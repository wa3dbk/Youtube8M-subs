00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.100
 good after the last game we've 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.200
 earned 10 points 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.920
 we go directly to training 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.410
 of the team 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:27.310
 let's go there and triple is not sad 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.310
 triple to start 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.400
 you have to remember that the last game 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:39.310
 with my smile because we have nothing 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:42.710
 but a pretty interesting nudge 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.210
 and when six kids 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.940
 'we are and your command 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.160
 minutes for the team quite enough 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.440
 points enough assists 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.239
 quite complete the matches and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.829
 after some good talks with the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.559
 work in arms we are getting 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.390
 is going to put us as holders though 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.000
 the increase minus I say we have not 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.100
 got to be headlines I do not know if this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 training will serve for it 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 the best is essential for 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.560
 get it I do not know 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.770
 but 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.189
 you know I had that is being very 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.409
 humble that is to say we were following 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.110
 out there who strive me the torch of 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.370
 owner and how I saw that that did not work for 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.680
 nothing 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.320
 logically I chose to threaten general 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.440
 way communicating that it's over 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.440
 soon because I lack enough with what 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.740
 that does not mean that I'm walking 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.750
 with the coach 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.060
 it seems that things start to move 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.549
 to move the subject 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.380
 already his own was done that I 've 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.049
 fact that things are going well 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.939
 precisely a titular man in 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.250
 a few games has not done me in 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.460
 how many 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.180
 in as much as you always like for now 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.760
 as is logical, so there is no 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.119
 other than continue working hard but already 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.860
 I say this better than before or less already 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.060
 saying and they go up for example 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.060
 michael williams 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.090
 He said he was noticing that soon 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.440
 they will be the owner I was going to remove 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.600
 posts so good is another one that 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.680
 expect to be patient 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.980
 I 'm trying to do it 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.420
 I hope you can be being 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.960
 because so in two games later 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.200
 bored out of the dock 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.560
 and it is illogical not because it is now 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.470
 as the number one rookie of the surf 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.470
 I'm even a candidate for my kid of the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.010
 league after almost half season 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.520
 we are already in January 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.470
 and good 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.550
 it is rare that the entrant does not want 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.170
 get me out that is totally illogical like that 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.050
 that I'm swelling here 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.620
 I ask 11 I've already do not know 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.490
 and you're otherwise not think 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.490
 serve the training 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.800
 there is michael cárter williams 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.820
 Michael 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.820
 turner 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:38.670
 let's vote well in 240 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:43.040
 miguelín como trapaso there is someone who 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.040
 I know, they were assisting 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.580
 michael crankcase williams my hand course 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:54.600
 he also liked the shot 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:58.630
 and so also as I have already seen 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.670
 in July the healing happened that michael 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.480
 karting or a selection or almost a month and 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.120
 half the ligament of the hand and that's not 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.900
 it served so that I want to be a starter 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.200
 They took to lorenzo obrado another rookie that 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.709
 this man is not of us and what 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.109
 get out of the holder as I get more abc 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.979
 I really then quite illogical 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.539
 alternate I do not know if an error or is that the 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.289
 try to make very difficult this year 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:32.970
 the issue of being a holder is in my mode 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:36.360
 career but 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.360
 very good 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.979
 there we are, come on, come, run, run, 

00:04:38.359 --> 00:04:45.400
 I've been fine there in the perfect show 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:50.190
 perfect anderson killed a hand 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.240
 and six up winning the holders 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.240
 of beating 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:03.210
 to valleys are richter sand that fails 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:06.240
 well you can also have seen 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.110
 my hazing flower to wear the nose 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.009
 of a clown but two games ago that 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.839
 I do not take it 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.520
 only jason richarson mean that already 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:18.009
 You do not need to joke joke and 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:23.020
 accelerate this pretty time the best 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:25.360
 it's not one reason or another I do not take it anymore 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.699
 and the match in the cement that we are 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.699
 we are finishing that at 55 seconds 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:37.340
 in the northeastern afternoon exhausted 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:39.800
 there solution that is the lonely the 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.840
 far too 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.230
 as a team that each side owner of 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.230
 beating 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.930
 little step back 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:55.169
 tri tri triple in front of brand letter 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.419
 williams 22 seconds left 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.099
 for session but by whether or not they 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.939
 it's worth this match to be starters 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.939
 they have me where to go 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:08.670
 michael michael michael michael crankcase 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:12.270
 william and those are 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.690
 santander cesar the shot we have 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.690
 sink them 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.710
 good 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.629
 I think what is 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.919
 little step back 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.610
 and kanata are the horn will end there 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:33.190
 we are 11 up we have finished some 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.460
 way to finish the training 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.440
 Well, see if this is any good 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.960
 if we are owners already in the next 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.170
 party there we are 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.170
 the training is over and we're going to 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.170
 sacrament 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:53.389
 I do not know if you would see my career up to 13 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:57.070
 points then my home the first year of the 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:59.320
 league for what they earned him 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.660
 and I have a good memory is element 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.590
 done with them getting the title of 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:10.689
 the nba then I sign for new york like this 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:13.089
 that nothing kids look at view my fans 

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:14.979
 we need how is it that cristian you take 

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:16.419
 he does not own sixers or be 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:20.529
 sooner than later evident that 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:23.769
 is ready is it clear everyone says so 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:25.719
 It is obvious that you touch the headline already 

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:27.489
 you imagine that I am a holder with quotas 

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:32.019
 sacraments so that it will be quite 

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:33.999
 funny and quite curious there we leave 

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:36.249
 the topic we are going to see if there is luck for 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:39.929
 the bag too, so the kids 

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:39.929
 then in the next one until next time
