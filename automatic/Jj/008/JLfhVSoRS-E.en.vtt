00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
I'm gonna show you how to make a basic

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.869 
I'm gonna show you how to make a basic
light<00:00:03.240> clip<00:00:03.540> call<00:00:04.080> brick<00:00:04.430> all<00:00:05.430> you<00:00:05.549> need<00:00:05.730> is

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
light clip call brick all you need is

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.169 
light clip call brick all you need is
Rick<00:00:06.060> Rubin<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.839> code<00:00:07.049> end<00:00:07.790> let<00:00:08.790> us<00:00:08.940> to

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
Rick Rubin and a code end let us to

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.970 
Rick Rubin and a code end let us to
basically<00:00:09.480> do<00:00:09.900> Fred<00:00:10.440> Euler<00:00:10.650> line<00:00:10.769> through

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
basically do Fred Euler line through

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:30.140 
basically do Fred Euler line through
direct<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.160> oven

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.690 

sometimes<00:00:31.020> after<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.410> code<00:00:31.590> end<00:00:31.800> off<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.490> gets

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
sometimes after the code end off it gets

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.030 
sometimes after the code end off it gets
jammed<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.150> it<00:00:33.270> sometimes<00:00:38.180> there<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.270> go

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
jammed on it sometimes there you go

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:48.260 
jammed on it sometimes there you go
then<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.130> Fred<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> cone<00:00:41.700> end<00:00:41.910> I'll<00:00:47.120> just<00:00:48.120> put

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
then you Fred the cone end I'll just put

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.750 
then you Fred the cone end I'll just put
the<00:00:48.360> Rick<00:00:48.510> Chu<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.870> back<00:00:49.110> inside<00:00:49.470> it<00:00:52.760> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the Rick Chu of in back inside it and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.750 
the Rick Chu of in back inside it and
you<00:00:54.000> get<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.150> live<00:00:54.420> clip<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.500> them<00:00:58.610> and<00:00:59.610> this

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you get a live clip one of them and this

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.719 
you get a live clip one of them and this
fridge<00:01:00.269> on<00:01:00.390> your<00:01:00.540> line

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.850 

mmm<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.570> before<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:08.960> put<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.259> Coenen<00:01:09.619> on<00:01:09.740> to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
mmm and before you put the Coenen on to

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.969 
mmm and before you put the Coenen on to
that<00:01:10.009> you<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:11.500> get<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.710> swivel<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:15.560> just

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
that you have to get the swivel and just

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:28.569 
that you have to get the swivel and just
clip<00:01:16.250> it<00:01:17.470> on<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.530> there<00:01:25.149> all<00:01:26.149> right<00:01:27.579> sometimes

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
clip it on to there all right sometimes

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.090 
clip it on to there all right sometimes
the<00:01:28.899> Conan<00:01:29.899> doesn't<00:01:30.229> go<00:01:30.320> into<00:01:30.500> it<00:01:30.710> something

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
the Conan doesn't go into it something

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:44.529 
the Conan doesn't go into it something
you<00:01:31.159> have<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.340> weigh<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.820> with<00:01:31.939> saliva<00:01:43.539> that's

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
you have to weigh it with saliva that's

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.279 
you have to weigh it with saliva that's
the<00:01:44.689> like<00:01:44.869> least<00:01:45.229> I'm<00:01:45.439> done<00:01:45.619> right<00:01:45.920> there<00:01:47.289> when

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
the like least I'm done right there when

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.240 
the like least I'm done right there when
you<00:01:48.319> take<00:01:48.590> your<00:01:48.709> hooklink

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
you take your hooklink

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.469 
you take your hooklink
with<00:01:49.670> your<00:01:49.819> swivel<00:01:50.149> on<00:01:50.709> and<00:01:52.000> just<00:01:53.000> simply<00:01:53.240> tie

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
with your swivel on and just simply tie

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:06.469 
with your swivel on and just simply tie
a<00:01:53.509> slipknot<00:01:54.020> in<00:01:54.229> it

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.469 

haffley<00:02:07.479> not<00:02:07.659> so<00:02:07.780> very<00:02:07.930> strong<00:02:08.319> not<00:02:09.479> very

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
haffley not so very strong not very

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.190 
haffley not so very strong not very
reliable

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
reliable

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.949 
reliable
so<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.560> recommend<00:02:11.980> not<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:15.750> turn<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.900> around

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
so I recommend not to you turn it around

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:26.640 
so I recommend not to you turn it around
about<00:02:17.290> five<00:02:17.830> or<00:02:18.069> six<00:02:18.190> times

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.510 

always<00:02:27.650> wet<00:02:27.860> your<00:02:28.010> nuts

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
always wet your nuts

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.370 
always wet your nuts
cuz<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.060> tends<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.450> burn<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.750> line<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.140> could

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
cuz it tends to burn the line it could

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.140 
cuz it tends to burn the line it could
cause<00:02:30.740> breakage<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:33.440> says<00:02:33.980> snips<00:02:34.820> are<00:02:35.000> good

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
cause breakage it says snips are good

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.670 
cause breakage it says snips are good
enough<00:02:37.960> Fred<00:02:38.960> you<00:02:39.430> let<00:02:40.430> system<00:02:40.820> back<00:02:40.970> down<00:02:41.680> and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
enough Fred you let system back down and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.330 
enough Fred you let system back down and
the<00:02:42.830> swivel<00:02:43.250> goes<00:02:43.550> into<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.180> light<00:02:44.360> system

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
the swivel goes into the light system

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.030 
the swivel goes into the light system
making<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.550> there<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.790> eat<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:49.040> that's<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:49.550> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
making it there and eat and that's it a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.150 
making it there and eat and that's it a
basic<00:02:52.040> light<00:02:52.220> system<00:02:52.610> for<00:02:52.760> carbon
