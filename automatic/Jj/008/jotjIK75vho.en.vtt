motorcycles are much shorter and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.969 
motorcycles are much shorter and
narrower<00:01:21.090> than<00:01:21.600> cars<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.470> they<00:01:22.619> present<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
narrower than cars so they present a

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.890 
narrower than cars so they present a
smaller<00:01:23.250> profile<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.479> driver<00:01:24.720> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
smaller profile if a driver is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
smaller profile if a driver is
subconsciously<00:01:25.560> expecting<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.159> motorcycle<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
be as long and as wide as a car you may

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.039 
be as long and as wide as a car you may
think<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.460> farther<00:01:29.880> away<00:01:29.970> or<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.780> more

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
think it's farther away or going more

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.179 
think it's farther away or going more
slowly<00:01:31.200> than<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.740> really<00:01:31.890> is

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
slowly than it really is

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.120 
slowly than it really is
the<00:01:32.880> solution<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> take<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.680> time

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the solution to this is to take the time

the solution to this is to take the time
and<00:01:35.159> effort<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.790> look<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.240> once<00:01:36.720> but

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
and effort to look not just once but

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.960 
and effort to look not just once but
twice<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.180> yes<00:01:39.840> three<00:01:40.500> times<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:41.460> make<00:01:41.640> sure

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
twice and yes three times to make sure

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.020 
twice and yes three times to make sure
just<00:01:42.540> how<00:01:42.750> far<00:01:43.079> away<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> rider<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.430> just

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
just how far away the rider is and just
