nothing<00:02:44.459> too<00:02:44.580> special<00:02:44.989> what<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.019> want<00:02:46.290> to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
nothing too special what I want to

compare<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.880> gauges<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.450> each<00:02:48.570> hose

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
compare the the gauges of each hose

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.360 
compare the the gauges of each hose
because<00:02:51.510> not<00:02:51.690> many<00:02:51.870> hoses<00:02:52.170> can<00:02:52.560> compare<00:02:52.950> to

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
because not many hoses can compare to

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.720 

so<00:03:01.840> here's<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.230> fancy<00:03:02.590> hose<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:03.370> about<00:03:03.490> a<00:03:03.520> half

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
so here's the fancy hose to about a half

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.620 
so here's the fancy hose to about a half
inch<00:03:03.880> gauge<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:06.760> green<00:03:07.180> one<00:03:07.330> here's<00:03:07.480> the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
inch gauge and this green one here's the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.290 
inch gauge and this green one here's the
dream<00:03:07.810> hose<00:03:07.990> has<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.070> thicker<00:03:09.430> outer<00:03:09.730> diameter

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
dream hose has a thicker outer diameter

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.080 
dream hose has a thicker outer diameter
like<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.050> hose<00:03:11.230> itself<00:03:11.410> is<00:03:11.740> thicker<00:03:11.950> but<00:03:12.820> it's

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
like the hose itself is thicker but it's

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.060 
like the hose itself is thicker but it's
about<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.600> same<00:03:13.750> size<00:03:13.810> which<00:03:14.560> is<00:03:14.590> very<00:03:14.890> nice

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
about the same size which is very nice

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.430 
about the same size which is very nice
which<00:03:15.970> would<00:03:16.180> um<00:03:16.330> give<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.960> you<00:03:17.170> know<00:03:17.230> much

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
which would um give it you know much

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.830 
which would um give it you know much
easier<00:03:17.830> drawl<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.370> get<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.030> lot<00:03:19.210> more<00:03:19.240> smokes<00:03:19.660> a

this<00:03:40.030> one<00:03:40.240> is<00:03:40.360> very<00:03:40.540> comparable<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.680> looks

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
this one is very comparable and it looks

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.850 
this one is very comparable and it looks
a<00:03:41.920> lot<00:03:42.010> nicer<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.750> it's<00:03:44.020> a<00:03:44.080> glass<00:03:44.290> tip<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.740> know

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
a lot nicer and it's a glass tip I know

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.100 
a lot nicer and it's a glass tip I know
that's<00:03:45.040> like<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.190> big<00:03:45.370> thing<00:03:45.580> out<00:03:45.670> there<00:03:45.850> now

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
that's like a big thing out there now

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.150

hose<00:03:53.920> itself<00:03:54.220> comes<00:03:54.640> with<00:03:54.850> it<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:55.210> I<00:03:55.270> think

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
hose itself comes with it so I think

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.690 
hose itself comes with it so I think
that's<00:03:55.480> pretty<00:03:55.660> neat<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:57.190> I'm<00:03:57.400> going<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:57.610> go

except it is 72 inches long so there's a
