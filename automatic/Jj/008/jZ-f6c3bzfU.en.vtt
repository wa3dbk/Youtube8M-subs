a<00:01:05.409> lot<00:01:05.710> of<00:01:05.770> work<00:01:06.310> outside<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:09.630> I've<00:01:10.630> noticed

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
a lot of work outside and I've noticed

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.230 
a lot of work outside and I've noticed
when<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.560> am<00:01:11.680> active<00:01:12.159> that<00:01:12.520> my<00:01:12.700> pulse<00:01:12.970> rate

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
when I am active that my pulse rate

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.980 
when I am active that my pulse rate
quickens<00:01:13.870> a<00:01:14.049> little<00:01:14.350> bit<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.830> a<00:01:15.430> little

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
quickens a little bit and a little

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.170 
quickens a little bit and a little
shortness<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.290> breath<00:01:17.560> so<00:01:18.400> it's<00:01:18.909> really

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
shortness of breath so it's really

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.850 
shortness of breath so it's really
important<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.630> try<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:19.930> take<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.229> easy<00:01:20.409> during

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
important to try to take it easy during

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.350 
important to try to take it easy during
fasting<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:23.590> warning<00:01:23.979> science<00:01:24.549> to<00:01:24.909> stop

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
fasting just warning science to stop

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.389 
fasting just warning science to stop

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
feels like all the time I would like

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.490 
feels like all the time I would like
been<00:01:44.619> trying<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.189> pull<00:01:45.609> it<00:01:45.759> off<00:01:45.909> but<00:01:46.210> it's<00:01:46.719> my

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
been trying to pull it off but it's my

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.130 
been trying to pull it off but it's my
taste<00:01:47.829> but<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.450> sounding<00:01:49.450> up<00:01:49.630> or<00:01:49.840> what<00:01:49.990> they're

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
taste but it sounding up or what they're

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.819 
taste but it sounding up or what they're
doing<00:01:50.350> in<00:01:50.469> there<00:01:50.649> but<00:01:51.399> it<00:01:51.460> feels<00:01:51.579> really<00:01:51.820> weird

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
doing in there but it feels really weird

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.590 
doing in there but it feels really weird
other<00:01:53.829> than<00:01:54.039> that<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.490> really<00:01:54.520> can't<00:01:55.299> think<00:01:55.450> of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
other than that I really can't think of

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.749 
other than that I really can't think of
much<00:01:56.320> else<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.740> has<00:01:56.829> changed<00:01:57.130> everything's

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
much else that has changed everything's

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.919 
much else that has changed everything's
pretty<00:01:58.000> much<00:01:58.090> staying<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.630> same<00:01:58.659> right<00:01:59.109> now

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
pretty much staying the same right now

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.080 
pretty much staying the same right now
so<00:02:01.929> I<00:02:02.530> probably<00:02:02.920> won't<00:02:03.219> be<00:02:03.579> back<00:02:03.729> tomorrow

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
so I probably won't be back tomorrow

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.649 
so I probably won't be back tomorrow
