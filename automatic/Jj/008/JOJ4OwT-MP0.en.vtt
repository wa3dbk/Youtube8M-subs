world today a little finishing school

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.839 
world today a little finishing school
there<00:00:09.840> are<00:00:09.960> basically<00:00:10.349> two<00:00:10.500> parts<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
there are basically two parts to the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.730 
there are basically two parts to the
finish<00:00:12.179> there's<00:00:12.660> what<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:12.990> call<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.349> stain

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
finish there's what we call the stain

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.580 
finish there's what we call the stain
which<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.610> really<00:00:15.089> just<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.540> pigment<00:00:16.170> that

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
which is really just a pigment that

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.460 
which is really just a pigment that
changes<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> color<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.420> wood<00:00:18.600> itself<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
changes the color of the wood itself and

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.099 
changes the color of the wood itself and
what<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.130> call<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.490> clear<00:00:20.820> buy<00:00:21.480> clear<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:22.020> I'm

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
what we call a clear buy clear what I'm

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.960 
what we call a clear buy clear what I'm
talking<00:00:22.500> about<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> protective<00:00:23.699> coating

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
talking about is a protective coating

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.120 
talking about is a protective coating
that's<00:00:24.449> clear<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:24.990> color<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.500> water<00:00:25.769> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
that's clear in color like water and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.580 
that's clear in color like water and
usually<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.060> either<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.720> urethane<00:00:28.260> or<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
usually it's either like a urethane or a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.490 
usually it's either like a urethane or a
lacquer<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.460> goes<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.630> wood<00:00:30.779> once<00:00:31.289> it's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
lacquer that goes on the wood once it's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.590 
lacquer that goes on the wood once it's
been<00:00:31.679> stained<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.820> best<00:00:33.030> way<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.180> tell<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
been stained the best way to tell if the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.450 
been stained the best way to tell if the
stain<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.110> good<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.440> by<00:00:34.559> looking<00:00:34.800> at<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.340> an

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
stain is good is by looking at it at an

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.280 
stain is good is by looking at it at an
angle<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.000> look<00:00:36.210> at<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.540> straight<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.960> you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
angle if you look at it straight on you

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.540 
angle if you look at it straight on you
might<00:00:37.469> not<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.739> able<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.399> much

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
might not be able to get as much

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.670 
might not be able to get as much
information<00:00:38.760> from<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.899> way<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> wood<00:00:40.440> looks

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
information from the way the wood looks

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.950 
information from the way the wood looks
and<00:00:40.980> by<00:00:41.489> looking<00:00:41.879> at<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.210> an<00:00:42.300> angle<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.809> can

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and by looking at it at an angle you can

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.810 
and by looking at it at an angle you can
see<00:00:42.989> if<00:00:43.379> there's<00:00:43.680> any<00:00:43.890> cracking<00:00:44.879> or<00:00:45.420> any

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
see if there's any cracking or any

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.130 
see if there's any cracking or any
inconsistencies<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> finish<00:00:48.899> which

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
inconsistencies with the finish which

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.810 
inconsistencies with the finish which
obviously<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.770> want<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> stay<00:00:50.280> away<00:00:50.460> from<00:00:50.520> if

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
obviously you want to stay away from if

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.450 
obviously you want to stay away from if
you<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.149> here's<00:00:51.480> another<00:00:51.750> example<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.460> cherry

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
you can here's another example of cherry

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.119 
you can here's another example of cherry
with<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.539> number<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.199> different<00:00:55.559> finishes<00:00:55.860> on

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
with a number of different finishes on

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.950 
with a number of different finishes on
it<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.789> from<00:00:57.300> variation<00:00:57.840> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it and you can see from variation to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.250 
it and you can see from variation to
variation<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.070> way<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.760> color<00:00:59.969> changes<00:01:00.629> we

can actually take a piece of cherry wood
whether<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.780> veneer<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.350> solid<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:04.979> really

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
alter the color pretty dramatically if

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.520 
alter the color pretty dramatically if

the urethane depending on the specific
application<00:01:25.439> when<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.890> put<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> clear<00:01:26.490> coat

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
application when we put the clear coat

application when we put the clear coat
on<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:27.210> usually<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> few<00:01:28.140> coats<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> sand<00:01:29.040> it

on it usually is a few coats and sand it

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.130 
on it usually is a few coats and sand it
in<00:01:29.310> between<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.600> sure<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.990> the

in between just to make sure that the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.899 
in between just to make sure that the
final<00:01:31.500> product<00:01:31.740> comes<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:32.250> nice<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.490> smooth

final product comes out nice and smooth

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.520 
final product comes out nice and smooth
the<00:01:33.509> last<00:01:33.720> thing<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> need<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.290> know<00:01:34.409> about

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the last thing you need to know about

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.620 
the last thing you need to know about
finish<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.400> glossy<00:01:35.670> er<00:01:35.909> finishes<00:01:36.479> are

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
finish is that glossy er finishes are

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.499 
finish is that glossy er finishes are
much<00:01:36.930> more<00:01:37.140> sensitive<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.829> scratches<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.090> if

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
much more sensitive to scratches so if
