00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
is very very new about what's at the wii

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.000 
is very very new about what's at the wii
u<00:00:21.449> version<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:21.990> game<00:00:22.080> well<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.920> know

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
u version of this game well you know

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.410 
u version of this game well you know
obviously<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.609> goes<00:00:23.730> without<00:00:23.880> saying<00:00:24.090> that

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
obviously it goes without saying that

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.390 
obviously it goes without saying that
the<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.320> most<00:00:25.470> newest<00:00:25.800> thing<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the the most newest thing of this is

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.460 
the the most newest thing of this is
probably<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> hardware<00:00:27.210> itself<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:28.109> wii<00:00:28.260> u

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
probably the hardware itself the wii u

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.620 
probably the hardware itself the wii u
as<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.519> see<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> controller<00:00:30.060> also<00:00:30.390> is

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
as you can see the controller also is

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.959 
as you can see the controller also is
quite<00:00:30.869> unique<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.520> we've<00:00:32.520> done<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.759> lot<00:00:32.940> of

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
quite unique and we've done a lot of

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.549 
quite unique and we've done a lot of
cool<00:00:33.180> things<00:00:33.210> with<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.719> such<00:00:33.930> as<00:00:34.140> using<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
cool things with this such as using the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.740 
cool things with this such as using the
touchscreen<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.640> selected<00:00:36.120> techniques

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
touchscreen to have selected techniques

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.110 
touchscreen to have selected techniques
on<00:00:36.930> screen<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.100> tap<00:00:38.730> them<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
on screen and you just tap them to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.690 
on screen and you just tap them to
perform<00:00:39.420> them<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> game<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.399> that's<00:00:41.640> just

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
perform them in the game so that's just

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.280 
perform them in the game so that's just
one<00:00:41.910> example<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> ways<00:00:42.750> we're<00:00:42.960> using<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
one example of the ways we're using the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.709 
one example of the ways we're using the
controller<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.640> also<00:00:44.850> because<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.329> way<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
controller and also because the way the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.060 
controller and also because the way the
hardware<00:00:46.020> works<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.440> you're<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.860> you're<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
hardware works if you're if you're a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.740 
hardware works if you're if you're a
young<00:00:47.190> kid<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.180> want<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> hide<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.719> your

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
young kid and you want to hide in your

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.180 
young kid and you want to hide in your
bed<00:00:48.960> from<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.289> parents<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.129> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
bed from your parents you can kind of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.069 
bed from your parents you can kind of
still<00:00:50.520> play<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.910> game<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> controller

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
still play the game on the controller

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.680 
still play the game on the controller
itself<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.180> those<00:00:54.329> are<00:00:54.449> some<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
itself so you know those are some of the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
itself so you know those are some of the
things<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> hardware<00:00:55.289> allows<00:00:55.440> us<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.860> but

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
things the hardware allows us to do but

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.119 
things the hardware allows us to do but
another<00:00:56.760> cool<00:00:57.030> neat<00:00:57.480> feature<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.129> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
another cool neat feature is the the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
another cool neat feature is the the
mushroom<00:00:59.460> battle<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.539> mode<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.809> something

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
mushroom battle this mode is something

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.200 
mushroom battle this mode is something
that<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.829> made<00:01:02.100> possible<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.000> we're

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that is made possible just because we're

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.119 
that is made possible just because we're
collaborating<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.229> Nintendo<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.920> it's

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
collaborating with Nintendo so it's

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.930 
collaborating with Nintendo so it's
quite<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> okay

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.630 

you

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.280 

what<00:01:20.640> made<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.850> want<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> add<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.660> mushroom<00:01:22.140> or

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
what made you want to add in mushroom or

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.290 
what made you want to add in mushroom or
in<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> first<00:01:22.800> place<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:23.370> just<00:01:23.610> an

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
in the first place was it just an

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.500 
in the first place was it just an
inspiration<00:01:25.050> from<00:01:25.260> Mario's<00:01:26.330> adventures<00:01:27.330> more

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
inspiration from Mario's adventures more

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.720 
inspiration from Mario's adventures more
or<00:01:27.600> less<00:01:27.750> well<00:01:28.650> before<00:01:28.830> we<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.250> started

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
or less well before we actually started

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.300 
or less well before we actually started
work<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.300> wii<00:01:30.630> u<00:01:30.750> version<00:01:30.990> ah<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
work on the wii u version ah the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.070 
work on the wii u version ah the
development<00:01:32.880> environment<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.510> had<00:01:33.690> this<00:01:33.810> new

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
development environment we had this new

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.140 
development environment we had this new
feature<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.680> could<00:01:34.890> make<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.460> models

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
feature that you could make the models

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.260 
feature that you could make the models
scale<00:01:36.660> bigger<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.200> smaller<00:01:37.830> and<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.120> was

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
scale bigger or smaller and so this was

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.500 
scale bigger or smaller and so this was
in<00:01:39.900> place<00:01:40.230> earlier<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:41.340> saw<00:01:41.550> some<00:01:41.850> limited

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
in place earlier we saw some limited

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.380 
in place earlier we saw some limited
examples<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.520> other<00:01:44.550> platforms

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
examples of this and the other platforms

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.510 
examples of this and the other platforms
with<00:01:45.600> for<00:01:45.870> example<00:01:45.960> fight<00:01:46.860> lab<00:01:47.070> does<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> little

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
with for example fight lab does a little

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.050 
with for example fight lab does a little
bit<00:01:47.760> for<00:01:48.030> some<00:01:48.270> comedic<00:01:49.110> effects<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.800> such<00:01:50.060> so

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
bit for some comedic effects and such so

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.130 
bit for some comedic effects and such so
we<00:01:51.180> were<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.360> playing<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.900> in<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
we were all playing with it in the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.870 
we were all playing with it in the
development<00:01:52.860> environment<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.729> thought

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
development environment and we thought

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.430 
development environment and we thought
it<00:01:53.940> was<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.300> cool<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:55.260> were<00:01:55.380> still

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
it was kind of cool but we were still

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.620 
it was kind of cool but we were still
trying<00:01:56.370> to<00:01:56.520> come<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.790> ideas<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.360> flush<00:01:57.600> it

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
trying to come up with ideas to flush it

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.750 
trying to come up with ideas to flush it
out<00:01:57.840> into<00:01:58.080> something<00:01:58.500> larger<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> full

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
out into something larger like a full

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.390 
out into something larger like a full
mode<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.300> that<00:02:00.840> really<00:02:00.990> didn't<00:02:01.350> come<00:02:02.130> along

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
mode and that really didn't come along

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.070 
mode and that really didn't come along
until<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:02.880> started<00:02:03.180> working<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.570> Wii<00:02:03.750> U<00:02:03.900> with

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
until we started working on a Wii U with

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.380 
until we started working on a Wii U with
Nintendo<00:02:04.620> and<00:02:04.830> we<00:02:04.890> thought<00:02:05.390> gameplay-wise

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
Nintendo and we thought gameplay-wise

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.300 
Nintendo and we thought gameplay-wise
you<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.900> what<00:02:07.350> what<00:02:07.650> is<00:02:07.860> something<00:02:08.100> that

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you know what what is something that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.980 
you know what what is something that
would<00:02:08.460> make<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:08.850> want<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.750> make<00:02:09.929> a

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
would make you want to to make a

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.350 
would make you want to to make a
character<00:02:10.619> grow<00:02:10.830> larger<00:02:11.220> or<00:02:11.340> smaller<00:02:11.370> how<00:02:12.300> to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
character grow larger or smaller how to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.480 
character grow larger or smaller how to
affect<00:02:12.630> gameplay<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.350> then<00:02:13.890> when<00:02:14.070> we<00:02:14.190> started

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
affect gameplay and then when we started

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.430 
affect gameplay and then when we started
working<00:02:14.730> with<00:02:14.820> Nintendo<00:02:15.330> we<00:02:15.540> thought<00:02:15.750> well

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
working with Nintendo we thought well

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.810 
working with Nintendo we thought well
hey<00:02:16.650> that's<00:02:16.890> perfect<00:02:17.070> for<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> mushroom

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
hey that's perfect for the mushroom

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.030 
hey that's perfect for the mushroom
because<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:19.290> would<00:02:19.440> kind<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.709> make<00:02:19.980> sense

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
because that would kind of make sense

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.310 
because that would kind of make sense
with<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.550> gameplay<00:02:20.850> mechanic<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:22.200> then

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
with that gameplay mechanic and then

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.290 
with that gameplay mechanic and then
that<00:02:22.500> kind<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.770> just<00:02:22.950> linked<00:02:23.580> pretty<00:02:23.820> well<00:02:24.000> we

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
that kind of just linked pretty well we

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.360 
that kind of just linked pretty well we
started<00:02:24.570> work<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:24.989> version<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:26.040> when

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.920 
work kind of tailoring the game to each
individual<00:03:16.140> platform<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:17.580> know<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.850> the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
individual platform you know the the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.900 
individual platform you know the the
generation<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.020> ps3<00:03:19.290> 360<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.160> then<00:03:20.520> something

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
generation of ps3 360 and then something

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.350 
generation of ps3 360 and then something
that<00:03:21.030> suits<00:03:21.330> this<00:03:21.960> hardware<00:03:22.320> as<00:03:22.440> well<00:03:22.940> so<00:03:23.940> we

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
that suits this hardware as well so we

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.700 
that suits this hardware as well so we
just<00:03:24.540> want<00:03:24.720> people<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:25.080> keep<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.560> mind

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710

particular fighting game it's an

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.470 
particular fighting game it's an
interesting<00:03:47.040> question<00:03:47.340> i<00:03:47.700> really<00:03:48.330> thought

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
interesting question i really thought

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.360 
interesting question i really thought
about<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.870> since<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.320> was<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.890> focused<00:03:50.070> on

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
about that since I was so focused on

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.920 
about that since I was so focused on
trying<00:03:50.610> to<00:03:50.730> get<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:51.060> game<00:03:51.270> polished<00:03:51.780> before

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
trying to get this game polished before

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.580 
trying to get this game polished before
release<00:03:53.030> but<00:03:54.030> now<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.450> ask<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.200> I

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
release but now that you ask that and I

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.190 
release but now that you ask that and I
think<00:03:55.620> about<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.280> on<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.550> spot<00:03:56.790> if<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:58.050> were<00:03:58.110> to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
think about it on the spot if I were to

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.630 
think about it on the spot if I were to
make<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.350> new<00:03:58.500> tech<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.860> perhaps<00:03:59.010> one<00:03:59.340> idea

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
make a new tech and perhaps one idea

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.910 
make a new tech and perhaps one idea
that<00:03:59.820> would<00:03:59.910> be<00:04:00.060> interesting<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:00.920> you

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
that would be interesting is that you

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.620 
that would be interesting is that you
know<00:04:02.040> with<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:02.280> hardware<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:03.360> have<00:04:03.510> this

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
know with this hardware you have this

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.930 
know with this hardware you have this
one<00:04:03.810> control<00:04:04.200> at<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.380> moment<00:04:04.410> but<00:04:04.940> eventually

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
one control at the moment but eventually

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.310 
one control at the moment but eventually
you're<00:04:06.150> gonna<00:04:06.270> be<00:04:06.420> able<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.630> play<00:04:06.720> with<00:04:06.990> two<00:04:07.170> of

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
you're gonna be able to play with two of

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.850 
you're gonna be able to play with two of
these<00:04:07.440> connected<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.670> clean<00:04:09.180> machine<00:04:09.860> so

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
these connected to the clean machine so

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.250 
these connected to the clean machine so
what<00:04:11.070> this<00:04:11.190> would<00:04:11.430> maybe<00:04:11.640> allow<00:04:11.970> for<00:04:12.300> is<00:04:12.510> you

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
what this would maybe allow for is you

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.660 
what this would maybe allow for is you
know<00:04:13.350> up<00:04:13.560> until<00:04:13.650> now<00:04:13.860> you're<00:04:14.190> you're<00:04:14.430> both

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
know up until now you're you're both

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.190 
know up until now you're you're both
looking<00:04:14.880> when<00:04:15.240> you're<00:04:15.360> fighting<00:04:15.750> against

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
looking when you're fighting against

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.199 
looking when you're fighting against
another<00:04:16.350> human<00:04:16.980> opponent<00:04:17.370> you're<00:04:17.880> looking<00:04:18.120> at

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
another human opponent you're looking at

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.330 
another human opponent you're looking at
the<00:04:18.299> same<00:04:18.480> screen<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.350> you're<00:04:19.980> saying<00:04:20.280> the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
the same screen so you're saying the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.580 
the same screen so you're saying the
same<00:04:20.520> thing<00:04:20.760> right<00:04:20.970> but<00:04:21.930> with<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.230> you<00:04:22.290> have

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
same thing right but with this you have

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.110 
same thing right but with this you have
your<00:04:22.740> own<00:04:22.770> personal<00:04:23.070> screen<00:04:23.640> so<00:04:23.880> perhaps

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
your own personal screen so perhaps

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.330 
your own personal screen so perhaps
doing<00:04:24.570> something<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.110> before<00:04:25.860> match<00:04:26.100> you

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
doing something like before match you

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.010 
doing something like before match you
have<00:04:26.520> some<00:04:26.760> kind<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:27.030> options<00:04:27.510> like<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:27.870> can

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
have some kind of options like you can

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.570 
have some kind of options like you can
set<00:04:28.230> a<00:04:28.260> trap<00:04:28.530> somewhere<00:04:28.980> in<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.130> stage<00:04:29.370> or

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
set a trap somewhere in the stage or

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.460 
set a trap somewhere in the stage or
something<00:04:29.880> like<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.060> your<00:04:30.930> opponent<00:04:31.290> can't

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
something like that your opponent can't

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.310 
something like that your opponent can't
see<00:04:31.760> would<00:04:32.760> be<00:04:32.970> something<00:04:33.570> would<00:04:33.840> add<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.050> the

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
see would be something would add to the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.320 
see would be something would add to the
game<00:04:34.500> plan<00:04:34.530> would<00:04:34.950> be<00:04:35.070> interesting<00:04:35.550> kind<00:04:36.300> of

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
game plan would be interesting kind of

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.240 
game plan would be interesting kind of
like<00:04:36.510> you<00:04:36.630> know<00:04:36.690> how<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:36.930> game<00:04:37.440> of<00:04:37.590> Mahjong<00:04:38.010> it

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
like you know how a game of Mahjong it

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.620 
like you know how a game of Mahjong it
you<00:04:38.400> don't<00:04:38.580> know<00:04:38.669> what<00:04:38.790> your<00:04:38.940> ponies<00:04:39.240> hand<00:04:39.450> is

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
you don't know what your ponies hand is

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.080 
you don't know what your ponies hand is
inside<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.550> something<00:04:41.550> like<00:04:41.580> that<00:04:41.880> would<00:04:41.970> be

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
inside so something like that would be

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.360 
inside so something like that would be
quite<00:04:42.210> interesting<00:04:42.990> try<00:04:43.320> although<00:04:43.950> if<00:04:44.250> I

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
quite interesting try although if I

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.159 
quite interesting try although if I
actually<00:04:44.640> did<00:04:44.970> make<00:04:45.150> an<00:04:45.390> all<00:04:45.630> new<00:04:45.780> tech<00:04:45.990> and

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
actually did make an all new tech and

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.530 
actually did make an all new tech and
for<00:04:46.320> Wii<00:04:46.440> U<00:04:46.910> it<00:04:47.910> might<00:04:48.090> go<00:04:48.270> in<00:04:48.330> a<00:04:48.390> different

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
for Wii U it might go in a different

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
for Wii U it might go in a different
direction<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:49.080> don't<00:04:49.230> know<00:04:49.290> that's<00:04:49.500> just

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
direction I don't know that's just

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.140 
direction I don't know that's just
something<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.130> I<00:04:50.280> thought<00:04:50.730> on<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:50.910> spot

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
something that I thought on the spot

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.970 
something that I thought on the spot
right<00:04:51.360> now<00:04:51.540> that<00:04:51.780> might<00:04:51.900> be<00:04:52.020> interesting<00:04:52.440> but

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
right now that might be interesting but

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.620 
right now that might be interesting but
uh<00:04:53.040> you<00:04:53.550> know<00:04:53.580> now<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:54.030> think<00:04:54.060> about<00:04:54.450> it

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
uh you know now that I think about it

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.690 
uh you know now that I think about it
I'm<00:04:55.320> not<00:04:55.500> even<00:04:55.710> sure<00:04:55.770> if<00:04:56.070> you<00:04:56.250> know<00:04:56.340> hardware

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
I'm not even sure if you know hardware

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.120 
I'm not even sure if you know hardware
spec<00:04:57.030> wise<00:04:57.210> you<00:04:57.419> can<00:04:57.450> have<00:04:57.750> a<00:04:57.780> separate<00:04:58.620> screen

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
spec wise you can have a separate screen

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.390 
spec wise you can have a separate screen
for<00:04:59.520> each<00:04:59.640> of<00:04:59.790> these<00:04:59.880> displays<00:05:00.390> so<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:01.410> don't

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
for each of these displays so I don't

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.900 
for each of these displays so I don't
know<00:05:02.460> maybe<00:05:02.610> i'll<00:05:02.760> have<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:03.000> ask<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.330> Nintendo

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
know maybe i'll have to ask a Nintendo

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.360 
know maybe i'll have to ask a Nintendo
that<00:05:04.200> all<00:05:05.200> right<00:05:05.290> that<00:05:05.470> sounds<00:05:05.500> cool<00:05:05.920> thanks<00:05:06.310> a

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
that all right that sounds cool thanks a

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.400
