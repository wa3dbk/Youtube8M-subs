00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.080
 the collective state police 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.370
 understanding what is the challenge of the 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.720
 security 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.520

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.520
 proper tools and training 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.590
 to use them is that we will succeed 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.240
 if the dogs have shown that it is a 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.250
 of the most effective tools in 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.530
 all fronts both on the fronts 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.780
 preventive educating children to not

 have to punish men like in 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.740
 all reactive fronts and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.260
 research the dogs have shown 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.040
 which are a very effective tool 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.530
 we appreciate the presence of all

 bases of protocols and procedures in 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 the use of dogs and being able to have lives 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.420
 so that not only the police 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.210
 certify but also the dog is 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.490
 can certify and you have a commitment 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.630
 with quality we can meet and what more 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.090
 california sets the example at the level 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.040
 national with this commitment counting 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.790
 with the headquarters of this national conference 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.250
 of the police dog 2012 aims at the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.410
 strengthen the work carried out by 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.810
 canine units of each of the 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.640
 states that visit us as well as the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.020
 representations of each municipality of 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.789
 baja california 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.250
 of course the state police 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.710
 preventive 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.110
 the training and the knowledge that 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.720
 is achieved with the binomials it becomes 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.780
 extraordinary and truly something that 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.420
 distinguish them is the value of these 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.780
 dogs along with their trainers are 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.209
 examples of constancy discipline we 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.120
 provides the certainty that they will give the maximum 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.820
 in each operation they become a 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.090
 only actor when making a 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.220
 homework 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.010
 for whom we observe the way in which 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.470
 k9 unit works is the truth 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.989
 admirable not only the way in which 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.599
 they do their daily work but also 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.239
 it shows that there is dedication and appreciation 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.010
 towards these dogs are willing to 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.650
 all to defend them at the moment of 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.720
 arise from a contingency 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.000
 the behavior of the police dog is 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.000
 something that as human beings we should 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.769
 appreciate and take as an example says the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.739
 said that man's best friend is 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.380
 the dog and in this case that phrase has 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.650
 much desert as they become 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.360
 true colleagues by profession 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.730
 have certified binomials and 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.069
 highly prepared will serve us for 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.769
 face more efficiently our 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.829
 fight against crime in case of 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.079
 detection of explosives and drugs even 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.760
 to civil protection tasks in 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.730
 our region is a subject always 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.610
 in force the dogs despite the fact that 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.760
 the technology is very advanced that no 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.340
 there is some machine 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.739
 a robot or something that may suffer from 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.470
 Fact of the body is fed 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.209
 machines but they are not compared with the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.750
 help that really help from a 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.150
 great help 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.560
 we can not have sight or smell or 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.360
 their hearing and for us is 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.709
 fundamental and in the state of Yucatan degrade 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.010
 we are concerned about safety and 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.299
 we want this to continue training your 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.069
 catalog for the first place in 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.510
 security this is the safest state 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.069
 of the country and a fundamental part of us 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.900
 to maintain that security is the 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.770
 training in which I am a trainer 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.050
 independent and I do not come from any 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.030
 from no academy what happens is 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.920
 also because here you can see the 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.560
 professionalism behind all the 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.900
 police buts and also for 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.240
 search and detection of narcotics that 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.390
 part even though she is an expert who does not 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.060
 normal size this has ease and 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.810
 can learn a lot Mayan detection is 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.700
 a rescued expert I already knew her 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.030
 big was three years old now but the 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.950
 I met for a year and a half and she's in 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.350
 different disciplines are not on duty 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:37.220
 and protection is in what is frisbee 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.020
 ready that's called this agility tricks and 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.740
 obedience is also beginning to 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.759
 work as a dog therapy 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.759
 but therapy
