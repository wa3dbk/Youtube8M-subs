00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.690
 increase is a little bit and it's basically 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.790

 very cool do not tell me uncle either 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.550
 throw yourself doing parkour of one of a bar 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.590
 that does not have a fever enough 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.810
 jones and ideas for video you can do 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.880
 and well I will leave gm for the description and 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.260
 by screen itself because if he wanted me 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.510
 send anything they do not see me and 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.769
 neither nonsense and said tubes start 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.540
 well I will leave the game of the 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.949
 truth is very cool is very frantic and 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.710
 well you'll see that it's pretty cool 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.600
 and said all we go to the video we have a 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.780
 white two call of duty video 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.309
 we are on record a 2025 team tour 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.839
 my mother leaving pretty fast and 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.400
 can you do can you do something 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.420
 pretty epic to wash with AFA 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.010
 madrid or with the value and said 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.510
 impressive and good that I had enough 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.890
 I want to take out a little leg with the fal 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.440
 that is a weapon that the truth that I'm cool 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.690
 quite and careful is said to have the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.960
 party I'm going to fine everyone so I 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.960
 die 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.790
 This is typical of nuclear and 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.560
 the rest 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.430
 I think that paisa came pretty cool 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.430
 so 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.530
 so let's be careful 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.899
 we killed that intense Jew who 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.049
 intense the game not as you have thought 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.020
 that 's how it all started so I 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.490
 I do not know what's happening in that game 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.490
 but like I do not know what's going on 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.899

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.630

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.760

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.960
 that game but I better keep killing 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.960
 I'm still playing like I was playing 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.400

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.220
 second squared 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.069
 double that I do not know what's going on here is 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.909
 I really do not know what's happening 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.909

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.140

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.959

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.860

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.860
