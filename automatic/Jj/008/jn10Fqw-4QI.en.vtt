 reviews have been preparing a lot of any omelet 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.269

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.619
 hello everyone my name is Julia and for 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.110
 test drive in our review, I grabbed 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.150
 new multi cooker pressure cooker from the company 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.190
 dinaton sometime with the help of another 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.859
 multipovar and can cook bread and 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.539
 today using this device we 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.539
 make a three-course dinner 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.129
 dishes for cooking which 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.109
 need a huge amount 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.359
 time that is more take part for 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.909
 i'm inedible that's better hold it 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.920
 time with great benefits but good 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.350
 sometimes you want to pamper your lover 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.780
 delicacy so came to the rescue 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.149
 pressure cooker in it any dish is cooked in 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.100
 times faster and even if the device 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.670
 wish to cook pilaf 50 minutes then 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.859
 vampire what's up some ordinary pap 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.139
 type of buckwheat means will be prepared in 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.769
 her a little longer due to dialing and resetting 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:04.650
 pressure 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.509
 but as for me it is a little trouble but 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.969
 dishes that you have to cook 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.000
 four hours out as loved ones 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.640
 Feast jelly tongue you cook for 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.890
 two hours or even fantastic 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.320
 will not burn anything and will not run away 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.670
 because besides it's too old she 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.640
 also a slow cooker 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.009
 in it you can cook everything and this 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.899
 everything in the world will not burn but for 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.789
 account that under one cover 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.700
 fits several very different 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.700
 pots devices you cool save 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.289
 and a place in the kitchen when there is always not enough 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.689
 need to say that the company is dinaton 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.469
 conquers the world with multi chefs 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.609

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.679

 about the slow cooker so many programs and 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.520
 functions that straight head can 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.090
 spin from such a diversity 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.909
 but about everything from 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.130

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.549
 carry the device across the kitchen tract and 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.670
 during the work do not need to 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.920
 otherwise spoil all the dishes and make it easier and 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.269
 it was faster to kill us here 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.450
 there is a measuring cup 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.230

 pressure cooking principle the higher 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.430
 the pressure the faster the water boils and 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.530
 getting ready 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.829

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.400
 pressure at the same five-level we do not 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.470
 Once the pressure continued safety system 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.079
 so until the pressure is completely 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.990
 dropped the lid will not open in 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.610

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.770
 there are perishable meat type foods 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.169
