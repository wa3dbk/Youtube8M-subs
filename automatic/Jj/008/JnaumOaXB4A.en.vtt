00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.899 
listening why I believe that as we can
be<00:01:16.259> we've<00:01:16.859> lived<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.280> towns<00:01:17.490> where<00:01:17.609> there's

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
be we've lived in towns where there's

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.029 
be we've lived in towns where there's
noise<00:01:18.149> and<00:01:18.509> cars<00:01:18.719> going<00:01:18.899> by<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.799> hear

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
noise and cars going by but just hear

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.399 
noise and cars going by but just hear
our<00:01:20.340> child<00:01:20.969> say<00:01:21.390> something<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.020> were

immediately awake
I<00:01:23.479> believe<00:01:24.479> our<00:01:24.570> subconscious<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.350> always

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
I believe our subconscious is always

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.980 
I believe our subconscious is always
listening<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:26.969> he<00:01:27.149> would<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.420> sleep<00:01:27.689> of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
listening and so he would go to sleep of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.080 
listening and so he would go to sleep of
course<00:01:28.140> hearing<00:01:28.799> these<00:01:28.920> scriptures<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:29.880> then

course hearing these scriptures but then

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.499 
course hearing these scriptures but then
listening<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.719> the<00:01:30.840> scriptures<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.439> his<00:01:31.649> sleep

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
listening to the scriptures in his sleep

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.389 
listening to the scriptures in his sleep
we<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:34.049> believe<00:01:34.320> we've<00:01:34.499> seen<00:01:34.710> results<00:01:35.219> in
