00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.540
 fbi will have to answer numerous 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.189
 questions about the terrorist attack in boston 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.870
 why US intelligence agencies do not 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.480
 are interested in suspects 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.129
 organization of explosions tamerlanom tsarinaev 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.800
 although the signals came repeatedly on 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.260
 For two years, Russia has warned 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.870
 Not only FBI and Tzar in Java was 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.000
 a gross mistake 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.070
 fbi made a serious mistake about it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.200
 no doubt if regarding 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.300
 Tsarnaevy were any suspicions if 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.449
 Russia warned about this and why him 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.670
 not controlled it turns out that Russia 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.640
 It was right and the United States just ignored 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.050
 her messages 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.910
 numerous disturbing facts on 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.649
 Tamerlane Tsarnaev page on youtube 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.140
 a huge number of commercials where 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.850
 preaching radical views friends 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.620
 drives a car with a terrorist number 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 number one and special services nothing 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.629
 noticed can fbi formed a certain 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 image of Islamist terrorists and this 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.249
 the stereotype prevented the agent from seeing something 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.050
 what was right in front of them maybe they 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.390
 argued as follows Chechens 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.070
 hate russians they us or their 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.720
 the role was played by the political situation and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.360
 so the american special services are not 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.470
 able to calculate tamerlane tsarnaev 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.210
 it is also likely that Americans do not 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.160
 taken seriously by the Russian message 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.930
 special services because of the general unfavorable 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.600
 situation in relations between Moscow and 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.310
 Washington according to the President of Russia 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.170
 we just need to work on it if we 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.120
 here we will really combine 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.240
 efforts we will not miss these blows 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.920
 and bear such a loss is very likely that 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.540
 the American authorities betrayed the political 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.310
 the color of the information received as 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.890
 Russiaâ€™s concerns have never been taken before 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.360
 in attention ilyasa ahmadova right hand 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.430
 internationally recognized Chechen 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.410
 terrorist Shamil Basayev provided 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.080
 political asylum and now he lives in 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.640
 boston ahmed zakayev whose in russia 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.040
 accused of horrific crimes against 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.730
 innocent people in the us still consider 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.740
 Chechen freedom fighter 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.600
 strange that in any case I will not say 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.940
 that we sympathized with them but of course we 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.670
 criticized Putin and how far he is 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.800
 entered into a relationship with Chechnya and the Chechens 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.440
 there was no reason to hate the United 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.120
 states many wonder if 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.620
 Tamerlane learn about how to make a bomb 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.869
 during his trip to Russia 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.710
 however, the answer rather indicates another 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.200
 a place 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.510
 according to a high ranking official 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.250
 from the government I quote they found 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.000
 instructions on how to make a bomb 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.220
 the internet 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.810
 This information is worth keeping in mind to 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.400
 learn how to make explosives no one 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.080
 need to go anywhere or get 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.080
 instructions personally from experts 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.430
 when Johar Tsarina came to his senses he 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.260
 stated according to the authorities that their with 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.910
 brother motive was the desire to protect 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.910
 Islam because of the wars in iraq and afghanistan 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.780
 many terrorists try to justify 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.980
 their monstrous crimes 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.660
 politically motivated but it is not 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.970
 cancels the fact that they just 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.410
 heartless killers when power 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.730
 countries view information on 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.530
 potential extremists with 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.630
 from a political point of view and not from a point 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.910
 In terms of safety, this can be 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.690
 pledge of future disasters from washington
