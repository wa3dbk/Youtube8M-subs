00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 dress crochet for beginners mommies 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.420
 we channel we knit here is such a trace 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.540
 the dress 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.840
 this is the second part of the video of the first lesson 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.529
 pieces we knitted a dress from the waistline 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.890
 down at the end of the video you will see a link to 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.150
 all parts of the video tutorial and presentation 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.039
 the dress itself 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.320
 and now we will continue to knit 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:33.059
 dress from the waist line up for this 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.850
 we will attach a thread to another place 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.980
 than we started to knit a chain of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.579
 air for example here in the opposite 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.500
 to the side 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.040
 so that the thread we have not layered each 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.040
 on the friend we do the initial loop 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:56.340
 threading and knitting one air loop 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.770
 lifting and now we will knit the same 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.160
 the most pattern only up can 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:07.770
 or under the chain or in each loop we 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:11.130
 did when knitted skirt down we 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.240
 provyazyvaem one column without 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:20.350
 Nakida only nine pieces 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:26.020
 and so we knit a whole row smoothly 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:29.939
 moving from arc to arc and knit the second 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:34.119
 a series of connecting eyelets we 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.189
 we arrive at the middle of the arc that is necessary 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.159
 do as in the first row we did 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:44.560
 when knitted down five connective 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:46.899
 eyelets came to the center of others 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.770
 and now we will knit our usual 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:59.500
 the next row is 4 aerial and a column with 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:02:04.060
 two nakidy in the same loop 2 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.420
 air 2 more posts with two 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.049
 nakida in the same loop we knit 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.840
 skirt from the waist line down and up for 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.150
 To our, this pattern was beautiful 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.390
 see on the dress that is on the skirt he 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.840
 folded down and on top he walked 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.319
 upstairs 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.920
 so tied 5 air and over 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.989
 midpoint the next arc we knit 2 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.750
 columns with two naquids 2 air and 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:40.200
 2 more posts with two crooks and now 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.349
 we will knit up to the armhole line this 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.040
 pattern and most importantly try on yourself 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.870
 this dress she will already be enough 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.780
 long because we already have a skirt 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.530
 connected and you will see already that under 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.360
 the weight of the dress pattern 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.450
 stretched a little down and therefore 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.180
 we knit a little shorter top 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.760
 dresses, that is, the skirt, we knitted a little 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.920
 shorter than we would like the top 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.250
 part of the dress we will knit a little shorter 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.150
 here to the armhole line than we would like 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.010
 because you have a waist where we 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.230
 knit down and up 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.700
 dress after you already say 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.579
 till the end of the dress and wash it and she 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.549
 otlezhitsya likely leaves you below 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.120
 than waistline if you tie size in 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.549
 the size 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.709
 that is , you need to tie a little bit 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.859
 In short so when I dress 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.380
 stretch down this waistline hit 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.299
 it is on the waist but do not worry if 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.790
 she will leave you below 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.519
 in our case, it went all the same below 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.269
 because we knitted first dress 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:55.829
 up and then down and top 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.849
 we stretched and the waistline crossed 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.099
 on the hips 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.770
 but the beauty of the dress has not changed 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:08.330
 and so when you 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:10.910
 docked up to the prime line and finished here 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.900
 this last row make the last 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:19.190
 pull the dress a little bit 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.450
 down to understand that further everyones line 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.180
 waist in the next lesson we will knit 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.650
 dress sleeves 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:33.320
 on the screen you see now 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:36.410
 a link to all parts stay 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.970
 Mommy channels they ask if 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.970
 there are questions thank you for your attention
