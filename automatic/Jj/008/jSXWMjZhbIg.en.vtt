00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:12.760
 This time is it 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:16.360
 The victim in the back also checks not only the perpetrator's insurance but also his own insurance 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:23.440
 I would like to tell you a story like 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.820
 In the case of a normal accident, it is the treatment cost that a perpetrator's voluntary insurance company has come out 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:31.540
 Leave damage etc 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:33.730
 It will pay you to turn it out, but in addition to the money, it will actually come out on your side . 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.380
 It is that also there may or there is gold 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:41.480
 Reasons for continuing to pay premiums 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.130
 So I think that it is necessary that get firmly if there is what Mao money out 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.500
 I will 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:50.260
 Well then 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.220
 Check your personal insurance requirements and check if there is a passenger injury contract. 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.830
 You will 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:01:01.450
 Then, if you get in a car and make an accident, you will have a certain amount of money 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:06.940
 It is this confirmation required it means that if there is coming out of your insurance 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:14.650
 So personal injury compensation rider this is and say what say such if what kind of case 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:15.760
 For example through car negligence of the 20% amount in the case of negligence proportion to the self it has been said that I am 82 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.880
 Will be deducted 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:25.210
 In other words , even if it is damage of 10 million yen , 2 million yen if you have a science room 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.980
 You will be deducted and you will only get 8 million . 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.120
 a 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:39.180
 When in this personal injury compensation authorized certain that among the 20 percent of the negligence worth somewhat of here 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.950
 As this personal injury compensation special contract that the insurance company can get its own insurance, it is necessary confirmation 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.310
 It is what I did 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310
 then 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.939
 My brother hadn't got insurance when I was in a car accident 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:02:00.030
 If you have only entered the liability , check your fist 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:08.429
 Then there is this whether or not there is an uninsured car injury contract 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:11.340
 Claim the same amount as the sound of damages against the other party to your insurance company 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:18.060
 You may say that it is possible 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.400
 So if you do not have insurance for the other party, you will need to confirm this uninsured car injury contract 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.890
 In part 2 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:29.959
 Is the customer trying to defend important is that the recent important ne This 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:36.140
 I ask if I have an accident and claim the other party for damages 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:40.370
 Roughly the upper limit Well now in the insurance that pays the lawyer of lawyers like is about 3,000,000 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:44.170
 This is confirmation required us has become so insurance to pay up 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.020
 This is I do not have a defense Shitsuka not when there 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.400
 eh 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:57.220
 One more note is that you are not the only insurance that you have applied 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:01.930
 Although the family 225 of the same town is lacking, for example , there are no cars in my house 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.430
 When there is a car of father and mother , that father and mother are hanging 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.799
 Check the insurance 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.799
 If there is such a thing there may still come out 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.940
 Are. We do not live in the case of those of unmarried 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.780
 I will be my parents 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.569
 Because I might leave just maybe, please check the insurance 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:26.689
 Although this is does not mean necessarily out 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:29.090
 If you check the insurance policy, it may be worthwhile if you go further insurance company 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:32.440
 It is to confirm to 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.430
 So after all variety 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.180
 There are insurances that are not well known, but as long as you pay the premium 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.700
 is not it 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:45.790
 After all I would like to check with the insurance agent if it is better to check well 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.640
 Sometimes there may be a mistake 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.430
 If you don't know if you want to get the insurance policy or data and check it yourself 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.510
 Then 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.890
 By saying 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.940
 If it is the contents, please do not mind me and I will 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.940
 This time is over
