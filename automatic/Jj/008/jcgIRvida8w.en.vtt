00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.209
 and now we are all here in a video 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.450
 of how to learn to install the optimal 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:16.070
 for the minecraft 1.7 point 9 also I 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.130
 I think it's going to be able to 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.010
 future versions and some more 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.109
 old and good first thing we have 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.460
 what to do is go to the opd page and 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:31.330
 I found that it's optical at net point and then 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.280
 we go to the download section 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.940
 and here we are going to follow the versions 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:41.990
 that we can download and then I'm going to 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.670
 download the 1.7 that is so ultra 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.390
 close better 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.040
 and download 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.270
 well I keep it on the desk 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.440
 it can be anywhere 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.980
 but if you close 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.980
 good 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.320
 some will leave you with another icon 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.390
 but good 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.500
 Now what we have to do is give it 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.500
 click and here to open with java we have it 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.200
 where he is and we will decide the optimum 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.340
 good installer yes to install it 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.939
 We give you here to install 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.549
 and it is that the history has already been installed 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.100
 or we can delete this file and ready 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.439
 Well the good ode fan is already installed 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.600
 before setting it up he forgot to say 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.759
 what for 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.430
 to put it here here after 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.979
 installed will come out here in your lunch box 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.530
 here I will say optimal profile and not 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.210
 it depends on the vision that has good 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.049
 here if you do not show them they give you edit 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.250
 profile and here use slot version 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.800
 and end 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.530
 and per liter and well we are here in 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.810
 the minecraft to learn how to install 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.660
 configure the of the fine and then not 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.640
 we see options to first that he has 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.750
 two new controls to change the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.500
 sprint button 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.660
 or the sun here because I maybe first 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.740
 Once you install it was to change the button 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.840
 of the zoom I put the letter r but I 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.030
 they can put any letter or they can 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.770
 change the vote is not the sprint 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.320
 and all that is all for now 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.570
 well now it has been now if the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.970
 graphic configurations here I'm going to 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.520
 decide the best configuration for 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.200
 computers that are not so good like that 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.280
 like mine 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.890
 and what good value 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.930
 Well, yes, it is not flying. 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.920
 leave it like that but then I'm going to say the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.920
 skate settings 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.330
 well here in graph we give in quick 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.420
 the fast 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.510
 in rendering distance we lower it 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.120
 The most you can depends on if you do not 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.090
 low equipment if you leave that is for the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.790
 distance that you will see from afar 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.790
 here we can turn it off 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.550
 Here this that we leave it is that 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.250
 It is the best I have 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.180
 here focus to see a little bit more of 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.330
 far 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.810
 then fog is deactivated 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.280
 well now it's not in quality 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.240
 all this we are going to put in off 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.620
 you 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.620
 by all 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.430
 and well only that 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:50.130
 now we are not going into details fifth jls 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:54.110
 we also put that in fast-off 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.110
 as it is because he gets angry 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.209
 if you do not bring to do it with a 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.209
 triumphant 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.360
 not 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.310
 What are they 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.780
 this post today 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:16.180
 this we can deactivate so that the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.180
 rain but I think that 's 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:23.780
 this is friend of your asset 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.560
 to show the fields 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.560
 this 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.250
 good yes 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.440
 and this is fine now they have 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.409
 performance or performance that we carry 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.919
 in smoot fps 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.919
 Y 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.169
 and so we do not 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.190
 good now in animations 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:55.240
 we put this in 2 and activate if 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.009
 they want activate 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.960
 which are all particles 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:04.999
 animated items activated and positions 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.279
 that the particles of the 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:08.910
 positions that is the best I think that 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:11.590
 others 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.129
 It is not so useful for me 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.429
 treatment 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:18.100
 good now in others 

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:20.860
 Ok here 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.380
 here gives us here we leave it in three 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.000
 minutes and we play in single player or what 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.729
 we can put in 30 minutes 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.840
 whom to not rain 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:35.630
 and put the time 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:39.220
 and well, that's all here you are known 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.220
 when a limited 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.160
 Y 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.160
 Well, that's all
