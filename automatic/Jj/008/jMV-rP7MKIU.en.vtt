00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
so what muscles make up the core well

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.900 
so what muscles make up the core well
it's<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.369> rectus<00:00:29.730> abdominis

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
it's going to be the rectus abdominis

to add some weight to it and lower the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.580 
to add some weight to it and lower the
repetitions<00:01:27.240> next<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.320> leg

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
repetitions next up it's going to be leg

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.350 
repetitions next up it's going to be leg
raises<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> focus<00:01:30.329> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
raises this one is going to focus a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.810 
raises this one is going to focus a
little<00:01:30.689> bit<00:01:30.869> more<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.650> lower<00:01:31.950> ab<00:01:32.220> fibers

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
little bit more on the lower ab fibers

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.429 
little bit more on the lower ab fibers
and<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.320> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and so with this you can just do it

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.679 
and so with this you can just do it
