00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.530

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.440
 and of them present this helmet 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.560
 here to give you a little opinion 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.949
 on this helmet here is already here is the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.039
 box 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:28.340
 so there is no headset in it I already 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:32.510
 used a diamond so 40 mm 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.940
 yes I 'm not too hello against 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:39.230
 soues it's written here I am 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.590
 do not see what the dairy is 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.670
 the cable is not bad and of course 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.830
 it's for voice chat 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.350
 so hop I just wanted behind me 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.480
 the euro if you see not everything is very 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.440
 well he is super cute pretty 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.300
 I pray them in black super beautiful 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.930
 here we did not see you too well because 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.089
 that day that is behind the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.700
 particularity that the security good he is 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.700
 very comfortable when put here 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.780
 I do not hear the noises that 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.869
 outside it is rather practical 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.660
 and there two things well is that b the 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:25.970
 micro that goes for the davis like these 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.979
 and it may seem and it can become a 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.750
 helmet sleeps badly and it really got 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.580
 good because when we do not want to 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.940
 talk to others good after you go 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.899
 see after what I mean the 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.700
 restricting to remove it or when 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.979
 we want to go out in town 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.590
 I personally do not use this headset 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.110
 to go to town if I 'm going to listen 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:51.229
 music after that I have more 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:54.039
 writing who over here i'm ready if you 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.289
 would have very good word written here with water 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.090
 here is it written we we really 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.700
 a helmet for the game but otherwise I have 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.050
 tried with my laptop he has a lot of 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.110
 are therefore another particularity of this 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.190
 helmet is he has a small 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:17.780
 remote control here which is very pretty 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.380
 so here is very beautiful we can adjust the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.050
 volume and mute the microphone 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:28.130
 if we do not want to talk here have me 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.250
 been in ten years now we can talk to 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.330
 microphone 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.769
 here after the price yes it must be the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.310
 know the price well so I'm going 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:43.030
 pay to cultura in a cultura store 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.640
 I paid 50 euros where exactly 49 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.989
 euros 99 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.750
 here after I do not know at all if we 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.620
 can pay more for it after me 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.180
 taken in dreamed 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.849

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.680

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.230
 prefer to take it so I just 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.569
 removed ah yes it's a little annoying to 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.170
 unpack the first time I've 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:28.090
