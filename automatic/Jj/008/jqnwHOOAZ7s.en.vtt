00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.430
 I'm fabio I prepare croquettes from 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.099
 selenella potatoes and cod before I have to 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.490
 think of the dissolved cod 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.289
 good quality and already desalted 6 covered 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.480
 of salt at home three days changing 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.970
 water often check that there is not 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.540
 are thorns if there are you need this 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.430
 tool to take it off then I don't need it 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.820
 even the skin then somehow 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.309
 the skin you have to eliminate because there 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:52.729
 serves pure pulp cut into pieces 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:56.989
 even small we choose the temperature 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:01:03.100
 not too high we prepare a drop 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:06.500
 of oil a crushed clove of garlic 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.580
 then we decide whether to remove it or blend it 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.939
 using it this taste is now in fashion 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.100
 without garlic the anchovy with garlic e 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.100
 oil a classic of seafood cuisine 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:29.390
 our cod and here we have to decide 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.249
 how much salt I would say at the moment little or 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.659
 nothing 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:36.579
 I make the scene but in reality being 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.579
 desalted may already be tasty 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.000
 we do so only a minute 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.750
 so without it heats the oil too much then 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.230
 we take with a half glass of wine 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.230
 dry white 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.170
 we let it evaporate a minute and 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.869
 we cook with a little milk 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.000
 very little 4 tablespoons for 4 people 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.140
 bassano in five minutes 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.670
 cod and cooked and well and dies 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.069
 we can almost avoid it at 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:25.790
 knife anyway crush it break it 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:29.290
 in pieces that we steam-cooked or 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:43.880
 meanwhile boil our ekotto cod 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:54.080
 dry it is cooling a little 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:59.720
 pepper and very little new nintendo salt 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.360
 the whole bottarga the mullet eggs 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.670
 dried lightly salted that's why 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.820
 it can also cause cod and tasty 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.609
 here stability will not be missed 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.260
 I need lemon juice to give me acidity 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.810
 then images of this prophet is a bit 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.310
 too sweet because the potato is that 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.870
 look, let him do it 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.739
 shatters everything if it should happen 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.910
 this dough is a little too soggy 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.799
 just add a 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.950
 spoon of breadcrumbs inside 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.630
 the dough 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.239
 I always advise him to rest in 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.660
 fridge half an hour somehow yes 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:42.410
 tighten with two spoons do this 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.210
 simple work all well compressed e 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.310
 all in the shape of hours 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.580
 or you really don't want to because 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.910
 we were kidding and take some fairies 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.740
 the balls went on like this to do 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.270
 the ball and then of course between one 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.220
 minute we are ready to fry 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.110
 in hot oil 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.270
 here the potatoes are cooked the cod 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:07.120
 cooked when cooked with egg and ready 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.120
 the croquettes 170 degrees abundant 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.790
 fry the potato croquettes and 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.920
 cod the oil this time rather 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.570
 hot as I said a little while ago inside not 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.120
 all at once 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:28.340
 the oil cools but a few at a time 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.420
 and let's see let's see if we can 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.490
 see them well 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.350
 here's what's happening and if we live 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.260
 hot or even warm as a dish 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.090
 main as an aperitif if you want with 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.490
 of spicy sauces of oil 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.770
 ginger with mayonnaise ski le tartare 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.880
 in short, have fun 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:50.170
 once again a little salt and then there 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.170
 place where you like 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.270
 well
