00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.419
 want discount to enter college 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:09.340
 I want to go bag good point october r 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:11.080
 hello welcome to the table from 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.530
 Now let's start talking about the 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.879
 mollusks are molluscs 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.580
 soft body 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.540
 usually protected by a shell 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.970
 limestone and they can be 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.080
 millimeter as for example certain 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.110
 snails 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.390
 or reach up to 20 meters 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.000
 length is the case of squid 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.270
 these animals can be 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.220
 found in various types of environments 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:45.940
 at sea on fresh water on land 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:50.050
 They are dribbling animals and what 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:54.430
 means they have pity derma 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:58.149
 even adema and ectoderm in addition are 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.700
 selected animals and we have already 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.059
 about body cavities that the 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.540
 seal is a very important cavity 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.520
 because it serves as protection and space 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.220
 for the growth of internal organs 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.340
 besides having an important function as 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.570
 hydrostatic skeleton and molluscs 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.960
 also show bilateral symmetry 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.630
 is that very important symmetry for 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.640
 the process of raising awareness of 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.240
 head emergence 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.640
 but beyond these general characteristics 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.000
 I also want to show the organization 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.520
 of the molluscs 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.689
 have a head where they are 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.420
 located the sense organs some 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:50.110
 have tentacles that will be very 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.110
 important for vision protection and 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.770
 emergence of this personal head like me 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.460
 I already told you it is very related to 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.520
 bilateral symmetry beyond the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.689
 molluscs have feet that are very 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.939
 important for the locomotion of the feet in 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.930
 some species also perform the function 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:16.989
 swimming pool 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.989
 sensation in the substrate and also personal 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.840
 the mollusks present a visceral sac 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.930
 the visceral sac is nothing more than a 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.650
 kind of bag that will be important 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.920
 to house the internal organs 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.650
 most of the physiological systems that 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.849
 We'll see in the next classes are 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.790
 located 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.090
 here in this bag that will be the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.689
 Literal bag coating receives the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.680
 special name and is called mantle the 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:51.040
 Bush 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.489
 is nothing more than a fold of the epidermis and 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.510
 it plays a very special role 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:02.109
 which is the production in the acoustic shell in the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.750
 molluscs is composed mainly of 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.989
 calcium carbonate and this quilt 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.840
 personnel may be internal within the 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.569
 body as in the case of squid 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.439
 or absent as it happens in the 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.260
 and why the thigh is important 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:23.799
 Good, we'll see in the next classes that 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.049
 accuses xuxa confers protection took 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.290
 lusco and we will always remember that the 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:32.199
 molluscs are soft-bodied animals and 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.810
 who gives resistance and protection to 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:37.750
 these animals is the course 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.930
 Furthermore the cusmt works as a 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.629
 muscle support and is important for 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.150
 the skeletal support 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.959
 only that the development of these parts 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.169
 different types of mollusk varies 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.530
 for example the few have the 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:59.169
 head and feet well developed 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.409
 others have a head almost 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:05.229
 non-existent and the bag part to be 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.989
 which is the most developed and 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:11.019
 differences in these parts are important 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.359
 for the division of molluscs into 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.939
 classes that is what we'll see in the 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.900
 next class then we close this class 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:21.030
 around here 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.030
 do not lose the next until more
