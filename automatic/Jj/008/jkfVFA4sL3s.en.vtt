00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:18.310
 and if you do not realize it is not a 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.710
 voluntary the truth sometimes but but 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.310
 if I like I like especially that 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.650
 issues that I consider very serious 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.349
 and the way to treat them is not from the 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.300
 solemnly just so that 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.070
 enter more easily you have to give the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.660
 contrary mood then things very 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.210
 sad you have to say them with laughter 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.410
 there are things that are funny to what 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.050
 better you have to take them a bit in 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.079
 Serious sex always 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.390
 it is seen from a perspective or very very serious 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.220
 in plane I advise you things so that 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.710
 see see better is your sex life 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.570
 and as if that were as if 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.450
 could really teach something like that and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.570
 many people just with all respect but 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.460
 he 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.290
 you do a business this does not 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.790
 nobody can tell you how to enjoy 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.790
 nobody can tell you how to feel pleasure 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.840
 and eroticism can also be very 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.770
 ridiculous about everything written 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.060
 Literally do not be your buttocks like 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.200
 open peach 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.620
 succulent and all these goals 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.940
 vehicles not then I do not know when it 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.990
 try to describe for example a 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.090
 scene that has to do with our 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.310
 sexuality with sex with the body that 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.490
 it is better to give something of 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.009
 humor not me yo when when he tried to 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.650
 very intimate or sexuality issues 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.240
 for example in this book of sexgraphs 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.880
 I am always very anticlimax and not in 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.100
 the moment he's going to arrive is supposed 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.720
 already the exciting moment of erection 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.810
 let's say that or laugh or try 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.899
 make you think something or cry or not and from 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.090
 suddenly it's over or it's over what 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.590
 you expected is better that is not what 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.250
 negative or be a bit surprising 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.880
 also not in class no no 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.729
 but to be another type of products 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.570
 that are going to make it that much more effective 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.570
 brief 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.629
 Y
