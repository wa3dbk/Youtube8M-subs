00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.560
 hello welcome is this new video tutorial behind the lustro tories 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.919
 in this case what I'm going to do is explain 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:13.490
 the material diego and the material itf the material of lives in light 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.630
 here I have a scene 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.280
 which I am working on now is that I simply took neither players in which 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.359
 as you are seeing here I have this plane 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.029
 and I have this plane are separated 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.990
 what I'm going to do right now is percent and will try to create a material in 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.920
 this case using live ex-matter we're going to use this material to 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.750
 project a 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.210
 a texture 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.140
 to put it on it on the screen of the monitor and that at the same time 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.820
 is projecting light 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.609
 if for example I have to whom a living and normal material 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.809
 which I have put in the diffuse channel put a texture that is that I will be 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:51.910
 here 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.640
 I have that texture that is a screenshot of my computer from my monitor 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.480
 so if I just put this texture in the diffuse channel 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.950
 to this material said ellis kills me a living standard material 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.250
 if I add him in this case 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.460
 percent here to this plane 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.520
 I have put a regular ibi matin just percent I have put a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.260
 ibi matin to adapt it to the plane 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.620
 if I come here 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.580
 and I'm doing a render, obviously, we're going to have 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.940
 in this case we are going to have the scene 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.310
 with the monitor on the left the one with the texture on 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.920
 but obviously as a texture has no light a bazaar turned off here is 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.190
 can see perfectly it has nothing light 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.950
 What it is about is that Ductor lived and at the same time we will see how to use 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.620
 the material was living light 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.350
 to continue in this case having this texture but at the same time 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.870
 emitting light 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.149
 well what I'm going to do is once I have this material 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.810
 and he has applied liduvina pin that the most important thing is that to know the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.249
 positioning the size and everything 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.619
 the texture in it pulls me or projected on the plane 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.510
 I'm going now to collect this I'm going to drag it and I'm going to paste it here 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.490
 what I'm going to do is put ki-hun under him and love him esprin ley lo 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.930
 first thing I do is beg to name the material to not have any kind of 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.770
 of over writing materials or anything like that or any failure 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.349
 what I'm going to do open here I felt and the material itf 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.409
 and what we are going to do is put him in this fifth channel and he called to put the 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.699
 photography in this case the most intimate 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.329
 and we are going to put this one is called escuÃ­n 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.779
 the tenth or pen 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.179
 and here what we are going to do is put 20 units 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:40.799
 light up by 20 units the light material percent in feet to light up 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:41.730
 hundred 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.690
 very intensely therefore 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.420
 once we apply this material to evil we will not tell you 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.989
 assign material 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.339
 let's see him off white 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:55.439
 percent here is where the important thing comes from and that's why I first 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.989
 assign this standard material 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.459
 with a divine pin 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.229
 like the texture in this case the photograph that I'm getting this 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:06.659
 material is exactly the same as the one that has this 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.120
 As already applied by an Ibi Martin what size and everything you have 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.750
 proportions that have the texture 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.599
 will continue to have this material but this time 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.739
 we are using a light material 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.409
 if I tell you render 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.430
 let's see right now as 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.539
 the monitor on the left is going to continue 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:28.339
 with the texture that we were looking for exactly as I say in the same 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:29.109
 position 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.449
 but this time more tarelli nominated 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.369
 and at the same time light is being projected 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:37.179
 keep in mind that the noise 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:41.920
 or in the venues perfection is that someone in in this one in it 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.700
 it's because it adjusts shooting and they're just low now just to make 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.609
 tests 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.219
 so good here it takes off here they are already seeing as the light material 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.869
 He must have been taking action 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:57.289
 we can go up then lower it has value for what this part is here 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.289
 in this plane in my house more with less light 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.619
 efe a very important thing is who 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.609
 when we apply materials from a kid 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.499
 many times it can happen is that the shadows that project us 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:14.929
 in obama will give the scientist is it really going to happen that they will not go out 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:15.820
 fled 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.249
 or it will not come out stain does or will not come out weird things 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:23.199
 when percent when we illuminate with the GDP in the matter 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.460
 to avoid that 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.550
 what we have to do is tell him here lighting the direct 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.800
 let's light up 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.009
 in this case with direct lighting 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.610
 and here in the uses that default are 8 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.949
 we can increase it to 16 joselo we can increase to 32 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.629
 depending on the quality and what the curtain 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.779
 in rare effect - adds to those who are not appearing shadows 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:48.990
 export 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.300
 obviously in this case also if we upload the subdivisions 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.560
 keep in mind that the render invades to take more time to render 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.080
 another thing that we can also be here I'm going to be a 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.029
 a clone of this one of these sell 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.860
 We are going to tell you what we can compensate for in the camera exhibition 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.400
 if we tell him to compensate us for the exposure of the camera we're going to 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 have to go down here quite this value I have already done some tests 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:14.909
 1 25 goes well 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.710
 then if I tell him to render 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.560
 scratched will see what percent the light will suffice a little more compensated with 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.460
 regarding the physical camera that in this case I'm using a camera 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.449
 physical 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.139
 the brightness comes out the rather more real that comes out a little bit more real so 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:31.910
 less in this one in this case 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.099
 good example 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.380
 and how are you seeing the light a little emotional here now that I finish 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.270
 here we can see the difference 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.550
 between how you see the two monitors 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.509
 percent obviously also the monitor on the right if we had 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.169
 wanted is that it emits bad use that is pri ante subject 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.380
 percent assuming we're not going to use compensation 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.090
 ponder of 20 we would have given the best of ing and 5 or 30 units 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:00.110
 but well this is the way in which we can judge the viceroy of 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.940
 material 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.409
 remember that with this material we can apply only objects to geometry 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:07.999
 and we can illuminate 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:12.569
 both the mining kilo and for example an object that is simply white and 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:17.270
 illuminate or in this case how are you seeing a blind plane or any 

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:20.809
 object that I have a texture and that at the same time is illuminated also 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.619
 well I hope that the Serbian exgeneral the psib to this video tutorial in the future 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:30.459
 do not forget to keep visiting 13 luis tutoring and we do not see in the next 

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:31.829
 video tutorial thanks
