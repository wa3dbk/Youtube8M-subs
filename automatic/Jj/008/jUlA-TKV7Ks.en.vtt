00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.529
 good morning from tonetto drawers today 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.080
 we are in the stop 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.049
 we are at the end of August the principles of 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.669
 September and as we have been seeing for a while since 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:17.550
 been a lot of work to do in 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:22.260
 primis obviously we have to equip ourselves 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:26.520
 of the necessary accesses such as hoe e 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.520
 rake shears and so on and then the 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.059
 first thing to do free is known 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.280
 theme obviously from what remains 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.980
 of cultures writes in this case 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.460
 we see tomatoes have now finished 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.879
 their production cycle going 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:49.739
 grubbed up from the military base to the base 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:54.530
 and put to dry and then be 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:58.499
 ragged study the roots as they are 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:03.109
 often so we do more Italians than 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:03.109
 obino that then all 8 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.900
 I did n't understand a little 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 here is if we put one side 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.610
 this then outline what of course 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.160
 their production cycle 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.240
 those as in this case is called e 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.070
 how many chili peppers start to 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.080
 becoming mature means that by now 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.950
 have completed their cycle 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.740
 productive 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.730
 we value these we eliminate and also 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:44.979
 these we will put yarn and make them 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:47.560
 dry then we will eliminate the pumpkins that 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.720
 have completed their cycle 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.460
 as productive as this you see is not there 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.580
 nothing even this sentence of put spate 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.490
 emitted from the side we find again 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.530
 of the lettuce that produced flowers 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.540
 we can also leave that for 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.729
 complete a seed application 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.300
 eventually collects the seeds 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:15.280
 however the oils with sistri piano also 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:18.930
 these to the flowered sogas and we must 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.840
 release the seeds and the kiss that they are 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.400
 in fact they have invaded the garden of when it is 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.570
 It was a pretty rainy summer 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.569
 we will eliminate by proceeding ahead 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:40.359
 eggplants gathered by now 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:42.519
 nothing more those who wear 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:46.329
 elderly as you see in this case that 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.249
 they have become yellowish and that or 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.370
 sick or because they have produced 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:57.370
 assassins pull them to the base as 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:00.730
 see so let's leave this way and get them 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.129
 dried after which we will collect them 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.280
 we all also found a nice one 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:12.299
 vitamin that we will collect but live 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.299
 this too and so on 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.609
 we are facing a show 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:22.199
 really sick many sick tomatoes 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:25.359
 they took the tomato bubble 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:28.620
 the production is dried as you see 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:33.250
 it went wrong so these will decrease 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.669
 here too we go bad we must 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.669
 burn 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.359
 here and then burn your wounded for 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.030
 avoid the mosaic of the 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:49.449
 mosaic virus which is why with reds 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.459
 and all these the case maiano semi li 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:54.280
 we can dig in when 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:59.229
 will constitute a natural fertilizer for the 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:03.389
 our home port all net 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:03.389
 see you soon. Bye
