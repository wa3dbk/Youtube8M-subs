00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.340 
one goes to the 9-volt battery
connection<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.049> plug<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.619> red<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.340> red<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
connection so you plug in red to red and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.080 
connection so you plug in red to red and
black<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.470> buy

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:28.109 

you<00:01:19.929> just<00:01:20.170> slide<00:01:20.409> it<00:01:20.619> in<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:27.640> if<00:01:27.939> you're

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
you just slide it in now if you're

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.319 
you just slide it in now if you're
putting<00:01:28.329> this<00:01:28.569> together

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
putting this together

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.120 
putting this together
I'm<00:01:31.329> putting<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.869> on<00:01:31.960> our<00:01:32.049> RC<00:01:32.530> body<00:01:32.740> you<00:01:32.920> do

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
I'm putting it on our RC body you do

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.649 
I'm putting it on our RC body you do
want<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.520> put<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:36.100> heat<00:01:36.459> shrink<00:01:36.670> over<00:01:36.939> before

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
want to put the heat shrink over before

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:46.319 
want to put the heat shrink over before
that<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:38.319> make<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.619> connection<00:01:44.789> so<00:01:45.789> that<00:01:45.819> you

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
that you make the connection so that you

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.630 
that you make the connection so that you
can<00:01:48.719> make<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.869> connection<00:01:50.189> slide<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.459> heat

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
can make the connection slide the heat

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.359 
can make the connection slide the heat
shrink<00:01:51.670> over<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.750> then<00:01:53.709> use<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> lighter<00:01:54.220> to

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
shrink over and then use a lighter to

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.710 
shrink over and then use a lighter to
heat<00:01:54.670> up<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.970> bottom<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.329> the<00:01:55.420> heat<00:01:55.569> shrink

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
heat up the bottom of the heat shrink

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.839 
heat up the bottom of the heat shrink
just<00:01:56.020> for<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.259> second<00:01:56.619> or<00:01:56.709> so<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.429> it'll<00:01:57.610> shrink

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849 
just for a second or so and it'll shrink

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:00.359 
just for a second or so and it'll shrink
up<00:01:58.030> around<00:01:58.239> the<00:01:58.390> connection<00:01:59.069> you<00:02:00.069> want<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.310> do

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
up around the connection you want to do

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:09.010 
up around the connection you want to do
that<00:02:00.489> for<00:02:00.700> each<00:02:00.729> connection<00:02:03.030> so

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.620 

so<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.080> hook<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.440> each<00:02:10.649> switch<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.970> hook<00:02:12.150> up<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
so to hook up each switch you hook up a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.120 
so to hook up each switch you hook up a
set<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.530> black<00:02:13.860> wires<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:15.750> one<00:02:15.930> switch<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.560> you

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
set of black wires to one switch and you

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.010 
set of black wires to one switch and you
notice<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.640> they're<00:02:17.910> wired<00:02:18.450> together

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
notice that they're wired together

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.600 
notice that they're wired together
so<00:02:19.640> one<00:02:20.640> set<00:02:20.940> goes<00:02:21.650> for<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.830> switch<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.520> other

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
so one set goes for one switch the other

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.130 
so one set goes for one switch the other
goes<00:02:23.850> for<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> other<00:02:24.240> doesn't<00:02:24.990> matter<00:02:25.760> which

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
goes for the other doesn't matter which

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.400 
goes for the other doesn't matter which
wire<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.200> connected<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.830> which<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.200> grab

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
wire is connected to which and you grab

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:45.350 
wire is connected to which and you grab
your<00:02:34.680> 9-volt<00:02:35.280> battery<00:02:37.130> plug<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.280> up<00:02:44.150> we<00:02:45.150> good

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
your 9-volt battery plug it up we good

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.800 
your 9-volt battery plug it up we good
to<00:02:45.450> go<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.440> use<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.190> switches<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.850> cycle

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
to go so you use the switches to cycle

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
to go so you use the switches to cycle
through<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:50.250> different<00:02:50.280> modes<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.650> for

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
through the different modes this is for

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.340 
through the different modes this is for
the<00:02:52.920> front<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:54.420> for<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.690> back<00:02:56.390> now<00:02:57.390> to
