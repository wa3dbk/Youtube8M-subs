if<00:01:24.570> those<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.960> didn't<00:01:25.229> wait<00:01:25.320> bought<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.680> it's

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
if those you didn't wait bought it it's

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.800 
if those you didn't wait bought it it's
pretty<00:01:26.040> much<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.340> cord<00:01:27.030> behind<00:01:27.180> my<00:01:27.450> bed<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
pretty much the cord behind my bed a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
pretty much the cord behind my bed a
pretty<00:01:28.110> much<00:01:28.400> it<00:01:29.400> pretty<00:01:29.640> much<00:01:29.790> looks<00:01:29.970> like

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
pretty much it pretty much looks like

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.300 
pretty much it pretty much looks like
this<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.229> basically<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.829> has<00:01:32.009> Michelle

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
this and it basically just has Michelle

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.609 
this and it basically just has Michelle
naming<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.729> i<00:01:32.850> drew<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> I'm<00:01:33.990> kind<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.229> saving

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
naming it i drew and I'm kind of saving

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.679 
naming it i drew and I'm kind of saving
it<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.040> anything<00:01:35.640> else<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.240> guessing<00:01:36.659> that

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
it for anything else I'm guessing that

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.080 
it for anything else I'm guessing that
I'm<00:01:37.320> gonna<00:01:37.439> put<00:01:37.680> some<00:01:37.860> fan<00:01:38.340> stop<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.909> there

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
I'm gonna put some fan stop on there

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.789 
I'm gonna put some fan stop on there
hopefully<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.720> day<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.229> happens

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
hopefully one day if that happens

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.679 
hopefully one day if that happens
they'll<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.100> amazing<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.030> hopefully<00:01:42.420> that's

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
they'll be amazing so hopefully that's

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.600 
they'll be amazing so hopefully that's
what<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.170> meant<00:01:43.290> by<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> board<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.040> yeah<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
what you meant by the board and yeah I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.310 
what you meant by the board and yeah I
can<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> effects<00:01:45.450> were<00:01:45.630> QE<00:01:45.899> stiff<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
can do the effects were QE stiff and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.109 
can do the effects were QE stiff and
quite<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> lot<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.680> people<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.640> say<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.970> get

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
quite a lot of people and you say I get

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.429 
quite a lot of people and you say I get
overwhelmed<00:01:48.329> with<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> press<00:01:48.990> sometimes

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
overwhelmed with the press sometimes

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.870 
overwhelmed with the press sometimes
it's<00:01:49.680> kind<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.950> hard<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.159> keep<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.430> top<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
it's kind of hard to keep on top of it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.730 
it's kind of hard to keep on top of it
which<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.390> why<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> kind<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.049> keep<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.619> on

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
which is why I kind of like keep it on

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.450 
which is why I kind of like keep it on
the<00:01:52.860> downlow<00:01:53.070> about<00:01:53.610> doing

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
the downlow about doing

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.310 
the downlow about doing
EFX<00:01:54.729> work<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.270> that's<00:01:55.570> pretty<00:01:55.720> much<00:01:55.840> why<00:01:56.110> but

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
EFX work and that's pretty much why but

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.870 
EFX work and that's pretty much why but
y'all<00:01:56.500> do<00:01:56.680> you<00:01:56.920> just<00:01:57.100> inbox<00:01:57.400> me<00:01:57.520> what<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.700> want

a<00:02:06.909> lot<00:02:07.119> but<00:02:07.300> basically<00:02:07.630> i<00:02:07.780> just<00:02:07.840> got<00:02:08.170> a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
a lot but basically i just got a

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.020 
a lot but basically i just got a
variance<00:02:08.470> Cape<00:02:08.649> when<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.190> was<00:02:09.399> about<00:02:09.520> nine<00:02:10.000> or

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
variance Cape when I was about nine or

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.150 
variance Cape when I was about nine or
ten<00:02:10.330> years<00:02:10.539> old<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:10.780> think<00:02:10.959> I<00:02:11.230> can't<00:02:11.830> obviously

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
ten years old I think I can't obviously

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.830 
ten years old I think I can't obviously
remember<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.670> specific<00:02:13.090> like<00:02:13.209> dates<00:02:13.510> and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
remember the specific like dates and

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.270 
remember the specific like dates and
that<00:02:13.930> stuff<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.440> I'm<00:02:14.709> pretty<00:02:14.980> sure<00:02:15.069> i<00:02:15.160> was

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
that stuff and I'm pretty sure i was

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.240 
that stuff and I'm pretty sure i was
around<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.520> AG<00:02:16.000> five<00:02:16.239> years<00:02:16.569> six<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.110> i<00:02:17.950> just

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
around the AG five years six and i just

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.150 
around the AG five years six and i just
typed<00:02:18.459> in<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:18.910> google<00:02:19.900> i<00:02:20.020> think<00:02:20.230> i<00:02:20.380> just<00:02:20.739> typed

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
typed in on google i think i just typed

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.600 
typed in on google i think i just typed
in<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.760> like<00:02:22.569> multiplayer<00:02:23.560> game<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.459> came

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
in and like multiplayer game and it came

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.340 
in and like multiplayer game and it came
up<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.180> obviously<00:02:25.630> because<00:02:25.840> risk<00:02:26.050> is<00:02:26.200> such<00:02:26.319> a

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
up so obviously because risk is such a

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.170 
up so obviously because risk is such a
well-known<00:02:26.590> game<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.280> lot<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.730> people<00:02:28.000> knew<00:02:28.150> it

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
well-known game a lot of people knew it

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.000 
well-known game a lot of people knew it
back<00:02:28.420> then<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.170> guess<00:02:29.380> that's<00:02:29.620> why<00:02:29.800> it's<00:02:29.950> a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
back then and I guess that's why it's a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.740 
back then and I guess that's why it's a
blur<00:02:30.250> search<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.760> click<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.390> I

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
blur search is a click on it and I

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.420 
blur search is a click on it and I
remember<00:02:32.200> being<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:32.620> long<00:02:32.800> bridge<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.130> remember

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
remember being in long bridge I remember

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.920 
remember being in long bridge I remember
it<00:02:33.489> now<00:02:33.640> being<00:02:33.880> his<00:02:33.970> Lumbridge<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.780> when<00:02:34.900> I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
it now being his Lumbridge but when I

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.300 
it now being his Lumbridge but when I
dreamed<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.500> didn't<00:02:35.650> know<00:02:35.739> what<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.920> was<00:02:36.040> so

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
dreamed it I didn't know what it was so

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.710 
dreamed it I didn't know what it was so
I<00:02:36.340> was<00:02:36.610> kind<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.850> like<00:02:36.970> lost<00:02:37.300> i<00:02:37.480> didn't<00:02:37.660> know

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
I was kind of like lost i didn't know

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.540 
I was kind of like lost i didn't know
what<00:02:37.810> i<00:02:37.870> was<00:02:37.959> doing<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.470> then<00:02:38.890> over<00:02:39.160> time<00:02:39.310> I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
what i was doing and then over time I

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.430 
what i was doing and then over time I
gradually<00:02:39.880> just<00:02:40.000> got<00:02:40.239> used<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.840> that's

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
gradually just got used to it and that's

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.900 
gradually just got used to it and that's
how<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.620> discovered<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.400> fifth<00:02:42.640> question

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
how I discovered it the fifth question

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.940 
how I discovered it the fifth question
comes<00:02:43.360> from<00:02:43.450> chris<00:02:43.750> richardson<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.530> he<00:02:44.709> says

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
comes from chris richardson and he says

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.490 
back then back into it not to shore and
minecraft<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.180> they<00:02:58.360> look<00:02:58.810> like<00:02:58.840> three<00:02:59.290> games
