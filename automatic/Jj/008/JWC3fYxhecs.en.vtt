the<00:00:43.770> other<00:00:44.040> side<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.760> didn't<00:00:44.969> stay<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the other side so we didn't stay on the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
the other side so we didn't stay on the
field<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:46.469> really<00:00:46.710> couldn't<00:00:46.980> get<00:00:47.100> off<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
field we really couldn't get off the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.000 
field we really couldn't get off the
field<00:00:47.640> too<00:00:47.940> well<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.739> was<00:00:49.860> always

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
field too well and it was always

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770 
field too well and it was always
something<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.550> executed<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.329> way<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.690> the

something on executed on way or the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.049 
something on executed on way or the
other<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.020> that's<00:00:52.920> my<00:00:53.160> fault<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.640> got<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
other so that's my fault I got to do a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.799 
other so that's my fault I got to do a
better<00:00:54.120> job<00:00:56.000> no<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.329> think<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.600> i<00:00:57.719> think

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.420 
better job no I don't think so i think
they<00:00:58.109> came<00:00:58.320> out<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.649> played<00:00:58.739> pretty<00:00:59.039> good<00:00:59.129> in

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
they came out and played pretty good in

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.799 
they came out and played pretty good in
the<00:00:59.489> beginning<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> game<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.210> mean<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.629> put

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
the beginning of the game I mean we put

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.090 
the beginning of the game I mean we put
the<00:01:00.899> defense<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:01.890> had<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the defense out there they had a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.520 
the defense out there they had a
three-and-out<00:01:02.609> stop<00:01:03.170> we<00:01:04.170> brought<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
three-and-out stop we brought the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.170 
three-and-out stop we brought the
offense<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.159> there<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.610> went<00:01:05.820> down<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
offense out there and they went down the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.940 
offense out there and they went down the
field<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.659> got<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.930> score<00:01:07.340> I<00:01:09.560> thought<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.799> we

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
field and got a score I thought that we

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.580 
field and got a score I thought that we
were<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.189> our<00:01:11.220> way<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.909> those<00:01:12.000> kind<00:01:12.360> of

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
games maybe a little bit like we had

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.080

last<00:01:14.939> week<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.380> won<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> way<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.520> went

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
you know I'm not one of these big

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.570 
you know I'm not one of these big
believers<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.630> only<00:01:32.780> way<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.260> you<00:01:33.380> can

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
there I mean you know I think Cameron

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.530 
there I mean you know I think Cameron
Wake<00:01:52.310> might<00:01:52.580> add<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.790> couple<00:01:53.030> hits<00:01:53.240> on<00:01:53.450> the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
Wake might add a couple hits on the

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.719 
Wake might add a couple hits on the
quarterback<00:01:53.690> a<00:01:54.050> little<00:01:54.410> bit<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.130> we<00:01:55.460> really

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
quarterback a little bit and we really

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.160 
quarterback a little bit and we really
didn't<00:01:55.880> do<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.000> whole<00:01:56.090> lot<00:01:56.300> from<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.899> pressure

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
didn't do a whole lot from a pressure

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.170 
didn't do a whole lot from a pressure
standpoint<00:01:57.920> in<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:58.220> game<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:58.490> would<00:01:58.729> say<00:01:59.000> they

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
standpoint in this game I would say they

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.630 
standpoint in this game I would say they
pressured<00:01:59.600> us<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.899> lot<00:02:00.050> more<00:02:00.229> than<00:02:00.290> we

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
pressured us a lot more than we

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.590 
pressured us a lot more than we
attempted<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.670> pressure<00:02:01.970> them<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.479> that's

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
attempted to pressure them and that's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.359 
attempted to pressure them and that's
not<00:02:02.840> being<00:02:03.110> critical<00:02:03.320> that's<00:02:03.770> just<00:02:04.040> part<00:02:04.250> of

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
not being critical that's just part of

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.249 
not being critical that's just part of
our<00:02:04.490> package<00:02:04.910> right<00:02:05.149> now<00:02:05.330> part<00:02:05.840> of<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:05.960> way<00:02:06.080> we

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
no it doesn't really change my thought

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.390 
no it doesn't really change my thought
process<00:03:42.630> as<00:03:42.810> far<00:03:43.050> as<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.680> way<00:03:43.830> I'll<00:03:44.040> approach

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
process as far as the way I'll approach

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.460 
process as far as the way I'll approach
the<00:03:44.670> game<00:03:44.880> okay<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:45.660> really<00:03:45.930> hadn't<00:03:46.230> said

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
the game okay and I really hadn't said

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.420 
the game okay and I really hadn't said
how<00:03:47.250> I'll<00:03:47.490> approach<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:48.030> game<00:03:48.060> however<00:03:49.430> it

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
how I'll approach the game however it

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.520 
how I'll approach the game however it
might<00:03:50.700> change<00:03:51.000> my<00:03:51.120> thought<00:03:51.540> process<00:03:52.140> on<00:03:52.350> how<00:03:52.380> I

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
might change my thought process on how I

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.650 
might change my thought process on how I
approached<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.790> next<00:03:54.090> three<00:03:54.300> days<00:03:54.330> of

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
approached the next three days of

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.720 
approached the next three days of
practice<00:03:57.620> well<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.800> thought<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.100> Chad<00:03:59.430> Henne

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
practice well I thought the Chad Henne

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.130 
practice well I thought the Chad Henne
went<00:03:59.910> out<00:04:00.000> there<00:04:00.150> today<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.660> thought<00:04:00.870> for<00:04:01.110> a

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
went out there today and I thought for a

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.570 
went out there today and I thought for a
while<00:04:01.200> he<00:04:01.530> played<00:04:01.739> pretty<00:04:01.920> good<00:04:02.040> i<00:04:02.190> mean<00:04:02.459> I

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
while he played pretty good i mean I

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.350 
while he played pretty good i mean I
really<00:04:02.910> did<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.420> thought<00:04:03.930> he<00:04:04.080> had<00:04:04.110> some<00:04:04.500> drops

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
really did I thought he had some drops

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.180 
really did I thought he had some drops
early<00:04:06.360> on<00:04:06.510> in<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.780> deal<00:04:06.959> there<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:08.160> thought

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
early on in the deal there and I thought

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.250 
early on in the deal there and I thought
he<00:04:08.489> threw<00:04:08.670> some<00:04:08.820> really<00:04:09.090> good<00:04:09.239> balls<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:10.140> know

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
he threw some really good balls you know

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.440 
he threw some really good balls you know
the<00:04:10.410> one<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.560> wish<00:04:10.830> he<00:04:11.010> would<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:12.060> know<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.209> I

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
the one I wish he would you know that I

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.000 
the one I wish he would you know that I
think<00:04:12.750> he<00:04:12.900> wishes<00:04:13.080> he<00:04:13.410> would<00:04:13.530> have<00:04:13.590> had<00:04:13.769> back

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
think he wishes he would have had back

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.509 
think he wishes he would have had back
is<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.519> third<00:04:15.300> down<00:04:15.739> play<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:17.130> ended<00:04:17.310> up

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
is the third down play that ended up

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.400 
is the third down play that ended up
being<00:04:17.760> towards<00:04:18.090> our<00:04:18.269> sideline<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.959> brand<00:04:19.200> in

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
being towards our sideline to brand in

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.130 
being towards our sideline to brand in
there<00:04:19.620> okay<00:04:20.250> kind<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.060> little<00:04:21.299> flag<00:04:21.540> corner

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
there okay kind of a little flag corner

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.320 
there okay kind of a little flag corner
diaper<00:04:22.410> out<00:04:22.620> there<00:04:22.890> I<00:04:23.070> think<00:04:23.700> he<00:04:23.790> felt<00:04:24.030> like<00:04:24.090> he

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
diaper out there I think he felt like he

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.450 
diaper out there I think he felt like he
put<00:04:24.540> air<00:04:24.690> on<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.080> early<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:26.130> one<00:04:26.310> just

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
put air on it early and that one just

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.890 
put air on it early and that one just
kind<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.760> got<00:04:26.850> away<00:04:27.000> from<00:04:27.120> him<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.570> little<00:04:27.600> bit

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
kind of got away from him a little bit

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.600 
kind of got away from him a little bit
but<00:04:28.050> other<00:04:28.200> than<00:04:28.320> that<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.530> thought<00:04:28.830> really

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
but other than that I thought really

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.280 
but other than that I thought really
Chad<00:04:29.940> made<00:04:30.180> some<00:04:30.330> pretty<00:04:30.480> good<00:04:30.690> throws<00:04:30.990> in<00:04:31.200> the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
Chad made some pretty good throws in the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.140 
Chad made some pretty good throws in the
game<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.740> know<00:04:31.860> later<00:04:32.460> in<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.730> game<00:04:32.910> there

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
game you know later in the game there

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.500 
game you know later in the game there
was<00:04:33.270> one<00:04:33.480> on<00:04:33.630> their<00:04:33.900> side<00:04:34.169> line<00:04:35.240> where<00:04:36.240> they

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
was one on their side line where they

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.360 
was one on their side line where they
kind<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.870> rolled<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.290> coverage<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.890> Brandon

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
kind of rolled the coverage to Brandon

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.030 
kind of rolled the coverage to Brandon
in<00:04:38.520> that<00:04:38.669> situation<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:40.020> they<00:04:40.500> pressured

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
in that situation and and they pressured

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.830 
in that situation and and they pressured
him<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.580> he<00:04:41.700> had<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:42.090> throw<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.450> ball<00:04:42.600> out<00:04:42.810> of

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
him so he had to throw the ball out of

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.510 
him so he had to throw the ball out of
bounds<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.500> mean<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.710> was<00:04:43.800> just<00:04:43.979> the<00:04:44.070> throwaway

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
bounds I mean it was just the throwaway

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.790 
bounds I mean it was just the throwaway
ball<00:04:44.790> at<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.120> point<00:04:45.390> if<00:04:45.690> he<00:04:46.020> forced<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.560> have

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
ball at that point if he forced it have

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.400 
ball at that point if he forced it have
been<00:04:46.919> an<00:04:47.010> interception
