mean

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
mean

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.320 
mean
use<00:00:15.920> the<00:00:16.070> tree<00:00:16.250> climbing<00:00:16.520> or<00:00:16.820> other<00:00:16.910> vertical

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
use the tree climbing or other vertical

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.760 
use the tree climbing or other vertical
applications<00:00:17.450> it's<00:00:17.990> basically<00:00:18.410> an

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
applications it's basically an

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.670 
applications it's basically an
adjustable<00:00:19.430> Daisy<00:00:20.140> make<00:00:21.140> it<00:00:21.290> on<00:00:21.380> the<00:00:21.470> cheap

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
adjustable Daisy make it on the cheap

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.519 
adjustable Daisy make it on the cheap
big<00:00:22.490> fan<00:00:22.700> that<00:00:22.730> sort<00:00:23.180> of<00:00:23.240> stuff<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.020> here<00:00:24.349> this

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
big fan that sort of stuff so here this

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.280 
big fan that sort of stuff so here this

adjustable Daisy rustic whatever

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.950 
adjustable Daisy rustic whatever
basically<00:00:32.870> it's<00:00:33.650> a<00:00:34.510> big<00:00:35.510> loop<00:00:35.750> tied<00:00:36.170> with<00:00:36.559> a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
basically it's a big loop tied with a

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.630 
basically it's a big loop tied with a
size<00:00:38.960> triple<00:00:39.470> fishermen<00:00:39.890> because<00:00:40.010> I<00:00:40.220> plan<00:00:40.610> on

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
size triple fishermen because I plan on

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.119 
size triple fishermen because I plan on
not<00:00:40.910> on<00:00:41.059> time<00:00:41.300> this<00:00:41.540> at<00:00:41.690> all<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.050> we<00:00:42.769> hanging

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
not on time this at all and we hanging

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.700 
not on time this at all and we hanging
directly<00:00:43.519> on<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:46.070> then<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:48.320> loop<00:00:48.500> comes

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
directly on it and then the loop comes

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.789 
directly on it and then the loop comes
around<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.430> it<00:00:49.519> ties<00:00:49.729> a<00:00:50.229> three<00:00:51.229> wrap<00:00:51.409> rustic

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
around and it ties a three wrap rustic

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.210 
around and it ties a three wrap rustic
on<00:00:51.920> itself<00:00:52.720> the<00:00:53.720> other<00:00:53.930> end<00:00:54.229> you<00:00:54.710> girth<00:00:55.010> hitch

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
on itself the other end you girth hitch

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.509 
on itself the other end you girth hitch
on<00:00:55.549> to<00:00:55.970> your<00:00:56.510> harness<00:00:56.720> or<00:00:57.379> whatever<00:00:58.190> else<00:00:58.400> you

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
on to your harness or whatever else you

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.340 
on to your harness or whatever else you
need<00:00:58.549> put<00:00:59.390> on<00:00:59.600> you<00:00:59.780> can<00:00:59.930> use<00:01:00.049> this<00:01:00.170> for

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
need put on you can use this for

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.549 
need put on you can use this for
adjusting<00:01:00.739> hammocks<00:01:01.190> or<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.900> nice<00:01:02.900> easy

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
adjusting hammocks or a nice easy

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.060 
adjustable
swing<00:01:06.860> basically<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.500> usually<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:09.619> girth<00:01:09.890> it

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
swing basically so usually you girth it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.100 
swing basically so usually you girth it
to<00:01:10.190> this<00:01:10.310> end<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:10.880> your<00:01:11.000> harness<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.570> put<00:01:12.080> a

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
to this end to your harness and put a

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:22.170 
to this end to your harness and put a
carabiner<00:01:12.710> on<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.760> other<00:01:13.939> side

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.780 

slide<00:01:23.180> oppressor<00:01:23.540> cover<00:01:23.900> unity<00:01:24.710> problem<00:01:25.640> is

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
slide oppressor cover unity problem is

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.950 
slide oppressor cover unity problem is
you<00:01:26.630> end<00:01:26.780> up<00:01:26.810> carrying<00:01:27.110> more<00:01:27.439> rope<00:01:27.740> than<00:01:28.960> you

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
you end up carrying more rope than you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.990 
you end up carrying more rope than you
really<00:01:30.229> you<00:01:30.290> don't<00:01:30.440> get<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.560> lot<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.820> links<00:01:31.820> out

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
really you don't get a lot of links out

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.060 
really you don't get a lot of links out
of<00:01:32.150> this<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.080> total<00:01:33.290> length<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:33.740> this<00:01:33.920> you

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
of this so the total length is this you

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.670 
of this so the total length is this you
can<00:01:34.190> only<00:01:34.280> adjuster<00:01:34.700> passes<00:01:35.149> along<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.080> it's

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
can only adjuster passes along so it's

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.660 
can only adjuster passes along so it's
not<00:01:36.890> that<00:01:38.049> efficient<00:01:39.049> put<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.740> rope<00:01:39.950> it's<00:01:40.549> not

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
not that efficient put the rope it's not

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.130 
not that efficient put the rope it's not
about<00:01:40.789> doing<00:01:40.909> other<00:01:41.180> things<00:01:41.299> just<00:01:41.479> closing

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
about doing other things just closing

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.109 
about doing other things just closing
the<00:01:42.259> carabiner<00:01:42.680> on<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.250> middle<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.610> a<00:01:43.789> long

the carabiner on to the middle of a long

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.910 
the carabiner on to the middle of a long
piece<00:01:44.360> of<00:01:44.390> rope<00:01:44.570> a<00:01:44.720> single<00:01:44.990> piece<00:01:45.140> seems<00:01:45.740> like

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
piece of rope a single piece seems like

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.889 
piece of rope a single piece seems like
that<00:01:46.070> will<00:01:46.220> work<00:01:46.340> fine<00:01:46.580> put<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.360> stop<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.750> on

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
that will work fine put a stop and on

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.210 
that will work fine put a stop and on
the<00:01:48.080> end<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:50.470> alleviate<00:01:51.470> any<00:01:51.500> problems<00:01:52.070> from

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
the end to alleviate any problems from

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.770 
the end to alleviate any problems from
slipping<00:01:52.759> on<00:01:53.030> your<00:01:53.180> load<00:01:53.330> because<00:01:53.600> the

slipping on your load because the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.809 
slipping on your load because the
coalface<00:01:54.259> will<00:01:54.500> slip<00:01:54.710> on<00:01:54.800> your<00:01:54.920> load<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.369> lot<00:01:55.729> of

coalface will slip on your load a lot of

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.010 
coalface will slip on your load a lot of
