 [Music] 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.849
 hello to all girls thanks for being 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.400
 with me if today you want to spend 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.860
 of this makeup to this including the 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.810
 combed stay with me to see the step 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.090
 step by step to achieve this makeup that 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.640
 it's daily we're going to start applying 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.189
 a test is seen for the entire face 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.320
 for our makeup to be fixed 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.719
 all day and last us longer 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.820
 as they see from the body shop and I'm going to 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.410
 apply in the area of ​​the nose that is 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.660
 where I get more shine because I have 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.910
 mixed skin I get a lot of shine there 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.629
 so let's control this a bit 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.629
 with the 1st 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.460
 and now let's apply is bicrim to me 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.320
 I like something light in the day you know 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.200
 that is so love and I'm going to apply 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.120
 with this double fiber brush and let's 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.430
 do as taps first and now 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.620
 then we blur towards everything that is 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.800
 send out of our face to 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.640
 achieve a natural finish and so we 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.030
 we go with the whole face 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.860
 and I ended up with a little product left 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.930
 now let's correct the ojera I'm going to 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.300
 use this concealer in hd of the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.860
 figurine in porcelain shade we are going to 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.470
 apply it as a triangle 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.150
 over the ojera to illuminate also and 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.550
 that does not remain that effect as of dominates 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.530
 bimbo then we are also going to apply it 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.660
 on the nose and a little on the forehead 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.820
 I will use my finger to blur 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.830
 because I want that practical look 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.500
 that is something for you to recreate 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.830
 easily and as you see it is superfluous 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.470
 fast and you can see very illuminated at those 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.210
 areas and that looks very cute 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.859
 [Music] 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.500
 Now let's seal everything with this powder 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.270
 of prose that are in translucent tone 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.640
 it's a transparent powder is not going to give 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.679
 color I apply it there in the cap and with 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.750
 a brush but before I like to remove 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.250
 as it is excess of corrector in these 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.170
 lines that I believe that 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.539
 naturally I have them since I was little 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.610
 I have then we are going to prevent it from 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.760
 do by removing the concealer and then 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.990
 sealing 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.330
 [Music] 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.210
 and also on the nose where we apply 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.420
 like light colored cheeses where are we going to 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.420
 to illuminate 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.910
 and with a bigger brush that you are 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.670
 profusion let's also take the same 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.830
 dust and we're going to apply it on all the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.730
 face and it's going to be less quantity 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.319
 [Music] 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.629
 and we are going with the lips we are going to apply 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.019
 a lip balm this is from the body 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.870
 shop and it smells very very rich so let's go 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.260
 to apply it apply the one you want 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.390
 [Music] 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.579
 and now let's brush the eyebrows 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.370
 I want to remove the dust or makeup that 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.040
 may have fallen there we go with this 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.129
 kit that I bought it in the center is the 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.870
 tone 4 and with a bevelled brush I'll 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.310
 start to mark my eyebrows I use the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.560
 lighter tone because I want me to 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.680
 is a very natural look that is not noticed 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.930
 as well as that leaves them very marked 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.239
 [Music] 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.880
 with a transparent gel I'm 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.710
 saying 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.980
 now let's go with the bronzer I'm going to 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.720
 use this from the body shop and it's a 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.400
 natural tone I love I like 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.830
 use it with this fan brush what 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.810
 I apply on those where it should be 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.570
 mark the cheekbone and a little bit towards 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.440
 up with this blush palette this is 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.680
 the tone 2 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.910
 let's use the lighter tone 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.200
 pigment a lot so with little 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.030
 amount reaches me for two 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.340
 cheeks as you can see I like that 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.800
 he wants natural and juba and he blurs very 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.410
 well as they see and we are the color so 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.270
 That color is super nice I love it 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.410
 there you can see the one in the palette and my 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.170
 cheeks 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.420
 let's go with the shadow first and I'll 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.580
 use this different color I apply 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.580
 especially the eyelid and blends 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.209
 I will use this quartet of surfing and 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.819
 I'll apply the clearest tone 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.239
 over the basin we're going to mark a little 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.239
 the eye 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.709
 now I go with this shadow of body shop and 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.840
 it's a sector we're not going to use the tone 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.090
 more clarito there you can see the tones I'm going 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.940
 to use the most clarito with my finger what 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.669
 I apply like to pats and on camera not 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.799
 It shows a lot but it looks very nice I take 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.900
 this dark tone to create depth 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.600
 and in the basin to mark more of the eye 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.600
 with this broach we are going to blur it 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.539
 and now like this vanilla shadow and a 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.629
 flat clean brush let's clean 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.520
 our eyebrows and blurs we go with the 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.979
 eyeliner and in this case to use 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.479
 this one of l aquila that is in groupon 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.039
 but it's very chubby so I do not know 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.650
 scare it is not complicated to do the 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.840
 delineated and I'm going to do it quite 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.840
 natural with ball to lengthen the eye 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.669
 and I'm going to apply the dark shadows in 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.050
 the bottom part to frame the 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.569
 lower lashes 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.370
 and the pink tone I'm applying it in 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.409
 what is the part of the tear to 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.810
 remove I'm going with this mask that I 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.060
 love to sing me the brush so it will be 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.830
 the one you usually use applies two or three 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.580
 layers whatever you want 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:25.510
 today with this color fight lipstick that 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.000
 it's a crayon let's say like a balm 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.070
 but pigment a lot I love them you know 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.750
 that I have the whole collection so 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.240
 I'm using this a coffee tone 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.770
 that normally I would not use but good 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.760
 I cheered up and that's how the 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:43.030
 makeup now we go with the hair and 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.150
 let's drop a little bit is already brushed 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.640
 it is important to understand our dog and 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.250
 apply a heat protector that you 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.380
 like the one that sees you the most for all the 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.080
 hair let's divide it also and 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:03.330
 let's leave a part below 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:05.819
 [Music] 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.090
 let's take small millions like 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.680
 you know that part hair then I do not know 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.659
 they will notice how many curls 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.289
 but already with all the hair you will notice 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.289
 quite 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.409
 so here I'm doing everything for the 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.289
 part of the neck so you do not go to 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:25.080
 see there how not 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.849
 and straight hair we're not going to go all the 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.770
 head marking those seen but not 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.199
 are very marked 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.419
 and so I'm going, do not go back and forth 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.639
 in the front as I have the 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:38.449
 Longer strands of light will notice 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.449
 smoother 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.459
 [Music] 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.050
 and well we are already in the top 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.599
 as there are already a lot more notes 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.089
 curls not like when I started and these 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:56.499
 they always go out in this case 

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:58.270
 I'm doing like that curls more 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:00.520
 stuck to the roots because it is 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.669
 liking a lot like I have hair 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.589
 short so you can notice I have to do 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:07.569
 the almost from the root very carefully 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:10.050
 of not getting burned because it 's horrible when 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:10.050
 you burn 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:20.789
 [Music] 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.220
 and since we have finished the hair by 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:25.680
 there I see some rest that I do not like 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.690
 so what I do is mark a little 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.520
 more especially these that go to the front 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.500
 because they frame like the face 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.669
 then it is important because it is that they are 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.669
 more beautiful and defined 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:39.919
 just steps for one more time but 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.860
 who is already ready looks prettier 

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:44.809
 people I like and it is now our 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.659
 hair ready already and I'm accommodating 

00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:49.699
 a little and well thank you very much for watching 

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:53.469
 girls, I hope you liked it a lot 

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:53.469
