00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.180 
thought
apple<00:03:31.660> juice<00:03:31.840> would<00:03:32.200> look<00:03:32.710> a<00:03:32.830> little<00:03:32.950> more

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
apple juice would look a little more

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.750 
apple juice would look a little more
realistic<00:03:34.050> instead<00:03:35.050> of<00:03:35.140> water<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:36.610> this

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
realistic instead of water and this

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.970 
realistic instead of water and this
apple<00:03:37.030> juice<00:03:37.180> is<00:03:37.420> 40%<00:03:37.810> less<00:03:38.170> sugar<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:38.650> yeah<00:03:38.830> it

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
apple juice is 40% less sugar so yeah it

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.440 
apple juice is 40% less sugar so yeah it
is<00:03:39.100> not<00:03:39.310> as<00:03:39.490> yellow<00:03:39.910> as<00:03:40.120> regular<00:03:41.020> apple<00:03:41.530> juice

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
is not as yellow as regular apple juice

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.880 
is not as yellow as regular apple juice
