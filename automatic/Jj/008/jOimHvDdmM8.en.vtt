00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
toss which was like the mime toss book

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.750 
toss which was like the mime toss book
basically<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:09.920> time<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.220> took<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.550> clown

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
basically this time you took the clown

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.790 
basically this time you took the clown
into<00:01:11.120> explosive<00:01:11.630> bowels<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.080> you've<00:01:12.560> got<00:01:12.680> the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
into explosive bowels and you've got the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.560

hot<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.070> cold<00:01:13.130> mode<00:01:13.550> which<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:13.880> personally<00:01:14.510> I

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
hot and cold mode which is personally I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.720 
hot and cold mode which is personally I
think<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.900> best<00:01:15.080> new<00:01:15.320> single<00:01:15.680> blow<00:01:15.800> more<00:01:16.040> I'll

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
think the best new single blow more I'll

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.070 
think the best new single blow more I'll
choose<00:01:17.030> one<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.330> new<00:01:17.450> characters<00:01:17.900> as<00:01:18.050> well

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
choose one of the new characters as well

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.380 
choose one of the new characters as well
but<00:01:19.040> basically<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.730> whole<00:01:19.850> point<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.150> hot<00:01:20.270> and

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
but basically the whole point of hot and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.360 
but basically the whole point of hot and
cold<00:01:20.450> what<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:20.960> its<00:01:21.230> like<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:21.710> well<00:01:22.130> it's<00:01:22.250> like

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
cold what is its like the well it's like

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.100 
cold what is its like the well it's like
the<00:01:22.490> old<00:01:22.580> gear<00:01:22.880> mark<00:01:23.180> or<00:01:23.360> port<00:01:23.570> I<00:01:23.780> think<00:01:23.990> it's

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
the old gear mark or port I think it's

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.470 
the old gear mark or port I think it's
warmer<00:01:24.500> cooler<00:01:24.940> basically<00:01:25.940> you<00:01:26.060> get<00:01:26.180> five

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.620 
you like freezing a heart just stuff
like<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:34.280> lot<00:01:34.430> like<00:01:34.940> instead<00:01:35.180> of<00:01:35.360> seeing

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
like that a lot like instead of seeing

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.450 
like that a lot like instead of seeing
stalling<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:36.230> just<00:01:36.410> says<00:01:36.590> burning<00:01:37.100> hot<00:01:37.250> like

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
stalling it just says burning hot like

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.430 
stalling it just says burning hot like
that<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:38.210> I'm<00:01:38.300> obviously<00:01:38.450> close<00:01:38.900> to<00:01:39.080> it<00:01:39.200> but<00:01:39.410> I

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
that so I'm obviously close to it but I

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.140 
that so I'm obviously close to it but I
don't<00:01:39.560> know<00:01:39.860> which<00:01:39.980> one<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.250> is<00:01:40.370> so<00:01:41.000> that<00:01:41.120> I

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
don't know which one it is so that I

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.850 
don't know which one it is so that I
have<00:01:41.300> to<00:01:41.390> reset<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.960> after<00:01:42.170> try<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:42.470> find<00:01:42.680> it

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
have to reset and after try and find it

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.310 
have to reset and after try and find it
as<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.670> say<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:43.910> get<00:01:44.210> five<00:01:44.450> shots<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.900> find<00:01:45.140> it

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
as I say you get five shots to find it

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.110 
as I say you get five shots to find it
and<00:01:45.350> if<00:01:45.620> you<00:01:45.710> do<00:01:45.860> find<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.340> then<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.610> resets<00:01:46.970> the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
and if you do find it then it resets the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.180 
and if you do find it then it resets the
target<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:47.690> resetting<00:01:48.140> shots<00:01:48.410> you<00:01:48.950> get

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
target and resetting shots you get

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.590 
target and resetting shots you get
another<00:01:49.370> chance<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.850> find<00:01:50.060> any<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.330> target

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
another chance to find any of a target

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.690 
another chance to find any of a target
so<00:01:51.440> that's<00:01:51.620> pretty<00:01:52.070> damn<00:01:52.280> close

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
so that's pretty damn close

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.580 
so that's pretty damn close
see<00:01:53.969> her<00:01:54.060> Percy<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.630> be<00:01:54.750> fear<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.170> new<00:01:55.350> ones

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
see her Percy to be fear at the new ones
