00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.650 

alright<00:00:15.549> let's<00:00:15.759> zoom<00:00:15.940> in<00:00:16.059> a<00:00:16.119> bit<00:00:16.150> by<00:00:16.360> holding

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
alright let's zoom in a bit by holding

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.210 
alright let's zoom in a bit by holding
alt<00:00:16.810> and<00:00:17.080> just<00:00:17.260> scrolling<00:00:17.620> in<00:00:17.830> with<00:00:17.950> the<00:00:18.040> mouse

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
alt and just scrolling in with the mouse

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.700 
alt and just scrolling in with the mouse
wheel<00:00:18.430> and<00:00:18.790> now<00:00:19.360> we<00:00:19.420> have<00:00:19.660> our<00:00:19.780> HDR<00:00:20.380> image<00:00:20.530> on

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
wheel and now we have our HDR image on

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.320 
wheel and now we have our HDR image on
top<00:00:20.830> once<00:00:21.460> again<00:00:21.700> just<00:00:21.880> because<00:00:21.940> the<00:00:22.180> way<00:00:22.300> we

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
top once again just because the way we

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.940 
top once again just because the way we
selected<00:00:22.840> when<00:00:22.990> we<00:00:23.140> brought<00:00:23.500> them<00:00:23.650> in<00:00:23.830> and

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
selected when we brought them in and

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.770 
selected when we brought them in and
then<00:00:24.040> we're<00:00:24.730> going<00:00:24.820> to<00:00:24.940> just<00:00:25.090> tone<00:00:25.330> this<00:00:25.540> back

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
then we're going to just tone this back

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.020 
then we're going to just tone this back
so<00:00:26.050> again<00:00:26.320> bring<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.710> opacity<00:00:26.950> down<00:00:27.220> until<00:00:27.940> we

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 
so again bring the opacity down until we

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.600 
so again bring the opacity down until we
get<00:00:28.150> a<00:00:28.180> nice<00:00:28.450> subtle<00:00:29.110> look<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.860> our<00:00:29.980> HR<00:00:30.310> image

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
get a nice subtle look to our HR image

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.000 
get a nice subtle look to our HR image
and<00:00:30.850> the<00:00:31.420> only<00:00:31.600> thing<00:00:31.720> with<00:00:31.990> this<00:00:32.230> is<00:00:32.500> that<00:00:32.800> in

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
and the only thing with this is that in

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.980 
and the only thing with this is that in
this<00:00:33.670> particular<00:00:33.850> image<00:00:34.360> I<00:00:34.510> actually<00:00:34.630> want<00:00:34.900> to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
this particular image I actually want to

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.920 
this particular image I actually want to
retain<00:00:35.320> all<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:36.130> HDR<00:00:36.550> or<00:00:36.880> at<00:00:37.390> least<00:00:37.600> eighty

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
retain all of the HDR or at least eighty

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.260 
retain all of the HDR or at least eighty
percent<00:00:38.170> of<00:00:38.440> it<00:00:38.590> when<00:00:39.160> it<00:00:39.280> comes<00:00:39.489> to<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.940> sky

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
percent of it when it comes to the sky

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.490 
percent of it when it comes to the sky
and<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:40.720> know<00:00:40.810> what<00:00:40.930> I'm<00:00:41.050> going<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.230> go<00:00:41.320> up<00:00:41.410> to

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
and you know what I'm going to go up to

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.860 
and you know what I'm going to go up to
ninety<00:00:41.860> percent<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:43.030> we're<00:00:43.180> retaining<00:00:43.420> almost

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
ninety percent so we're retaining almost

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.840 
ninety percent so we're retaining almost
all<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.290> sky<00:00:44.470> detail<00:00:44.920> only<00:00:45.280> showing<00:00:45.489> ten

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
all the sky detail only showing ten

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.580 
all the sky detail only showing ten
percent<00:00:46.270> of<00:00:46.470> basically<00:00:47.470> the<00:00:47.560> underlying

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
percent of basically the underlying

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.280 
percent of basically the underlying
image<00:00:48.160> but<00:00:48.610> for<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.480> rocks<00:00:49.750> and<00:00:50.020> for<00:00:50.170> really

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
image but for the rocks and for really

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.799 
image but for the rocks and for really
everything<00:00:50.770> else<00:00:50.950> I<00:00:51.160> want<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.550> retain<00:00:51.910> mostly

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
everything else I want to retain mostly

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.040 
everything else I want to retain mostly
the<00:00:53.790> basically<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:54.880> original<00:00:55.239> image<00:00:55.329> so

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
the basically the original image so

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.389 
the basically the original image so
here's<00:00:56.260> we're<00:00:56.380> going<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:56.559> do<00:00:56.710> we're<00:00:57.160> going<00:00:57.309> to

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
here's we're going to do we're going to

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.729 
here's we're going to do we're going to
grab<00:00:57.700> our<00:00:58.059> layer<00:00:58.630> mask<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.230> instead<00:00:59.590> of

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
grab our layer mask and instead of

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.709 
grab our layer mask and instead of
basically<00:01:00.280> dropping<00:01:00.730> in<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:01.030> blank<00:01:01.329> layer<00:01:01.510> mask

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
basically dropping in a blank layer mask

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.120 
basically dropping in a blank layer mask
i'm<00:01:01.870> going<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.050> hold<00:01:02.110> down<00:01:02.230> alt<00:01:02.440> or<00:01:02.770> option<00:01:02.950> on

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
i'm going to hold down alt or option on

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.310 
i'm going to hold down alt or option on
a<00:01:03.190> Mac<00:01:03.399> click<00:01:04.089> layer<00:01:04.390> mask<00:01:04.659> so<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:04.930> comes<00:01:05.110> in

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
a Mac click layer mask so it comes in

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.039 
a Mac click layer mask so it comes in
basically<00:01:05.620> completely<00:01:06.159> black<00:01:06.790> okay<00:01:07.750> now

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
basically completely black okay now

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.990 
basically completely black okay now
we're<00:01:08.260> just<00:01:08.290> going<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:08.560> grab<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.799> brush<00:01:09.159> I'm

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
we're just going to grab a brush I'm

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.570 
we're just going to grab a brush I'm
going<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.210> shrink<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.630> size<00:01:10.870> of<00:01:11.049> this<00:01:11.170> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
going to shrink the size of this and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.039 
going to shrink the size of this and
then<00:01:12.580> we're<00:01:12.700> going<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:12.850> paint<00:01:13.180> white<00:01:13.570> in<00:01:13.780> in

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
then we're going to paint white in in

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.750 
then we're going to paint white in in
the<00:01:14.170> area<00:01:14.470> that<00:01:14.590> we<00:01:14.650> want<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:14.950> actually<00:01:15.070> reveal

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
the area that we want to actually reveal

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.340 
the area that we want to actually reveal
now<00:01:16.450> I'm<00:01:16.540> going<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.720> paint<00:01:16.900> this<00:01:17.020> in<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.229> one

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
now I'm going to paint this in a one

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.810 
now I'm going to paint this in a one
hundred<00:01:17.560> percent<00:01:17.590> opacity<00:01:17.860> but<00:01:18.369> making<00:01:18.670> sure

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
hundred percent opacity but making sure

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.760 
hundred percent opacity but making sure
my<00:01:19.000> brush<00:01:19.299> hardness<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:19.840> down<00:01:20.020> at<00:01:20.140> zero<00:01:20.500> and

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
my brush hardness is down at zero and

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.830 
my brush hardness is down at zero and
we're<00:01:21.310> going<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.549> paints<00:01:21.850> in<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.060> sky<00:01:22.299> and<00:01:22.600> again

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
we're going to paints in a sky and again

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.560 
we're going to paints in a sky and again
that's<00:01:22.990> painting<00:01:23.440> in<00:01:23.729> ninety<00:01:24.729> percent<00:01:24.909> of<00:01:25.270> our

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
that's painting in ninety percent of our

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.820 
that's painting in ninety percent of our
HDR<00:01:26.200> file<00:01:26.409> alright<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.869> you<00:01:28.960> can<00:01:29.080> see<00:01:29.260> how<00:01:29.439> easy

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
HDR file alright so you can see how easy

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.160 
HDR file alright so you can see how easy
that<00:01:29.979> actually<00:01:30.549> was<00:01:30.760> with<00:01:31.479> images<00:01:31.900> like<00:01:32.020> this

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
that actually was with images like this

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.350 
that actually was with images like this
that<00:01:32.380> have<00:01:32.470> very<00:01:32.799> strong<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.610> simple<00:01:33.760> horizon

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
that have very strong and simple horizon

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.539 
that have very strong and simple horizon
lines<00:01:34.570> this<00:01:35.229> blending<00:01:35.680> technique<00:01:36.070> is

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
lines this blending technique is

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.250 
lines this blending technique is
actually<00:01:36.939> very<00:01:36.970> very<00:01:37.570> simple<00:01:37.869> because<00:01:38.110> we

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
actually very very simple because we

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.690 
actually very very simple because we
don't<00:01:38.409> to<00:01:38.500> worry<00:01:38.740> about<00:01:38.890> really<00:01:39.220> anything<00:01:39.460> on

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
don't to worry about really anything on

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.600 
don't to worry about really anything on
the<00:01:39.760> horizon<00:01:40.500> that's<00:01:41.500> kind<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.010> jutting<00:01:42.490> out

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
the horizon that's kind of jutting out

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.429 
the horizon that's kind of jutting out
essentially<00:01:43.299> all<00:01:43.900> right<00:01:44.049> so<00:01:44.170> I'm<00:01:44.229> just<00:01:44.320> going

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
essentially all right so I'm just going

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.620 
essentially all right so I'm just going
to<00:01:44.530> remove<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> little<00:01:45.070> bit<00:01:45.250> from

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
to remove it a little bit from

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.850 
to remove it a little bit from
underneath<00:01:46.630> just<00:01:47.020> kind<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.259> refine<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.650> little

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
underneath just kind of refine a little

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.320 
underneath just kind of refine a little
bit<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.369> other<00:01:48.549> way<00:01:48.640> you<00:01:48.700> can<00:01:48.909> do<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.180> as

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
bit the other way you can do this as

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.600 
bit the other way you can do this as
well<00:01:49.509> is<00:01:49.570> by<00:01:49.930> doing<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.200> Grady<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.799> graduate

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
well is by doing a Grady a graduate

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.249 
well is by doing a Grady a graduate
brush<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.509> can<00:01:52.630> also<00:01:52.750> do<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:52.960> exact<00:01:53.229> same

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
brush so I can also do the exact same

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.140 
brush so I can also do the exact same
things<00:01:53.740> by<00:01:53.920> pulling<00:01:54.280> down<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.430> sky<00:01:54.820> and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
things by pulling down the sky and

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.969 
things by pulling down the sky and
actually<00:01:56.049> I<00:01:56.080> need<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.320> go<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.500> other<00:01:56.560> way<00:01:56.740> and

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
actually I need to go the other way and

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.999 
actually I need to go the other way and
basically<00:01:57.729> we're<00:01:57.909> just<00:01:57.939> revealing

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
basically we're just revealing

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.880 
basically we're just revealing
underneath<00:02:00.009> using<00:02:00.430> this<00:02:00.520> graduated<00:02:01.119> mask<00:02:01.360> or

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
underneath using this graduated mask or

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.980 
underneath using this graduated mask or
kind<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:02.979> graduate<00:02:03.340> paintbrush<00:02:03.790> all<00:02:04.689> right<00:02:04.810> so

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
kind of graduate paintbrush all right so

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.960 
kind of graduate paintbrush all right so
it's<00:02:05.200> also<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.500> really<00:02:05.770> nice<00:02:05.920> way<00:02:06.189> to<00:02:06.250> do<00:02:06.850> it

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
it's also a really nice way to do it

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.950 
it's also a really nice way to do it
because<00:02:07.150> it<00:02:07.240> creates<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.570> very<00:02:07.720> subtle

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
because it creates a very subtle

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.169 
because it creates a very subtle
transition<00:02:08.280> between<00:02:09.280> these<00:02:09.489> two<00:02:09.610> effects<00:02:09.970> and

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
transition between these two effects and

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.970 
transition between these two effects and
we<00:02:10.270> can<00:02:10.390> even<00:02:10.509> refine<00:02:11.020> that<00:02:11.230> by<00:02:11.770> simply

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
we can even refine that by simply

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.440 
we can even refine that by simply
grabbing<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.520> brush<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.000> then<00:02:13.030> painting

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
grabbing the brush and then painting

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.160 
grabbing the brush and then painting
over<00:02:13.720> certain

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
over certain

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.250 
over certain
is<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:14.980> we<00:02:15.099> don't<00:02:15.280> want<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.819> have<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.930> HDR

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
is that we don't want to have the HDR

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.080 
is that we don't want to have the HDR
look<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.680> them<00:02:17.830> all<00:02:18.520> right<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:18.910> is

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
look to them all right so this is

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.370 
look to them all right so this is
actually<00:02:19.239> looking<00:02:19.569> pretty<00:02:19.630> solid<00:02:20.110> now<00:02:20.230> let's

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
actually looking pretty solid now let's

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.900 
actually looking pretty solid now let's
take<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.560> look<00:02:20.800> let's<00:02:20.830> see<00:02:21.220> if<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.430> blend

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
take a look let's see if that blend

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.820 
take a look let's see if that blend
looks<00:02:22.180> good<00:02:22.420> we<00:02:22.989> might<00:02:23.170> want<00:02:23.319> to<00:02:23.410> tone<00:02:23.560> back

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
looks good we might want to tone back

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.100 
looks good we might want to tone back
the<00:02:23.980> blend<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.340> little<00:02:24.370> bit<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.720> maybe<00:02:25.750> up<00:02:26.080> to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
the blend a little bit so maybe up to

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.720 
the blend a little bit so maybe up to
like<00:02:26.349> eighty<00:02:26.739> percent<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:27.400> probably<00:02:27.670> a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
like eighty percent it's probably a

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.699 
like eighty percent it's probably a
better<00:02:27.940> number<00:02:28.180> than<00:02:28.360> 90<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.260> give<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.470> a

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
better number than 90 just to give it a

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.740 
better number than 90 just to give it a
little<00:02:30.220> more<00:02:30.489> of<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.640> natural<00:02:30.819> look<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.239> that

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
little more of a natural look to that

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.170 
little more of a natural look to that
blend<00:02:32.140> all<00:02:32.980> right<00:02:33.130> from<00:02:33.400> this<00:02:33.550> point<00:02:33.910> we<00:02:34.150> are

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
blend all right from this point we are

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.559 
blend all right from this point we are
essentially<00:02:34.989> done<00:02:35.230> with<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:36.569> photoshop

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
essentially done with the photoshop

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.500 
essentially done with the photoshop
processing<00:02:38.080> i<00:02:38.200> might<00:02:38.470> wanted<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:38.860> see<00:02:39.100> min<00:02:39.310> or

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
processing i might wanted to see min or

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.430 
processing i might wanted to see min or
basically<00:02:40.510> just<00:02:40.750> check<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:40.989> make<00:02:41.140> sure<00:02:41.290> I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
basically just check to make sure I

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.330 
basically just check to make sure I
don't<00:02:41.560> have<00:02:41.800> anything<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.130> want<00:02:42.220> to

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
don't have anything that I want to

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.949 
don't have anything that I want to
photoshop<00:02:42.910> out<00:02:43.090> make<00:02:43.420> sure<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.569> don't<00:02:43.660> have<00:02:43.840> any

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
photoshop out make sure I don't have any

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.930 
photoshop out make sure I don't have any
retouch<00:02:44.290> items<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:45.190> let's<00:02:45.340> hit<00:02:45.489> alt<00:02:45.700> ctrl

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
retouch items so let's hit alt ctrl

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.140 
retouch items so let's hit alt ctrl
shift<00:02:46.180> e<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:46.989> that's<00:02:47.500> option<00:02:48.010> command<00:02:48.580> shifty

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
shift e and that's option command shifty

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.390 
shift e and that's option command shifty
on<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.330> Mac<00:02:49.600> let's<00:02:50.470> zoom<00:02:50.769> in<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.160> check<00:02:51.310> this

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
on a Mac let's zoom in and check this

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.670 
on a Mac let's zoom in and check this
out<00:02:51.610> this<00:02:52.239> cloud<00:02:52.720> right<00:02:52.930> here<00:02:53.140> or<00:02:53.319> whatever

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
out this cloud right here or whatever

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.170 
out this cloud right here or whatever
this<00:02:53.830> is<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.160> might<00:02:54.280> actually<00:02:54.489> even<00:02:55.030> be<00:02:55.150> a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
this is it might actually even be a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.880 
this is it might actually even be a
piece<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.450> dust<00:02:55.600> or<00:02:56.049> something<00:02:56.140> on<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.530> camera

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
piece of dust or something on the camera

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.670 
piece of dust or something on the camera
it<00:02:57.130> looks<00:02:57.730> kind<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:57.970> like<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.120> birdie<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.680> it's

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
it looks kind of like a birdie and it's

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.710 
it looks kind of like a birdie and it's
kind<00:02:59.739> of<00:02:59.950> distracted<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:01.120> let's<00:03:01.299> subtract

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
kind of distracted so let's subtract

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.420 
kind of distracted so let's subtract
this<00:03:01.870> guy<00:03:02.049> out<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:02.560> see<00:03:02.799> a<00:03:02.830> defaults

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
this guy out and you can see a defaults

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.039 
this guy out and you can see a defaults
back<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.790> our<00:03:03.910> previous<00:03:04.330> brush<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.900> we're

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
back to our previous brush that we're

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.199 
back to our previous brush that we're
using<00:03:05.170> which<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:06.160> great<00:03:06.400> because<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.819> gives<00:03:06.850> us

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
using which is great because it gives us

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.809 
using which is great because it gives us
that<00:03:07.360> nice<00:03:07.660> natural<00:03:08.500> look<00:03:08.709> when<00:03:09.640> we're

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
that nice natural look when we're

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.620 
that nice natural look when we're
retouching<00:03:10.630> that<00:03:10.750> object<00:03:11.200> out<00:03:11.850> all<00:03:12.850> right

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
retouching that object out all right

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.600 
retouching that object out all right

zoom across the sky I don't really see

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.180 
zoom across the sky I don't really see
