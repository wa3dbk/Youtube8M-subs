00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.260

 good and a very happy year me 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.550
 personally I have contempt for 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.800
 resolutions for 2014 finally apart 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.720
 maybe too late maybe organize 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.380
 a thigh show but that's another 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.970
 question 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 laurent I took a lot of good 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.200
 resolutions for my youtube channel because 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.510
 that I'm not publishing regularly 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.610
 enjoys losing reviewed that I have first he 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.320
 is very very long ago and especially I 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.670
 do not have a blog yet a very request 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.719
 often if I have a blog and I tell myself that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.690
 it could be pretty good that I 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.190
 take care of my facebook page 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.110
 and then also I intend to diversify a 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.930
 little the content of my channel and I say to myself 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.840
 why not make videos hall but 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.030
 which touches on beauty or 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.399
 clothes and why not also do 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.930
 many videos for a tome 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.439
 thank you because that's all that's 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.750
 thanks to you 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.850
 there on youtube the 7000 then you know 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.410
 and integrates a device over 1500 and 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.480
 it's really huge 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.520
 so I wanted to do a little bit 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.650
 redesign of my channel really in 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.630
 depth and everything is organized for 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.270
 really can bring you a little 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.350
 more content and especially content from 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.770
 highest quality 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.990
 that's why I've already started 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.500
 by buying lighting so there by 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.420
 example it is it is 23h and I can 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.310
 finally shoot videos at my place 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.229
 quiet and shut up while waiting 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.030
 that they spend the sunbeam 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.160
 now that it's raining that he's selling or 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.600
 it snows can finally make videos 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.940
 so now no more excuse 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.860
 and that's all I'm telling you 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.630
 in fact for this new year 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.180

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.680
