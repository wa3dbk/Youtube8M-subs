00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.130

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.110

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.690

 ward how back we are going to enter the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.790
 module we go to versions and download 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.960
 the most recent now 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.650
 the following to remove the advertising 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.620
 from youtube as it will be youtube 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.750
 huawei 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.370
 I think it 's the youtube space 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.620
 way we go to the version 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.850
 most recent we will give it in download 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.000
 and we activate both modules we go for that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.880
 let's go to modules 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 and we are going to activate both modules in the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.150
 pac with this popcorn and we're going to 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.310
 restart our android device 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.920
 once we restart it 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.360
 so let's go into the first 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.360
 module that is my lingua 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.780
 as you can see he is going to load us all 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.560
 the applications that we have installed 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.540
 in our system 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.680
 let's wait for them to load what 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.950
 it happens is that I have many applications 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.820
 how can they see you guys coming 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.159
 by default sorry like that 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.429
 without any marked what we have to 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.759
 to do is mark this option select 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.759
 all 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.320
 and as you can see it tells us of each 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.030
 application what kind of advertising 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.070
 we have for example in this climate already 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.840
 we have this in this game we have this 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.330
 type or this other guy in this other 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.069
 the blackhearts is not going to erase that yes 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.069
 I tell you here we have some 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.599
 configurations that the truth is good 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.360
 many also we have in the part of 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.530
 up the refresh button and also 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.690
 we can find an application here 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.120
 specific for example if on facebook I 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.159
 generates advertising then the brand 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.459
 when we install a new application 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.780
 we have to mark it and restart the 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.460
 device to apply the 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.260
 changes 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.380
 once we have marked all 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.200
 our applications which have 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.400
 advertising as we restart our 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.140
 device to apply the 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.770
 changes we also have here adjustments of 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.770
 the application 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.590
 there seems to be no meaning adjustments 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.250
 word as you can see it is only for 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.150
 show them the system applications 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.769
 and then about him 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.569
 well this has been all for the same in 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.790
 work that takes away the publicity of 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.440
 any application and finally 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.560
 we of 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.640
 in youtube huawei with youtube alhuey 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.640
 nothing else we have to 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.180
 mark these two options and restart 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.190
 our device so they stay 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.890
 the changes once we do this 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.890
 Well, it would be completely 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.090
 and without ads our youtube I'm going to 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.400

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.099
 test with moving work 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.739
 the twitter client of plum has 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.900
 club forgiveness with advertising as it is 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.480
 free but with this application of 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.760

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.760

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.610
