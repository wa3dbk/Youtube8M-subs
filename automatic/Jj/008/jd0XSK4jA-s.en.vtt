ps2<00:01:51.170> but<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:52.009> did<00:01:52.219> a<00:01:52.250> great<00:01:52.520> job<00:01:52.549> of<00:01:52.849> emulating

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
ps2 but it did a great job of emulating

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.539

it<00:01:53.659> this<00:01:54.109> game<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.679> kind<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.069> feels<00:01:55.310> like<00:01:55.429> a

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
it this game it kind of feels like a

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.550 
it this game it kind of feels like a
weak<00:01:55.849> version<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.359> that<00:01:56.509> really<00:01:56.780> clicking<00:01:57.170> one

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
weak version of that really clicking one

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.169 
weak version of that really clicking one
button<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.310> just<00:01:58.549> keep<00:01:58.819> doing<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.149> same

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
button and just keep doing the same

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.699 
button and just keep doing the same
attack<00:01:59.630> over<00:01:59.959> and<00:02:00.079> over<00:02:00.259> again<00:02:00.349> and<00:02:00.590> then

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
attack over and over again and then

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.260

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
using your special that's basically the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.839 
using your special that's basically the
whole<00:02:02.450> gameplay<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:04.159> just<00:02:04.369> gets<00:02:04.549> boring

believe<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:36.769> game<00:02:36.980> should<00:02:37.190> have<00:02:37.250> had<00:02:37.459> just

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
believe this game should have had just

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.190 
believe this game should have had just
as<00:02:37.910> many<00:02:38.090> characters<00:02:38.450> there's<00:02:38.780> at<00:02:38.900> least<00:02:38.930> a

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
as many characters there's at least a

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.020 
as many characters there's at least a
second<00:02:39.590> one<00:02:39.709> or<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.010> third<00:02:40.250> would<00:02:40.819> have<00:02:40.910> been

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
second one or the third would have been

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.640 
second one or the third would have been
nice<00:02:41.209> because<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.569> third<00:02:41.750> one<00:02:41.959> has<00:02:42.109> plenty<00:02:42.530> of

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
nice because the third one has plenty of

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.030 
nice because the third one has plenty of
characters<00:02:43.069> and<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.079> a<00:02:45.109> fanservice<00:02:45.620> game

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
characters and this is a fanservice game

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.670 
characters and this is a fanservice game
so<00:02:46.790> what<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.510> mean<00:02:47.720> my<00:02:47.900> dad's<00:02:48.109> is<00:02:48.349> like<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
so what I mean my dad's is like the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.620 
so what I mean my dad's is like the
Tenkaichi<00:02:49.099> games<00:02:49.519> whether<00:02:49.760> or<00:02:49.880> not<00:02:49.970> excellent

Tenkaichi games whether or not excellent

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.479 
Tenkaichi games whether or not excellent
fighters<00:02:51.019> but<00:02:51.410> there<00:02:51.590> are<00:02:51.680> good<00:02:51.889> fighters<00:02:52.280> for

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
fighters but there are good fighters for

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.460 
fighters but there are good fighters for
this<00:02:52.639> series<00:02:53.150> such<00:02:53.359> as<00:02:53.389> Naruto<00:02:53.930> or<00:02:54.019> Dragonball

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
Z and this this just doesn't feel like a

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.170 
Z and this this just doesn't feel like a
very<00:02:57.200> good<00:02:57.319> portable<00:02:58.160> fighter<00:02:58.489> in<00:02:58.700> my<00:02:58.819> opinion

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
very good portable fighter in my opinion

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.569

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
but really is it worth it if the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.420 
but really is it worth it if the
gameplay<00:04:13.209> isn't<00:04:13.690> actually<00:04:14.500> up-to-date

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
gameplay isn't actually up-to-date
