at spark fund so Brian and I got to talk

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.289 
at spark fund so Brian and I got to talk
and<00:00:13.080> when<00:00:13.380> pryin<00:00:13.650> came<00:00:13.920> on<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:15.120> thought

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
and when pryin came on and we thought

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.640 
and when pryin came on and we thought
it'd<00:00:15.450> be<00:00:15.480> really<00:00:15.570> interesting<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.260> give

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
it'd be really interesting to give

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.130 
it'd be really interesting to give
schools<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.250> chance<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.730> compete<00:00:18.119> at<00:00:18.270> AVC<00:00:18.869> in

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
schools a chance to compete at AVC in

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.140 
schools a chance to compete at AVC in
years<00:00:19.740> past<00:00:20.010> we've<00:00:20.310> seen<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> lot<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.850> people

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
years past we've seen a lot of people

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.060 
years past we've seen a lot of people
come<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.390> from<00:00:21.750> universities<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.500> private

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
come in from universities and private

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.710 
come in from universities and private
individuals<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.730> bring<00:00:23.880> some<00:00:24.060> great<00:00:24.269> robots

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
individuals and bring some great robots

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.950 
individuals and bring some great robots
but<00:00:25.410> Brian<00:00:25.740> being<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.460> first<00:00:26.789> person<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
but Brian being a first person and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.109 
but Brian being a first person and
myself<00:00:28.289> being<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> first<00:00:28.769> person<00:00:29.010> also<00:00:29.340> we

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
myself being a first person also we

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.310 
myself being a first person also we
thought<00:00:30.330> it'd<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.480> great<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.810> give<00:00:31.170> high

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
thought it'd be great to give high

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 
thought it'd be great to give high
schools<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.800> chance<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.369> middle<00:00:32.820> schools<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
schools a chance and middle schools a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.120 
schools a chance and middle schools a
chance<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.870> build<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> competition

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
chance to build for the competition

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.069 
chance to build for the competition
absolutely<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.090> there's<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.420> lot<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> teams<00:00:36.899> out

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
absolutely so there's a lot of teams out

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.420 
absolutely so there's a lot of teams out
there<00:00:37.230> they're<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> have

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
there they're going to have

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.030 
there they're going to have
chassé<00:00:39.030> ease<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.719> extra<00:00:40.200> motors<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.770> extra

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
chassé ease and extra motors and extra

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.340 
chassé ease and extra motors and extra
parts<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:42.329> think<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.809> there's<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.110> ton<00:00:43.290> of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
parts we think that there's a ton of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.229 
parts we think that there's a ton of
opportunity<00:00:43.500> there<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.280> teams<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.059> don't

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
opportunity there for teams that don't

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.209 
opportunity there for teams that don't
have<00:00:45.510> stuff<00:00:45.840> we're<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> show<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.010> guys

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
have stuff we're going to show you guys

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.130 
have stuff we're going to show you guys
some<00:00:47.850> parts<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.510> use<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.930> are

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
some parts that we can use that are

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
some parts that we can use that are
straight<00:00:49.440> from<00:00:49.530> our<00:00:49.710> catalog<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.969> build<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
straight from our catalog to build a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.990 
straight from our catalog to build a
robot<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.750> will<00:00:51.870> compete<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.559> ABC<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
robot that will compete in ABC so the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.369 
robot that will compete in ABC so the
course<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.600> out<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.020> parking

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
course is going to be out on the parking

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
course is going to be out on the parking
lot<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.070> boulder<00:00:56.309> rez<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> be

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
lot of the boulder rez it's going to be

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.860 
lot of the boulder rez it's going to be
about<00:00:57.809> 180<00:00:58.469> feet<00:00:58.710> by<00:00:58.859> 160<00:00:59.609> feet<00:00:59.850> there<00:01:00.660> are

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
about 180 feet by 160 feet there are

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.139 
about 180 feet by 160 feet there are
four<00:01:01.559> corners<00:01:01.949> around<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.030> which

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
four corners around here for which

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.479 
four corners around here for which
you'll<00:01:03.359> earn<00:01:03.570> 25<00:01:04.350> points<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.159> around

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you'll earn 25 points for going around

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.399 
you'll earn 25 points for going around
each<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.850> those<00:01:05.970> corners<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.049> goal<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
each of those corners and the goal is to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.469 
each of those corners and the goal is to
traverse<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.040> entire<00:01:08.310> course<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.939> under<00:01:09.270> five

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
traverse the entire course in under five

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.880 
traverse the entire course in under five
minutes<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.080> that's<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:10.860> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
minutes and so that's going to be one of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.190 
minutes and so that's going to be one of
our<00:01:11.070> key<00:01:11.220> design<00:01:12.180> constraints<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> make

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
our key design constraints is to make

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.929 
our key design constraints is to make
sure<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.380> our<00:01:13.650> robot<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.010> fast<00:01:14.430> enough<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
sure that our robot is fast enough and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.060 
sure that our robot is fast enough and
able<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.810> traverse<00:01:15.960> around<00:01:16.290> an<00:01:16.680> outdoor

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
able to traverse around an outdoor

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.820 
able to traverse around an outdoor
parking<00:01:17.430> lot<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:18.360> under<00:01:18.750> five<00:01:18.990> minutes<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.380> 300

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
parking lot in under five minutes or 300

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.830 
parking lot in under five minutes or 300
seconds<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.850> spark<00:01:21.360> fun<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.810> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
seconds so a spark fun here we have a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.140 
seconds so a spark fun here we have a
lot<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.140> smaller<00:01:22.710> robots<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.549> carry<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
lot of smaller robots that we carry and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.460 
lot of smaller robots that we carry and
we<00:01:24.420> looked<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.049> these<00:01:25.170> different

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
we looked at all of these different

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.410 
we looked at all of these different
platforms<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.030> little<00:01:27.180> mini

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
platforms we have here the little mini

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.560 
platforms we have here the little mini
bot<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.799> from<00:01:29.100> parallax<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.820> robot

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
bot we have this from parallax the robot

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.920 
bot we have this from parallax the robot
and<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.880> magician's<00:01:33.360> chassis

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and then this is the magician's chassis

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.200 
and then this is the magician's chassis
with<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.619> new<00:01:35.159> board<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.640> we're<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.090> about

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
with a new board that we're just about

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.819 
with a new board that we're just about
to<00:01:36.270> release<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:37.140> looked<00:01:37.290> at<00:01:37.380> all<00:01:37.530> these

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
to release here we looked at all these

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.440 
to release here we looked at all these
designs<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.670> notice<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.150> they're

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
designs and we notice that they're

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.010 
designs and we notice that they're
probably<00:01:40.320> too<00:01:40.650> small<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.369> access<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.020> 680

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
probably too small to access this 680

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.010 
probably too small to access this 680
foot<00:01:43.470> course<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.939> looked<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.689> rover

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
foot course so we looked to the rover

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.990 
foot course so we looked to the rover
five<00:01:46.259> chassis<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> rover<00:01:47.189> five<00:01:47.399> chassis<00:01:47.850> has

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
five chassis the rover five chassis has

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.819 
five chassis the rover five chassis has
a<00:01:48.030> lot<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.420> flexibility<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> wheels

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
a lot of flexibility to it the wheels

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.219 
a lot of flexibility to it the wheels
you<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.729> non-standard<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.810> we'll

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you see here are non-standard so we'll

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.719 
you see here are non-standard so we'll
talk<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> little<00:01:52.560> about<00:01:52.710> why<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.340> chose<00:01:53.520> those

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
talk a little about why we chose those

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.639 
talk a little about why we chose those
wheels<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.390> minute<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.079> some

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
wheels here in a minute and then some

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.990 
wheels here in a minute and then some
additional<00:01:55.979> boards<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.759> we're<00:01:56.880> going

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
additional boards here that we're going

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.580 
additional boards here that we're going
to<00:01:57.060> talk<00:01:57.270> about<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.689> how<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.810> program<00:01:58.350> those

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
to talk about and how we program those

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
to talk about and how we program those
so<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.310> box<00:01:59.520> are<00:01:59.790> all<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.030> parts<00:02:00.210> you're

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so in this box are all the parts you're

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.090 
so in this box are all the parts you're
going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> need<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.899> build<00:02:01.079> your<00:02:01.259> robot<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
going to need to build your robot the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.800 
going to need to build your robot the
most<00:02:02.280> important<00:02:02.820> thing<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.180> course<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.630> your

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
most important thing of course is your

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.749 
most important thing of course is your
spark<00:02:04.049> fund<00:02:04.200> red<00:02:04.469> board<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:05.340> we've<00:02:05.490> got<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
spark fund red board then we've got the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.819 
spark fund red board then we've got the
rover<00:02:05.909> five<00:02:06.360> board<00:02:06.840> that's<00:02:07.140> our<00:02:07.619> motor

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
rover five board that's our motor

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.360 
rover five board that's our motor
controller<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.729> rover<00:02:08.940> 5<00:02:09.149> comes<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:09.929> a

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 
controller the rover 5 comes with a

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.100 
controller the rover 5 comes with a
6-cell<00:02:11.370> double<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.270> battery<00:02:12.660> holder<00:02:12.810> we're

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
6-cell double a battery holder we're

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.640 
6-cell double a battery holder we're
going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.319> replace

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
going to replace

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.080 
going to replace
this<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.159> that<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.400> get<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.549> little<00:02:14.790> bit<00:02:14.970> more

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
this just that we get a little bit more

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.449 
this just that we get a little bit more
oomph<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:15.689> our<00:02:15.840> robot<00:02:16.250> unfortunately<00:02:17.250> when

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
oomph with our robot unfortunately when

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.699 
oomph with our robot unfortunately when
we<00:02:17.489> tested<00:02:17.939> the<00:02:18.060> treads<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.989> had<00:02:19.170> some<00:02:19.379> numbers

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
we tested the treads we had some numbers

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.830 
we tested the treads we had some numbers
problems<00:02:20.250> these<00:02:20.730> are<00:02:20.790> small<00:02:21.239> diameter<00:02:21.629> wheels

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
problems these are small diameter wheels

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.140 
problems these are small diameter wheels
so<00:02:22.140> regardless<00:02:22.739> how<00:02:22.920> fast<00:02:23.310> these<00:02:23.549> motors<00:02:23.939> go

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
so regardless how fast these motors go

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.880 
so regardless how fast these motors go
this<00:02:24.540> thing<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.870> gonna<00:02:25.110> be<00:02:25.230> limited<00:02:25.409> by<00:02:25.829> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
this thing is gonna be limited by the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.280 
this thing is gonna be limited by the
circumference<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.939> these<00:02:27.060> wheels<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.959> we<00:02:28.079> had

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
circumference of these wheels so we had

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.410 
circumference of these wheels so we had
to<00:02:28.409> do<00:02:28.560> something<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.549> chassis<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.150> already

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
to do something this chassis is already

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.599 
to do something this chassis is already
built<00:02:30.629> with<00:02:30.870> fixed<00:02:31.500> motors<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:32.010> fixed<00:02:32.250> gears

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
built with fixed motors and fixed gears

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.819 
built with fixed motors and fixed gears
and<00:02:32.879> so<00:02:33.060> we<00:02:33.209> couldn't<00:02:33.390> change<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.840> but<00:02:34.530> one

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
and so we couldn't change that but one

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.319 
and so we couldn't change that but one
nice<00:02:35.040> thing<00:02:35.069> about<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.519> rover<00:02:35.670> five<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.180> that

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
nice thing about the rover five is that

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.210 
nice thing about the rover five is that
we<00:02:36.420> can<00:02:36.720> swap<00:02:37.019> out<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.409> wheels<00:02:37.590> we've<00:02:38.040> looked

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
we can swap out the wheels we've looked

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.860 
we can swap out the wheels we've looked
at<00:02:38.310> these<00:02:38.400> big<00:02:38.640> knobby<00:02:38.879> wheels<00:02:39.209> these<00:02:39.689> guys

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
at these big knobby wheels these guys

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.770 
at these big knobby wheels these guys
have<00:02:40.079> 120<00:02:40.890> millimeter<00:02:41.340> diameter<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.150> gives

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
have 120 millimeter diameter and gives

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.300 
have 120 millimeter diameter and gives
us<00:02:42.900> about<00:02:43.140> two<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.620> half<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.980> three<00:02:44.010> feet

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
us about two and a half to three feet

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.920 
us about two and a half to three feet
per<00:02:44.670> second<00:02:45.030> which<00:02:45.060> clears<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.720> entire

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
per second which clears the entire

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.680 
per second which clears the entire
course<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.440> about<00:02:46.530> 270<00:02:47.430> seconds<00:02:47.819> we've<00:02:48.209> got<00:02:48.450> a

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
course in about 270 seconds we've got a

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.960 
course in about 270 seconds we've got a
couple<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.319> cut<00:02:49.650> pieces<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.099> Mason<00:02:50.579> eye<00:02:50.700> and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
couple of cut pieces of Mason eye and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.250 
couple of cut pieces of Mason eye and
these<00:02:51.239> are<00:02:51.359> going<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.540> stand<00:02:51.989> for<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
these are going to stand for the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.229 
these are going to stand for the
platform<00:02:52.739> on<00:02:52.950> our<00:02:53.040> robot<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:53.819> went<00:02:54.000> through

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
platform on our robot we went through

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.690 
platform on our robot we went through
and<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:54.810> measured<00:02:55.139> all<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.530> all<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.519> holes

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
and we measured all of all of the holes

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.879 
and we measured all of all of the holes
on<00:02:56.940> here<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.299> we<00:02:57.450> created<00:02:58.019> drawing<00:02:58.290> packages

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
on here and we created drawing packages

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.369 
on here and we created drawing packages
for<00:02:59.189> all<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.609> these<00:02:59.730> so<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:01.019> don't<00:03:01.200> have

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
for all of these so that you don't have

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.199 
for all of these so that you don't have
to<00:03:01.530> measure<00:03:01.769> all<00:03:02.010> these<00:03:02.159> things<00:03:02.430> out<00:03:02.609> you<00:03:02.849> can

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
to measure all these things out you can

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.929 
to measure all these things out you can
print<00:03:03.450> out<00:03:03.599> our<00:03:03.840> drawings<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.950> print<00:03:05.849> them

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
print out our drawings and print them

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.670 
print out our drawings and print them
one<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:06.239> one<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.629> just<00:03:06.810> drill<00:03:07.139> right<00:03:07.170> through

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
one for one and just drill right through

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.259 
one for one and just drill right through
so<00:03:08.099> before<00:03:08.400> we<00:03:08.519> put<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.790> board<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.120> we're

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
so before we put the board on we're

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.330 
so before we put the board on we're
gonna<00:03:09.359> have<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.569> clip<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.019> ties<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.829> there<00:03:11.099> and

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
gonna have to clip the ties on there and

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.920 
gonna have to clip the ties on there and
separate<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.939> wires<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.510> got<00:03:12.629> to<00:03:12.689> be<00:03:12.750> careful

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
separate the wires you got to be careful

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.020 
separate the wires you got to be careful
that<00:03:13.650> we<00:03:13.799> keep<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.189> right<00:03:14.370> side<00:03:14.639> separate

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
that we keep the right side separate

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.099 
that we keep the right side separate
from<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.239> left<00:03:15.420> side<00:03:15.569> there's<00:03:15.840> going<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:15.989> be

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
from the left side there's going to be

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.170 
from the left side there's going to be
two<00:03:16.470> wires<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.859> red<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.250> black<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.819> each<00:03:18.030> of

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
two wires a red and a black for each of

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.729 
two wires a red and a black for each of
the<00:03:18.239> motors<00:03:18.510> there's<00:03:18.660> four<00:03:19.049> motors<00:03:19.470> on<00:03:19.590> this

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
the motors there's four motors on this

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.199 
the motors there's four motors on this
platform<00:03:20.099> and<00:03:20.519> then<00:03:20.730> there's<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.150> be

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
platform and then there's going to be

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.750 
platform and then there's going to be
four<00:03:21.720> sets<00:03:22.079> of<00:03:22.230> control<00:03:22.919> lines<00:03:23.160> for<00:03:23.549> the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
four sets of control lines for the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.520 
four sets of control lines for the
encoders<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.599> base<00:03:24.780> board<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.319> large

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
encoders so the base board the large

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.050 
encoders so the base board the large
board<00:03:25.829> will<00:03:26.010> go<00:03:26.129> on<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.370> bottom<00:03:26.489> here<00:03:26.879> and

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
board will go on the bottom here and

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.390 
board will go on the bottom here and
it's<00:03:27.389> designed<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:27.989> match<00:03:28.199> exactly<00:03:28.560> with<00:03:29.010> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
it's designed to match exactly with the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.670 
it's designed to match exactly with the
four<00:03:29.639> holes<00:03:29.849> on<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.750> bottom<00:03:30.870> plate<00:03:31.260> we<00:03:31.530> also

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
four holes on the bottom plate we also

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.349 
four holes on the bottom plate we also
made<00:03:32.040> another<00:03:32.459> feature<00:03:32.699> here<00:03:32.790> where<00:03:33.090> we<00:03:33.180> put

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
made another feature here where we put

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.059 
made another feature here where we put
the<00:03:33.449> holes<00:03:33.720> off-center<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.799> gives<00:03:34.980> us<00:03:35.040> a

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
the holes off-center this gives us a

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.530 
the holes off-center this gives us a
little<00:03:35.190> room<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.609> put<00:03:35.760> some<00:03:35.879> additional<00:03:36.180> parts

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
little room to put some additional parts

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.259 
little room to put some additional parts
and<00:03:36.720> sensors<00:03:37.169> but<00:03:37.530> also<00:03:37.709> gives<00:03:38.190> us<00:03:38.310> an<00:03:38.549> end<00:03:38.940> to

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
and sensors but also gives us an end to

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.270 
and sensors but also gives us an end to
the<00:03:39.389> board<00:03:39.629> and<00:03:39.870> shows<00:03:40.560> what<00:03:40.799> direction<00:03:41.099> is

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
the board and shows what direction is

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.250 
the board and shows what direction is
forward<00:03:41.699> on<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.909> robot<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.569> second<00:03:42.900> plate<00:03:43.109> is

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
forward on the robot the second plate is

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.960 
forward on the robot the second plate is
about<00:03:43.470> half<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.709> size<00:03:43.889> of<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.489> base<00:03:44.639> plate

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
about half the size of the base plate

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.000 
about half the size of the base plate
and<00:03:45.150> there's<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.109> whole<00:03:46.260> pattern<00:03:46.500> here<00:03:46.829> that

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
and there's a whole pattern here that

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.800 
and there's a whole pattern here that
matches<00:03:47.250> exactly<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.060> red<00:03:48.209> board<00:03:48.510> and

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
set of four 40 in sets we're going to

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.360 
set of four 40 in sets we're going to
add<00:04:06.959> two<00:04:07.379> additional<00:04:07.470> standoffs<00:04:08.099> these<00:04:08.250> are

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
add two additional standoffs these are

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.640 
add two additional standoffs these are
three<00:04:08.849> quarter<00:04:09.180> inch<00:04:09.359> standoffs<00:04:09.870> for<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.470> top

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
three quarter inch standoffs for the top

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.259 
three quarter inch standoffs for the top
board<00:04:10.949> we<00:04:11.340> also<00:04:11.489> have<00:04:11.669> to<00:04:11.729> mount<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:12.090> red

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
board we also have to mount the red

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.119 
board we also have to mount the red
board<00:04:12.510> on<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:13.019> top<00:04:13.229> plate<00:04:13.500> before<00:04:13.889> we<00:04:13.979> mount

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
board on the top plate before we mount

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.879 
board on the top plate before we mount
that<00:04:14.549> one<00:04:14.849> down<00:04:15.090> my<00:04:15.810> final<00:04:16.199> thing<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.530> fish

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
that one down my final thing is to fish

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.949 
that one down my final thing is to fish
through<00:04:17.159> my<00:04:17.400> encoder<00:04:17.729> wires<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:18.810> we're<00:04:18.930> just

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
through my encoder wires so we're just

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.199 
through my encoder wires so we're just
use<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.470> outside<00:04:20.070> channel<00:04:20.370> so<00:04:20.489> channels<00:04:20.880> one

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
use the outside channel so channels one

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.149 
use the outside channel so channels one
and<00:04:21.479> four<00:04:21.779> now<00:04:22.229> these<00:04:22.380> are<00:04:22.529> color<00:04:22.710> coded<00:04:23.130> so

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
and four now these are color coded so

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:26.340 
and four now these are color coded so
red<00:04:23.909> for<00:04:24.300> VCC<00:04:25.080> black<00:04:25.409> for<00:04:25.740> ground

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
red for VCC black for ground

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.010 
red for VCC black for ground
and<00:04:26.440> then<00:04:27.010> there's<00:04:27.580> two<00:04:27.880> encoder<00:04:28.240> channels<00:04:28.690> on

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
and then there's two encoder channels on

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.590 
and then there's two encoder channels on
you<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.710> quadrature<00:04:30.250> encoders<00:04:31.090> are<00:04:31.240> white

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
you the quadrature encoders are white

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.000 
you the quadrature encoders are white
and<00:04:31.750> yellow<00:04:31.900> it<00:04:32.140> doesn't<00:04:32.380> matter<00:04:32.530> which<00:04:32.800> one

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
and yellow it doesn't matter which one

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.040 
and yellow it doesn't matter which one
you<00:04:33.310> plug<00:04:33.580> in<00:04:33.760> very<00:04:34.270> last<00:04:34.510> thing<00:04:34.690> we<00:04:34.810> have<00:04:34.930> to

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
you plug in very last thing we have to
