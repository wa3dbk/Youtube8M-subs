00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 a fourth part of my day is 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.030
 talk about diablo 3 and the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.490
 community i'll say I'm back 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.980
 one day late or two but a lot 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.570
 it does not happen 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.670
 Momentary as calm as it is right now 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.859
 It was not over for a long time 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.939
 but that also causes us to stop 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.109
 really cool things have to do 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.320
 but I'll start with that as always 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.640
 gold price we look here as well 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.820
 In the last few weeks he is stable 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.770
 stayed at 100 euros so about 20 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.469
 euro per billion or band he seems 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.100
 to settle down now in the last 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.379
 months 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.480
 We can also look like that 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.460
 Demand is this year he is always 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 supply and demand so we see 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.930
 not much is sold and the price 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.750
 stays stable 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.539
 I tend almost to that now 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.980
 The wholesalers of gold are so one 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.870
 have agreed on it a bit 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.550
 and that's you the minimum price is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.899
 So that makes any sense 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.430
 makes gold sales is at least 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.860
 my guess that they are not anymore 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.670
 want to go deeper and that's why they 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 doing otherwise but worth that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.560
 button no longer good that is unique 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.810
 and that's also what we're about to do 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.490
 as I said it at diablo currently 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.770
 It is very quiet again 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.930
 content still we get any 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.549
 We have a few small ones 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.540
 interviews where you are between the lines 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.640
 can read 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.259
 We all hope that this year 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.689
 the patch comes but even the knowledge 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.670
 we do not 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:39.299
 yes a bit frustrating but how 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.159
 I said the beautiful is just that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.689
 we are looking for something or ourselves 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.790
 I'll make something out of it myself 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.500
 even in videos before that said it is 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.540
 absolutely my tip because the game makes 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.729
 fun but it lacks a bit of 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.560
 incentive to everything and the boss if one 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.540
 create yourself or with buddies 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.850
 or whatever , damn it 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.740
 have fun and I'll show what we have now 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.259
 so did the last weekend 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.990
 there we have a charity national 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.259
 competition organized by jazz 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.610
 an american was a great super 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.770
 Although many top players are 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.990
 competed 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.100
 there was only solo competition martin 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.760
 competition 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.650
 So there was gold collected and 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.480
 it was donated who like ours alone 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.400
 stream has collected 2150 euro donations 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.080
 and by such a deal was the whole 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.960
 even eightfold since we are seventeen 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.100
 1200 euro came 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.070
 super many thing so again thanks 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.290
 has also made me really fun then the 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.810
 solo competition that has the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.610
 organizer jazz won 59 ledger 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.200
 dallas got me in the last hour 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.180
 I still had hung up 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.940
 he was actually used all the time 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.870
 I have been delighted that 54 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.700
 become third 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.860
 with 48 so not outstanding until 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.030
 in total of the numbers so if you are 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.940
 when we were a little bit better 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.070
 All would be vacated then we would have too 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.990
 found more but very good and 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.490
 has a lot of fun 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.850
 the team national competition has ours 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.980
 team rap turin won with over 2 207 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.040
 last partly as far as I know in six 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.940
 Four to four very strong performance 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.830
 And something very pleasing is at the end 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.450
 There was a raffle of all gold was 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.880
 it was the largest donated 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.430
 raffle in the diablo 3 story 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:34.760
 So with distance the price pool were 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:39.050
 We are looking at 48 60 billion here 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.090
 gold was the price only gold you have to 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.300
 gold and it then I believe about 100 m 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.180
 bus and much more countries is so 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.920
 over 500 legendary it was just one 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.930
 amount 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.450
 and yes that was happy 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.530
 We have our five prizes 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.900
 won the community 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.230
 the fair has even won twice 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.209
 brusa lette snoopy basti basti has the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.970
 Main prize won 24 billion gold 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.950
 so it was definitely a cool thing 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.550
 and was a lot of fun and like me 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.080
 so said these competitions and that 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.640
 making in recent times also very common 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.000
 sometimes in the stream just two times 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.190
 hours of competition spontaneously 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.110
 somehow mods from me or hallways from 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.509
 me it's just fun and fun 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.490
 keep one at stake and give one 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.250
 motivation and i just want to 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.659
 in between when I drive I have real 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.759
 not anymore for the last davis i 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.439
 have too many dings seen so much 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.780
 played competitions and also won 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:42.060
 and so much legend has already been opened 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.349
 it is extremely rare that something 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.310
 good thing is that's how it is 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.750
 That's why I'm actually 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.370
 not driving so much anymore 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.569
 that I think something great or something 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.819
 Of course you have the still 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.590
 a bit in the back of the head but the 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.039
 main motivation is really for me 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.520
 together or against my friends and 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.349
 my viewer and opinion with him too 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.969
 play and that really just makes 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.629
 fun and that would have me too 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:10.439
 the game is good enough for us to do so 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.210
 have made 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:13.409
 Let's see what happens on the weekend 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.150
 maybe a quiet weekend 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:19.500
 Let's see, we always have so many now 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:23.210
 definitely had bands anyway 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.620
 then at the latest over the weekend 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.689
 there is again a single hardcore ace 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.190
 before that, I'm already on it 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.339
 last thing they had organized 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.360
 700 907 people attended 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:38.490
 all streamed 107 streams 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:43.289
 at the same time and that is enough a hammer 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.789
 thing and well as well as then gave 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.199
 There are a few changes on the homepage 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.740
 yes, everything is here construction this point 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:51.000
 tv can read you here 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.009
 that will also happen in the days 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.240
 we are only there own gold raffl there 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.080
 it also a lot of gold too 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.979
 win 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.949
 for all who did it here 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.580
 and otherwise we'll see each other next 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.310
 week again 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.310
 I press my thumb and hope very much 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.250
 that some info now times from 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.319
 at least come from blizzard in which 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.689
 direction it goes 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:18.750
 what exactly with this album 20 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.889
 or invited 20 what they call what exactly 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.659
 where does the direction go? 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.189
 because in the end we have no idea 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.860
 what happens because we know the drop 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.569
 Guess we are a bit lowered 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.710
 is better legendary and everything will be 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:29.939
 overworked but that's more 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.699
 actually knowing at all 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:35.180
 actually nothing and that's why 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:38.180
 At least I'm hot on a few infos 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.330
 ok until next time thanks for 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.490
