00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:10.301
Nearly 4 years now since the first BOI Eco Car introduced in Thailand

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:17.567
Now at last, it's the day for Toyota Motor Thailand 
to release its BOI Eco Car product

00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:25.434
The entirely new 5-door with one familiar name, 
but its segment and many things have changed

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:32.734
Built to be a right answer, to Thais today

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:54.834
Toyota's second generation Yaris for Thailand

00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:00.467
New 5-door, new generation, new segment, new prices

00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:05.234
And also as the first true "Yaris", because it's born not to be Vitz as we know it

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:10.801
Now debuted in Thailand for real, after world premiered in China

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:18.434
Rolled out from the "Gateway II, Chachoengsao" assembly line, and that line was established specifically for this BOI Eco Car of Toyota

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:24.567
The operation was started as soon as September begins

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:33.967
We must also not forget that this standard production 5-door 
is a result that derived from the "Dear Qin 5-door" concept

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:38.801
That's its guiding light indeed, just a similar way to 
how the new Vios (3rd-gen) emerged

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:43.567
Its appearance remained as large as B-segment should, 
despite being BOI Eco Car now

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:48.267
Large sized body as some competitor in its class and with over 
1,000kg of weight, but different with its own "Wide &amp; Low" stance

J grade will get front end with black stripe instead of silver

00:02:12.067 --> 00:02:14.834
Projector headlamps

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:18.234

00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:24.667
Dynamic exterior by aerodynamics principle, side fins, catamaran roof

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:27.167

00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:31.167

for a reason of noise reducing

00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:34.234

00:02:43.134 --> 00:02:44.967
While J Eco will be coverless

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:48.801
Its fuel tank is 42-litre

00:02:55.267 --> 00:02:58.067
Larger rear lamps which also supported dynamic act

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:01.134
Tailgate with chrome strip, again for G grade

00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:03.534
While others will be non-chrome

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.334
Dual lower red reflectors

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:14.501
Today's Thai spec Yaris powered by 3NR-FE 1,197cc 4-cyl 
DOHC 16-Valve 86HP, E20 accepted

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.401
And it's the first for Toyota Thailand: Dual VVT-i engine

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:22.667
Maximum Power: 63kw @ 6,000rpm |

Rear: Torsion beam with coil springs and anti-roll bar

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.601
In safety, all variants shared these in common:

00:03:43.134 --> 00:03:46.601

But Immobilizer &amp; Theft Deterrent System available for G &amp; E grades

00:04:00.767 --> 00:04:05.501
Interior actually not different much from Vios, 
in both appearance and space

00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:09.501
So meant existed of some details of difference

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:13.934
Main tone of the front console of every Yaris is "Dark Silver"

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:17.967
But again G grade always gained the rich features than others

00:04:18.767 --> 00:04:22.801
Like this leather-wrapped steering wheel with metallic decoration

00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:26.834
Electric power (EPS), speed-sensitive, with audio controller

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:30.967
Postion of gauge finally brought back behind steering wheel 
(like Thais said it should), then it's sportier

00:04:31.034 --> 00:04:36.267
With Multi-Info Display (MID), and ECO indicator

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.667
"Smart Start" ignition button

00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:42.401

00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:45.701

and chrome inner door handles

00:04:45.934 --> 00:04:49.134

00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:51.734

00:04:56.567 --> 00:05:00.101
3 positions of cupholders

00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:02.134
12V/120W power socket

00:05:05.534 --> 00:05:08.701
All variants will share this type of sport cloth seats equally

00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:17.134
Rear row seat with column-type headrests, 60:40 ability for G &amp; E, but center armrest just went absent

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:20.567
Anti-jam power windows (excluded J Eco)

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:23.201
Meanwhile without compromising of cargo area

00:05:26.901 --> 00:05:29.434
Spare tire located just under the cargo floor

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:36.301
And Yaris of today achieved 20km/l fuel consumption 
(UNECE Reg. 101 Combined Mode)

00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:42.301
And its emission rate that can compare to the rate of Euro IV

00:05:57.201 --> 00:06:00.634
7 exterior colors, 3 grades

00:06:01.534 --> 00:06:06.434
4 variants total, the price started at 469,000 THB

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:11.467
G grade maintained the price under 600,000 THB by 599,000 THB

00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:25.567
Excuse me sir, do you feel comfort on this new Yaris?

00:06:25.567 --> 00:06:27.967
"Don't bother ask me! I'm just a bear doll"

00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:32.701
Previous generation of Yaris in Thailand was B-segment, 
but its sales target never outsold the Vios

00:06:33.367 --> 00:06:39.301
Toyota found its way by decide to participate the BOI Eco Car program, 
and let this all-new Yaris 5-door standalone in that whole new segment

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.067
And with it, Toyota has made the "Right" answers 
from the car to the people more than ever before

00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:53.234
Vios is darn good already in B-segment, 
that's why TMT did something different this time to the new Yaris

00:06:55.567 --> 00:07:02.034
Lower segment but definitely higher potential, at least than the car it replaces
