book yeah this is a bit darker now so it
does<00:02:34.050> look<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.410> does<00:02:34.620> suit<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.160> game<00:02:35.310> better

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
does look it does suit the game better

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.970 
does look it does suit the game better
now<00:02:35.820> also<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:36.930> quit<00:02:37.110> on<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.470> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
now also if I just quit on to the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.620 
now also if I just quit on to the
texture<00:02:38.250> pack<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.520> used<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.180> flyover

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
texture pack that used in the flyover

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.510 
texture pack that used in the flyover
for<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.930> which<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.260> not<00:02:40.410> dokucraft<00:02:40.800> god<00:02:41.400> that

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
for it which is not dokucraft god that

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.280 
for it which is not dokucraft god that
is<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.670> slack<00:02:42.570> pure<00:02:43.010> bdcraft<00:02:44.090> 128<00:02:45.090> 128<00:02:45.750> that's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
is the slack pure bdcraft 128 128 that's

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.170 
is the slack pure bdcraft 128 128 that's
why<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.800> one<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.460> people<00:02:48.030> say<00:02:48.150> about

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
why I like this one so people say about

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.790 
why I like this one so people say about
hyper<00:02:48.570> computer<00:02:49.170> because<00:02:49.440> i'm<00:02:49.530> running<00:02:49.710> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
hyper computer because i'm running the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.940 
hyper computer because i'm running the
shader<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.340> do<00:02:50.490> have<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.700> hug<00:02:50.880> computer<00:02:51.950> yeah

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
shader you do have a hug computer yeah

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.970 
shader you do have a hug computer yeah
yeah<00:02:53.760> let's<00:02:54.210> let's<00:02:54.600> be<00:02:54.720> modest<00:02:55.080> here<00:02:55.290> I'm<00:02:55.680> all

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
yeah let's let's be modest here I'm all

sober<00:02:56.430> for<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:57.060> sort<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.450> like<00:02:57.660> making<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
sober for is sort of like making the

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.890 
sober for is sort of like making the
land<00:02:58.950> anymore<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.000> yeah<00:03:00.120> anyway<00:03:00.480> with<00:03:00.660> this

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
land anymore so yeah anyway with this

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.790 
land anymore so yeah anyway with this
texture<00:03:01.260> pack<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:02.160> different<00:03:03.560> was<00:03:04.560> about

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
texture pack on in different was about

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.160 
texture pack on in different was about
biomes<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.400> skybox<00:03:05.970> changed<00:03:06.270> color<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:06.750> in

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
biomes the skybox changed color so in

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.260 
biomes the skybox changed color so in
actual<00:03:07.370> runescape<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.580> does<00:03:08.760> go<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.090> like<00:03:09.180> a

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
actual runescape it does go so like a

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.990 
actual runescape it does go so like a
green<00:03:09.630> yes<00:03:10.290> mega<00:03:10.890> missed<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.460> tupperware<00:03:11.910> you

should<00:03:18.060> look<00:03:18.120> pretty<00:03:18.180> nice<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.870> reason<00:03:19.140> i

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
should look pretty nice the reason i

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.840 
should look pretty nice the reason i
like<00:03:19.320> this<00:03:19.470> texture<00:03:19.800> pack<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.130> well<00:03:20.400> with<00:03:20.700> like

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
like this texture pack is well with like

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.360 
like this texture pack is well with like
lb<00:03:21.540> photorealism<00:03:22.380> it's<00:03:23.040> always<00:03:23.220> really

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
lb photorealism it's always really

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.070 
lb photorealism it's always really
grainy<00:03:23.670> because<00:03:24.090> every<00:03:24.330> single<00:03:24.630> pixel<00:03:24.840> is

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
grainy because every single pixel is

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.110 
grainy because every single pixel is
different<00:03:25.590> basically<00:03:26.010> whereas<00:03:26.550> if<00:03:26.730> i<00:03:26.940> look

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
different basically whereas if i look

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.060 
different basically whereas if i look
really<00:03:27.270> closely<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:28.110> colors<00:03:28.470> all<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.650> same

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
really closely the colors all the same

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.400 
really closely the colors all the same
in<00:03:29.340> each<00:03:29.580> block<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.840> doesn't<00:03:31.110> go<00:03:31.230> really

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
in each block so it doesn't go really

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.920 
in each block so it doesn't go really
like<00:03:31.650> gravely<00:03:32.280> really<00:03:32.580> far<00:03:32.790> away<00:03:32.970> it's<00:03:33.690> really

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
like gravely really far away it's really

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.990 
like gravely really far away it's really
nice<00:03:34.050> texture<00:03:34.350> pack<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.070> no<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.370> can't<00:03:35.670> I

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
nice texture pack it is no I can't I

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.520 
nice texture pack it is no I can't I
like<00:03:36.270> as<00:03:36.450> well<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.810> coming<00:03:37.080> over<00:03:37.230> here<00:03:37.350> well

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
far away so i'll blend together so that
