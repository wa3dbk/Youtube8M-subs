little update with the Skywalker so I

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.520 
little update with the Skywalker so I
have<00:00:10.139> made<00:00:10.410> often<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.750> did<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.870> begin<00:00:13.110> to

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530

have made often that did I begin to
finishing<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.250> scale<00:00:14.910> cockpit<00:00:17.449> so<00:00:18.529> this<00:00:19.529> is

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
finishing the scale cockpit so this is

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.580 
finishing the scale cockpit so this is
what<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.220> end<00:00:20.490> result<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.750> resolve<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.320> I

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
what the end result I and resolve this I

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.400 
what the end result I and resolve this I
might<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.640> do<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> little<00:00:24.210> tweaking<00:00:25.130> this

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
might have to do a little tweaking this

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.030 
might have to do a little tweaking this
because<00:00:29.210> I'm<00:00:30.210> not<00:00:30.330> always<00:00:30.869> Center<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.710> should

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
because I'm not always Center it should

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.880 
because I'm not always Center it should
be<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.430> right<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.440> need<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> go

be about right here so I just need to go
into<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.489> end<00:00:35.870> we<00:00:36.870> did<00:00:37.800> GUI<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
into the end we did GUI for the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.630 
into the end we did GUI for the
do-it-yourself<00:00:39.329> head<00:00:39.510> tracker<00:00:40.309> you<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.489> see

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
do-it-yourself head tracker you can see

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
do-it-yourself head tracker you can see
if<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.790> look<00:00:41.969> over<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:44.300> is<00:00:47.149> that<00:00:48.149> Center<00:00:48.840> so

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
if I look over that is that Center so

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.139 
if I look over that is that Center so
I'd<00:00:49.739> rather<00:00:49.950> I'd<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> about

where<00:00:56.879> I'm<00:00:56.969> running<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.449> PPM<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> Dragon

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
where I'm running the PPM to the Dragon

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.910 
where I'm running the PPM to the Dragon
OSD<00:00:59.359> from<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.539> receiver<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.350> use<00:01:01.710> my

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
OSD from the receiver and we use my

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.270 
OSD from the receiver and we use my
aileron<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.820> elevator<00:01:03.059> ports<00:01:03.809> open<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
aileron and elevator ports open I'm the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.980 
aileron and elevator ports open I'm the
dragon<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.330> contracts<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.990> put

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
dragon in contracts so I can just I put

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.920 
dragon in contracts so I can just I put
just<00:01:10.619> an<00:01:10.710> extension<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> elevator

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
just an extension from the elevator

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.960 
just an extension from the elevator
servo<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:17.159> airlock<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:19.700> make<00:01:20.700> sure<00:01:20.939> I

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
servo and the airlock and make sure I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.820 
servo and the airlock and make sure I
situated<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.280> servos<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:23.939> match

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
situated the servos so it would match

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.660 
situated the servos so it would match
right<00:01:27.350> or<00:01:30.680> would<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.710> cool<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.130> throttle

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
right or would be cool to have throttle

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.469 
right or would be cool to have throttle
right<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:33.229> but<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.880> maybe<00:01:35.880> another<00:01:36.360> little

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
right here but I maybe another little

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.010 
right here but I maybe another little
add-on<00:01:37.170> after<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.880> wanted<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.329> get<00:01:39.479> it

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
add-on after but I just wanted to get it

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.710 
add-on after but I just wanted to get it

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.770 

so<00:02:48.870> yeah<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.470> can

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.270 

research<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.590> know<00:02:52.710> I<00:02:52.740> can<00:02:52.950> enslave<00:02:53.130> another

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
research I know I can enslave another

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.630 
research I know I can enslave another
Channel<00:02:54.030> I've<00:02:54.180> got<00:02:54.420> lots<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:56.040> through<00:02:56.520> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
Channel I've got lots just through the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.060 
Channel I've got lots just through the
radio<00:02:57.000> through<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.330> drynesss<00:02:57.960> you<00:02:58.290> know<00:02:58.380> and

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
radio through the drynesss you know and

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.770 
radio through the drynesss you know and
I<00:02:59.160> thought<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.580> just<00:02:59.610> have<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.090> make<00:03:00.210> sure<00:03:00.270> that

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
I thought I just have to make sure that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.900 
I thought I just have to make sure that
there<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.860> certain<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.250> could<00:03:02.430> do<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.670> even

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
there is a certain you could do it even

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.630 
there is a certain you could do it even
with<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.120> dx7<00:03:03.890> spectrum<00:03:04.890> like<00:03:05.070> normal<00:03:05.400> people

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
with the dx7 spectrum like normal people

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.780 
with the dx7 spectrum like normal people
doing<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.210> just<00:03:06.480> way<00:03:06.660> in<00:03:06.840> another<00:03:07.080> channel<00:03:08.040> off

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.320 

go<00:03:18.340> ahead<00:03:18.490> say<00:03:18.730> there's<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.000> couple<00:03:19.210> different

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
go ahead say there's a couple different

go ahead say there's a couple different
OS<00:03:20.020> these<00:03:20.260> things<00:03:20.560> this

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.199 

easy<00:03:23.500> always<00:03:23.829> easy<00:03:24.730> no<00:03:25.030> SD<00:03:25.239> I<00:03:25.420> think<00:03:26.909> very<00:03:27.909> said

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
easy always easy no SD I think very said

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.089 
easy always easy no SD I think very said
learn<00:03:28.420> put<00:03:28.659> this<00:03:28.810> stuff<00:03:29.019> up<00:03:29.200> in<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.439> top<00:03:29.680> I

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
learn put this stuff up in the top I

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.750 
learn put this stuff up in the top I
think<00:03:30.549> that's<00:03:30.939> the<00:03:31.150> one

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.089 

that<00:03:35.300> month<00:03:35.540> had<00:03:35.750> everything<00:03:36.020> off<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.410> top

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
that month had everything off the top

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.229 
that month had everything off the top
so<00:03:38.249> there's<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.489> couple<00:03:38.670> different<00:03:38.819> options

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
so there's a couple different options

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.059 
so there's a couple different options
for<00:03:39.659> the<00:03:39.780> dragon<00:03:40.109> overseas<00:03:40.499> one<00:03:40.799> of<00:03:40.950> the

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
for the dragon overseas one of the

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.270 
for the dragon overseas one of the
things<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.549> really<00:03:41.849> like<00:03:42.030> about<00:03:43.280> unusually

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
things I really like about unusually

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.539 
things I really like about unusually
warm<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.269> think<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.599> is<00:03:45.719> default<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.590> lot<00:03:47.430> of

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
warm I think it is default a lot of

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.370 
warm I think it is default a lot of
people<00:03:47.819> tend<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.120> use

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.199 

so<00:03:52.950> that's<00:03:53.700> just<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.090> little<00:03:54.360> run<00:03:54.540> now

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
so that's just a little run now

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.589 
so that's just a little run now
of<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.750> scale<00:03:57.439> conflict<00:03:57.920> or<00:03:58.099> Skywalker<00:03:58.599> it's

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
of the scale conflict or Skywalker it's

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:17.569 
of the scale conflict or Skywalker it's
a<00:03:59.659> head<00:03:59.810> tracker

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.869 

so<00:04:18.060> as<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.509> appreciate<00:04:19.349> you<00:04:19.440> watching<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:20.009> as
