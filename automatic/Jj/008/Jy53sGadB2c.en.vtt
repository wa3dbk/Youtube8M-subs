is no tangles with this hair I guess

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.720 
is no tangles with this hair I guess
it's<00:05:44.590> because<00:05:44.710> the<00:05:44.980> peruvian<00:05:45.370> hair<00:05:45.550> is<00:05:45.700> just

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
it's because the peruvian hair is just

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.270 
it's because the peruvian hair is just
so<00:05:46.060> light<00:05:46.360> that<00:05:46.660> even<00:05:47.230> though<00:05:47.350> it's<00:05:47.530> wavy<00:05:47.830> that

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.560 
so light that even though it's wavy that
the<00:05:48.580> tangles<00:05:49.210> are<00:05:49.210> not<00:05:49.570> hardcore<00:05:50.470> so<00:05:51.570> there's

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
the tangles are not hardcore so there's

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.540 
the tangles are not hardcore so there's
