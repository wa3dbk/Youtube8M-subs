00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
to do is once again those are actually

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.760 
to do is once again those are actually
all<00:00:36.000> free<00:00:36.420> spinning<00:00:36.809> meaning<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.440> could<00:00:37.590> like

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
all free spinning meaning you could like

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.130 
all free spinning meaning you could like
slow<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.190> down<00:00:38.360> do<00:00:39.360> whatever<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.690> want<00:00:39.930> with

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
slow it down do whatever you want with

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.040 
slow it down do whatever you want with
it<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.950> least<00:00:41.730> until<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.239> mechanism<00:00:42.660> locks<00:00:42.780> up

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
it at least until the mechanism locks up

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.510 
it at least until the mechanism locks up
again<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.530> point<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.890> can't<00:00:44.100> turn<00:00:44.309> them

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
again at that point you can't turn them

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.850 
again at that point you can't turn them
so<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> could<00:00:45.360> actually<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.680> you

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
so what you could actually do is if you

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.479 
so what you could actually do is if you
try<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.700> hard<00:00:48.059> enough<00:00:49.160> let's<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.430> this

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
try just hard enough let's get this

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.139 
try just hard enough let's get this
going

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
going

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.639 
going
I<00:00:51.180> might<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.780> able<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:53.690> there<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.170> that

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
I might be able to there you go and that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.560 
I might be able to there you go and that
last<00:00:55.890> click<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.340> saw<00:00:56.520> right<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.329> would

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
last click you saw right there it would

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.090 
last click you saw right there it would
