the comments about nitrates now nitrates

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.330 
the comments about nitrates now nitrates
are<00:00:38.280> accommodation<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.620> oxygen<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.649> nitrogen

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
are accommodation of oxygen and nitrogen

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.990 
are accommodation of oxygen and nitrogen
and<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.120> occur<00:00:42.420> naturally<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:43.140> food

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
and they occur naturally in food

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.240 
and they occur naturally in food
particularly<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.600> carrots<00:00:46.230> spinach<00:00:46.500> collard

are<00:00:51.000> no<00:00:51.149> big<00:00:51.329> deal<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.140> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
are no big deal because we have a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.020 
are no big deal because we have a
bacteria<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.890> our<00:00:53.039> stomach<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.699> break

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
bacteria and our stomach that can break

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.510 
bacteria and our stomach that can break
down<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:55.050> nitrates<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.649> cause<00:00:55.829> no<00:00:56.039> problem

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
down the nitrates can cause no problem

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.979 
down the nitrates can cause no problem
however<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.629> some<00:00:58.140> babies<00:00:58.620> um<00:00:59.780> they<00:01:00.780> don't

however in some babies um they don't
have<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> bacteria<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> break<00:01:02.190> down<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
have the bacteria to break down the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.600 
have the bacteria to break down the
nitrates<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.110> cause<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.650> special<00:01:05.430> type

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
nitrates and it can cause a special type

nitrates and it can cause a special type
of<00:01:05.640> anemia<00:01:06.000> also<00:01:06.659> known<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.960> blue<00:01:07.260> baby

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
syndrome or nitrate poisoning this is

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.980 
syndrome or nitrate poisoning this is
the<00:01:11.130> word<00:01:11.310> I'm<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.810> try<00:01:12.960> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the word I'm not going to try and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.070 
the word I'm not going to try and
pronounce<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.100> called

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
pronounce it but that's what it's called

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.200

anyways blue baby syndrome sounds really

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.679 
anyways blue baby syndrome sounds really
really<00:01:18.390> scary<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.159> looked<00:01:21.119> into<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
really scary and so I looked into it

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.719 
really scary and so I looked into it
because<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.680> pretty<00:01:22.950> nervous<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
because I I was pretty nervous and

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.289 
because I I was pretty nervous and
here's<00:01:24.540> what<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> learned<00:01:25.909> nitrates<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.180> I

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
here's what I learned nitrates like I

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.030 
here's what I learned nitrates like I
said<00:01:27.540> naturally<00:01:28.049> occur<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.890> those

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
said naturally occur in all of those

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.999 
said naturally occur in all of those
foods<00:01:29.369> however<00:01:30.240> commercial<00:01:31.079> baby<00:01:31.619> food

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
foods however commercial baby food

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.789 
foods however commercial baby food
screens<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> now<00:01:33.990> springing<00:01:34.470> for

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
screens for it now springing for

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.350 
screens for it now springing for
nitrates<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.340> different<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:35.790> removing

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
nitrates is different from removing

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.330 
nitrates is different from removing
nitrates<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:37.200> nitrates<00:01:37.680> naturally

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
nitrates because nitrates naturally

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.210 
nitrates because nitrates naturally
occur<00:01:38.640> they<00:01:39.180> can't<00:01:39.509> actually<00:01:39.810> remove<00:01:40.799> them

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
occur they can't actually remove them

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.910 
occur they can't actually remove them
from<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> food<00:01:41.970> however<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.170> theory<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.770> I'm

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
from the food however in theory if I'm

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.719 
from the food however in theory if I'm
buying<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.610> jar<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.299> gerber<00:01:45.840> carrots<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:47.430> jar

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
buying a jar of gerber carrots that jar

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.910 
buying a jar of gerber carrots that jar
has<00:01:47.880> been<00:01:48.119> screened<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.840> garba<00:01:49.229> raas<00:01:49.259> decided

that the level of

that the level of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
is acceptable to sell unfortunately

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.160 
is acceptable to sell unfortunately
there<00:01:57.010> is<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:57.820> isn't<00:01:58.180> regulated<00:01:58.600> by<00:01:58.870> an

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
there is this isn't regulated by an

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.220 
there is this isn't regulated by an
external<00:01:59.470> company<00:01:59.890> or<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.490> FDA<00:02:00.910> so<00:02:01.690> it's<00:02:01.990> all

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
external company or the FDA so it's all

external company or the FDA so it's all
self<00:02:02.620> regulation<00:02:03.510> so<00:02:04.510> we're<00:02:04.840> kind<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.200> just

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
self regulation so we're kind of just

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.920 
self regulation so we're kind of just
trusting<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.040> businesses<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.930> regulate

trusting the businesses to regulate
their<00:02:08.110> own<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.580> hasn't<00:02:09.820> always<00:02:10.060> worked

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.240 
their own and that hasn't always worked
so<00:02:10.600> well<00:02:10.750> in<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.110> past<00:02:11.230> but<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:12.070> you're<00:02:12.220> making

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
so well in the past but if you're making

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.670 
so well in the past but if you're making
your<00:02:12.640> own<00:02:12.670> baby<00:02:12.970> food<00:02:13.150> it's<00:02:13.630> not<00:02:14.080> possible<00:02:14.320> for

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
your own baby food it's not possible for

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.070 
your own baby food it's not possible for
you<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:14.980> screen<00:02:15.370> for<00:02:15.400> nitrates<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.780> for

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
you to screen for nitrates so for

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.080 
you to screen for nitrates so for
example<00:02:17.170> if<00:02:17.590> you're<00:02:17.740> making<00:02:18.040> carrots<00:02:18.520> there

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
example if you're making carrots there

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.970 
example if you're making carrots there
are<00:02:19.330> nitrates<00:02:19.959> in<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.320> but<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.680> don't<00:02:20.860> know

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
are nitrates in it but you don't know

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.400 
are nitrates in it but you don't know
how<00:02:21.190> much<00:02:21.400> you're<00:02:21.730> giving<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.180> your<00:02:22.270> baby<00:02:22.480> so

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
how much you're giving to your baby so

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.810 
how much you're giving to your baby so
that<00:02:23.500> seems<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.860> little<00:02:23.890> bit<00:02:24.190> scary<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.730> I

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
that seems a little bit scary and I

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.550 
that seems a little bit scary and I
thought<00:02:25.030> well<00:02:25.239> maybe<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.690> just<00:02:25.959> won't<00:02:26.140> serve

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
thought well maybe I just won't serve

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.610 
thought well maybe I just won't serve
roslyn<00:02:27.520> homemade<00:02:28.030> carrot<00:02:28.480> or<00:02:28.780> spinach<00:02:29.140> or<00:02:29.380> any

roslyn homemade carrot or spinach or any
of<00:02:30.160> these<00:02:30.280> other<00:02:30.430> foods<00:02:31.110> but<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.200> more<00:02:32.350> I

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
of these other foods but the more I

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.990 
of these other foods but the more I
looked<00:02:32.590> into<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.950> this<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.550> what<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.730> learned

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
looked into it this is what I learned

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.060 
looked into it this is what I learned

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
recommends that you don't give these

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.979 
recommends that you don't give these

particularly after six months babies
have<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.020> bacteria<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.860> break<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.190> down<00:02:48.340> just

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
have the bacteria to break it down just

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.180 
have the bacteria to break it down just
like<00:02:48.790> adults<00:02:49.300> two<00:02:49.560> babies<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.770> are<00:02:50.800> at<00:02:51.010> high

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
like adults two babies that are at high

like adults two babies that are at high
risk<00:02:51.220> for<00:02:51.520> nitrate<00:02:51.970> poisoning<00:02:52.180> our<00:02:52.630> babies

example if you are a baby as formula-fed

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.360 
example if you are a baby as formula-fed
and<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:02.080> are<00:03:02.350> using<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.920> time<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.340> you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
and you are using the time that you

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.100 
and you are using the time that you
mixed<00:03:03.670> with<00:03:03.790> water<00:03:03.940> does<00:03:04.450> some<00:03:04.600> formulas<00:03:05.019> you

mixed with water does some formulas you

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.810 
mixed with water does some formulas you
can<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.410> buy<00:03:05.500> straight<00:03:05.769> up<00:03:05.890> but<00:03:06.580> if<00:03:06.700> your

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
can just buy straight up but if your

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.520 
can just buy straight up but if your
pup's<00:03:07.000> using<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.630> formula<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.260> mixed

pup's using the formula that you mixed

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.170 
pup's using the formula that you mixed
with<00:03:08.650> water<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.220> home<00:03:09.489> water<00:03:09.790> supply

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
with water and the home water supply

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.199 
with water and the home water supply
that<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.450> have<00:03:10.630> is<00:03:10.870> well<00:03:11.650> water<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:13.030> when

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
that you have is well water that is when

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.490 
that you have is well water that is when
you're<00:03:13.360> putting<00:03:13.570> your<00:03:13.660> baby<00:03:13.870> at<00:03:14.049> risk<00:03:14.080> for

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
you're putting your baby at risk for

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.009 
you're putting your baby at risk for
nitrate<00:03:14.890> poisoning<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:16.090> it's<00:03:16.450> always<00:03:16.690> worth

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
nitrate poisoning so it's always worth

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.180 
nitrate poisoning so it's always worth
it<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.260> make<00:03:17.380> sure<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.769> you're<00:03:17.890> checking

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
it to make sure that you're checking

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.340 
it to make sure that you're checking
with<00:03:18.459> your<00:03:18.610> pediatrician<00:03:18.880> about<00:03:19.540> your<00:03:20.170> home

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
well-child visit after six months it's

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.539 
well-child visit after six months it's
really<00:03:25.090> not<00:03:25.390> an<00:03:25.600> issue<00:03:26.160> however<00:03:27.160> there<00:03:27.400> are

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
really not an issue however there are

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.190 
really not an issue however there are
ways<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.940> can<00:03:28.180> further<00:03:28.570> reduce<00:03:28.840> the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
ways that you can further reduce the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.960 
ways that you can further reduce the
amount<00:03:29.350> of<00:03:29.440> nitrates<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:30.040> are<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.400> your

refrigerator the more nitrates occur

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.370 
refrigerator the more nitrates occur
because<00:03:39.820> like<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.209> said<00:03:40.360> it's<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.750> nationally<00:03:41.170> a

organic<00:03:51.970> vegetables<00:03:52.959> aren't<00:03:53.319> made<00:03:53.590> with<00:03:53.769> a

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
organic vegetables aren't made with a

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.880 
organic vegetables aren't made with a
fertilizer<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.879> whatnot<00:03:55.650> which<00:03:56.650> also

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
fertilizer and whatnot which also

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.399 
fertilizer and whatnot which also
introduced<00:03:57.459> of<00:03:57.610> nitrates<00:03:58.060> into<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.690> food<00:03:58.870> so

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
introduced of nitrates into the food so

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:00.899 
introduced of nitrates into the food so
there<00:03:59.560> will<00:03:59.769> still<00:04:00.040> be<00:04:00.099> nitrates<00:04:00.580> because

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
there will still be nitrates because

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.550 
there will still be nitrates because
like<00:04:01.060> i<00:04:01.150> said<00:04:01.180> it's<00:04:01.510> naturally<00:04:01.989> occurring<00:04:02.349> but

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
like i said it's naturally occurring but

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.800 
like i said it's naturally occurring but
it<00:04:02.709> will<00:04:02.890> be<00:04:02.920> less<00:04:03.959> so<00:04:04.959> with<00:04:05.590> this<00:04:05.799> in<00:04:06.040> mind<00:04:06.099> and

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
it will be less so with this in mind and

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.059 
it will be less so with this in mind and
after<00:04:07.810> reading<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.200> article<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.769> i<00:04:08.799> will
