now<00:03:09.150> don't<00:03:09.299> get<00:03:09.420> me<00:03:09.510> wrong<00:03:09.569> you<00:03:09.870> still<00:03:09.930> can

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
now don't get me wrong you still can

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.170 
now don't get me wrong you still can
sweep<00:03:10.530> whereas<00:03:10.769> beyond<00:03:11.099> it's<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.030> would

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
sweep whereas beyond it's just you would

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.729 
sweep whereas beyond it's just you would
have<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.420> watch<00:03:12.540> out<00:03:12.840> for<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:13.049> lot<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.380> physical

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739
