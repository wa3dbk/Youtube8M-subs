difficult<00:00:52.490> as<00:00:52.550> I<00:00:52.640> thought<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:52.970> what<00:00:53.120> it<00:00:53.210> would

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
difficult as I thought of what it would

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.440 
difficult as I thought of what it would
be<00:00:54.010> it's<00:00:55.010> very<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:55.430> very<00:00:55.490> doable<00:00:55.850> i<00:00:56.150> like<00:00:56.329> the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
be it's very it's very doable i like the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.300 
be it's very it's very doable i like the
fact<00:00:56.480> how<00:00:56.780> I<00:00:57.140> seen<00:00:57.590> how<00:00:57.710> young<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.190> know

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310

showing<00:01:13.909> that<00:01:14.060> okay<00:01:14.359> whoops<00:01:14.569> you<00:01:15.229> had<00:01:15.560> a

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
showing that okay whoops you had a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.129 
showing that okay whoops you had a
little<00:01:15.679> tilt<00:01:16.100> therefore<00:01:16.549> you<00:01:16.609> have<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.909> wide

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:17.139 
little tilt therefore you have the wide

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.660 
little tilt therefore you have the wide
circle<00:01:18.139> rather<00:01:18.350> than<00:01:18.499> as<00:01:18.619> small<00:01:18.920> as<00:01:19.189> it

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
circle rather than as small as it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.879 
circle rather than as small as it
flanged<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.630> thought<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.259> was<00:01:21.469> was<00:01:22.280> good<00:01:22.749> I

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:23.889 
flanged I thought that was was good I

appreciated really especially the fact
is<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:26.749> worked<00:01:26.990> on<00:01:27.139> one<00:01:27.319> piece<00:01:27.560> in<00:01:27.590> front<00:01:27.920> of

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
is you worked on one piece in front of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.340 
is you worked on one piece in front of
me<00:01:28.189> as<00:01:28.399> I<00:01:28.999> was<00:01:29.210> able<00:01:29.389> to<00:01:29.829> see<00:01:30.829> hand<00:01:31.670> positioning

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
me as I was able to see hand positioning

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.169 
me as I was able to see hand positioning
pressuring<00:01:33.350> holding<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.219> the<00:01:34.639> tools<00:01:34.880> that<00:01:35.030> I

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
pressuring holding the the tools that I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.929 
pressuring holding the the tools that I
could<00:01:35.420> maintain<00:01:35.600> flatness<00:01:36.520> been<00:01:37.520> able<00:01:37.700> to

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
could maintain flatness been able to

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.069 
could maintain flatness been able to
listen<00:01:38.179> to<00:01:38.569> the<00:01:38.920> RPMs<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.069> the<00:01:40.969> machine<00:01:41.719> so<00:01:42.049> i

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
listen to the RPMs of the machine so i

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.469 
listen to the RPMs of the machine so i
can<00:01:42.319> understand<00:01:42.770> when<00:01:43.609> did<00:01:43.729> have<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.270> make<00:01:44.450> a

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
can understand when did have it make a

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.899 
can understand when did have it make a
bite<00:01:44.779> and<00:01:44.990> what<00:01:45.139> that<00:01:45.350> sounded<00:01:45.770> like<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.249> then

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
bite and what that sounded like and then

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.639 
bite and what that sounded like and then
at<00:01:47.029> that<00:01:47.149> point<00:01:47.209> to<00:01:47.659> see<00:01:47.869> what<00:01:48.139> finished

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
at that point to see what finished

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.219 
at that point to see what finished
product<00:01:49.039> acted<00:01:49.340> i<00:01:49.490> could<00:01:49.670> achieve<00:01:49.969> i<00:01:50.209> think<00:01:51.049> i

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
product acted i could achieve i think i

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.100 
product acted i could achieve i think i
really<00:01:51.499> am<00:01:51.649> confident<00:01:52.159> that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
really am confident that

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.310 
really am confident that
we<00:01:53.590> obtained<00:01:54.010> is<00:01:54.610> sufficient<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.480> take<00:01:56.140> the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
we obtained is sufficient to take the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.890 
we obtained is sufficient to take the
machinery<00:01:56.830> that<00:01:57.070> we<00:01:57.550> got<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:58.180> bad<00:01:58.360> for<00:01:58.630> John

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
machinery that we got in a bad for John

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.470 
machinery that we got in a bad for John
into<00:01:59.530> a<00:01:59.590> job<00:02:00.330> pretty<00:02:01.330> intense<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:04.060> hands<00:02:04.360> on

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
into a job pretty intense more hands on

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.710 
into a job pretty intense more hands on
