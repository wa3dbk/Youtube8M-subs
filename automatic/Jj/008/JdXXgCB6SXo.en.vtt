00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello today i want to show you how 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.040
 you make an inventory sample 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.950
 that is, simply because times look like 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.009
 the oil level is in the engine 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.740
 one must say this test should 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.470
 you can only if the engine is warm 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.570
 and five minutes ago 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.960
 beside it the verdict is and besides 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.500
 rieden ag can be measured 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.730
 to it in every motor a collar 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.559
 marked dipstick in this case yellow 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.399
 this is white yellow red or orange 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.059
 and meadows we pull out completely 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.520
 and clean it with a clean cloth 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:48.920
 so that all oil residues are removed 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.110
 Now insert the once a bottom 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.110
 may turn a little and pull 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.699
 out then we see on it died 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.440
 maybe there are two markings here 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.359
 to see something bad that's how it works 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.309
 and in between, oil must be suspected 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.320
 But now they do not see that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.540
 I can see that the oil here is about 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.869
 what does it mean something else? 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.170
 the upper mark which means again 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:23.580
 that the stand is completely in order 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.830
 because our mark is that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.439
 minimum and the upper mark the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 maximum here just turned that that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.460
 take that that likes him in between 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.650
 should the oil level is the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.070
 Austrian, however, is not correct 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.770
 possibly too little oil in the engine 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.420
 then you can just do that yellow the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.540
 open and refill some oil 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.520
 Engine oil you should use 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.770
 It's best to go to a specialist dealer 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.180
 This really is different from MOTO MOTO 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.299
 that you should seek advice if 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.119
 they are not one hundred percent sure 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.710
 then I hope to have helped and 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.130
 I wish you much fun yourself 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130
 try out
