all of our accounts were banned because

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.980 
all of our accounts were banned because
apparently<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.340> was<00:02:20.790> never<00:02:20.970> told<00:02:21.240> upfront<00:02:21.630> as

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
apparently I was never told upfront as

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.290 
apparently I was never told upfront as
to<00:02:22.260> why<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.830> actually<00:02:23.340> had<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.790> find<00:02:24.060> out

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
to why I actually had to find out

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.580 
to why I actually had to find out
through<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:25.680> post<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.110> bit<00:02:28.320> when

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
through a post that one of the bit when

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.060 
through a post that one of the bit when
the<00:02:28.740> devs<00:02:28.980> made<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.610> long<00:02:29.970> time<00:02:30.390> ago<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.070> I

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
the devs made a long time ago that I

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.000 
the devs made a long time ago that I
guess<00:02:32.370> apparently<00:02:32.550> we<00:02:33.150> were<00:02:33.680> breaking<00:02:34.680> their

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
guess apparently we were breaking their

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.190 
guess apparently we were breaking their

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
violating it then hey I guess we

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.780 
violating it then hey I guess we
deserved<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.630> know<00:02:46.580> getting<00:02:47.580> reprimanded

deserved you know getting reprimanded
for<00:02:48.240> it<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.630> guess<00:02:48.900> we'll<00:02:49.080> leave<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.350> at<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.470> so

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
for it I guess we'll leave it at that so

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.900 
for it I guess we'll leave it at that so
but<00:02:51.390> anyway<00:02:51.750> here<00:02:52.050> we<00:02:52.230> are<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.410> year<00:02:52.620> later<00:02:53.040> I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
but anyway here we are a year later I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.210 
but anyway here we are a year later I
guess<00:02:54.360> if<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.690> violate<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.320> term<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.770> service<00:02:55.920> I

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
guess if you violate a term of service I

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.280 
guess if you violate a term of service I
guess<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.610> results<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.360> one-year<00:02:57.750> ban<00:02:57.930> for

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
guess it results in a one-year ban for

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.690 
guess it results in a one-year ban for
you<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.590> everybody<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.160> were<00:02:59.310> doing<00:02:59.490> it
