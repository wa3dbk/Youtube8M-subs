00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
services have all the ones that we did

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.380 
services have all the ones that we did
we<00:01:40.940> did<00:01:41.090> an<00:01:41.180> oil<00:01:41.390> change<00:01:41.479> in<00:01:41.899> a<00:01:41.960> brake<00:01:42.170> flush<00:01:43.390> so

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
we did an oil change in a brake flush so

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.150 
we did an oil change in a brake flush so
those<00:01:44.780> symbols<00:01:45.320> are<00:01:45.410> this<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:45.950> brake

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
those symbols are this is the brake

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.380 
those symbols are this is the brake
flush<00:01:46.399> symbol<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:48.850> obviously<00:01:49.850> that's<00:01:50.270> the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
flush symbol and obviously that's the

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.740 
flush symbol and obviously that's the
oil<00:01:50.720> change<00:01:51.380> symbol<00:01:51.800> so<00:01:52.460> we<00:01:52.759> reset<00:01:53.210> both<00:01:53.569> of

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
oil change symbol so we reset both of

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.500 
oil change symbol so we reset both of
those<00:01:53.840> successfully
