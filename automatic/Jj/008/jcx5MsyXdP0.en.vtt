rushed<00:00:27.640> and<00:00:28.000> my<00:00:28.779> overseer<00:00:29.289> was<00:00:29.500> out<00:00:29.680> of

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
rushed and my overseer was out of

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.470 
rushed and my overseer was out of
position<00:00:29.980> so<00:00:30.490> we<00:00:30.520> actually<00:00:30.730> managed<00:00:31.150> to<00:00:31.180> kill

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
position so we actually managed to kill

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.119 
position so we actually managed to kill
my<00:00:31.600> lair<00:00:31.810> enough<00:00:32.140> that<00:00:32.410> i<00:00:32.439> kind<00:00:32.829> of<00:00:32.949> fell

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
my lair enough that i kind of fell

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.900 
my lair enough that i kind of fell
behind<00:00:33.310> but<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:35.350> both<00:00:35.500> just<00:00:35.860> kept<00:00:36.489> on<00:00:36.610> in<00:00:36.790> the

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
behind but we both just kept on in the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.729 
behind but we both just kept on in the
game<00:00:37.030> and<00:00:37.239> became<00:00:37.630> a<00:00:37.690> macro<00:00:38.050> game<00:00:38.200> but<00:00:38.410> he<00:00:38.530> was

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
game and became a macro game but he was

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.160 
game and became a macro game but he was
just<00:00:39.010> pulling<00:00:39.579> ahead<00:00:39.790> so<00:00:40.390> then<00:00:40.570> we<00:00:40.690> eventually

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
just pulling ahead so then we eventually

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.310 
just pulling ahead so then we eventually
won<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.739> game<00:00:41.920> in<00:00:42.340> his<00:00:42.880> second<00:00:43.239> game<00:00:43.360> which

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
won the game in his second game which

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.740 
won the game in his second game which
was<00:00:44.380> a<00:00:44.620> all<00:00:45.579> right<00:00:45.820> lower<00:00:46.059> lost<00:00:46.300> temple<00:00:46.540> game

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
was a all right lower lost temple game

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.520 
was a all right lower lost temple game
so<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.280> basically<00:00:48.700> I<00:00:48.850> we<00:00:49.420> had<00:00:49.570> like<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.809> break<00:00:50.110> so

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
so so basically I we had like a break so

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.500 
so so basically I we had like a break so
we<00:00:51.100> were<00:00:51.219> talking<00:00:51.370> about<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:52.030> matchup<00:00:52.239> as

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
though we're clanmates oh I didn't

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.150 
though we're clanmates oh I didn't
didn't<00:00:55.270> matter<00:00:55.390> so<00:00:55.660> much<00:00:55.690> who<00:00:56.320> won<00:00:56.530> or<00:00:56.710> so<00:00:56.860> it

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
didn't matter so much who won or so it

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.100 
didn't matter so much who won or so it
was<00:00:57.370> just<00:00:57.460> four<00:00:57.850> miles<00:00:58.030> pouch<00:00:58.300> so<00:00:58.960> we're

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
was just four miles pouch so we're

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.080 
was just four miles pouch so we're
talking<00:00:59.320> about<00:00:59.500> how<00:00:59.829> to<00:00:59.890> stop<00:01:00.520> my<00:01:00.670> speedling

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
talking about how to stop my speedling

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.729 
talking about how to stop my speedling
bill<00:01:01.270> because<00:01:01.539> it<00:01:01.719> was<00:01:02.020> like<00:01:02.230> saying<00:01:02.559> it's

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
bill because it was like saying it's

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.950 
bill because it was like saying it's
really<00:01:03.070> good<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.399> so<00:01:03.460> I<00:01:03.850> said<00:01:04.420> like<00:01:04.570> you<00:01:04.809> can

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
really good and so I said like you can

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.350 
really good and so I said like you can
make<00:01:05.110> our<00:01:05.260> 16<00:01:05.799> Nexus<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.670> actually<00:01:07.210> get<00:01:07.299> a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
make our 16 Nexus and actually get a

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.990 
make our 16 Nexus and actually get a
cannon<00:01:07.900> kind<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.409> in<00:01:08.530> time<00:01:08.770> is<00:01:08.979> best<00:01:09.640> counter

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
cannon kind of in time is best counter

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.240 
cannon kind of in time is best counter
against<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:10.930> did<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.950> have<00:01:12.070> never

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
against it so did it and I have never

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.270 
against it so did it and I have never
practiced<00:01:12.909> against<00:01:13.390> it<00:01:13.510> that<00:01:13.540> much<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.890> then

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
practiced against it that much so then

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.100 
practiced against it that much so then
he<00:01:15.369> pulled<00:01:15.549> ahead<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:15.850> lot<00:01:16.119> so<00:01:16.600> I<00:01:16.659> took<00:01:16.750> three

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
he pulled ahead a lot so I took three

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.679 
he pulled ahead a lot so I took three
bases<00:01:17.500> because<00:01:17.920> i<00:01:18.130> think<00:01:18.189> is<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.450> game<00:01:19.659> is

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
bases because i think is the game is

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.690 
bases because i think is the game is
going<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.049> become<00:01:20.200> that<00:01:20.380> story<00:01:20.860> takes<00:01:21.070> three

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
going to become that story takes three

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.090 
going to become that story takes three
bases<00:01:22.030> after<00:01:22.420> products<00:01:23.140> that's<00:01:23.290> at<00:01:23.500> but<00:01:24.040> i

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
bases after products that's at but i

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.820 
bases after products that's at but i
haven't<00:01:24.490> practiced<00:01:24.790> it<00:01:24.970> so<00:01:25.390> so<00:01:26.260> he<00:01:26.380> just<00:01:26.680> did

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
haven't practiced it so so he just did

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.789 
haven't practiced it so so he just did
to<00:01:27.520> stargates<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.210> then<00:01:29.049> he<00:01:29.200> could<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.650> just

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
to stargates and then he could you just

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.730 
to stargates and then he could you just
kill<00:01:30.040> me<00:01:30.070> like<00:01:30.610> that<00:01:30.759> i<00:01:30.820> was<00:01:31.090> just<00:01:31.299> lunch<00:01:31.740> not

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
kill me like that i was just lunch not

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.440 
kill me like that i was just lunch not
trying<00:01:33.040> hundred<00:01:33.340> percent<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.729> win<00:01:33.880> if<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.240> if

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
trying hundred percent to win if you if

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.170 
trying hundred percent to win if you if
you<00:01:34.570> understand<00:01:34.960> like<00:01:35.140> she<00:01:35.439> sing<00:01:35.740> because

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you understand like she sing because

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.880 
you understand like she sing because
normally<00:01:37.180> maybe<00:01:37.630> i<00:01:37.750> would<00:01:38.020> all<00:01:38.290> in<00:01:38.560> against

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
normally maybe i would all in against

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.789 
normally maybe i would all in against
that<00:01:39.100> yes<00:01:39.670> desperately<00:01:40.360> time<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.900> beat<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:41.560> I

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
that yes desperately time to beat it I

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.730 
that yes desperately time to beat it I
was<00:01:42.460> Morris<00:01:42.880> trying<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.659> learn<00:01:43.930> more<00:01:44.530> about<00:01:44.560> a

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
was Morris trying to learn more about a

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.890 
was Morris trying to learn more about a
game<00:01:45.009> and<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:45.939> the<00:01:46.030> moment<00:01:46.360> I<00:01:46.479> was<00:01:46.630> just

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
game and and and the moment I was just

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.890 
game and and and the moment I was just
real<00:01:47.170> curious<00:01:47.590> if<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.909> my<00:01:49.329> theory<00:01:49.869> about

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
real curious if if my theory about

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.690 
real curious if if my theory about
taking<00:01:50.470> three<00:01:50.650> bases<00:01:50.979> quickly<00:01:51.310> with<00:01:51.460> sorry

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
taking three bases quickly with sorry

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.179 
taking three bases quickly with sorry
would<00:01:51.939> work<00:01:52.119> well<00:01:52.360> but<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.500> think<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.890> just<00:01:53.979> need

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
would work well but I think I just need

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.770 
would work well but I think I just need
to<00:01:54.310> practice<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.759> more<00:01:54.790> I<00:01:55.180> think<00:01:55.540> it's<00:01:55.659> going

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
to practice it more I think it's going

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.749 
to practice it more I think it's going
to<00:01:55.840> work<00:01:56.070> how<00:01:57.070> do<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.280> think<00:01:57.549> you're
