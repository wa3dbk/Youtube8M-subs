see here I've tried to replicate a

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.150 
see here I've tried to replicate a
cookie<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.270> Minecraft<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:15.960> half<00:00:16.200> a<00:00:16.320> cookie<00:00:16.440> to

make some sort of doorway on to it now
this<00:00:20.190> is<00:00:20.460> basically<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.330> cocoa<00:00:21.779> bean<00:00:21.990> farm<00:00:22.260> with

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
this is basically a cocoa bean farm with

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.050 
this is basically a cocoa bean farm with
a<00:00:23.220> wheat<00:00:23.730> farm<00:00:24.029> stuck<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> back<00:00:25.110> and<00:00:26.060> stop

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
to make it the most economical way

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000 
to make it the most economical way
possible<00:00:39.390> by<00:00:39.570> using<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.530> least<00:00:40.680> amount<00:00:40.800> of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
possible by using the least amount of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.680 
possible by using the least amount of
pistons<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.640> stuff<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.060> so<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.540> you

for business here and then three persons
for<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.760> cocoa<00:00:48.090> beans<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.890> has<00:00:50.160> two

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
for the the cocoa beans now this has two

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.900 
for the the cocoa beans now this has two
I<00:00:51.390> knew<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.200> was<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.790> is

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
I knew that was going to do that that is

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.340 
I knew that was going to do that that is
just<00:00:54.059> such<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> pain<00:00:54.630> but<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:55.050> mind<00:00:55.969> now<00:00:56.969> as

just such a pain but then mind now as
you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.530> all<00:00:59.130> on<00:00:59.309> ice<00:00:59.550> to<00:01:00.090> allow<00:01:00.360> the<00:01:00.390> items<00:01:00.840> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you can all on ice to allow the items to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.850 
you can all on ice to allow the items to
go<00:01:01.020> quicker<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:02.870> if<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.050> want<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.350> tutorial<00:01:04.649> on

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.490 
come whizzing through thanks to the the
ice<00:01:33.049> now<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.860> wheat<00:01:35.400> stops<00:01:36.350> there<00:01:37.350> we

can then turn it off because items just
get<00:01:40.590> stuck<00:01:40.830> in<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.490> while<00:01:42.080> so

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
get stuck in here for a little while so

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.130 
get stuck in here for a little while so
you<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.229> turn<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.680> off<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.540> as<00:01:45.540> soon<00:01:46.020> as

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you just turn it off and then as soon as

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.390 
you just turn it off and then as soon as
it's<00:01:46.290> off<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:48.090> items<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:49.110> funnel<00:01:49.890> through

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
it's off the items then funnel through

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.090 
it's off the items then funnel through
to<00:01:50.970> their<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:52.079> normally<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.680> everything

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
to their so normally we have everything

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.370 
to their so normally we have everything
and<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.759> will<00:01:53.909> see<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.869> get<00:01:54.990> quite<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.290> bit

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and as you will see we get quite a bit

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.950 
and as you will see we get quite a bit
out<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.860> if<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.700> get<00:01:56.939> rid<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.420> these

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
out of it if we get rid of the these

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.260 
out of it if we get rid of the these
seeds<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:59.390> we<00:02:00.390> won't<00:02:00.630> really<00:02:00.750> need<00:02:00.960> them<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
seeds as we won't really need them you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.160 
seeds as we won't really need them you
obviously<00:02:03.270> notice<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.720> get<00:02:04.579> 64<00:02:05.579> wheat<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
obviously notice we get 64 wheat and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.009 
obviously notice we get 64 wheat and
enough<00:02:07.170> cocoa<00:02:07.500> beans<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.040> make<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:09.360> eight

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
enough cocoa beans to make that eight

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.350 
enough cocoa beans to make that eight
cookies<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.890> that's<00:02:11.700> how<00:02:11.790> many<00:02:11.970> cookies<00:02:12.150> you

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
cookies and that's how many cookies you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.229 
cookies and that's how many cookies you
can<00:02:12.510> get<00:02:12.630> out<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.680> that's<00:02:13.890> some<00:02:15.799> 3688

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
can get out of this so that's some 3688
