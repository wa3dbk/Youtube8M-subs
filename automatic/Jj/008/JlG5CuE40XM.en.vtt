00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.450 
position if the ball is too far forward
this<00:00:39.750> could<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> contributing<00:00:40.559> factor<00:00:40.860> as

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
this could be a contributing factor as

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.790 
this could be a contributing factor as
to<00:00:41.640> why<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.120> too<00:00:42.420> high<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.410> want<00:00:43.649> you
