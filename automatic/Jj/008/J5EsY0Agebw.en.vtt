00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
from an earlier episode it will be a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.840 
from an earlier episode it will be a
good<00:00:47.250> home<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.809> match<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.850> I'm

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
good home if they match up so I'm

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.060 
good home if they match up so I'm
looking<00:00:51.059> forward<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.020> know<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.860> guys

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
looking forward to that I know you guys

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.459 
looking forward to that I know you guys
might<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.789> looking<00:00:53.910> forward<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.469> but

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
might not be looking forward to that but

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.200 
might not be looking forward to that but
you<00:00:56.399> know<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.699> about<00:00:56.910> time<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.570> move<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
you know it's about time to move on to

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.230 
you know it's about time to move on to
new<00:01:00.210> things<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.670> 125<00:01:03.629> gallon<00:01:04.110> tank<00:01:05.240> is

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
new things and this 125 gallon tank is

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.429 
new things and this 125 gallon tank is
not<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.439> those<00:01:07.740> things<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.960> 300

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
not one of those things but the 300

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.300 
not one of those things but the 300
gallon<00:01:10.710> stock<00:01:10.979> tank<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.909> eventually<00:01:13.310> but

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
gallon stock tank will be eventually but

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.899 
gallon stock tank will be eventually but
it<00:01:14.460> may<00:01:14.640> take<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:15.090> time<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.470> together

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
it may take some time to to get together

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.749 
it may take some time to to get together
so<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> meantime<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.740> probably<00:01:20.130> will<00:01:20.549> be

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
so in the meantime I probably will be

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.830 
so in the meantime I probably will be
focusing<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.259> fish<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.890> little<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.430> more

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
focusing on the fish a little bit more

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.490 
focusing on the fish a little bit more
than<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> past<00:01:26.930> but<00:01:27.930> don't<00:01:28.259> worry

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
than I have in the past but don't worry

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.940 
than I have in the past but don't worry
I<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.610> been<00:01:29.790> looking<00:01:30.000> into<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.950> researching

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
I have been looking into and researching

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.530 
I have been looking into and researching
different<00:01:32.729> species<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.509> Matt<00:01:34.079> turtles<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.540> I

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
different species of Matt turtles and I

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.010 
different species of Matt turtles and I
will<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.560> probably<00:01:38.450> making<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.630> final<00:01:39.900> decision

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
will be probably making a final decision

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
will be probably making a final decision
on<00:01:40.700> what<00:01:41.700> type<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:41.970> map<00:01:42.689> turtle<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.490> want<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.610> get

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
on what type of map turtle I want to get

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.620 
on what type of map turtle I want to get
into<00:01:46.310> within<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> next<00:01:47.610> few<00:01:47.939> weeks<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.570> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
into within the next few weeks but I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.590 
into within the next few weeks but I
won't<00:01:48.990> be<00:01:49.140> buying<00:01:49.409> any<00:01:50.329> probably<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
won't be buying any probably for the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.219 
won't be buying any probably for the
next<00:01:51.659> year<00:01:52.229> or<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.000> until<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.750> 300

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
next year or so until I have that 300

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.039 
next year or so until I have that 300
gallon<00:01:55.530> stock<00:01:55.799> tank<00:01:56.070> setup<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:56.969> as<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.930> can

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
gallon stock tank setup but as you can

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.179 
gallon stock tank setup but as you can
see<00:01:58.350> here<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> fish<00:01:59.130> room<00:01:59.280> the<00:02:00.119> algae<00:02:00.810> is

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
see here in the fish room the algae is

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.550 
see here in the fish room the algae is
just<00:02:02.189> about<00:02:02.520> gone<00:02:03.649> which<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.829> pretty<00:02:05.130> exciting

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
just about gone which is pretty exciting

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.770 
just about gone which is pretty exciting
and<00:02:07.479> also<00:02:08.479> as<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.709> can<00:02:09.890> see<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:11.060> Frog<00:02:11.390> bit

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
and also as you can see the Frog bit

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and also as you can see the Frog bit
here<00:02:12.200> has<00:02:12.500> really<00:02:12.830> taken<00:02:13.130> over<00:02:13.610> it's<00:02:13.910> about

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
here has really taken over it's about

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.339 
here has really taken over it's about
75%<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.280> tank<00:02:16.610> it's<00:02:17.239> about<00:02:17.360> fifty

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
75% of that tank it's about fifty

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.580 
75% of that tank it's about fifty
percent<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.920> tank<00:02:20.319> maybe<00:02:21.319> about

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
percent of that tank maybe about

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.610 
percent of that tank maybe about
twenty-five<00:02:22.310> percent<00:02:22.459> of<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.849> tank<00:02:23.120> and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
twenty-five percent of this tank and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.350 
twenty-five percent of this tank and
again<00:02:24.620> like<00:02:25.220> seventy-five<00:02:25.849> percent<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.239> this

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
again like seventy-five percent of this

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.040 
again like seventy-five percent of this
tank<00:02:26.569> not<00:02:27.349> quite<00:02:27.650> sure<00:02:27.680> why<00:02:28.160> it's<00:02:28.340> growing

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
tank not quite sure why it's growing

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.940 
tank not quite sure why it's growing
unevenly<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.319> might<00:02:30.470> have<00:02:30.560> just<00:02:30.590> been<00:02:30.709> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
unevenly it might have just been the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.290 
unevenly it might have just been the
number<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.250> plants<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.670> each<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.209> those

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
number of plants that each of those

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.229 
number of plants that each of those
tanks<00:02:32.690> started<00:02:33.050> with<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.580> did<00:02:34.580> notice<00:02:34.790> that

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
tanks started with I did notice that

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.770 
tanks started with I did notice that
there<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.900> some<00:02:36.200> duck<00:02:36.530> weed<00:02:36.800> in<00:02:37.130> there<00:02:37.780> with

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
there is some duck weed in there with

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.740 
there is some duck weed in there with
the<00:02:38.900> Frog<00:02:39.140> bit<00:02:39.410> but<00:02:39.830> it's<00:02:40.190> all<00:02:40.280> good<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:41.180> don't

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
the Frog bit but it's all good I don't

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.270 
the Frog bit but it's all good I don't
really<00:02:41.900> discriminate<00:02:42.290> when<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.739> comes<00:02:43.010> to

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
really discriminate when it comes to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.190 
really discriminate when it comes to
floating<00:02:43.970> plants<00:02:44.209> so<00:02:44.540> I'll<00:02:44.630> just<00:02:44.690> let<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.080> do

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
floating plants so I'll just let it do

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.170 
floating plants so I'll just let it do
its<00:02:45.380> thing<00:02:46.239> as<00:02:47.239> we<00:02:47.870> can<00:02:48.019> see<00:02:48.380> in<00:02:48.739> here<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:49.819> have<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
its thing as we can see in here I have a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.839 
its thing as we can see in here I have a
couple<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.540> coconut<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:51.200> hides<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.849> thought

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
couple of coconut it hides I thought

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.110 
couple of coconut it hides I thought
that<00:02:53.000> might<00:02:53.209> be<00:02:53.269> nice<00:02:53.540> for<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.930> core<00:02:54.140> cats<00:02:54.470> and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
that might be nice for the core cats and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.940 
that might be nice for the core cats and
for<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.299> bristlenose<00:02:56.630> plate<00:02:57.019> goes<00:02:57.230> but<00:02:57.920> I

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
for the bristlenose plate goes but I

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.650 
for the bristlenose plate goes but I
don't<00:02:58.250> know<00:02:58.310> how<00:02:58.459> interested<00:02:59.030> they<00:02:59.060> are<00:02:59.330> in

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
don't know how interested they are in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.430 
don't know how interested they are in
those<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:01.220> we'll<00:03:01.430> see<00:03:01.610> I<00:03:01.819> do<00:03:02.420> have<00:03:02.750> quite<00:03:03.380> a

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
those but we'll see I do have quite a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.220 
those but we'll see I do have quite a
bit<00:03:03.500> java<00:03:03.920> moss<00:03:04.220> growing<00:03:04.730> in<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.900> two<00:03:06.110> of

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
bit java moss growing in the two of

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.089 
bit java moss growing in the two of
these<00:03:06.410> tanks<00:03:06.950> as<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:08.720> can<00:03:08.840> see<00:03:09.140> but<00:03:09.560> then<00:03:09.739> I

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
these tanks as you can see but then I

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.520 
these tanks as you can see but then I
haven't<00:03:10.670> transferred<00:03:11.359> some<00:03:11.750> yet<00:03:12.620> into<00:03:13.549> these

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
haven't transferred some yet into these

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.430 
haven't transferred some yet into these
two<00:03:15.530> tanks<00:03:16.040> on<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.940> side<00:03:17.150> as<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:18.019> can<00:03:18.170> see

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
two tanks on the side as you can see

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.920 
two tanks on the side as you can see
would<00:03:18.709> be<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.310> current<00:03:19.609> that<00:03:20.420> gets<00:03:20.660> created

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
would be the current that gets created

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.120 
would be the current that gets created
up<00:03:21.380> here<00:03:21.769> when<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.790> air<00:03:23.239> stones<00:03:23.600> are<00:03:23.810> on<00:03:24.130> the

up here when the air stones are on the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.550 
up here when the air stones are on the
waist<00:03:25.400> does<00:03:26.000> seem<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.480> accumulate<00:03:27.079> in<00:03:27.260> some

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
waist does seem to accumulate in some

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.300 
waist does seem to accumulate in some
corners<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:29.209> these<00:03:29.510> tanks<00:03:30.140> namely<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.130> back

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
corners of these tanks namely the back

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.690 
corners of these tanks namely the back
corner<00:03:31.730> there<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.810> front<00:03:33.049> corner<00:03:33.380> here

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
timers went out on the lights kind of a

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.290 
timers went out on the lights kind of a
comedic<00:04:23.960> way<00:04:24.170> to<00:04:24.230> end<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.590> episode<00:04:24.860> but<00:04:25.700> yeah

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
comedic way to end the episode but yeah

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.740 
comedic way to end the episode but yeah
as<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.750> was<00:04:26.780> saying<00:04:27.290> I<00:04:27.920> do<00:04:28.610> have<00:04:28.910> quite<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.180> few<00:04:29.270> of

as I was saying I do have quite a few of

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.070 
as I was saying I do have quite a few of
the<00:04:29.990> mystery<00:04:30.380> snails<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:31.330> they<00:04:32.330> are<00:04:32.480> doing<00:04:32.900> a

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
the mystery snails and they are doing a

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.650 
the mystery snails and they are doing a
good<00:04:33.470> job<00:04:33.530> at<00:04:34.040> cleaning<00:04:34.460> that<00:04:34.760> algae<00:04:35.210> off<00:04:35.480> the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
good job at cleaning that algae off the

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.980 
good job at cleaning that algae off the
glass<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:36.710> am<00:04:37.190> supplementing<00:04:38.000> them<00:04:38.180> with<00:04:38.690> some

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
glass I am supplementing them with some

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.250 
glass I am supplementing them with some
algae<00:04:39.350> wafers<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:40.040> some<00:04:40.790> fresh<00:04:41.510> cucumber<00:04:42.050> and

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
algae wafers and some fresh cucumber and

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.320 
algae wafers and some fresh cucumber and
this<00:04:43.220> seemed<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.490> be<00:04:43.580> digging<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:44.090> and

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
this seemed to be digging that and

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.870 
this seemed to be digging that and
they're<00:04:44.870> growing<00:04:45.350> really<00:04:45.530> fast<00:04:45.790> so<00:04:46.790> i'll

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
they're growing really fast so i'll

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.030 
they're growing really fast so i'll
probably<00:04:47.120> be<00:04:47.300> looking<00:04:47.630> to<00:04:47.840> sell<00:04:48.530> off<00:04:48.740> some<00:04:48.770> of

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
probably be looking to sell off some of

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.610 
probably be looking to sell off some of
the<00:04:49.600> frog<00:04:50.600> bit<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:51.940> some<00:04:52.940> of<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.620> mystery

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
the frog bit and some of the mystery
