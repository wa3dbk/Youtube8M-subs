this<00:00:02.690> is<00:00:02.870> a<00:00:02.900> short<00:00:03.259> video<00:00:03.469> I<00:00:03.679> made<00:00:04.040> on<00:00:04.310> the

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.490 
this is a short video I made on the

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.140 
this is a short video I made on the
mystery<00:00:05.090> of<00:00:05.390> Leonardo's<00:00:06.290> mirror<00:00:07.040> writing

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.080 

here's<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.360> typical<00:00:13.050> sample<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:14.130> his<00:00:14.640> mere

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
here's a typical sample of his mere

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.440 
here's a typical sample of his mere
writing<00:00:15.480> from<00:00:15.840> one<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.110> his<00:00:16.230> famous<00:00:16.530> pictures

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
writing from one of his famous pictures

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.990 
writing from one of his famous pictures
there<00:00:18.450> are<00:00:18.480> three<00:00:18.900> proposed<00:00:19.619> reasons<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.730> his

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
there are three proposed reasons for his

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.940 
there are three proposed reasons for his
mere<00:00:21.210> writing<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:21.869> he<00:00:22.230> was<00:00:22.410> trying<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> make

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
mere writing one he was trying to make

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.740 
mere writing one he was trying to make
it<00:00:23.070> harder<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.460> people<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.119> read<00:00:24.330> his<00:00:24.510> notes

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
it harder for people to read his notes

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.940 
it harder for people to read his notes
and<00:00:25.050> steal<00:00:25.349> his<00:00:25.500> ideas<00:00:26.900> two<00:00:27.900> he<00:00:28.529> was<00:00:28.740> hiding

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
and steal his ideas two he was hiding

and steal his ideas two he was hiding
his<00:00:29.279> scientific<00:00:29.759> ideas<00:00:30.270> from<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.689> Catholic

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
his scientific ideas from the Catholic

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.040 
his scientific ideas from the Catholic
Church<00:00:31.759> whose<00:00:32.759> teachings<00:00:33.270> he<00:00:33.630> disagreed<00:00:34.560> with

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
Church whose teachings he disagreed with

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.200 
Church whose teachings he disagreed with
three<00:00:37.050> writing<00:00:37.680> left<00:00:37.920> handed<00:00:38.399> from<00:00:38.670> left<00:00:39.090> to

three writing left handed from left to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.450 
three writing left handed from left to
right<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> was<00:00:39.870> messy<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.829> ink<00:00:41.040> just

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
right it was messy because the ink just

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.209 
right it was messy because the ink just
put<00:00:42.030> down<00:00:42.270> would<00:00:42.660> smear<00:00:43.199> as<00:00:43.410> his<00:00:43.710> hand<00:00:43.980> moved

put down would smear as his hand moved

put down would smear as his hand moved
across<00:00:44.489> -<00:00:46.430> those<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.609> the<00:00:47.640> three<00:00:48.090> proposed

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
across - those are the three proposed

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.580 
across - those are the three proposed
reasons<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.480> nobody<00:00:51.480> knows<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.719> sure<00:00:51.929> why<00:00:52.410> he

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
reasons and nobody knows for sure why he

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.150 
reasons and nobody knows for sure why he
did<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
did it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
did it
but<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.870> an<00:00:55.019> interesting<00:00:56.269> mystery<00:00:57.269> and<00:00:57.660> in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
but it is an interesting mystery and in

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.660 
but it is an interesting mystery and in
this<00:00:58.379> video<00:00:58.679> I'm<00:00:58.829> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.100> propose<00:00:59.399> another

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
this video I'm going to propose another

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.070 
this video I'm going to propose another
reason<00:01:01.160> my<00:01:02.160> idea<00:01:02.519> is<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.539> backward

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
reason my idea is that the backward

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.670 
reason my idea is that the backward
writing<00:01:04.880> draws<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.270> into<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.840> picture<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
writing draws one into the picture and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.810 
writing draws one into the picture and
traditional<00:01:10.680> forward<00:01:11.130> writing<00:01:11.520> can

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
traditional forward writing can

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.800 
traditional forward writing can
sometimes<00:01:12.659> stop<00:01:13.200> further<00:01:13.590> investigation

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.660 

why<00:01:17.810> because<00:01:18.230> if<00:01:18.440> we<00:01:18.620> know<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.280> name<00:01:19.490> of

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
why because if we know the name of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.700 
why because if we know the name of
something<00:01:20.060> we<00:01:20.240> often<00:01:20.570> think<00:01:20.750> we<00:01:20.990> understand

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
something we often think we understand

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.370 
something we often think we understand
it

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.399 

the<00:01:26.860> backward<00:01:27.280> reading<00:01:27.610> forces<00:01:28.240> one<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.689> go

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
the backward reading forces one to go

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.679 
the backward reading forces one to go
into<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.950> picture<00:01:30.250> more<00:01:30.400> closely<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.360> notice

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
into the picture more closely and notice

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.870 
into the picture more closely and notice
if<00:01:31.869> you<00:01:31.990> go<00:01:32.140> inside<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.979> picture<00:01:33.340> you<00:01:33.640> can

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
if you go inside the picture you can

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.789 
if you go inside the picture you can
read<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.330> writing<00:01:34.479> for<00:01:34.990> example<00:01:35.080> in<00:01:35.619> this

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
read the writing for example in this

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.550 
read the writing for example in this
picture<00:01:36.190> if<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.490> put<00:01:37.090> yourself<00:01:37.540> inside<00:01:37.810> the

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
picture if you put yourself inside the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.889 
picture if you put yourself inside the
picture<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.159> can<00:01:39.369> read<00:01:39.549> the<00:01:39.729> title<00:01:39.970> at<00:01:40.840> the

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
picture you can read the title at the

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:47.399 
picture you can read the title at the
top<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:42.189> view<00:01:42.520> from<00:01:43.090> tower<00:01:44.009> 26<00:01:46.409> here's

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
top the view from tower 26 here's

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.480 
top the view from tower 26 here's
another<00:01:47.649> example<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:50.259> you<00:01:50.710> put<00:01:50.920> yourself<00:01:51.250> in

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
another example if you put yourself in

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.270 
another example if you put yourself in
the<00:01:51.640> picture<00:01:51.970> you<00:01:52.270> can<00:01:52.299> read<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:53.049> writing<00:01:56.280> and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
the picture you can read the writing and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.100 
the picture you can read the writing and
when<00:01:57.549> I<00:01:57.580> am<00:01:57.789> working<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.270> sometimes<00:01:58.539> use

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
when I am working I sometimes use

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.440 
when I am working I sometimes use
backward<00:01:59.619> writing<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.580> keep<00:02:00.940> myself<00:02:01.119> focused

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
backward writing to keep myself focused

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.809 
backward writing to keep myself focused
on<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.990> subject<00:02:02.470> matter<00:02:02.649> rather<00:02:03.369> than<00:02:03.700> the

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
on the subject matter rather than the

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.219 
on the subject matter rather than the
words<00:02:04.440> here's<00:02:05.440> some<00:02:05.649> examples<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:07.780> my<00:02:07.840> own

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
words here's some examples of my own

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.600 
words here's some examples of my own
work

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.280 

if<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.820> focus<00:02:16.360> on<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.570> writing<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.080> do

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
if you focus on the writing and do

if you focus on the writing and do
manage<00:02:17.710> to<00:02:17.740> read<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.280> will<00:02:18.400> often<00:02:18.640> find

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
manage to read it you will often find

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.440 
manage to read it you will often find
yourself<00:02:19.240> inside<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.290> picture<00:02:21.450> here's

another example if you try to read it
you<00:02:25.780> find<00:02:26.080> yourself<00:02:26.500> inside<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.700> picture<00:02:30.330> and

from my own my own work my

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.440 
from my own my own work my
this<00:02:38.829> could<00:02:39.189> be<00:02:39.310> tested<00:02:39.730> with<00:02:39.879> an<00:02:40.090> eye

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
this could be tested with an eye

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.649 
this could be tested with an eye
tracking<00:02:41.170> device<00:02:41.939> which<00:02:42.939> would<00:02:43.090> show<00:02:43.360> where

tracking device which would show where
the<00:02:43.810> person<00:02:44.140> was<00:02:44.230> looking<00:02:44.439> for<00:02:45.010> both<00:02:45.189> the

the person was looking for both the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.369 
the person was looking for both the
forward<00:02:45.610> writing<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.540> backward<00:02:46.780> writing

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
forward writing and the backward writing

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.979 
forward writing and the backward writing
and<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:48.700> poor<00:02:48.909> writing<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.480> think<00:02:49.510> they<00:02:49.840> would

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
and the poor writing I think they would

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.899 
and the poor writing I think they would
just<00:02:50.170> look<00:02:50.739> at<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.950> forward<00:02:51.189> writing<00:02:51.700> and

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
just look at the forward writing and

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.670 
just look at the forward writing and
tend<00:02:52.269> not<00:02:52.329> to<00:02:52.450> look<00:02:52.689> at<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> picture<00:02:53.260> as<00:02:53.409> much

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
tend not to look at the picture as much

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.840 
tend not to look at the picture as much
as<00:02:54.129> in<00:02:54.939> the<00:02:54.970> backward<00:02:55.510> writing
