but<00:01:45.740> i<00:01:45.799> think<00:01:46.039> that<00:01:46.159> it's<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.399> really<00:01:46.850> smart

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
but i think that it's a really smart

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.239 
but i think that it's a really smart
thing<00:01:47.810> for<00:01:47.840> them<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.350> put<00:01:48.499> out<00:01:48.619> dlc<00:01:49.070> that's

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
thing for them to put out dlc that's

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:50.800 
thing for them to put out dlc that's
completely<00:01:49.670> free<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.240> don't<00:01:50.570> think<00:01:50.689> that<00:01:50.719> I

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
completely free I don't think that I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.679 
completely free I don't think that I
know<00:01:50.899> anybody<00:01:51.380> who<00:01:51.710> doesn't<00:01:52.310> like<00:01:52.670> valve<00:01:52.999> like

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.770 
know anybody who doesn't like valve like
who<00:01:54.049> is<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.200> gamer<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.859> doesn't<00:01:55.310> like<00:01:55.429> valve

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
who is a gamer and doesn't like valve

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.760 
who is a gamer and doesn't like valve
and<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:56.869> think<00:01:57.079> that<00:01:57.200> anything<00:01:57.499> that<00:01:57.530> they<00:01:57.710> do

can<00:02:45.319> have<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.859> think<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:46.909> idea<00:02:47.120> is

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
can have it I think that this idea is

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.229 
can have it I think that this idea is
going<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.599> backfire<00:02:48.790> but<00:02:49.790> for<00:02:49.939> those<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.090> you

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
going to backfire but for those of you

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.119 
going to backfire but for those of you
who<00:02:50.359> are<00:02:50.419> desperate<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.959> have<00:02:51.139> it<00:02:51.319> be<00:02:51.859> aware

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
who are desperate to have it be aware

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.250 
who are desperate to have it be aware
that<00:02:52.459> there<00:02:53.000> may<00:02:53.150> be<00:02:53.180> limited<00:02:53.569> copies<00:02:54.139> no

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
that there may be limited copies no

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.080 
that there may be limited copies no
matter<00:02:54.439> where<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.829> go<00:02:54.859> they're<00:02:55.609> limiting<00:02:55.970> the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
matter where you go they're limiting the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.460 
matter where you go they're limiting the
number<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.329> copies<00:02:56.569> to<00:02:56.840> all<00:02:56.870> retailers

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
number of copies to all retailers

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.500 
number of copies to all retailers
regardless<00:02:58.129> of<00:02:58.250> how<00:02:58.340> big<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.819> retailer<00:02:59.239> is

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
regardless of how big the retailer is

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.800 
regardless of how big the retailer is
which<00:03:00.169> is<00:03:00.290> also<00:03:00.409> frustrating<00:03:01.069> so<00:03:01.669> I<00:03:02.120> don't<00:03:02.719> I

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
which is also frustrating so I don't I

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.670 
which is also frustrating so I don't I
think<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:03.109> this<00:03:03.230> is<00:03:03.290> going<00:03:03.439> to<00:03:03.500> backfire

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
think that this is going to backfire

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.970 
think that this is going to backfire
really<00:03:04.159> badly<00:03:04.310> ocarina<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.120> time<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.569> um<00:03:05.980> well

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
really badly ocarina of time is um well

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.670 
really badly ocarina of time is um well
it's<00:03:07.310> it's<00:03:07.939> my<00:03:08.840> favorite<00:03:09.230> game<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.409> all<00:03:09.620> time

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
it's it's my favorite game of all time

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.280 
it's it's my favorite game of all time
and<00:03:10.159> I<00:03:10.969> think<00:03:11.060> that<00:03:11.510> they<00:03:11.629> are<00:03:11.659> making<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:12.109> big

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
and I think that they are making a big
