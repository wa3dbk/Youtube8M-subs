I think acting there's a lot less
pressure<00:03:20.780> with<00:03:21.109> it<00:03:21.459> in<00:03:22.459> my<00:03:22.600> opinion<00:03:23.600> just

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
pressure with it in my opinion just

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.900 
pressure with it in my opinion just
because<00:03:24.230> I've<00:03:24.560> been<00:03:24.709> singing<00:03:25.100> you<00:03:25.370> know<00:03:25.430> Momo
