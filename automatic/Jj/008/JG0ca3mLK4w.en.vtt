00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.570
 when he walks into the football field he doesn't 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.090
 understands nothing he sees green but not 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.349
 find out the truth 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.269
 he coaches the local football team 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.929
 despite the fact that moving in his brain 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.199
 white object is not associated with the ball 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.579
 Karelin uses his memories to 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.100
 the accident that hurt 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.179
 his brain 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.769
 not allowing now to understand that 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:22.550
 located directly 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.329
 before him, these images can very actively 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.099
 hide how little fact after all 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.269
 I still have a search for buildings 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.569
 subjects based on my visuals 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.379
 memories and ability 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.260
 represent he combine green field 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.130
 white round ball you hit them 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.240
 but when project players turn out 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.540
 together blocking each other and dump 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.430
 field site I can not say that 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.410
 there are thunderings 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.320
 different classes and movements 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.970
 savers and here 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.030
 China 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.220
 but only images in the head allow 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.870
 Kerimov to cope with the outside world 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.290
 Citizens of the brain did not affect the 5 th although 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.680
 identification system 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 completely destroyed 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.960
 keep going 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.450
 what is the plate with the inscription 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.909
 little thing why don't you go take her 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.560
 lead take 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 close your eyes 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.080
 the commissioner looks like an old record at 45 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.080
 turns 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.560
 for such a sbu itself now has an image that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.400
 this is in the administration this 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.870
 45 rpm plate 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.580
 center and there is no order strange but 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.620
 everyone can take advantage 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.110
 with your imagination to present those 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.020
 objects that in the real world learn 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.830
 can not 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.700
 Baku 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.030
 let's move on and press 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.310
 for the beginning, do not draw 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.759
 something like 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.759
 tough counters which is good 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.629
 let it be 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.499
 stiff brush 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:15.340
 we know 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.090
 the owner is now separate sirens 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.110
 is a very vivid example of a person 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.019
 which although not able to recognize 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.910
 subjects are nevertheless able to see 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.160
 all day the same subject world 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.260
 eyes for your brain with we don't know 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.929
 tsahal 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.759
 it turns out it means saying he is capable 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.019
 create very detailed yet 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.219
 baggage connection visual mentally 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.219
 Ilyich images of bees 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.359
 now how very good she is 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.569
 something like a pen and it goes down 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.229
 bristles yes I promise to give 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:49.439
 this depth 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.209
 this is not something two-dimensional this 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.339
 3D drawing 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.349
 Katya powder 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.079
 there seems to be a complete discrepancy 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.560
 between what the term is able to see and 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.320
 what is he capable of 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.339
 well and the brazilians 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.059
 rivals he can't create 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:07.259
 own hands 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:10.259
 at least imagine that it is 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.989
 tape recorder 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.939
 if it is a bicycle at all 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.499
 signers you yourself drew it before 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:26.409
 these are your kids drawing a bicycle like you 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.609
 this drawing seems familiar to me 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.609
 so no it does not look like a bicycle 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.040
 2 to which 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.420
 Kevin's condition show break 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.119
 between the brain areas creating images 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.969
 and areas that we use for 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:41.989
 perceptions 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.199
 and since these two systems are combined 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.299
 the existence of people like lost 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.579
 complicates significantly 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.609
 understanding of how the mantra historian 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:51.699
 combination 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.930
 all the individual components of the images 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.150
 decree shots don't seem to brain not 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.549
 there was a clear area where the line and 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.359
 rear projection combined 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.469
 clear up 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.649
 with summer atlanta clearly interpreting 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.409
 money in a bikini surrounding in the assessment 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.409
 parts of the world plummeting 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:13.809
 m ford think such an area in 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:15.839
 reality not only mikhaleva if 

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.689
 could even go look in 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.639
 brain if this area is not for us 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.759
 managed bn find her
