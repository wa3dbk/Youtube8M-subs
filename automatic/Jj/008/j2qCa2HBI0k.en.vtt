00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.759 
don't really like a shoe that has too
many<00:00:23.310> colors<00:00:23.609> let<00:00:24.199> loads<00:00:25.199> really<00:00:25.500> bright

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
many colors let loads really bright

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.349 
many colors let loads really bright
color<00:00:26.099> ways<00:00:26.340> i<00:00:26.550> don't<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:26.910> like<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.180> I

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
color ways i don't really like that I

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.349 
color ways i don't really like that I
July<00:00:27.630> simple<00:00:28.080> colors<00:00:29.000> exactly<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.179> this

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
July simple colors exactly like this

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.139 
July simple colors exactly like this
just<00:00:30.630> playing<00:00:30.929> black<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.410> white<00:00:31.820> with<00:00:32.820> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
just playing black and white with a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.110 
just playing black and white with a
course<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.690> thee<00:00:34.610> then<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.969> see

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
course with thee then if you can see

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.920 
course with thee then if you can see
that<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:37.940> period<00:00:38.940> signature<00:00:39.780> right

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that but the period signature right

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.560 
that but the period signature right
there<00:00:40.700> that's<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> best<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.180> think<00:00:42.210> that's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
there that's the best I think that's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.319 
there that's the best I think that's
really<00:00:42.719> good<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.489> think<00:00:44.489> then<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.180> see

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
really good I think then if you can see

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.020 
really good I think then if you can see
but<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.539> look<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.430> bucket<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.850> kind

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
but they look a little bucket it's kind

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.000 
but they look a little bucket it's kind
of<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.180> little<00:00:48.390> arrow<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.230> back<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.649> figure

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
of a little arrow at the back I figure

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.869 
of a little arrow at the back I figure
this<00:00:50.940> looks<00:00:51.930> kind<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.260> weird<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.640> can't

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
this looks kind of weird but you can't

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.189 
this looks kind of weird but you can't
really<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.539> when<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.719> wearing<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
really see it like when you wearing it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.279 
really see it like when you wearing it
so<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.680> don't<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:55.949> mind<00:00:56.719> but<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:58.109> looks

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
so I don't really mind but it looks

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.790 
so I don't really mind but it looks
really<00:00:58.500> good<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.600> think<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.989> I'll<00:01:01.500> definitely

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
really good I think and I'll definitely

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680 
really good I think and I'll definitely
give<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.280> nine<00:01:02.730> point<00:01:02.969> five<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> ten

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
give it a nine point five out of ten

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.980 
give it a nine point five out of ten
easily<00:01:05.540> okay<00:01:06.540> now<00:01:06.750> skate<00:01:07.560> skate<00:01:08.159> ability<00:01:08.700> I

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.070 
and obviously you can see hasn't really
affected<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.849> looks<00:02:09.090> there's<00:02:09.599> not

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
affected it like the looks there's not

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.850 
affected it like the looks there's not
only<00:02:10.200> ripped<00:02:10.530> yet<00:02:11.060> okay

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
only ripped yet okay

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.430 
only ripped yet okay
so<00:02:13.860> skate<00:02:14.250> ability<00:02:14.700> are<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.270> would<00:02:15.540> rate<00:02:15.720> rate

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
so skate ability are I would rate rate

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.620 
so skate ability are I would rate rate
it<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.890> an<00:02:17.280> 8<00:02:17.580> because<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.120> haven't<00:02:18.360> really

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
it and an 8 because I haven't really

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.990 
it and an 8 because I haven't really
skated<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.530> much<00:02:19.800> but<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:20.340> far<00:02:20.610> it's<00:02:20.819> like

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
skated that much but so far it's like

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.480 
skated that much but so far it's like
really<00:02:21.990> good<00:02:22.200> okay<00:02:23.130> next<00:02:24.060> durability<00:02:24.840> Oh<00:02:25.490> see

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
really good okay next durability Oh see

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.720 
really good okay next durability Oh see
I<00:02:26.670> can't<00:02:26.970> comment<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:27.990> much<00:02:28.230> either

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
I can't comment on this much either

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.720 
I can't comment on this much either
sounds<00:02:29.730> skated<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.209> much<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:30.780> ah<00:02:31.160> as<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.580> can

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
sounds skated a much but ah as you can

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.270 
sounds skated a much but ah as you can
see<00:02:32.910> there<00:02:33.090> are<00:02:33.180> no<00:02:33.300> luck<00:02:33.560> not<00:02:34.560> only<00:02:34.680> big<00:02:34.920> rips

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
see there are no luck not only big rips

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.310 
see there are no luck not only big rips
or<00:02:35.640> marks<00:02:36.540> yet<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.390> probably<00:02:39.870> give<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.200> an

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
or marks yet so I probably give it an

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.490 
or marks yet so I probably give it an
eight<00:02:40.470> as<00:02:40.650> well<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:42.450> course<00:02:42.720> I'm<00:02:42.900> going<00:02:43.440> to

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
eight as well of course I'm going to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.220

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
have to skate it a bit more to properly

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.870 
have to skate it a bit more to properly
properly<00:02:46.230> test<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.310> durability<00:02:47.670> out<00:02:48.060> but

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
properly test it the durability out but

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.449

all-around good shoe I think so I'd
probably<00:03:55.290> rate<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.769> easily<00:03:57.200> 99.5<00:03:58.200> out<00:03:58.440> of<00:03:58.530> 10

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
probably rate it easily 99.5 out of 10
