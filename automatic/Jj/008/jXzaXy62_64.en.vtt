00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:04.279 
here's what we need for today's lessons

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.280 
here's what we need for today's lessons
let's<00:00:05.279> take<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.640> piece<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:05.970> eye<00:00:06.450> pain<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.080> put

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
let's take a piece of eye pain and put

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.049 
let's take a piece of eye pain and put
it<00:00:07.410> through<00:00:07.620> six<00:00:08.040> millimeters<00:00:08.700> glasses<00:00:09.450> be

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
it through six millimeters glasses be

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.589 
it through six millimeters glasses be
we're<00:00:12.059> gonna<00:00:12.240> make<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.840> loop<00:00:13.110> at<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.500> end<00:00:14.599> first

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
we're gonna make a loop at the end first

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.099 
we're gonna make a loop at the end first
of<00:00:15.750> all<00:00:15.870> let's<00:00:16.740> bend<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.460> wire<00:00:17.760> first<00:00:18.270> about

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
of all let's bend the wire first about

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.820 
of all let's bend the wire first about
90<00:00:19.560> degree<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.840> leave<00:00:21.840> about<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.289> centimeter

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
90 degree and leave about one centimeter

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.259 
90 degree and leave about one centimeter
and<00:00:23.460> cut<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.300> rest<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.750> wire<00:00:25.050> off<00:00:27.830> and<00:00:29.269> then

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
and cut the rest of wire off and then

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.830 
and cut the rest of wire off and then
loop<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.929> circle<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.710> end<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:35.420> like<00:00:36.420> this

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
loop a circle at the end just like this

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.660 
loop a circle at the end just like this
and<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.520> little<00:00:38.640> bit<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.590> next<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.370> we're

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and just a little bit the next one we're

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.010 
and just a little bit the next one we're
gonna<00:00:41.879> make<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.270> bugle<00:00:42.809> bead<00:00:43.850> make<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.210> circle<00:00:45.840> at

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
gonna make a bugle bead make a circle at

00:00:46.020 --> 00:01:00.020 
gonna make a bugle bead make a circle at
the<00:00:46.050> end<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:49.440> need<00:00:49.680> six<00:00:50.070> piece<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:59.030> okay

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the end we need six piece of this okay

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.970 
the end we need six piece of this okay
just<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.629> bit

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
just a little bit

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.040 
just a little bit

make sure that me and tidy now we need a
piece<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.770> jump<00:01:08.040> ring<00:01:08.270> actually<00:01:09.270> small<00:01:10.140> jump

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
piece of a jump ring actually small jump

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.080 
piece of a jump ring actually small jump
ring<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.450> then<00:01:12.450> we're<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> come<00:01:13.260> by<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
ring and then we're going to come by a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.010 
ring and then we're going to come by a
teardrop<00:01:15.090> shape<00:01:15.510> glasses<00:01:16.380> being<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:18.020> twist

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
teardrop shape glasses being here twist

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.790 
teardrop shape glasses being here twist
the<00:01:19.110> jump<00:01:19.440> ring<00:01:19.740> open<00:01:23.690> and<00:01:24.690> then<00:01:25.229> put<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
the jump ring open and then put the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.290 
the jump ring open and then put the
beads<00:01:26.040> into<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.820> jump<00:01:27.090> ring<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:32.060> twist<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
beads into the jump ring and twist it

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:41.139 
beads into the jump ring and twist it
bad<00:01:35.450> make<00:01:36.450> sure<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.930> close<00:01:37.259> completely<00:01:40.009> and

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
bad make sure you close completely and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.300 
bad make sure you close completely and
then<00:01:42.149> we're<00:01:42.390> going<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.630> take<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> large<00:01:43.500> pieces

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
then we're going to take a large pieces

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.529 
then we're going to take a large pieces
jump<00:01:45.000> ring<00:01:45.300> here<00:01:46.399> twist<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.610> open<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:50.610> then

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
jump ring here twist it open and then

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.650 
jump ring here twist it open and then
we're<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.990> put<00:01:52.380> three<00:01:53.250> pieces<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.880> bugle

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
we're going to put three pieces of bugle

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.620 
we're going to put three pieces of bugle
beads<00:01:54.929> here<00:01:55.580> which<00:01:56.580> we<00:01:56.910> made<00:01:57.179> earlier<00:01:59.630> and

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
beads here which we made earlier and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.450 
beads here which we made earlier and
then<00:02:00.810> we're<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.200> put<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.740> teardrop

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
then we're going to put the teardrop

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.630 
then we're going to put the teardrop
shape<00:02:02.940> beads<00:02:03.929> here<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.890> then<00:02:05.340> put<00:02:05.610> another

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
shape beads here and then put another

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.520 
shape beads here and then put another
three<00:02:06.479> bugle<00:02:06.899> beads<00:02:07.170> into<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.190> jump<00:02:08.459> ring<00:02:09.530> at

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
three bugle beads into the jump ring at

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.650 
three bugle beads into the jump ring at
the<00:02:10.709> end<00:02:10.920> we're<00:02:11.580> gonna<00:02:11.819> put<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.360> six

the end we're gonna put the six

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.830 
the end we're gonna put the six
millimeters<00:02:13.349> classes<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.160> here<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.840> close

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
millimeters classes be here and close

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.470 
millimeters classes be here and close
the<00:02:16.170> jump<00:02:16.380> ring<00:02:18.980> kate<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.550> lace<00:02:23.480> then

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
the jump ring kate is like lace then

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.180 
the jump ring kate is like lace then
we're<00:02:24.930> going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.140> twist<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.830> loop<00:02:26.069> at<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.450> end

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
we're going to twist the loop at the end

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.970 
we're going to twist the loop at the end
to<00:02:29.190> come<00:02:29.459> by<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.870> ear<00:02:31.140> wire<00:02:31.440> here<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:34.530> close

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
to come by the ear wire here and close

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.740 
to come by the ear wire here and close
the<00:02:35.670> root<00:02:37.130> ok<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.489> just<00:02:38.520> finish<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.420> next

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
the root ok you just finish the next

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.349 
the root ok you just finish the next
lesson<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.410> hope<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.580> enjoy<00:02:42.349> bye
