00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.070
 I stayed 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.229
 the coconut village 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.229
 is one of those that have expanded the most in recent years 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.980
 this has been occurring because the demand for coconut water to consume nature 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.840
 and the demand is little compared to the industry, 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.820
 very 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.260
 In parallel, it is due to the expansion of coconut 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.350
 the demand for proven quality seedlings has also grown 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.280
 This is due to the fact that the change corresponds to one of the most 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.520
 of the productive process 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.559
 wants to be responsible for providing productions to the actors both in quality 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.700
 as in quantity provided there are suitable conditions of cultivation 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.860
 thus 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.340
 It's quite clear. 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.820
 and on the one hand there is a considerable increase in the number of 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.900
 producers of coconut and also of the planted area 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.760
 for another 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.490
 it is also necessary to have 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.490
 increases in the supply of good quality seedlings 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.980
 on this 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.840
 has produced more than 70 courses in the series Cultivation and Body Processing for 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.600
 which we belong to the technical coordination of the agronomist luiz angelo 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.090
 mirizola son 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.180
 specialist in coconut palm 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.440
 here will be presented in detail 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.250
 the main techniques that should be adopted in the whole process of 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.520
 production of coconut seedlings so the information will be directed 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.030
 for those who want to produce seedlings both the motorcycle 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.270
 such as non-commercial hybrids 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.939
 but there is no doubt that they will also serve to guide the 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.240
 people who want to cultivate new areas with little 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.220
 as to the choice of voice and lists and thus of good quality seedlings 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.980
 I currently have an increasing consumption 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.959
 coconut water 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.200
 together with this consumption requires an increase in planting, ie in the planted area 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.329
 recovered 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.179
 although there is then we change seedlings producer in the market 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.539
 quality seedlings are difficult to find 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:36.149
 through the children course you will learn in a way and aware how 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:38.909
 produce a high quality change 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.319
 to meet this new demand for better standard seedlings 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.119
 these seedlings 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.049
 and these producers must be certified by the taste and exchangers 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.399
 state 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:54.809
 where the celebration took place the inspection of these seedlings 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.569
 also occurs 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.739
 a monitoring in the state so that these seedlings are certified and can be 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.349
 marketed 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.769
 in other states 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.180
 to fulfill our objective, which is to present the main information to 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.529
 respect to the production process of coconut seedlings 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:14.519
 and he came 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.399
 we split the movie into two parts 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:21.239
 in the first he presented the process of production of coconut seedlings 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.439
 dwarf and in the second the process of production of hybrid coconut 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:30.189
 in the part concerning the production of dwarf coconut seedlings we will speak 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.209
 respect the matrices 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.209
 selection and preparation of seeds 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.599
 characteristics of the nursery 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.290
 and the selection and preparation of the seedlings to be planted 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.059
 in the second part when we will focus on the production of coconut seedlings 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.059
 hybrid we will talk about matrices 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.299
 of the field of production 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.299
 the selection of the parent plant and the parent plant 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.359
 collection and preparation of pollen 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.509
 and artificial pollination
