other<00:02:22.860> people<00:02:23.220> who<00:02:23.459> took<00:02:23.640> them<00:02:23.850> tendras<00:02:24.360> or<00:02:24.690> so

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
other people who took them tendras or so

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.210 
other people who took them tendras or so
to<00:02:25.740> actually<00:02:26.070> find<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.850> park<00:02:27.120> there<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.190> yeah<00:02:29.190> I

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
to actually find it park there so yeah I

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.730 
to actually find it park there so yeah I
don't<00:02:29.490> know<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.330> don't<00:02:30.990> go<00:02:31.170> saying<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:31.650> not

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
don't know so don't go saying it's not

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.600 
don't know so don't go saying it's not
working<00:02:32.280> but<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.840> third<00:02:34.200> method<00:02:34.560> which<00:02:35.250> i

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
working but the third method which i

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.570 
working but the third method which i
think<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:36.090> probably<00:02:36.330> just<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.989> easiest<00:02:37.580> you

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
think is probably just the easiest you

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.400 
think is probably just the easiest you
go<00:02:39.300> start<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.840> new<00:02:40.020> character<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:43.140> do<00:02:43.290> the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
go start a new character and you do the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.920 
go start a new character and you do the
beginning<00:02:43.800> race<00:02:44.010> with<00:02:44.550> Michaels<00:02:45.120> card<00:02:45.390> obey

beginning race with Michaels card obey
tailgater<00:02:46.519> after<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.610> race<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:48.030> get<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.330> keep

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
tailgater after the race you get to keep

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.990 
tailgater after the race you get to keep

give them the car let them sit there
with<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.250> you're<00:03:08.250> going<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.400> swap<00:03:08.640> your

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
with it and you're going to swap your

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.840 
with it and you're going to swap your
character<00:03:09.360> join<00:03:09.870> back<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.680> take<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.610> car<00:03:11.820> off

them and store it in your garage that

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.430 
them and store it in your garage that
that's<00:03:14.340> probably<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.850> easiest<00:03:14.880> method<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440
