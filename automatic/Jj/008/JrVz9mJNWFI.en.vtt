00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
look at the figure and see if it was

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.580 
look at the figure and see if it was
worth<00:00:31.000> getting<00:00:31.210> they<00:00:31.900> wanted<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.200> update<00:00:32.470> it

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
worth getting they wanted to update it

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.590 
worth getting they wanted to update it
thoughts<00:00:32.830> on<00:00:33.160> it<00:00:33.340> so<00:00:33.489> I<00:00:33.550> figured<00:00:33.910> I<00:00:34.059> will<00:00:34.450> give

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
thoughts on it so I figured I will give

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.630 
thoughts on it so I figured I will give
them<00:00:34.750> updated<00:00:35.170> thoughts<00:00:35.470> on<00:00:35.710> it<00:00:36.010> maybe<00:00:36.340> we'll

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
them updated thoughts on it maybe we'll

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.280 
them updated thoughts on it maybe we'll
see<00:00:36.820> if<00:00:36.940> it's<00:00:37.090> any<00:00:37.120> different<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:37.720> have<00:00:37.750> no<00:00:38.020> idea

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
see if it's any different I have no idea

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.530 
see if it's any different I have no idea
what<00:00:38.410> I<00:00:38.440> said<00:00:38.620> originally<00:00:39.190> so<00:00:39.400> you<00:00:40.330> guys<00:00:40.480> are

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
what I said originally so you guys are

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.270 
what I said originally so you guys are
gonna<00:00:40.660> have<00:00:40.780> to<00:00:40.840> let<00:00:40.960> me<00:00:41.050> know<00:00:41.170> he's<00:00:41.890> just<00:00:42.160> shy

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
gonna have to let me know he's just shy

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.610 
gonna have to let me know he's just shy
of<00:00:42.309> 8<00:00:42.580> inches<00:00:42.760> tall<00:00:43.120> so<00:00:43.480> pretty<00:00:43.720> much<00:00:43.930> the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
of 8 inches tall so pretty much the

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.829 
of 8 inches tall so pretty much the
proper<00:00:45.010> size<00:00:45.220> for<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.000> figure<00:00:46.269> he's<00:00:46.420> got<00:00:46.600> some

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
proper size for the figure he's got some

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.270 
proper size for the figure he's got some
decent<00:00:47.140> bulk<00:00:47.620> to<00:00:47.949> him

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
decent bulk to him

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.180 
decent bulk to him
looks<00:00:48.760> pretty<00:00:49.030> appropriate<00:00:49.479> I'd<00:00:50.170> say<00:00:50.589> for

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
looks pretty appropriate I'd say for

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.110 
looks pretty appropriate I'd say for
Ronan<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.629> it's<00:00:53.440> not<00:00:53.769> -<00:00:53.949> not<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.550> best<00:00:54.580> build

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
Ronan but it's not - not the best build

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.719 
Ronan but it's not - not the best build
a<00:00:55.210> figure<00:00:55.360> I'm<00:00:55.780> not<00:00:56.019> super<00:00:56.650> thrilled<00:00:56.830> with<00:00:57.519> it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
a figure I'm not super thrilled with it

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.030 
a figure I'm not super thrilled with it
his<00:00:58.239> little<00:00:58.449> hood<00:00:58.720> thing<00:00:58.989> he<00:00:59.080> comes<00:00:59.350> off<00:00:59.620> and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
his little hood thing he comes off and

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.119 
his little hood thing he comes off and
that's<00:01:00.699> what<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:00.940> looks<00:01:01.120> like<00:01:01.330> looks<00:01:01.750> okay<00:01:02.260> his

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
that's what it looks like looks okay his

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.090 
that's what it looks like looks okay his
head<00:01:03.430> looks<00:01:03.760> okay<00:01:04.449> it's<00:01:04.960> not<00:01:05.170> great<00:01:05.530> but<00:01:05.799> they

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
head looks okay it's not great but they

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.280 
head looks okay it's not great but they
didn't<00:01:06.340> do<00:01:06.430> a<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:07.540> harsh<00:01:07.990> lighting

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
didn't do a really harsh lighting

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.990 
didn't do a really harsh lighting
hopefully<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:08.770> can<00:01:08.860> see<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.130> alright<00:01:09.490> they

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
hopefully you can see it alright they

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.430 
hopefully you can see it alright they
put<00:01:10.240> some<00:01:10.420> blue<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.750> there<00:01:10.900> around<00:01:10.990> his<00:01:11.260> eyes

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
put some blue in there around his eyes

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.990 
put some blue in there around his eyes
and<00:01:11.650> a<00:01:11.740> little<00:01:12.040> bit<00:01:12.159> of<00:01:12.250> shading<00:01:12.549> on<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.790> face

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
and a little bit of shading on the face

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.749 
and a little bit of shading on the face
but<00:01:13.240> not<00:01:13.360> a<00:01:13.390> whole<00:01:13.630> lot<00:01:13.890> he<00:01:14.890> looks<00:01:15.100> ok<00:01:15.399> I<00:01:15.430> guess

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
but not a whole lot he looks ok I guess

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.480 
but not a whole lot he looks ok I guess
his<00:01:16.479> cape<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:17.289> actually<00:01:17.829> done<00:01:17.979> pretty<00:01:18.009> well

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
his cape is actually done pretty well

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.370 
his cape is actually done pretty well
the<00:01:18.909> sculpt<00:01:19.299> is<00:01:19.390> decent<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:20.049> it's<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.229> nice

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
the sculpt is decent and it's a nice

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.950 
the sculpt is decent and it's a nice
soft<00:01:20.649> material<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.850> it's<00:01:22.090> pretty<00:01:22.689> good

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
soft material so it's pretty good

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.870 
soft material so it's pretty good
there's<00:01:23.350> no<00:01:23.469> shading<00:01:23.829> on<00:01:24.070> it<00:01:24.250> but<00:01:24.430> I<00:01:24.460> think<00:01:24.759> it

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
there's no shading on it but I think it

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.940 
there's no shading on it but I think it
looks<00:01:25.119> alright<00:01:25.469> there's<00:01:26.469> not<00:01:26.619> really<00:01:26.770> any

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
looks alright there's not really any

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.999 
looks alright there's not really any
shading<00:01:27.399> on<00:01:27.520> any<00:01:27.759> part<00:01:28.060> of<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.210> figure<00:01:28.570> so<00:01:29.409> it

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
shading on any part of the figure so it

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.620 
shading on any part of the figure so it
doesn't<00:01:30.310> really<00:01:30.369> stand<00:01:30.670> out<00:01:30.880> as<00:01:31.060> looking<00:01:31.359> bad

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
doesn't really stand out as looking bad

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.440 
doesn't really stand out as looking bad
and<00:01:32.079> it<00:01:32.229> I<00:01:32.619> like<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.770> way<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.070> hangs<00:01:33.460> on<00:01:33.820> him<00:01:34.210> so

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
and it I like the way it hangs on him so

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.060 
and it I like the way it hangs on him so
that's<00:01:34.570> ok<00:01:34.960> we're<00:01:35.500> gonna<00:01:35.619> leave<00:01:35.799> it<00:01:35.920> off<00:01:36.039> for

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
that's ok we're gonna leave it off for

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.179 
that's ok we're gonna leave it off for
now<00:01:36.369> though<00:01:36.579> shoulders<00:01:37.359> have<00:01:37.719> a<00:01:38.049> ball<00:01:38.890> hinge

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
now though shoulders have a ball hinge

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.730 
now though shoulders have a ball hinge
but<00:01:39.640> no<00:01:40.030> bicep<00:01:40.240> swivel<00:01:40.869> built<00:01:41.049> in<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:41.500> it's<00:01:41.619> not

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
but no bicep swivel built in so it's not

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.010 
but no bicep swivel built in so it's not
really<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.100> true<00:01:42.429> ball<00:01:42.700> hinge<00:01:43.000> but<00:01:43.659> they're

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
really a true ball hinge but they're

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.419 
really a true ball hinge but they're
okay<00:01:44.409> I<00:01:44.439> guess<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:45.750> mean<00:01:46.750> that's<00:01:47.710> probably<00:01:47.979> good

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
okay I guess I mean that's probably good

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:49.770 
okay I guess I mean that's probably good
enough<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:48.880> always<00:01:49.149> better<00:01:49.299> to<00:01:49.420> have<00:01:49.479> advice

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
enough it's always better to have advice

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.620 
enough it's always better to have advice
what<00:01:50.079> biceps<00:01:50.679> swivel<00:01:51.130> though<00:01:51.509> sculpting<00:01:52.509> is<00:01:52.570> a

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
what biceps swivel though sculpting is a

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.859 
what biceps swivel though sculpting is a
little<00:01:52.869> strange<00:01:53.229> I<00:01:53.560> guess<00:01:54.189> it's<00:01:54.369> ok<00:01:54.729> we<00:01:55.719> do

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
little strange I guess it's ok we do

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.749 
little strange I guess it's ok we do
have<00:01:56.079> a<00:01:56.109> hinge<00:01:56.439> here<00:01:56.740> for<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.130> elbow<00:01:57.549> which

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
have a hinge here for the elbow which

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.389 
have a hinge here for the elbow which
also<00:01:57.999> gives<00:01:58.270> us<00:01:58.450> our<00:01:58.749> kind<00:01:59.229> of<00:01:59.350> quasi<00:01:59.859> bicep

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
also gives us our kind of quasi bicep

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.349 
also gives us our kind of quasi bicep
swivel<00:02:00.850> I'm<00:02:01.149> guessing<00:02:02.549> huh<00:02:03.549> that's<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.149> little

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
swivel I'm guessing huh that's a little

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.690 
swivel I'm guessing huh that's a little
weird<00:02:04.689> this<00:02:05.590> almost<00:02:05.979> looks<00:02:06.189> like<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.549> way

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
weird this almost looks like the way

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.240 
weird this almost looks like the way
this<00:02:06.880> is<00:02:07.060> sculpted<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:08.740> this<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:09.069> supposed

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
this is sculpted that this is supposed

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.220 
this is sculpted that this is supposed
to<00:02:09.580> be<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.270> other<00:02:10.390> side<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.020> then<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
to be the on the other side and then the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.740 
to be the on the other side and then the
other<00:02:11.350> hand<00:02:11.710> on<00:02:11.920> there<00:02:12.360> since<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.600> would

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
other hand on there since that would

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.780 
other hand on there since that would
fold<00:02:14.080> up<00:02:14.260> better<00:02:14.560> right<00:02:14.890> here<00:02:15.190> for<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.640> elbow

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
fold up better right here for the elbow

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.330 
fold up better right here for the elbow
hinge<00:02:16.300> but<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.200> don't<00:02:17.440> know<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:18.010> could<00:02:18.190> be<00:02:18.220> a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
hinge but I don't know it could be a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.310 
hinge but I don't know it could be a
defect<00:02:18.790> I'm<00:02:19.240> not<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.630> worried<00:02:19.900> about<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.140> cuz

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
defect I'm not that worried about it cuz

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.650 
defect I'm not that worried about it cuz
it's<00:02:20.470> pretty<00:02:20.560> mediocre<00:02:21.190> anyway<00:02:21.790> anyway<00:02:22.540> we

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
it's pretty mediocre anyway anyway we

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.420 
it's pretty mediocre anyway anyway we
have<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> wrist<00:02:23.050> swivel

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
have a wrist swivel

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.670 
have a wrist swivel
and<00:02:24.549> a<00:02:24.879> wrist<00:02:25.540> hinge<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.349> he's<00:02:26.500> got<00:02:26.650> a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
and a wrist hinge and he's got a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.069 
and a wrist hinge and he's got a
gripping<00:02:27.069> hand<00:02:27.310> for<00:02:27.760> his<00:02:28.060> hammer<00:02:28.390> which<00:02:28.780> done

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
gripping hand for his hammer which done

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.509 
gripping hand for his hammer which done
well<00:02:29.319> enough<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.739> got<00:02:29.890> some<00:02:30.099> paint<00:02:30.310> on<00:02:30.459> it

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
well enough it's got some paint on it

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.429 
well enough it's got some paint on it
and<00:02:30.760> some<00:02:30.909> sculpt<00:02:31.299> so<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.659> can't<00:02:32.049> complain<00:02:32.319> too

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
and some sculpt so I can't complain too

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.860 
and some sculpt so I can't complain too
much<00:02:32.709> it's<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.069> little<00:02:33.099> bit<00:02:33.370> soft<00:02:33.670> but<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.599> little

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
much it's a little bit soft but a little

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.020 
much it's a little bit soft but a little
hot<00:02:35.019> water<00:02:35.049> or<00:02:35.620> hairdryer<00:02:36.280> action<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.879> you'll

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
hot water or hairdryer action and you'll

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.199 
hot water or hairdryer action and you'll
be<00:02:37.230> right<00:02:38.230> as<00:02:38.409> rain<00:02:38.439> he<00:02:39.400> can<00:02:39.549> hold<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:39.969> so

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
be right as rain he can hold that so

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.300 
be right as rain he can hold that so
that's<00:02:40.420> pretty<00:02:40.629> good<00:02:40.840> same<00:02:41.500> articulation<00:02:41.769> on

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
that's pretty good same articulation on

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.319 
that's pretty good same articulation on
this<00:02:42.819> side<00:02:43.230> except<00:02:44.230> he<00:02:44.829> has<00:02:45.519> an<00:02:45.639> open<00:02:45.909> hand<00:02:46.120> on

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
this side except he has an open hand on

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.240 
this side except he has an open hand on
this<00:02:46.750> side<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.409> it<00:02:47.530> looks<00:02:47.680> like<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.920> sculpt

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
this side and it looks like the sculpt

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.979 
this side and it looks like the sculpt
is<00:02:48.340> about<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.849> same<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.239> on<00:02:49.359> that<00:02:49.510> side<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:49.930> I

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
is about the same is on that side so I

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.750 
is about the same is on that side so I
guess<00:02:50.170> they're<00:02:50.319> not<00:02:50.500> on<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:51.340> wrong<00:02:51.549> side

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
guess they're not on the wrong side

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.750 
guess they're not on the wrong side
after<00:02:52.090> all<00:02:53.129> pretty<00:02:54.129> limited<00:02:54.639> articulation

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
after all pretty limited articulation

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.670 
after all pretty limited articulation
all<00:02:55.510> around<00:02:55.810> though<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:56.170> mean<00:02:56.379> that's<00:02:56.560> all

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
all around though I mean that's all

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.830 
all around though I mean that's all
you're<00:02:56.799> gonna<00:02:56.889> get<00:02:57.129> out<00:02:57.189> of<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.519> bicep<00:02:57.970> or<00:02:58.269> out

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
you're gonna get out of the bicep or out

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.470 
you're gonna get out of the bicep or out
of<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.019> elbow<00:02:59.290> hinge<00:02:59.560> pretty<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.430> basic<00:03:00.819> he

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
of the elbow hinge pretty the basic he

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.360 
of the elbow hinge pretty the basic he
does<00:03:01.659> have<00:03:01.870> an<00:03:01.959> ab<00:03:02.139> crunch<00:03:02.500> when<00:03:02.889> most<00:03:03.099> of<00:03:03.250> the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
does have an ab crunch when most of the

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.399 
does have an ab crunch when most of the
figures<00:03:03.549> at<00:03:03.790> this<00:03:03.939> period<00:03:04.180> didn't<00:03:04.659> so<00:03:05.200> that's

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
figures at this period didn't so that's

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.199 
figures at this period didn't so that's
pretty<00:03:05.620> good<00:03:05.889> it's<00:03:06.370> pretty<00:03:06.669> limited<00:03:06.879> though

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
pretty good it's pretty limited though

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.470 
pretty good it's pretty limited though
you<00:03:07.359> really<00:03:07.599> only<00:03:07.750> get<00:03:07.959> up<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.859> down<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:10.359> we

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
you really only get up and down and we

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.479 
you really only get up and down and we
have<00:03:10.569> a<00:03:10.599> waist<00:03:10.840> twist<00:03:11.139> his<00:03:11.469> belt<00:03:11.739> comes<00:03:12.250> off

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
have a waist twist his belt comes off

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.629 
have a waist twist his belt comes off
belt<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:13.750> loincloth<00:03:14.310> there's<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.370> little<00:03:15.549> bit

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
belt in loincloth there's a little bit

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.129 
belt in loincloth there's a little bit
of<00:03:15.669> paint<00:03:15.939> on<00:03:16.090> there<00:03:16.269> though<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.689> buttons<00:03:17.019> are

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
of paint on there though the buttons are

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.470 
of paint on there though the buttons are
painted<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.709> little<00:03:18.099> bit<00:03:18.189> of<00:03:18.280> detail<00:03:18.639> work<00:03:18.819> so

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
painted a little bit of detail work so

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.929 
painted a little bit of detail work so
that's<00:03:19.569> pretty<00:03:19.840> good<00:03:20.079> really<00:03:21.010> big<00:03:21.189> hip<00:03:21.489> joints

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939 
that's pretty good really big hip joints

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.059 
that's pretty good really big hip joints
and<00:03:22.150> their<00:03:22.569> Y<00:03:22.750> joints<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:23.500> that's<00:03:23.709> not<00:03:23.889> ideal

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
and their Y joints so that's not ideal

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.369 
and their Y joints so that's not ideal
but<00:03:24.790> they're<00:03:24.969> not<00:03:25.120> bad<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:25.780> can<00:03:25.959> pretty<00:03:26.290> much

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
but they're not bad you can pretty much

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.289 
but they're not bad you can pretty much
get<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.709> leg<00:03:26.919> where<00:03:27.069> you<00:03:27.159> need<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.489> go<00:03:27.760> so

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
get the leg where you need it to go so

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.309 
get the leg where you need it to go so
that's<00:03:28.419> okay<00:03:28.810> we<00:03:29.079> have<00:03:29.169> double<00:03:29.440> jointed<00:03:29.739> knees

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
that's okay we have double jointed knees

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.390 
that's okay we have double jointed knees
pretty<00:03:32.319> good<00:03:32.530> range<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:32.859> motion

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
pretty good range of motion

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.059 
pretty good range of motion
nice<00:03:33.760> sculpt<00:03:34.690> work<00:03:34.870> on<00:03:35.139> these<00:03:35.500> wraps<00:03:35.829> down

nice sculpt work on these wraps down
here<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.579> pretty<00:03:37.150> decent<00:03:37.659> paint<00:03:37.840> work<00:03:38.049> so

here and pretty decent paint work so

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.000 
here and pretty decent paint work so
that's<00:03:38.829> not<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.280> bad<00:03:39.310> actually<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:41.560> then<00:03:41.859> we

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
that's not so bad actually and then we

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.129 
that's not so bad actually and then we
have<00:03:42.159> just<00:03:42.189> an<00:03:42.519> ankle<00:03:42.819> hinge<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.389> swivel<00:03:43.900> no

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
have just an ankle hinge and swivel no

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.110 
have just an ankle hinge and swivel no
ankle<00:03:44.560> rocker<00:03:44.799> which<00:03:45.069> i<00:03:45.310> think<00:03:45.370> is<00:03:45.699> always<00:03:45.939> a

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
ankle rocker which i think is always a

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.300 
ankle rocker which i think is always a
must<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:47.379> it's<00:03:47.500> pretty<00:03:47.739> disappointing<00:03:47.949> that

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
must so it's pretty disappointing that

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.280 
must so it's pretty disappointing that
that's<00:03:48.549> not<00:03:48.729> in<00:03:48.909> there<00:03:49.120> but<00:03:49.540> he's<00:03:49.659> not<00:03:49.689> so<00:03:50.079> bad

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
that's not in there but he's not so bad

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.110 
that's not in there but he's not so bad
all<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.069> way<00:03:51.189> around<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.549> guess<00:03:51.699> he's<00:03:51.849> not<00:03:51.879> as

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
all the way around I guess he's not as

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.809 
all the way around I guess he's not as
bad<00:03:52.269> as<00:03:52.419> I<00:03:52.540> was<00:03:52.689> remembering<00:03:53.590> him<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:53.979> be<00:03:54.159> so<00:03:54.430> if

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
bad as I was remembering him to be so if

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.409 
bad as I was remembering him to be so if

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.740 
it's not in the category of don't buy it

it's just in the category of don't get
too<00:04:02.019> excited<00:04:02.199> over<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:02.889> because<00:04:03.310> it's<00:04:03.489> not

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
too excited over it because it's not

that<00:04:03.669> great<00:04:04.389> it<00:04:05.169> will<00:04:05.379> pretty<00:04:05.739> much<00:04:05.919> just

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
that great it will pretty much just

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.879 
that great it will pretty much just
suffice<00:04:06.959> although<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.139> being<00:04:08.259> said<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.620> got

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
suffice although that being said I got

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.589 
suffice although that being said I got
this<00:04:09.040> guy<00:04:09.220> for<00:04:09.250> 40<00:04:09.729> bucks<00:04:09.759> and<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.180> think<00:04:10.419> he's

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
this guy for 40 bucks and I think he's

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.509 
this guy for 40 bucks and I think he's
up<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.900> whole<00:04:11.139> lot<00:04:11.349> more<00:04:11.590> than<00:04:11.799> that<00:04:12.009> so<00:04:12.280> he

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
up a whole lot more than that so he

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.189 
up a whole lot more than that so he
might<00:04:12.729> be<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.090> category<00:04:13.569> of<00:04:13.659> do<00:04:13.840> not<00:04:13.989> buy

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
might be in the category of do not buy

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.620 
might be in the category of do not buy
it<00:04:14.259> based<00:04:14.590> on<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:15.040> current<00:04:15.069> pricing<00:04:15.879> so

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
it based on the current pricing so

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.170 
it based on the current pricing so
there's<00:04:17.530> my<00:04:17.799> thought<00:04:18.070> on<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.669> have<00:04:18.940> to

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
there's my thought on it you have to

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.849 
there's my thought on it you have to
make<00:04:19.630> your<00:04:19.810> own<00:04:19.900> decision<00:04:20.320> on<00:04:20.409> whether<00:04:20.590> or<00:04:20.799> not

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
make your own decision on whether or not

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.620 
make your own decision on whether or not
it's<00:04:21.220> worth<00:04:21.459> getting<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.120> there<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:22.360> is<00:04:22.419> guys

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
it's worth getting so there it is guys
