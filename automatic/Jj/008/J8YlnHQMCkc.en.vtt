00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.380 
trees like a little bit here just a
little<00:02:08.470> bit<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.630> now<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.690> arch<00:02:11.140> should<00:02:11.980> be

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
little bit and now the arch should be

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.780 
little bit and now the arch should be
where<00:02:13.390> your<00:02:13.569> eye<00:02:13.599> is<00:02:13.810> looking<00:02:14.319> straight<00:02:14.790> right

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
where your eye is looking straight right

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.360 
where your eye is looking straight right
here<00:02:16.299> whether<00:02:17.140> some<00:02:17.410> people<00:02:17.440> do<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.010> like<00:02:18.040> that

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
here whether some people do it like that

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.330 
here whether some people do it like that
from<00:02:18.549> their<00:02:18.730> nose<00:02:18.910> like<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:21.010> this<00:02:21.160> should

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
from their nose like this so this should

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.920 
from their nose like this so this should
be<00:02:21.370> where<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.940> art<00:02:22.180> show<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.810> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
be where the art show this is the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.990 
be where the art show this is the
highest<00:02:23.260> point<00:02:23.470> right<00:02:23.709> here<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.730> don't

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
highest point right here so you don't

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000 
highest point right here so you don't
want<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.239> tweeze<00:02:25.480> here<00:02:26.019> but<00:02:26.590> what<00:02:26.739> you<00:02:26.829> may

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
want to tweeze here but what you may

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.809 
want to tweeze here but what you may
want<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.340> do<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.640> tweet<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.209> little<00:02:28.750> bit<00:02:28.989> below

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.190 

so<00:02:33.819> now<00:02:33.970> what<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.269> want<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.510> do<00:02:34.599> is<00:02:34.780> brush<00:02:35.140> it

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.759 
and first just fill in the places where
you<00:04:14.030> know<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:14.450> obviously<00:04:14.630> see<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:16.840> gap<00:04:17.840> keep

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
you know you obviously see a gap keep

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.340 
you know you obviously see a gap keep
filling<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.310> in

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
filling it in

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.990 
filling it in
until<00:04:21.350> it<00:04:21.590> looks<00:04:21.829> good<00:04:22.039> and<00:04:22.250> shape<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.819> the<00:04:22.850> way

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
until it looks good and shape it the way

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.020 
until it looks good and shape it the way
you<00:04:23.150> like<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:23.780> again<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:25.190> know<00:04:25.370> that<00:04:25.400> this<00:04:25.759> is

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
you like so again you know that this is

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.820 
you like so again you know that this is
around<00:04:26.690> here<00:04:27.050> it<00:04:27.229> should<00:04:27.380> be<00:04:27.440> your<00:04:27.650> highest

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
around here it should be your highest

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.490 
around here it should be your highest
point<00:04:28.250> right<00:04:28.430> there<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:28.880> this<00:04:29.599> about<00:04:30.139> here

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
point right there and this about here

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.170 
point right there and this about here
where<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:30.830> can<00:04:30.979> end<00:04:31.220> you<00:04:31.430> can<00:04:31.580> extend<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:32.000> little

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
where it can end you can extend a little

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.930 
where it can end you can extend a little
bit<00:04:32.300> like<00:04:32.509> I<00:04:32.690> did<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.620> same<00:04:33.860> thing<00:04:34.099> here<00:04:36.940> so

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
bit like I did the same thing here so

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.550 
bit like I did the same thing here so
the<00:04:38.090> next<00:04:38.270> thing<00:04:38.449> that<00:04:38.479> you<00:04:38.660> do<00:04:38.870> after<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.349> to

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
the next thing that you do after that to

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.870 
the next thing that you do after that to
make<00:04:39.710> it<00:04:39.740> look<00:04:39.860> more<00:04:39.979> natural<00:04:40.190> is<00:04:40.699> to

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
make it look more natural is to

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.339 
make it look more natural is to
definitely<00:04:41.270> brush<00:04:41.569> it<00:04:41.750> out<00:04:41.840> this<00:04:42.050> is<00:04:42.080> an

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
definitely brush it out this is an

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.700 
definitely brush it out this is an
important<00:04:42.860> step<00:04:43.130> so<00:04:44.000> brush<00:04:44.419> it<00:04:44.569> out<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:45.560> that

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
important step so brush it out so that

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.950 
important step so brush it out so that
looks<00:04:45.949> more<00:04:46.280> natural<00:04:49.210> so<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.389> last<00:04:50.599> step<00:04:50.930> to

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
looks more natural so the last step to

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.409 
looks more natural so the last step to
do<00:04:51.319> is<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:52.220> can<00:04:52.400> use<00:04:52.910> something<00:04:53.270> like

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
do is you can use something like

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.040 
do is you can use something like
Anastasia<00:04:54.550> brow<00:04:55.550> gel<00:04:56.030> and<00:04:56.330> apply<00:04:56.690> that<00:04:56.720> all

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
Anastasia brow gel and apply that all

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.570 
Anastasia brow gel and apply that all
over<00:04:57.610> just<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:58.759> that<00:04:58.940> it<00:04:59.090> can<00:04:59.270> be<00:04:59.419> more<00:05:00.009> even<00:05:01.009> or

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
over just so that it can be more even or

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.210 
over just so that it can be more even or
if<00:05:02.360> you're<00:05:02.690> on<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.810> budget<00:05:02.990> you<00:05:03.440> can<00:05:03.770> use<00:05:03.979> L

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
if you're on a budget you can use L

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.870 
if you're on a budget you can use L
eyebrow<00:05:05.030> treat<00:05:05.389> contain<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.710> very<00:05:07.070> often<00:05:07.580> I

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
eyebrow treat contain so very often I

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.580 
eyebrow treat contain so very often I
don't<00:05:08.060> like<00:05:08.449> my<00:05:08.630> eyebrows<00:05:09.020> over<00:05:09.259> brown

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
don't like my eyebrows over brown

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.439 
don't like my eyebrows over brown
because<00:05:09.949> it<00:05:10.130> comes<00:05:10.430> in<00:05:10.580> brown<00:05:10.789> sometimes<00:05:11.330> I

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
because it comes in brown sometimes I

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.960 
because it comes in brown sometimes I
find<00:05:11.659> a<00:05:11.780> to<00:05:12.020> ground<00:05:12.320> and<00:05:12.590> too<00:05:12.919> unnatural<00:05:13.520> so<00:05:13.940> I

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
find a to ground and too unnatural so I

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.010 
find a to ground and too unnatural so I
just<00:05:14.240> use<00:05:14.509> this<00:05:14.690> clear<00:05:15.080> side<00:05:16.360> just<00:05:17.360> put<00:05:17.990> a

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
just use this clear side just put a

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:26.970 
just use this clear side just put a
little<00:05:18.229> bit<00:05:18.560> on<00:05:18.830> there<00:05:20.650> like

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.390 

and<00:05:27.220> then<00:05:27.520> after<00:05:27.820> that<00:05:27.940> I<00:05:28.000> just<00:05:28.240> comb<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.780> over

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
and then after that I just comb it over

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.290 
and then after that I just comb it over
with<00:05:30.400> my<00:05:30.880> little<00:05:32.220> eyebrow<00:05:33.220> calm<00:05:33.610> here

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300
