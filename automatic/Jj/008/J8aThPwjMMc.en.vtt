framing<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.119> usually<00:01:12.540> go<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.900> same<00:01:13.140> kind

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
framing I usually go for the same kind

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.840 
framing I usually go for the same kind
of<00:01:13.530> framing<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.189> good<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.460> you're<00:01:14.549> close<00:01:14.729> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
of framing it's good if you're close to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.340 
of framing it's good if you're close to
the<00:01:14.939> camera<00:01:15.150> cuz<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:15.840> pick<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the camera cuz then it will pick up the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
the camera cuz then it will pick up the
sound<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:16.920> well<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.520> don't<00:01:17.580> want<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> get

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
sound really well you don't want to get

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.370 
sound really well you don't want to get
too<00:01:18.060> close<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> camera<00:01:18.869> unless<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.229> want

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
too close to the camera unless you want

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.770 
too close to the camera unless you want

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
the editing part I worked with Windows

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.789 
the editing part I worked with Windows
Movie<00:02:03.479> Maker<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.229> first<00:02:04.500> three<00:02:04.770> years

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
Movie Maker for the first three years

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
Movie Maker for the first three years
and<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.369> was<00:02:05.490> fine<00:02:05.759> except<00:02:06.329> for<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.509> fact<00:02:06.570> that

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and it was fine except for the fact that

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.900 
and it was fine except for the fact that
Windows<00:02:07.229> Movie<00:02:07.409> Maker<00:02:07.590> likes<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.250> crash<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> lot

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
so basically if you have any

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.059 
so basically if you have any
program<00:02:10.569> that<00:02:10.780> will<00:02:10.899> allow<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.590> cut<00:02:11.829> and

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
program that will allow you to cut and

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.649 
program that will allow you to cut and
paste<00:02:12.129> your<00:02:13.120> good

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
a review because that takes all the fun

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.790 
a review because that takes all the fun
out<00:04:38.260> of<00:04:38.410> it

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
out of it

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.230 
out of it
the<00:04:38.919> first<00:04:39.130> time<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:39.340> was<00:04:39.580> offered<00:04:39.850> a<00:04:39.910> book<00:04:40.060> I

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
the first time I was offered a book I

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.060 
the first time I was offered a book I
accepted<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:40.900> immediately<00:04:41.440> because<00:04:41.740> I<00:04:41.830> felt

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
accepted it immediately because I felt

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.010 
accepted it immediately because I felt
so<00:04:42.280> honored<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:43.030> ended<00:04:43.330> up<00:04:43.450> not<00:04:43.720> wanting<00:04:43.990> to

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
so honored and I ended up not wanting to

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.720 
so honored and I ended up not wanting to
read<00:04:44.290> it<00:04:44.380> at<00:04:44.530> all<00:04:44.680> because<00:04:44.980> I<00:04:45.070> didn't<00:04:45.340> like<00:04:45.490> it

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
read it at all because I didn't like it

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.460 
read it at all because I didn't like it
and<00:04:45.970> then<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.150> felt<00:04:46.419> really<00:04:46.690> bad<00:04:46.960> about<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.260> so

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
and then I felt really bad about it so

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.290 
and then I felt really bad about it so
just<00:04:47.980> think<00:04:48.280> about<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.669> before<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:48.940> accept

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
just think about it before you accept

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.000 
just think about it before you accept
something<00:04:49.510> for<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:49.870> review<00:04:50.169> also<00:04:50.590> in<00:04:50.800> case<00:04:50.919> you
