00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
idea was you have a painting and it kind

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.490 
idea was you have a painting and it kind
of<00:00:47.879> opens<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> secret<00:00:48.750> latch<00:00:48.930> over<00:00:49.230> here

and<00:04:18.220> there's<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.370> place<00:04:19.640> right<00:04:19.880> there<00:04:20.080> it's

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
and there's the place right there it's

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.680 
and there's the place right there it's
next<00:04:21.350> to<00:04:21.500> two<00:04:21.650> big<00:04:21.890> trees<00:04:22.220> so<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.270> can<00:04:23.420> see<00:04:23.600> it

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
next to two big trees so you can see it

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.310 
next to two big trees so you can see it
from<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.960> house<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.500> also<00:04:25.990> it's<00:04:26.990> easy<00:04:27.170> to

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
from the house and also it's easy to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.440 
from the house and also it's easy to
find<00:04:27.500> it's<00:04:27.920> next<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.250> two<00:04:28.370> big<00:04:28.550> trees<00:04:28.790> just<00:04:29.180> but

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
find it's next to two big trees just but

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.900 
find it's next to two big trees just but
it's<00:04:29.690> kind<00:04:29.900> of<00:04:29.930> a<00:04:29.990> little<00:04:30.200> out<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.580> way<00:04:31.610> off

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
it's kind of a little out of the way off

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.480 
it's kind of a little out of the way off
to<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.120> side<00:04:32.420> of<00:04:32.450> it<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:36.680> one<00:04:37.070> more<00:04:37.250> thing<00:04:37.400> I

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
to the side of it so one more thing I

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.280 
to the side of it so one more thing I
gotta<00:04:37.670> show<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.360> this<00:04:38.510> is<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.690> file<00:04:38.960> room

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
gotta show you so this is the file room

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.330 
gotta show you so this is the file room
I<00:04:40.270> tried<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.450> add<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.870> other<00:04:42.830> stuff<00:04:43.160> I<00:04:43.250> was

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
I tried to add the other stuff I was

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.470 
I tried to add the other stuff I was
talking<00:04:43.640> about<00:04:43.790> like<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.060> big<00:04:44.240> size

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
talking about like the big size

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.600 
talking about like the big size
Tyrannosaurus<00:04:45.260> Rex<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.830> giant<00:04:46.400> penny

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
Tyrannosaurus Rex and the giant penny

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.430 
Tyrannosaurus Rex and the giant penny
but<00:04:48.100> every<00:04:49.100> time<00:04:49.250> I<00:04:49.310> try<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.930> draw<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:50.990> more<00:04:51.320> to

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
but every time I try to draw the more to

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.140 
but every time I try to draw the more to
make<00:04:51.620> them<00:04:51.770> in<00:04:51.860> pixel<00:04:52.250> art<00:04:52.370> they<00:04:52.550> just<00:04:52.820> didn't

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
make them in pixel art they just didn't

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.270 
make them in pixel art they just didn't
look<00:04:53.270> right<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:54.170> I<00:04:56.500> mean<00:04:57.500> basically<00:04:57.710> for<00:04:58.130> it<00:04:58.190> to

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
look right so I mean basically for it to

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.680 
look right so I mean basically for it to
look<00:04:58.400> like<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.670> penny<00:04:59.000> it<00:04:59.330> would<00:04:59.420> have<00:04:59.540> to<00:04:59.600> be

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
look like a penny it would have to be

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.350 
look like a penny it would have to be
like<00:04:59.930> hundreds<00:05:00.470> of<00:05:00.590> blocks<00:05:00.860> high<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:02.090> kind<00:05:02.270> of

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
like hundreds of blocks high to kind of

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.750 
like hundreds of blocks high to kind of
get<00:05:02.480> that<00:05:02.800> detail<00:05:03.800> in<00:05:04.010> there<00:05:04.250> but<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.520> don't

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
get that detail in there but I don't

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.120 
get that detail in there but I don't
have<00:05:04.970> hundreds<00:05:05.510> of<00:05:05.600> blocks<00:05:05.900> I<00:05:06.140> have<00:05:06.260> like<00:05:06.500> 20

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
have hundreds of blocks I have like 20

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.200 
have hundreds of blocks I have like 20
or<00:05:07.250> 25<00:05:08.710> because<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:10.040> symbol<00:05:10.430> is<00:05:10.490> only<00:05:10.700> 18

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
or 25 because that symbol is only 18

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.930 
or 25 because that symbol is only 18
high<00:05:11.420> and<00:05:11.720> 32<00:05:12.230> wide<00:05:12.520> but<00:05:13.520> if<00:05:13.610> you're<00:05:13.700> trying<00:05:13.850> to

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
do a penny a keen eye it looks like

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.700 
do a penny a keen eye it looks like
garbage<00:05:16.330> this<00:05:17.330> looks<00:05:17.510> like<00:05:17.570> a<00:05:17.690> big<00:05:17.900> brown

central the main command center and just

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.180 
central the main command center and just
sit<00:05:39.650> here<00:05:39.830> and<00:05:40.090> do<00:05:41.090> stuff<00:05:41.360> Cooper<00:05:42.350> typical<00:05:42.770> see

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
sit here and do stuff Cooper typical see

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.030 
sit here and do stuff Cooper typical see
what<00:05:43.340> jokers<00:05:43.730> up<00:05:43.880> to<00:05:44.620> this<00:05:45.620> way<00:05:45.800> here's<00:05:45.980> a

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
what jokers up to this way here's a

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.420 
what jokers up to this way here's a
little<00:05:46.420> fingerprint<00:05:47.420> DNA<00:05:47.840> scanner<00:05:48.310> this<00:05:49.310> is

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
little fingerprint DNA scanner this is

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.890 
little fingerprint DNA scanner this is
just<00:05:49.520> a<00:05:49.640> small<00:05:49.940> one<00:05:49.970> I<00:05:50.240> guess<00:05:50.570> it<00:05:50.720> would<00:05:50.810> be

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
just a small one I guess it would be

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.570 
just a small one I guess it would be
convenient<00:05:51.320> if<00:05:51.680> you're<00:05:51.980> hearing<00:05:52.250> you<00:05:52.370> want<00:05:52.520> to

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
convenient if you're hearing you want to

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.490 
convenient if you're hearing you want to
check<00:05:52.760> something<00:05:52.790> you<00:05:53.300> just<00:05:53.450> go<00:05:53.660> there<00:05:53.870> but

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
check something you just go there but

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.000 
check something you just go there but
but<00:05:54.860> I<00:05:54.920> plan<00:05:55.130> to<00:05:55.160> make<00:05:55.280> a<00:05:55.400> whole<00:05:55.640> science<00:05:56.590> lab<00:05:57.590> a

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
but I plan to make a whole science lab a

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.060 
but I plan to make a whole science lab a
whole<00:05:58.250> science<00:05:58.790> weighed<00:05:59.590> out<00:06:00.590> of<00:06:00.770> one<00:06:00.950> of

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
whole science weighed out of one of

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.740 
whole science weighed out of one of
these<00:06:01.190> colors<00:06:01.490> i'm<00:06:01.820> not<00:06:01.970> exactly<00:06:02.300> sure<00:06:02.480> which

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
these colors i'm not exactly sure which

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.290 
these colors i'm not exactly sure which
car<00:06:02.990> may<00:06:03.170> use<00:06:03.320> it<00:06:03.470> for<00:06:03.500> the<00:06:03.710> science<00:06:04.040> wing<00:06:04.300> and

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
car may use it for the science wing and

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.360 
car may use it for the science wing and
i<00:06:05.750> gotta<00:06:05.930> have<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:06.170> batmobile<00:06:06.740> somewhere<00:06:07.040> in

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
i gotta have the batmobile somewhere in

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.190 
i gotta have the batmobile somewhere in
