red<00:02:28.370> stop<00:02:28.640> lights<00:02:28.850> painted<00:02:29.299> at<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.510> rear<00:02:29.690> and

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
red stop lights painted at the rear and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.199 
red stop lights painted at the rear and
they're<00:02:30.230> playing<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.829> 2012<00:02:31.579> version<00:02:31.790> and

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
they're playing on the 2012 version and

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.449 
they're playing on the 2012 version and
a<00:02:32.630> later<00:02:32.810> version<00:02:33.049> also<00:02:33.440> has<00:02:33.739> more<00:02:33.920> accurately

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
a later version also has more accurately

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:43.770 
a later version also has more accurately
located<00:02:34.819> equipment<00:02:35.390> outside<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.900> cab

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.479 

the<00:02:44.780> DAT<00:02:45.080> makes<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.620> good-looking<00:02:46.010> truckload

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
the DAT makes a good-looking truckload

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.830 
the DAT makes a good-looking truckload
but<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.790> little<00:02:47.030> bit<00:02:47.150> wide<00:02:47.360> because<00:02:47.750> you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
but is a little bit wide because you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.470 
but is a little bit wide because you
can't<00:02:48.110> remove<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.560> blade<00:02:49.030> but<00:02:50.030> here<00:02:50.269> is

let's face it you don't see one of those
every<00:03:00.769> day<00:03:00.879> so<00:03:01.879> we'll<00:03:02.060> start<00:03:02.299> off<00:03:02.390> by<00:03:02.450> testing

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
every day so we'll start off by testing

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.660 
every day so we'll start off by testing
out<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.230> tracks<00:03:03.500> on<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.650> smooth<00:03:03.980> surface<00:03:04.010> and

out the tracks on a smooth surface and

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.920 
out the tracks on a smooth surface and
there's<00:03:04.819> too<00:03:04.940> much<00:03:05.030> friction<00:03:05.330> for<00:03:05.660> them<00:03:05.780> to

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
keep the tension on the tracks you can

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.460 
keep the tension on the tracks you can
get<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.420> tracks<00:03:14.659> to<00:03:14.810> move<00:03:14.959> but<00:03:15.170> they<00:03:15.290> are<00:03:15.440> a

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
get the tracks to move but they are a

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.710 
get the tracks to move but they are a
little<00:03:15.860> bit<00:03:15.950> reluctant<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.670> there<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.599> an

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
little bit reluctant and there is an

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.360 
little bit reluctant and there is an
issue<00:03:17.810> over<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.230> high<00:03:18.410> drive<00:03:18.709> sprocket<00:03:19.190> where

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
issue over the high drive sprocket where

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.069 
issue over the high drive sprocket where
the<00:03:19.519> tracks<00:03:19.790> just<00:03:19.910> seem<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.360> roll<00:03:20.569> over<00:03:20.599> the

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
the tracks just seem to roll over the

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.280 
the tracks just seem to roll over the
teeth<00:03:21.379> rather<00:03:21.709> than<00:03:22.010> gauging<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.640> sprocket

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
teeth rather than gauging the sprocket

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.569 
teeth rather than gauging the sprocket
but<00:03:24.290> let's<00:03:24.500> give<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.799> test<00:03:25.010> on<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.220> rougher

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
but let's give it a test on a rougher

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.240 
but let's give it a test on a rougher
surface<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.150> see<00:03:26.299> how<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:26.540> gets<00:03:26.690> on<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.250> again

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
surface and see how it gets on and again

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.440 
surface and see how it gets on and again
there's<00:03:28.430> quite<00:03:28.609> a<00:03:28.640> lot<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:28.790> stiffness<00:03:29.180> in<00:03:29.329> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
there's quite a lot of stiffness in the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.330 
there's quite a lot of stiffness in the
mechanism<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.140> it's<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.500> bit<00:03:30.650> hit<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.010> miss<00:03:31.129> as

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
mechanism and it's a bit hit and miss as

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.949 
mechanism and it's a bit hit and miss as
to<00:03:31.459> whether<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.790> tracks<00:03:32.180> will<00:03:32.420> really<00:03:32.750> roll

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
to whether the tracks will really roll

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.229 
to whether the tracks will really roll
or<00:03:33.140> not<00:03:33.489> let's<00:03:34.489> have<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.700> look<00:03:34.819> at<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:34.970> front<00:03:35.180> of

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
or not let's have a look at the front of

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.849 
or not let's have a look at the front of
the<00:03:35.359> machine<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:35.810> see<00:03:35.870> how<00:03:36.200> they<00:03:36.349> dozing

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
the machine and see how they dozing

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.130 
the machine and see how they dozing
blade<00:03:36.890> performs<00:03:37.579> and<00:03:37.879> the<00:03:38.720> first<00:03:38.900> thing<00:03:39.019> to

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
blade performs and the first thing to

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.690 
blade performs and the first thing to
say<00:03:39.170> is<00:03:39.319> that<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.709> blade<00:03:39.859> can<00:03:39.920> be<00:03:40.310> raised<00:03:40.519> and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
say is that the blade can be raised and

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.400 
say is that the blade can be raised and
lowered<00:03:40.790> although<00:03:41.359> it<00:03:41.510> is<00:03:41.629> very<00:03:41.720> stiff<00:03:42.200> and

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
lowered although it is very stiff and

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.750 
lowered although it is very stiff and
that<00:03:42.890> just<00:03:43.069> means<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.310> have<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.430> be<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.609> little

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
that just means you have to be a little

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.190 
that just means you have to be a little
bit<00:03:43.879> careful<00:03:44.090> when<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.510> push<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:44.900> pull<00:03:45.079> on

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
bit careful when you push and pull on

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.420 
bit careful when you push and pull on
the<00:03:45.319> blade<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.099> don't<00:03:46.280> damage

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
the blade so that you don't damage

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.819 
the blade so that you don't damage
something<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.900> tilting<00:03:48.230> mechanism<00:03:48.380> does

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
something the tilting mechanism does

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.220 
something the tilting mechanism does
offer<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.099> very<00:03:49.340> small<00:03:49.669> range<00:03:49.880> of<00:03:50.000> movement<00:03:50.480> but

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
offer a very small range of movement but

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.809 
offer a very small range of movement but
it's<00:03:51.410> constrained<00:03:51.829> by<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.069> design<00:03:52.519> of<00:03:52.549> the

like to do a real-life simulation and

here<00:04:21.380> is<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.650> DAT<00:04:21.979> doing<00:04:22.610> what<00:04:22.729> it<00:04:22.820> likes<00:04:23.030> best

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
here is the DAT doing what it likes best

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.800 
here is the DAT doing what it likes best
shoving<00:04:24.380> rocks<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:25.210> some<00:04:26.210> way<00:04:26.330> this<00:04:26.450> is<00:04:26.599> quite

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
shoving rocks in some way this is quite

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.180 
shoving rocks in some way this is quite
a<00:04:26.840> good<00:04:27.050> looking<00:04:27.320> model<00:04:27.440> of<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.740> caterpillar

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
a good looking model of the caterpillar

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.150 
a good looking model of the caterpillar
dat<00:04:28.580> with<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.030> decent<00:04:29.270> level<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:29.720> detail<00:04:30.169> it

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
dat with a decent level of detail it

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.529 
dat with a decent level of detail it
does<00:04:31.340> have<00:04:31.520> some<00:04:31.669> working<00:04:31.970> features<00:04:32.330> which

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
does have some working features which

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.180 
does have some working features which
means<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:32.930> can<00:04:33.080> pose<00:04:33.289> the<00:04:33.500> model<00:04:33.620> as<00:04:33.860> you<00:04:33.889> like

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
means you can pose the model as you like

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.550 
means you can pose the model as you like
but<00:04:35.180> perhaps<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.630> model<00:04:35.870> engineering<00:04:36.139> is<00:04:36.410> not

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
but perhaps the model engineering is not

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.560 
but perhaps the model engineering is not
quite<00:04:36.800> as<00:04:36.950> good<00:04:37.070> as<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.310> might<00:04:37.460> have<00:04:37.490> been<00:04:37.669> but

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
quite as good as it might have been but

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.850 
quite as good as it might have been but
if<00:04:38.720> you're<00:04:38.840> a<00:04:38.870> caterpillar<00:04:39.320> fan<00:04:39.560> its

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
if you're a caterpillar fan its

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.860 
if you're a caterpillar fan its
recommended

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870
