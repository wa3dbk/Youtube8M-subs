00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.399 
70 miles per hour but when I get in my
car<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.379> yield<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.610> its<00:02:18.940> power<00:02:19.269> then<00:02:19.870> suddenly

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
car and yield to its power then suddenly

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.320 
car and yield to its power then suddenly
I<00:02:20.500> have<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.980> ability<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.430> achieve<00:02:21.700> speeds

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
I have the ability to achieve speeds

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.390 
I have the ability to achieve speeds
that<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.689> could<00:02:22.870> never<00:02:23.109> achieve<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.769> my<00:02:23.920> own<00:02:24.099> and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
that I could never achieve on my own and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.690 
that I could never achieve on my own and
so<00:02:25.029> it<00:02:25.180> is<00:02:25.299> when<00:02:26.139> my<00:02:26.560> faith<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.310> in

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
so it is when my faith is in

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.800 
so it is when my faith is in
gods<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.360> my<00:02:29.080> beat<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:30.099> his<00:02:30.610> power<00:02:30.940> Bennett

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
gods and my beat is in his power Bennett

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.740 
gods and my beat is in his power Bennett
his<00:02:32.050> strength<00:02:32.470> becomes<00:02:33.250> my<00:02:33.610> strength<00:02:34.060> his

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
his strength becomes my strength his

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.589 
his strength becomes my strength his
power<00:02:35.140> becomes<00:02:35.920> my<00:02:36.340> power<00:02:36.700> that's<00:02:37.269> why<00:02:37.540> the

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
power becomes my power that's why the

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.619 
power becomes my power that's why the
Bible<00:02:38.110> says<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.650> Ephesians<00:02:39.129> 320<00:02:39.849> that<00:02:40.269> those

who<00:02:40.930> live<00:02:41.140> by<00:02:41.349> faith<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:42.040> says<00:02:42.489> now<00:02:42.879> unto<00:02:43.480> Him

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
who live by faith it says now unto Him

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.190 
who live by faith it says now unto Him
who<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.290> able<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.769> do<00:02:44.980> exceedingly<00:02:45.010> abundantly

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
who is able to do exceedingly abundantly

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.839 
who is able to do exceedingly abundantly
and<00:02:47.200> above<00:02:47.680> all<00:02:47.860> we<00:02:48.069> could<00:02:48.160> ever<00:02:48.280> ask<00:02:48.550> or<00:02:48.790> think

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
and above all we could ever ask or think

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.089 
and above all we could ever ask or think
according<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.870> power<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.380> worketh<00:02:50.709> in
