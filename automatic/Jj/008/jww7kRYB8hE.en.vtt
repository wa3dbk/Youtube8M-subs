00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
which i think was a really good play on

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.149 
which i think was a really good play on
his<00:01:50.250> part<00:01:50.329> so<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.360> go<00:01:51.630> into<00:01:51.990> my<00:01:52.200> exes<00:01:52.710> ooh<00:01:52.890> and

his part so I go into my exes ooh and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.030 
his part so I go into my exes ooh and
you<00:01:54.000> know<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.659> had<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.500> confused

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
you know what I just had to be confused

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.179 
you know what I just had to be confused
so<00:01:56.909> he<00:01:56.969> goes<00:01:57.119> for<00:01:57.240> taunt<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.290> don't<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:58.710> why<00:01:58.950> he

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
so he goes for taunt I don't know why he

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.499 
so he goes for taunt I don't know why he
would<00:01:59.340> do<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.520> but<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:00.299> he<00:02:00.390> was

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
would do that but I think he was

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.959 
would do that but I think he was
expecting<00:02:01.020> me<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.350> set<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.280> his<00:02:02.490> Connelly

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
expecting me to set up so his Connelly

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.840 
expecting me to set up so his Connelly
takes<00:02:03.270> basically<00:02:03.509> 50%<00:02:04.079> off<00:02:04.619> from<00:02:04.979> all<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
takes basically 50% off from all the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.029 
takes basically 50% off from all the
spikes<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.570> shocks<00:02:06.840> event<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.560> dies<00:02:07.829> from

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
spikes and so shocks event it dies from

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.690 
spikes and so shocks event it dies from
the<00:02:08.220> earthquake

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the earthquake

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.010 
the earthquake
up<00:02:09.690> next<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.920> crafty<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:12.209> think

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
up next is this crafty I think

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.220 
up next is this crafty I think
for<00:02:13.560> me<00:02:13.710> honestly<00:02:14.070> like<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:15.750> battle<00:02:16.110> was

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
for me honestly like this battle was

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.000 
for me honestly like this battle was
kind<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.770> like<00:02:17.780> that's<00:02:18.780> really<00:02:18.990> easy<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.470> I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
kind of like that's really easy like I

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.970 
kind of like that's really easy like I
mean<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.610> was<00:02:20.700> unexpected<00:02:21.090> that's<00:02:21.690> one<00:02:21.900> thing

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.220 

but<00:02:25.980> one<00:02:26.160> thing<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.430> knew<00:02:26.760> was<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:28.140> guy

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
but one thing I knew was that this guy

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.050 
but one thing I knew was that this guy
was<00:02:28.530> pretty<00:02:28.740> inexperienced<00:02:29.370> because<00:02:29.850> like

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
was pretty inexperienced because like

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.330 
was pretty inexperienced because like
most<00:02:30.390> people<00:02:30.780> would<00:02:31.140> have<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> rabbit<00:02:31.980> spinner

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
most people would have a rabbit spinner

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.330 
most people would have a rabbit spinner
like<00:02:32.720> my<00:02:33.720> ex<00:02:33.960> go<00:02:34.170> drill<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.650> already<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> best

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
like my ex go drill is already the best

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.360 
like my ex go drill is already the best
extra<00:02:35.940> drill<00:02:36.210> in<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.810> world<00:02:37.200> I'd<00:02:37.590> be<00:02:37.740> like<00:02:37.920> yes

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
extra drill in the world I'd be like yes

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.620 
extra drill in the world I'd be like yes
earthquake<00:02:39.210> rapid<00:02:39.960> spin<00:02:40.850> sword<00:02:41.850> stance<00:02:42.240> and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
earthquake rapid spin sword stance and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.950 
earthquake rapid spin sword stance and
protect<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.250> can't<00:02:44.610> basically<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.690> can't

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
protect so I can't basically you can't

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.110 
protect so I can't basically you can't
do<00:02:46.110> anything<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.770> flying<00:02:47.040> types<00:02:47.510> yep

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
do anything to flying types yep

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.360 
do anything to flying types yep
so<00:02:51.120> anyways<00:02:51.510> his<00:02:52.140> team<00:02:52.380> continues<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:52.980> rack<00:02:53.340> up

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
so anyways his team continues to rack up

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.810 
so anyways his team continues to rack up
damage<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.750> stock<00:02:55.650> shocks<00:02:55.920> at<00:02:56.220> spikes<00:02:56.580> and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
damage to the stock shocks at spikes and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.980 
damage to the stock shocks at spikes and
pretty<00:02:59.820> much<00:02:59.910> that's<00:03:00.150> what<00:03:00.330> really<00:03:00.630> caused

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
pretty much that's what really caused

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.250 
pretty much that's what really caused

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
so with the charge beam and yeah charge

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.310 
so with the charge beam and yeah charge
cream<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:30.360> only<00:03:30.480> gives<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:31.110> a

cream like it only gives you like a
certain<00:03:31.680> percent<00:03:32.220> chance<00:03:32.460> of<00:03:32.610> like<00:03:34.040> racing<00:03:35.040> of

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
certain percent chance of like racing of

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.840 
certain percent chance of like racing of
special<00:03:35.580> turn

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
special turn

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.900 
special turn
so<00:03:36.750> anyways<00:03:37.050> um<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.620> couldn't<00:03:37.950> expert<00:03:38.400> rail<00:03:38.640> and

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
so anyways um I couldn't expert rail and

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.940 
so anyways um I couldn't expert rail and
I<00:03:39.390> realized<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.050> it's<00:03:40.260> not<00:03:40.380> working<00:03:40.770> out

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
I realized this it's not working out

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.710 
I realized this it's not working out
with<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.280> earthquake<00:03:41.550> as<00:03:41.940> he<00:03:42.330> goes<00:03:42.540> for

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
with the earthquake as he goes for

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.170 
with the earthquake as he goes for
softball<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.560> decided<00:03:44.100> sort<00:03:44.340> fence<00:03:44.640> up<00:03:44.880> and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
softball that decided sort fence up and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.060 
softball that decided sort fence up and
go<00:03:45.750> all<00:03:45.960> the<00:03:46.080> way<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.460> GE<00:03:47.460> times<00:03:48.230> attack<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.530> he

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
go all the way to GE times attack and he

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.410 
go all the way to GE times attack and he
goes<00:03:50.250> was<00:03:50.430> soul<00:03:50.700> power

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
goes was soul power

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.100 
goes was soul power
and<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:52.320> killed<00:03:52.560> him<00:03:52.830> and<00:03:52.860> I<00:03:53.420> called<00:03:54.420> him<00:03:54.600> with

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
and I killed him and I called him with

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.280 
and I killed him and I called him with
earthquake<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:57.120> make<00:03:57.540> Scratchy<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.050> can

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
earthquake and I make Scratchy I can

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.530 
earthquake and I make Scratchy I can
definitely<00:03:58.530> out<00:03:59.040> speed<00:03:59.370> this<00:03:59.550> thing<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.330> go

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
definitely out speed this thing so I go

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.920 
definitely out speed this thing so I go
for<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.810> earthquake<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:02.360> this<00:04:03.360> bronze<00:04:03.690> on

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
for the earthquake and this bronze on

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.420 
for the earthquake and this bronze on
dice<00:04:04.170> on<00:04:04.410> spikes<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:05.720> yeah<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:07.800> is<00:04:08.160> why

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
dice on spikes and yeah so that is why

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.300 
dice on spikes and yeah so that is why
you<00:04:08.730> should<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:10.670> rapid<00:04:11.670> spinners
