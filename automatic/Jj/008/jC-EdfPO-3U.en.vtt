one<00:00:03.590> two<00:00:04.310> three<00:00:05.000> four

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.490 

so<00:00:29.980> this<00:00:30.099> is<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.400> chorus<00:00:30.759> to<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:31.869> silent<00:00:32.349> man

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
so this is the chorus to the silent man

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.119 
so this is the chorus to the silent man
and<00:00:32.879> a<00:00:33.879> lot<00:00:34.120> of<00:00:34.210> this<00:00:34.329> is<00:00:34.450> based<00:00:34.690> on<00:00:34.989> your<00:00:35.949> E

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
and a lot of this is based on your E

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.770 
and a lot of this is based on your E
major<00:00:36.160> chord<00:00:36.489> shape<00:00:37.000> that<00:00:37.210> you<00:00:37.300> play<00:00:37.480> in<00:00:37.600> first

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
major chord shape that you play in first

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.270 
major chord shape that you play in first
position<00:00:40.800> we're<00:00:41.800> gonna<00:00:41.890> actually<00:00:42.010> be<00:00:42.160> getting

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
position we're gonna actually be getting

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.799 
position we're gonna actually be getting
a<00:00:42.430> lot<00:00:42.519> of<00:00:42.579> mileage<00:00:42.790> of<00:00:43.120> taking<00:00:43.449> that<00:00:43.510> shape

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
a lot of mileage of taking that shape

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:44.880 
a lot of mileage of taking that shape
and<00:00:44.019> moving<00:00:44.230> it<00:00:44.320> up<00:00:44.410> into<00:00:44.589> different

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
and moving it up into different

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.979 
and moving it up into different
positions<00:00:45.040> so<00:00:45.940> that's<00:00:46.120> your<00:00:46.210> first<00:00:46.420> chord<00:00:46.780> E

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
positions so that's your first chord E

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.729 
positions so that's your first chord E
major<00:00:49.140> after<00:00:50.140> that<00:00:50.290> we're<00:00:50.409> going<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:50.559> go<00:00:50.680> to

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
major after that we're going to go to

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.470 
major after that we're going to go to
this<00:00:50.829> quick<00:00:51.129> East<00:00:51.430> sus<00:00:52.019> 4<00:00:54.150> I'm<00:00:55.150> going<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.360> add

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
this quick East sus 4 I'm going to add

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.009 
this quick East sus 4 I'm going to add
the<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.960> in<00:00:56.530> there<00:00:56.860> on<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.460> 3rd<00:00:58.210> string<00:00:58.510> 2nd

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
the a in there on the 3rd string 2nd

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:07.050 
the a in there on the 3rd string 2nd
fret<00:00:59.050> so<00:00:59.739> it's<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.400> that<00:01:06.520> would<00:01:06.729> be<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.909> first

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
fret so it's so that would be the first

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.149 
fret so it's so that would be the first
bar<00:01:07.360> of<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.780> course<00:01:10.439> then<00:01:11.439> I'm<00:01:11.560> going<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.710> go

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
bar of the course then I'm going to go

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.140 
bar of the course then I'm going to go
up<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.759> this<00:01:13.240> F<00:01:13.450> sharp<00:01:13.869> minor<00:01:14.799> 11<00:01:15.400> with<00:01:15.820> an<00:01:15.909> e<00:01:16.030> in

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
up to this F sharp minor 11 with an e in

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.820 
up to this F sharp minor 11 with an e in
the<00:01:16.240> bass<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:19.509> holding<00:01:19.900> strength<00:01:20.170> on<00:01:20.650> this

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
the bass but holding strength on this

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.399 
the bass but holding strength on this
whole<00:01:21.009> section<00:01:21.400> so<00:01:21.939> I<00:01:22.330> would<00:01:22.780> figure<00:01:22.990> that<00:01:23.110> as

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
whole section so I would figure that as

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.870 
whole section so I would figure that as
open<00:01:23.979> string<00:01:24.250> 4th<00:01:25.030> fret<00:01:25.290> 4th<00:01:26.290> fret<00:01:26.850> 2nd<00:01:27.850> fret

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
open string 4th fret 4th fret 2nd fret

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.920 
open string 4th fret 4th fret 2nd fret
and<00:01:28.630> two<00:01:29.380> open<00:01:29.650> strings

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.880 

then<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.170> moves<00:01:34.440> up<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.040> at<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.890> seventh

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
then that moves up to at the seventh

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.610 
then that moves up to at the seventh
fret<00:01:38.240> 6th<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.360> 7th<00:01:39.630> fret<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.260> is<00:01:40.410> almost

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
fret 6th and 7th fret this is almost

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.340 
fret 6th and 7th fret this is almost
like<00:01:40.740> you're<00:01:41.070> playing<00:01:41.280> an<00:01:41.490> E<00:01:41.670> chord<00:01:42.350> just

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
like you're playing an E chord just

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.080 
like you're playing an E chord just
moved<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:46.730> 7th<00:01:47.730> 6th<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.180> 7th<00:01:48.450> fret

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
moved up to the 7th 6th and 7th fret

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.340 
moved up to the 7th 6th and 7th fret
same<00:01:51.090> shape<00:01:51.390> only<00:01:51.780> we're<00:01:51.870> going<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:52.050> refigure

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
same shape only we're going to refigure

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:01.960 
same shape only we're going to refigure
it<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.460> an<00:01:56.550> E<00:01:56.670> major<00:01:56.820> 9<00:01:57.180> e<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.900> face

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.920

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
a I'm gonna move it up a whole step to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.500 
a I'm gonna move it up a whole step to
the<00:02:19.710> 8th<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.730> 9th<00:02:21.420> frets<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:23.070> that's<00:02:23.880> at<00:02:24.060> this

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
the 8th and 9th frets and that's at this

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.890 
the 8th and 9th frets and that's at this
point<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> B<00:02:26.810> 11<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:30.270> bass<00:02:30.450> but

point I have a B 11 and the bass but

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.210 
point I have a B 11 and the bass but
then<00:02:31.050> I'm<00:02:31.140> gonna<00:02:31.260> also<00:02:31.410> put<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.770> 7th<00:02:32.100> fret

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
then I'm gonna also put the 7th fret

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.180 
then I'm gonna also put the 7th fret
down

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
down

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.030 
down
the<00:02:34.940> second<00:02:35.300> half<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:35.630> measure<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.620> we

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
the second half of that measure so we

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:49.209 
the second half of that measure so we
play<00:02:37.220> through<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.460> first<00:02:37.490> time

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:49.219 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.030 

on<00:02:50.219> the<00:02:50.430> repeat<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.510> play<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> e<00:02:51.959> sus4<00:02:52.409> and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
on the repeat you play the e sus4 and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.949 
on the repeat you play the e sus4 and
then<00:02:53.219> you<00:02:53.280> come<00:02:53.430> back<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.060> regular<00:02:54.359> e<00:02:54.659> so

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
then you come back to the regular e so

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:02.780 
then you come back to the regular e so
it's<00:02:57.260> my<00:02:58.260> F<00:02:58.439> sharp<00:02:58.680> minor<00:02:58.799> 11<00:03:01.400> then<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.430> put<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
it's my F sharp minor 11 then I put the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.339 
it's my F sharp minor 11 then I put the
a<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.150> B<00:03:03.180> instead<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.019> having<00:03:04.170> two

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
a and the B instead of having two

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.780 
a and the B instead of having two
separate<00:03:04.590> measures<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.069> make<00:03:05.219> that<00:03:05.370> into<00:03:05.609> one

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
separate measures I make that into one

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.149 
separate measures I make that into one
measure<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.510> go<00:03:09.319> so<00:03:10.319> it's<00:03:10.500> two<00:03:10.739> beats<00:03:10.980> on

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
measure and I go so it's two beats on

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.190 
measure and I go so it's two beats on
the<00:03:11.189> a<00:03:12.709> move<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.889> to<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.129> B<00:03:14.569> then<00:03:15.569> put<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.930> B<00:03:16.079> in

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
the a move up to the B then put the B in

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.240 
the a move up to the B then put the B in
the<00:03:16.290> base<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:18.150> then<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.389> go<00:03:18.480> back<00:03:18.629> to<00:03:18.840> E<00:03:19.250> and
