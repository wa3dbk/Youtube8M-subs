00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
right this is our project our senior

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.610 
right this is our project our senior
design<00:00:01.890> project<00:00:02.669> our<00:00:03.449> objectives<00:00:04.440> were<00:00:04.560> to

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
design project our objectives were to

for<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.690> echo<00:00:06.870> Center<00:00:07.140> down<00:00:07.350> on<00:00:07.529> the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
for the echo Center down on the

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.980 
for the echo Center down on the
waterfront<00:00:08.269> we<00:00:09.269> thought<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.510> best<00:00:09.540> course<00:00:09.900> of

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
waterfront we thought the best course of

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.990 
waterfront we thought the best course of
action<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.290> do<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.590> was<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:10.980> include<00:00:11.550> lots<00:00:11.849> of

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
action to do this was to include lots of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.289 
action to do this was to include lots of
lights<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.750> bubbles<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.320> just<00:00:14.299> general

or interact with it however they please
we<00:00:27.570> built<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.930> as<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.310> this<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.580> device

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
we built this as a this one device

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.209 
we built this as a this one device
serves<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> model<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.500> future<00:00:31.740> fruit

this device serves as a model for future
displays<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.719> echo

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.850 

okay<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:44.570> the<00:00:44.750> way<00:00:44.870> we<00:00:44.990> built<00:00:45.200> this<00:00:45.350> we<00:00:45.560> split

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
okay so the way we built this we split

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.380 
okay so the way we built this we split
this<00:00:46.010> up<00:00:46.160> into<00:00:46.340> three<00:00:46.400> different<00:00:46.610> systems<00:00:47.180> we

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
this up into three different systems we

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.360 
this up into three different systems we
had<00:00:47.540> the<00:00:47.810> electrical<00:00:48.290> system<00:00:48.650> we<00:00:48.980> had<00:00:49.130> the

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
had the electrical system we had the

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.980 
had the electrical system we had the
plumbing<00:00:49.760> can<00:00:49.910> we<00:00:50.030> hit<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.270> structure<00:00:50.630> system

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
plumbing can we hit the structure system

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.710 
plumbing can we hit the structure system
the<00:00:51.680> structure<00:00:52.100> we<00:00:52.190> built<00:00:52.460> out<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:52.720> 80/20

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
the structure we built out of 80/20

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.170 
the structure we built out of 80/20
frame<00:00:53.960> there's<00:00:54.320> this<00:00:54.530> lot<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:54.980> room<00:00:55.160> we<00:00:56.090> have

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
frame there's this lot of room we have

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.270 
frame there's this lot of room we have
to<00:00:56.300> build<00:00:56.480> in<00:00:56.810> a<00:00:57.350> couple<00:00:57.650> of<00:00:57.710> gusset<00:00:58.040> plates

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
to build in a couple of gusset plates

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.310 
to build in a couple of gusset plates
and<00:00:58.610> overall<00:00:59.510> it<00:00:59.630> turned<00:00:59.809> out<00:00:59.930> to<00:00:59.989> be<00:01:00.080> pretty

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
and overall it turned out to be pretty

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.229 
and overall it turned out to be pretty
good<00:01:00.440> support<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:01.250> can<00:01:01.400> see<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:04.850> doesn't<00:01:05.150> want

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
good support you can see it doesn't want

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.610 
good support you can see it doesn't want
to<00:01:05.360> move<00:01:05.510> especially<00:01:05.780> since<00:01:06.229> it's<00:01:06.350> leveled

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
to move especially since it's leveled

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.250 
to move especially since it's leveled

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
with five hundred pounds of water this

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.310 
with five hundred pounds of water this
is<00:01:09.320> our<00:01:09.560> FFT<00:01:10.220> bottle<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:11.060> shows<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.080> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
in move it out and I can cross my arms

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.180 
in move it out and I can cross my arms
and<00:02:09.810> I'll<00:02:09.899> still<00:02:10.110> go<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.500> now<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.950> switched

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and I'll still go and now it's switched

to another function that allows me to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.979 
to another function that allows me to

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
paint almost different life depending on

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:30.870 
paint almost different life depending on
my<00:02:16.110> location<00:02:16.470> with

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.120 

you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.650 

and<00:02:39.940> then<00:02:40.450> if<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.660> move<00:02:40.780> out<00:02:40.930> into<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.200> fringe

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
and then if you move out into the fringe

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.050 
and then if you move out into the fringe
it<00:02:43.660> takes<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.960> second<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.410> then<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.650> clears

it takes a second and then it clears

it takes a second and then it clears
everything<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.480> goes<00:02:46.990> back<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.560> ambient<00:02:48.100> mode
