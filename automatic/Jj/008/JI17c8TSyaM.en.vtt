00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
playing on the iceberg lounge I think

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.380

that<00:00:30.390> birds<00:00:30.570> called<00:00:31.969> mAb<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.149> pretty<00:00:33.300> much

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that birds called mAb and pretty much

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.020

what<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.430> fighting<00:00:35.730> one

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
what you do here is it's a fighting one

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.170 
what you do here is it's a fighting one
and<00:00:36.770> it's<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:38.190> pretty<00:00:38.579> sure<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:38.969> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and it's I'm pretty sure what it is is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.160 
and it's I'm pretty sure what it is is
just<00:00:39.210> endless<00:00:39.960> rounds<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.870> enemies<00:00:42.870> come<00:00:43.050> at

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
just endless rounds of enemies come at

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.430 
just endless rounds of enemies come at
you<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:44.070> remember<00:00:44.489> there<00:00:44.760> was<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.910> DLC<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.960> Arkham

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
you I remember there was a DLC in Arkham

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.110 
you I remember there was a DLC in Arkham
Asylum<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.850> was<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> lot

of<00:00:48.149> fun<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> think<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.260> better

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
of fun but this one I think is better

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.470 
of fun but this one I think is better
because<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:50.520> bigger<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.210> other<00:00:51.360> one

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
because it's bigger and the other one

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.990 
because it's bigger and the other one
was<00:00:51.600> very<00:00:51.629> Titan<00:00:52.559> impact<00:00:53.370> sounds<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> lot
