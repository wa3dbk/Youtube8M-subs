00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 today I will give an answer to one of the hands 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.899
 Frequently asked questions that you ask me when 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.360
 we are in the markets or when there 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.639
 we meet and it is that of how 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.150
 keep the shoe that is how to clean 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.630
 especially the suede that is evident is 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.390
 the skin that is more sensitive to dirt 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.710
 then you must immediately forewarn yourself of one 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:31.019
 basin with water a small brush 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.940
 from nails with a good grip and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.489
 of Marseille soap this is the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.380
 more ecological and more homely system 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.030
 to clean the shoe well then 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.770
 let's take a shoe that had walked 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.100
 for a while and that was enough 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.930
 Sports see the dirtiest area was 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.320
 this case the heel area 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.559
 let's start damien tingiamo the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.600
 brush in this way we rub myself 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.160
 maybe I get a little closer to the camera for 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.010
 show how I work I begin a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.909
 clean it this way you see what a hand 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.390
 as you rub it you make some foam 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:12.750
 which is the foam of the soap I dip 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.990
 still on the basin I dip again 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 on soap and I keep cleaning 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.950
 you have seen more has removed the laces before 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.890
 to start cleaning from shoes 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.409
 because the villages are annoying until 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.049
 do this operation see how 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.450
 in the area that I've already done, stay 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.400
 absorbing the soap this is not a 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.229
 bad because it keeps the skin soft 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.810
 let's go ahead not to see you see that 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.670
 the operation that does not need much 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.220
 time 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.329
 here in this case or intinto was a 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.329
 bit too much but still have the same 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.329
 let's continue 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.409
 I hope you see what I am 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:01.799
 by doing you will see that in the water a little 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.890
 dirty discord will dilute let's go 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.890
 forward 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:16.200
 the unit rule 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.480
 now here is some foam in 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.260
 we still dye clean a good one 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:28.739
 surface of the hair of the brush e 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:30.299
 We begin to remove a little in the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.110
 foam that he had made but really 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:37.319
 passing over it so here it is 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.079
 you will see that I was not foam and the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.230
 shoe is ready to be left in 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.150
 rest to dry away from each 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.280
 heat source 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.970
 naturally in nubuck to her slightly 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.650
 sirri will tell us however once you get it 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.440
 put on the shoe when it is dry 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.000
 ten steps and you will feel like waterfall 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.000
 first as soft as before
