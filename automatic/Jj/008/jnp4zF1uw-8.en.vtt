00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.989 

I<00:00:05.770> thought<00:00:06.770> we<00:00:06.859> had<00:00:06.950> one<00:00:07.100> more<00:00:07.279> laps<00:00:07.459> so<00:00:07.850> how

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:07.999 
I thought we had one more laps so how

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:09.490 
I thought we had one more laps so how
was<00:00:08.029> hopeful<00:00:08.510> that<00:00:08.540> caution<00:00:08.990> came<00:00:09.140> out<00:00:09.290> before

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
was hopeful that caution came out before

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.600 
was hopeful that caution came out before
we<00:00:09.770> cross<00:00:11.290> evidently<00:00:12.290> it<00:00:12.620> wasn't<00:00:12.950> a<00:00:13.100> case<00:00:13.250> but

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
we cross evidently it wasn't a case but

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.420 
we cross evidently it wasn't a case but
I<00:00:13.850> had<00:00:14.390> a<00:00:14.420> couple<00:00:14.600> runs<00:00:14.860> lap<00:00:15.860> or<00:00:16.010> two<00:00:16.039> before

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
I had a couple runs lap or two before

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.070 
I had a couple runs lap or two before
that<00:00:16.609> and<00:00:16.760> I<00:00:16.850> knew<00:00:16.970> to<00:00:17.090> sit<00:00:17.300> in<00:00:17.390> my<00:00:17.570> mind

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
that and I knew to sit in my mind

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.360 
that and I knew to sit in my mind
position<00:00:18.470> they're<00:00:18.590> not<00:00:18.740> give<00:00:18.860> up<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.070> bottom

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.370 
position they're not give up the bottom

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.860 
position they're not give up the bottom
I<00:00:19.550> felt<00:00:19.880> like<00:00:20.030> something<00:00:20.300> what<00:00:20.539> happened<00:00:20.810> up

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.870 
I felt like something what happened up

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.240 
I felt like something what happened up
front<00:00:21.170> and<00:00:21.230> I<00:00:21.289> could<00:00:21.440> improve<00:00:21.650> my<00:00:21.800> position

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
front and I could improve my position

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.970 
front and I could improve my position
and<00:00:22.370> sure<00:00:22.490> enough<00:00:22.550> it<00:00:22.820> did<00:00:23.200> look<00:00:24.200> like<00:00:24.260> tony

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
and sure enough it did look like tony

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.380 
and sure enough it did look like tony
was<00:00:25.130> trying<00:00:25.340> to<00:00:25.430> make<00:00:25.490> a<00:00:25.550> move<00:00:25.670> college<00:00:26.240> trying

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
was trying to make a move college trying

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.060 
was trying to make a move college trying
to<00:00:26.450> keep<00:00:26.600> them<00:00:26.690> behind<00:00:26.869> him<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:27.289> they<00:00:27.920> hooked

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
to keep them behind him and they hooked

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.189 
to keep them behind him and they hooked
by<00:00:28.220> a<00:00:28.250> couple<00:00:28.460> inches<00:00:28.699> and<00:00:28.940> turn<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.240> 18<00:00:29.570> on

of<00:01:12.100> Kyle's<00:01:13.100> car<00:01:13.399> he<00:01:13.850> went<00:01:14.030> straight<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.420> the

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
of Kyle's car he went straight in the

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.819 
of Kyle's car he went straight in the
fence<00:01:14.689> in<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:14.930> they<00:01:15.170> looked<00:01:15.439> to<00:01:15.530> me<00:01:15.619> like<00:01:15.649> the

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
fence in it they looked to me like the

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.249 
fence in it they looked to me like the
wheels<00:01:15.979> came<00:01:16.189> off<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.430> ground<00:01:16.609> a<00:01:16.700> bit<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.259> real

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
wheels came off the ground a bit so real

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.529 
wheels came off the ground a bit so real
scared<00:01:18.649> for<00:01:19.189> him<00:01:19.310> there<00:01:19.490> for<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.700> second<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:20.509> I

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
scared for him there for a second so I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.389 
scared for him there for a second so I
just<00:01:20.689> turned<00:01:20.930> left<00:01:21.109> went<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.469> grass<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.009> I

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
just turned left went to the grass and I

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.999 
just turned left went to the grass and I
guess<00:01:23.000> Tony<00:01:23.180> won<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.539> race<00:01:23.659> but<00:01:23.899> just<00:01:24.649> a<00:01:24.710> wild

guess Tony won the race but just a wild

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.880 
guess Tony won the race but just a wild
