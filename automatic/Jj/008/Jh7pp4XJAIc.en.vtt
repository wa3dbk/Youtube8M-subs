00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
wig I don't recommend wearing it as a

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.650 
wig I don't recommend wearing it as a
full<00:02:36.190> win<00:02:36.400> just<00:02:36.580> because<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:37.030> will<00:02:37.210> look<00:02:37.360> too

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
full win just because it will look too

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.280 
full win just because it will look too
when<00:02:38.320> he<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.500> don't<00:02:38.800> think<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.040> has<00:02:39.250> enough<00:02:39.580> um

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
when he I don't think it has enough um

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.200 
when he I don't think it has enough um
it's<00:02:41.290> not<00:02:41.470> as<00:02:41.560> big<00:02:41.830> as<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.220> legit<00:02:42.610> way<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
it's not as big as the legit way and it

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.880 
it's not as big as the legit way and it
is<00:02:43.360> comparable<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.960> legit<00:02:44.410> but<00:02:44.590> it's<00:02:44.710> not<00:02:44.800> as

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
is comparable to legit but it's not as

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.430 
is comparable to legit but it's not as
big<00:02:45.070> as<00:02:45.250> as<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.610> village<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.330> wig<00:02:46.570> so<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.080> think<00:02:47.170> it

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
big as as a village a wig so I think it

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.800 
big as as a village a wig so I think it
easily<00:02:47.800> looks<00:02:48.190> like<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.430> wig<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.540> weren't

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
easily looks like a wig if you weren't

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.720 
easily looks like a wig if you weren't
as<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.050> full<00:02:50.410> weight<00:02:50.650> because<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.370> demi

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
as a full weight because this is a demi

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.560 
as a full weight because this is a demi
cap<00:02:52.150> um<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:54.250> what<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.430> did<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.910> basically<00:02:55.270> I

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
cap um so what I did is basically I

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.140 
cap um so what I did is basically I
pulled<00:02:56.110> my<00:02:56.380> hair<00:02:56.650> back<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.190> then<00:02:57.610> just<00:02:57.880> put<00:02:58.060> it

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
pulled my hair back and then just put it

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.600 
pulled my hair back and then just put it
right<00:02:58.450> here<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.470> looks<00:02:59.680> like<00:02:59.860> I<00:02:59.980> have<00:03:00.220> it

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
right here so it looks like I have it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.030 
right here so it looks like I have it
cuz<00:03:00.820> my<00:03:01.000> hair<00:03:01.270> like<00:03:01.450> gets<00:03:01.660> apart<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.440> then<00:03:02.920> my

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
cuz my hair like gets apart and then my

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.770 
cuz my hair like gets apart and then my
hair<00:03:03.280> in<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.490> back<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:04.210> my<00:03:04.330> hair<00:03:04.540> is<00:03:04.630> actually

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.530 
hair in the back but my hair is actually
just<00:03:05.620> loosely<00:03:06.160> twisted<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:06.970> creates<00:03:07.300> this

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
just loosely twisted so it creates this

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.810 
just loosely twisted so it creates this
