you<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> race<00:01:01.340> but<00:01:02.420> you<00:01:03.420> know

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you do is a race but you know

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
you do is a race but you know
mountaineering<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.589> climbing<00:01:04.830> mountains

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
mountaineering and climbing mountains

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.730 
mountaineering and climbing mountains
and<00:01:05.880> being<00:01:06.240> self-reliant<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.229> think<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.590> would

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and being self-reliant I think I would

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
and being self-reliant I think I would
have<00:01:07.860> probably<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:08.909> growing<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.210> in

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
have probably you know growing up in

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.609 
have probably you know growing up in
Northern<00:01:09.600> California's<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.080> big<00:01:10.260> climbing

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
Northern California's a big climbing

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.700 
Northern California's a big climbing
community<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.010> Yosemite<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.510> lot<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
community in Yosemite and a lot of the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.499 
community in Yosemite and a lot of the
places<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.580> sort<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.880> gravitated

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
places that I was sort of gravitated

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.859 
places that I was sort of gravitated
towards<00:01:15.869> were<00:01:16.740> outdoor<00:01:17.610> shops<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
towards were outdoor shops and and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.080 
towards were outdoor shops and and
mountain<00:01:19.350> climbing<00:01:19.770> stores<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.939> would

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
mountain climbing stores and I would

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
mountain climbing stores and I would
read<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> books<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:22.380> look<00:01:22.500> at<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
read the books and I would look at the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.730 
read the books and I would look at the
equipment<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.110> when<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> started<00:01:25.619> getting

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
equipment and when I started getting

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.850 
equipment and when I started getting
into<00:01:25.950> cycling<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.580> started<00:01:27.000> dreaming<00:01:27.180> about

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
into cycling I started dreaming about

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.280 
into cycling I started dreaming about
spending<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.880> days<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.630> weeks

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
spending you know days and weeks

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.560 
spending you know days and weeks
climbing<00:01:31.920> mountains<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:33.180> think<00:01:33.390> that's

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
climbing mountains and I think that's

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.969 
climbing mountains and I think that's
probably<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.140> direction<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.740> would<00:01:34.799> have

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
probably the direction I would have

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.289 
probably the direction I would have
headed<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.990> but<00:01:37.369> cycling<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:41.090> it<00:01:42.090> had

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
headed and but cycling was more it had

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.719 
headed and but cycling was more it had
more<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:42.990> more<00:01:43.020> versatile<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.009> could<00:01:44.640> do

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
more it was more versatile I could do

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
more it was more versatile I could do
more<00:01:44.909> things<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.259> more

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
more things and I was more

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.340 
more things and I was more
self-sufficient<00:01:47.210> through<00:01:48.210> cycling<00:01:48.689> than

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
self-sufficient through cycling than

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.469 
self-sufficient through cycling than
anything<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.070> could<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.360> had

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
anything that I could have but if I had

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.510 
anything that I could have but if I had
never<00:01:51.630> been<00:01:51.810> exposed<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.799> think<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.460> don't

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
never been exposed to it I think I don't

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.510 
never been exposed to it I think I don't

but there's 200 guys fighting for those
three<00:03:27.690> spots<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:29.880> can't<00:03:30.180> imagine

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
three spots and you you can't imagine

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.530 
three spots and you you can't imagine
the<00:03:31.050> war<00:03:31.530> for<00:03:32.430> those<00:03:32.550> three<00:03:32.850> spots<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.330> get

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
the war for those three spots to get

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.479 
the war for those three spots to get
into<00:03:33.780> those<00:03:33.900> three<00:03:34.200> positions<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:35.100> you're

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
into those three positions and you're

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.190 
into those three positions and you're
talking<00:03:35.850> about<00:03:36.060> roads<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.630> are<00:03:36.720> barely<00:03:36.959> as

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
talking about roads that are barely as

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.070 
talking about roads that are barely as
wide<00:03:37.350> as<00:03:37.530> my<00:03:37.560> shoulders<00:03:38.100> so<00:03:39.030> you're<00:03:39.630> trying<00:03:39.959> to

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
wide as my shoulders so you're trying to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.650 
wide as my shoulders so you're trying to
cram<00:03:40.940> 200<00:03:41.940> maniacs<00:03:42.690> in<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.920> space<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:45.450> only

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
cram 200 maniacs in the space that only

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.440 
cram 200 maniacs in the space that only
two<00:03:45.989> or<00:03:46.080> three<00:03:46.290> men<00:03:46.470> should<00:03:46.739> be<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:47.700> that's

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
two or three men should be and so that's

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.759 
two or three men should be and so that's
if<00:03:48.570> it's<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.780> good<00:03:48.989> road<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.320> then<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.530> get<00:03:49.650> on

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
if it's a good road and then you get on

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.860 
if it's a good road and then you get on
the<00:03:49.920> cobble<00:03:50.370> that's<00:03:50.640> before<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.420> get<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
the cobble that's before you get to the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.290 
the cobble that's before you get to the
cobbles<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:53.190> then<00:03:53.400> once<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:53.850> get<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.090> the

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
cobbles so then once you get to the

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.630 
cobbles so then once you get to the
