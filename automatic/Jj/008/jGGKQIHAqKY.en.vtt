00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.970 

when<00:02:32.210> they<00:02:32.330> come<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:32.600> place<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:32.990> at<00:02:33.320> like<00:02:33.800> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
when they come in place this at like the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.720 
when they come in place this at like the
keyboard<00:02:34.310> right<00:02:34.960> okay<00:02:35.960> and<00:02:36.590> then<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:37.460> know<00:02:37.580> if

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
keyboard right okay and then you know if

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.160 
keyboard right okay and then you know if
you<00:02:37.880> did<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.830> swap<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.270> keyboard<00:02:41.720> then

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
you did the swap of the keyboard then

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.540 
you did the swap of the keyboard then
you<00:02:42.320> might<00:02:42.590> feel<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.490> lump<00:02:43.910> at<00:02:44.780> first<00:02:45.170> but<00:02:45.890> I'm

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
you might feel a lump at first but I'm

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.570 
you might feel a lump at first but I'm
gonna<00:02:46.730> keep<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.570> keyboard<00:02:48.080> will<00:02:48.320> settle<00:02:48.710> if

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
gonna keep the keyboard will settle if

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.250 
gonna keep the keyboard will settle if
you<00:02:49.730> put<00:02:49.940> those<00:02:50.890> small<00:02:51.890> plastic<00:02:52.640> things<00:02:53.260> right

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
you put those small plastic things right

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.340 
you put those small plastic things right
so<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:55.310> won't<00:02:55.460> settle<00:02:56.470> okay<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.850> see<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.260> feels<00:03:00.260> a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
so it won't settle okay I see it feels a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.960 
so it won't settle okay I see it feels a
little<00:03:00.470> bit<00:03:00.710> stiff<00:03:01.070> but<00:03:01.100> anyway<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.480> just<00:03:03.970> as

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
little bit stiff but anyway it just as

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.360 
little bit stiff but anyway it just as
long<00:03:05.240> as<00:03:05.390> it's<00:03:05.570> about<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:07.870> mm-hmm

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
long as it's about that mm-hmm

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.190 
long as it's about that mm-hmm
okay<00:03:10.420> yeah<00:03:11.420> this<00:03:12.410> one<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.770> might<00:03:12.950> have<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:14.200> open

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
okay yeah this one I might have to open

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.480 
okay yeah this one I might have to open
again<00:03:15.380> because<00:03:16.070> not<00:03:16.280> all<00:03:16.460> of<00:03:16.490> them<00:03:16.850> are<00:03:17.110> okay

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
again because not all of them are okay

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.220 
again because not all of them are okay
but<00:03:19.960> anyway<00:03:20.960> I<00:03:21.080> think<00:03:21.470> here<00:03:22.720> it'll<00:03:23.720> be<00:03:23.900> an

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
but anyway I think here it'll be an

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.300 
but anyway I think here it'll be an
issue<00:03:25.990> because<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:29.540> always<00:03:29.900> good<00:03:30.310> it's

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
issue because it's always good it's

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.180 
issue because it's always good it's
always<00:03:31.550> better<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.880> have<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.410> keyboard<00:03:33.410> but<00:03:33.680> you

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
always better to have a keyboard but you

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.890 
always better to have a keyboard but you
know<00:03:34.310> if<00:03:34.400> you're<00:03:34.610> looking<00:03:34.910> for<00:03:37.900> better

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
know if you're looking for better

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.750 
know if you're looking for better
solutions<00:03:40.180> okay

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
solutions okay

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.690 
solutions okay
I'm<00:03:43.760> just<00:03:43.970> checking<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.420> keys<00:03:45.459> anyway<00:03:46.459> this

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
I'm just checking the keys anyway this

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.580 
I'm just checking the keys anyway this
is<00:03:46.880> for<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.600> I'll<00:03:47.780> open<00:03:48.500> this<00:03:48.680> some<00:03:49.270> on<00:03:50.270> my<00:03:50.480> own

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.350 

there<00:03:54.590> are<00:03:54.680> few<00:03:54.890> keys<00:03:55.160> that<00:03:55.370> are<00:03:55.580> not<00:03:55.850> really

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
there are few keys that are not really

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.699 
there are few keys that are not really
okay<00:03:57.200> now<00:03:57.680> we'll<00:03:57.860> have<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.070> look<00:03:58.340> on<00:03:58.490> those<00:03:59.590> in<00:04:00.590> a

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
okay now we'll have a look on those in a

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.710 
okay now we'll have a look on those in a
second<00:04:01.130> okay<00:04:01.850> maybe<00:04:02.150> this<00:04:02.390> is<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.540> good

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
second okay maybe this is a good

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.680 
second okay maybe this is a good
exercise<00:04:02.990> to<00:04:03.400> kind<00:04:04.400> of<00:04:04.550> show<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:04.970> exactly<00:04:05.480> how

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
exercise to kind of show you exactly how

exercise to kind of show you exactly how
to<00:04:05.959> take<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.470> keyboard<00:04:07.630> okay<00:04:08.660> don't<00:04:09.200> happens

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
goes here okay not here okay and then

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.220 
goes here okay not here okay and then
pull<00:04:25.100> it<00:04:25.250> up<00:04:25.930> mm-hmm

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
pull it up mm-hmm

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:34.420 
pull it up mm-hmm
one<00:04:29.440> come<00:04:30.440> on<00:04:30.590> come<00:04:31.400> on<00:04:31.430> -<00:04:31.730> okay<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.800> then<00:04:33.919> you

one come on come on - okay and then you

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.430 
one come on come on - okay and then you
see<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.669> connection<00:04:35.060> there<00:04:35.240> we<00:04:36.050> come<00:04:36.230> with<00:04:36.410> a

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
see the connection there we come with a

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.000 
see the connection there we come with a
plastic<00:04:37.370> thing<00:04:38.860> and<00:04:39.860> then<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:41.090> just<00:04:41.770> lift<00:04:42.770> it

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
plastic thing and then you just lift it

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.659 
plastic thing and then you just lift it
a<00:04:43.070> little<00:04:43.220> bit<00:04:43.639> from<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:44.000> inside<00:04:45.460> not<00:04:46.460> too

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
a little bit from the inside not too

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.170 
a little bit from the inside not too
much<00:04:46.880> I'm<00:04:47.120> gonna<00:04:47.270> go<00:04:47.510> on<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:47.720> other<00:04:47.780> side<00:04:49.180> lift

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
much I'm gonna go on the other side lift

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.890 
much I'm gonna go on the other side lift
pink<00:04:50.870> okay<00:04:51.610> what<00:04:52.610> was<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:52.790> issue<00:04:54.760> yeah<00:04:55.760> okay

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
pink okay what was the issue yeah okay

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.860 
pink okay what was the issue yeah okay
so<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:58.250> idea<00:04:58.550> is<00:04:58.700> that<00:04:58.880> we<00:04:59.300> have<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.690> look

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
so the idea is that we have to look

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.240 
so the idea is that we have to look
underneath<00:05:00.260> you<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:02.720> then<00:05:02.930> see<00:05:03.320> oh<00:05:03.590> yeah<00:05:04.220> I

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
underneath you and then see oh yeah I

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.690 
underneath you and then see oh yeah I
see<00:05:04.550> it

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
see it

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.810 
see it
I<00:05:04.930> see<00:05:05.930> a<00:05:05.960> few<00:05:06.169> things<00:05:06.229> wrong<00:05:07.040> there<00:05:07.280> but

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
I see a few things wrong there but

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.159 
I see a few things wrong there but
that's<00:05:08.180> not<00:05:08.419> gonna<00:05:08.570> be<00:05:08.720> a<00:05:08.750> problem

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
that's not gonna be a problem

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.900 
that's not gonna be a problem
okay<00:05:09.740> I'll<00:05:09.919> do<00:05:10.070> that<00:05:10.190> on<00:05:10.250> my<00:05:10.520> own<00:05:10.550> time<00:05:10.790> because

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
okay I'll do that on my own time because

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.140 
okay I'll do that on my own time because
I<00:05:11.060> have<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.210> heat<00:05:11.479> it<00:05:11.510> up<00:05:11.690> and<00:05:12.460> and<00:05:13.460> then<00:05:13.639> try<00:05:14.120> to

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
I have to heat it up and and then try to

I have to heat it up and and then try to
you<00:05:14.960> know<00:05:14.990> nudge<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.950> in<00:05:16.070> place<00:05:16.310> okay

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030
