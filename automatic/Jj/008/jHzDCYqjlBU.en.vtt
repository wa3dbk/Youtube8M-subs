00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 but mario been signed by feyenoord mister the hunter 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.199
 I don't know what that will get 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.509
 I speak 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.440
 I don't know I think I have it in the umpteenth not bad though 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.490
 It is well known that he is for you 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.310
 it is familiar ground is true i live in rotterdam weeks see the tub as 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.660
 you look closely illness cooper lie from home 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.390
 but you and leg take a night at barendrecht I live in east and east 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.740
 but yes i know i have played the 8 years at feyenoord i have day might 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.980
 and I had a fantastic time everyone knows that 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.140
 So if that question ever comes from the summer when the finances are clear and they 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.000
 from now on would have ears 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.490
 I have ambitions to moan ears to Feyenoord years 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.679
 if you have ambitions when they are getting high and a good sleep at the moment 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.119
 does it sound like train track yes right but then I stick to that feyenoord on the 

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:52.920
 position where they do not belong 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.960
 and the big port of Tangier is fierce from Feyenoord is logical 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.250
 Have made a choice by Mario Leg to the Total 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.250
 then he already knows of course through and through and knows what he has to you 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.040
 what can he add to the feyenoord as it stands now 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.560
 yes off just as a person from outside when we see I think and I am not sure 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.830
 just feyenoord 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.080
 Who 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.150
 in the selection first just a virus like proving it for a while 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.930
 and I think that mario leg in diest can do antibiotics 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.910
 take it with you and apply it to put the tiles on 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.030
 suspect buttons in any way I mean is that with humor that is with 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.530
 another way of approaching how should it look 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.610
 but i just think by way of mario leg that he also has it there 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.610
 has done it in a nutshell in a few words 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.890
 enjoy a good attitude and make it clear to the players that they are not 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.700
 just for them have to play football but for themselves and for it 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.660
 audience buying in a season ticket 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.720
 So and then that then you realize that you like your audience viewers 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.470
 People who work hard for a season ticket that you then get 110 percent 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.560
 to give 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.890
 so leg it can be a trick not only at a club like nrc but that will 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.060
 it can also at a top club 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.499
 I think so I think I sure he will afterwards 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.999
 what he got there on the rails though is not the first season 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:08.670
 certainly two-thirds third star happens
