00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.350
 from the 80s the 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.509
 Video games have been becoming 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.150
 part of the daily life of the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.460
 people in almost all the world up 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.830
 get to the point even today is a 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
 industry bigger than cinema the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.190
 great video game producers and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.740
 make announcements of new releases 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.690
 during most of the year 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.800
 they are classic and legendary with end 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.290
 fantasy 73 and 92 metal gear solid 'between 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.180
 many others made us go great 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.550
 moments and not leave the big 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.160
 memories but as every industry has 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.290
 his dark side and his bad moments are 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.370
 I could not make the exception as xavi 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.860
 two eggs that have also left us 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.520
 memories for not exactly so 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.520
 good that were 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.070
 these games were so shit that only 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.949
 putting them up for sale would have been a 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.589
 rude graphics that burned the eyes 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.570
 bad gameplay arguments so bad 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.129
 that scratched on the vehicles were 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.440
 some of these those of the videogames 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.079
 and now I show them what to me 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.420
 criteria are the five worst you would know 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.780
 by the producers 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.780
 to 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.570
 if you are one of those who like the unique 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.730
 themselves displaced maybe this is your 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.650
 eggs 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.440
 with the title of the most useless game of the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.960
 club history is a game developed to 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.490
 the 90s by a programmer without trade and 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.040
 thinking for sure what he would do with his life 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.530
 Well, I think that such garbage looks more like 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.720
 in laughter the main character in a 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.150
 asylum to which we must carry a 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.340
 end to another without leaving lopez the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.050
 gameplay was totally stupid and 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.510
 found we're going to delayed on horseback 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.580
 with one key for each leg making a 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.900
 force almost always useless to have the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.150
 past did not fall backwards or towards 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.950
 in front of a game that makes us ask 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.950
 why did not they abort their creator 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.780
 i 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.550
 books and 3d was the first and last game 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.450
 of the blues saga and developed in 3d 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.800
 for playstation in the year of 1994 it was 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.660
 a game that pretended to measure up in 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.870
 the games of the time like super mario 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.910
 64 or bandicoot crash but could never 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.760
 approach these two and even the no 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.020
 it was so painful that barely five 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.000
 minutes of having started the egg 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.980
 Wishing to read the heads with their 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.200
 miserable pixelated graphics to the extreme 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.230
 a skill both confused and very 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.900
 difficult sounds very repetitive and without a 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.700
 solid argument this boastful egg of 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.980
 be the worst platform game anymore 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.550
 developed and condemned the musical saga 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.860
 completed the video a great pity with 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.700
 your great predecessors and I will give you a 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.129
 example of this 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.379
 the first metal and only for pc wang 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.170
 It was without a doubt a masterpiece 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:59.200
 that have recovered forever 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.930
 Now imagine that metal gear 2 has 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.810
 been so bad so badly to leave 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.790
 the room in complete oblivion as well 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.790
 of atrocious was books and 3d 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.160
 the video games of comic superheroes 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.590
 they have not been the best in lines 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.040
 general few titles like batman 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.710
 arkham city 'have come true 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.680
 of the super plus 64 released in the year of 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.620
 1994 exclusively for the nintendo of 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.660
 64 was such a miserable game that 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.540
 presumed to have the worst game title 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.850
 of this console and for many media the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.770
 worst game in history the greatest 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.890
 pleasure in its gameplay is to fly 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.200
 stupidly through some hoops to 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.540
 get to a specific destination the 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.450
 control is lousy superman is almost 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.550
 uncontrollable just like the camera that 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.790
 without mentioning the graphics a total 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.560
 shame a city with details 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.930
 unforgivable and a totally superman 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.380
 unrecognizable except for the colors of the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.220
 suit in order for the game is as if you 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.680
 make salt in the eyes 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.190
 a total shame for the character of 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.190
 superman 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.820
 there are games that cause a sensation but 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.770
 final are bad or at least help the 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.259
 minimum quality required 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.840
 many games are also bad but 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.240
 soon forgotten as many 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.080
 Eggs are bad as they end up selling 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.539
 taking advantage of the success of some movie 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.370
 and there are games that are rent and masters 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:53.110
 but buy them ever but this game 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.599
 made an entire industry go to the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.680
 tender the famous crisis of the 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.680
 video games of 83 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:04.119
 and the alien was a game 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.299
 developed by natalia in the year 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:09.699
 1982 taking advantage of the great success of the 

00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:11.829
 movie the company wanted to make the 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.679
 game in record time no matter 

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:16.719
 not even the quality of it and how 

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:18.879
 hopefully the result was so 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:21.009
 disastrous although then it has been called the 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.169
 worst video game in the world and that is 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.869
 while we play this game hard 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.979
 we know what we should do without 

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:28.869
 mention that projects and 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.479
 graphics follow that we will burn the 

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:33.849
 retina not only we advance we choose 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.909
 objects but nothing makes sense in this 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.249
 mediocre video game so much so that as 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:41.409
 I mentioned already led the atari company to 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:44.229
 bankruptcy and how people did not want to 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.609
 gifted is said to reach the point of 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.849
 that four million copy of the game 

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:50.200
 without selling they are buried in the desert 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.960
 numeric 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.300
 although it is hard to believe in play 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.970
 so have had sales by very few 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:02.970
 fish the game that occupies our first 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.970
 place has managed to sell a single copy 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.520
 i 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.350
 the worst video game in history was 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:26.229
 created in 1995 and did not sell a single civil 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.960
 his name is serpost and fun 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.940
 of this game is to travel a road 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.760
 in a straight line for 8 real hours 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.400
 consecutive and if the player wants to 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.300
 least take a break and you should 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.729
 restart the entire game 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.069
 you must take a supposed bus that neither 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:46.470
 veto true from tucson up 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:48.509
 Arizona in real time respecting the 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.750
 Regulatory speed with a board 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:53.580
 which includes a single curve is so but 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.520
 so bad that there are not even vehicles 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.919
 to dodge and once in a while it gets 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.349
 see on the screen some white sign that 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:03.620
 tries to give the feeling that this 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:03.620
 Advance 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:08.449
 the game only allows one player to whom 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.849
 it is required in addition to an incredible 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:13.159
 tolerance to boredom maintain 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:15.560
 sign the helm of the virtual bus 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:18.110
 it has been programmed because it 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.270
 constantly to the right you have to 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.159
 be extremely alert an oversight 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.409
 can force the hard-working player to 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:27.050
 start again so take five hours 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:28.580
 driving and even if you do not believe it is the 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.710
 number of people that isolated have the 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.490
 patience to complete I can you 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.830
 count fingers with one hand 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.020
 so much so that the magazines and pages 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.949
 videogame officials refused 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.949
 even to qualify 

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:47.900
