so the first thing we're going to do is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.930 
so the first thing we're going to do is
add<00:02:38.340> some<00:02:38.790> olive<00:02:38.970> oil<00:02:40.070> about<00:02:41.070> two<00:02:41.640> tablespoons

again extra virgin olive oil is always

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.260 
again extra virgin olive oil is always
