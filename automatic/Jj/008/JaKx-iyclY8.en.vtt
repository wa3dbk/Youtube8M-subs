00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
when the most useless thing in the world

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.209 
when the most useless thing in the world
but<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.509> did<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> good<00:01:57.869> job<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.890> like<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.070> is

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
but you did a good job it's like this is

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.109 
but you did a good job it's like this is
like<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> only<00:01:59.520> thing<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.759> can<00:01:59.850> actually<00:02:00.060> do

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
like the only thing you can actually do

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.399 
like the only thing you can actually do
with<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> game<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.960> make<00:02:01.140> make

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
with it in a game like to make make

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.120 
with it in a game like to make make
pretty<00:02:01.799> blue<00:02:02.040> blocks<00:02:03.469> yeah<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:04.950> got

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
pretty blue blocks yeah and then you got

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.839 
pretty blue blocks yeah and then you got
a<00:02:05.159> little<00:02:05.310> your<00:02:06.090> little<00:02:06.560> library<00:02:07.560> i<00:02:07.649> think<00:02:07.890> is

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
a little your little library i think is

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.430 
a little your little library i think is
that<00:02:09.770> it's<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.840> think<00:02:12.840> that's<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.110> okay

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
that it's the I think that's the okay

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.380 
that it's the I think that's the okay
yeah<00:02:13.709> okay<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.099> this<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.520> bedroom<00:02:14.640> and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
yeah okay so this is the bedroom and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.059 
yeah okay so this is the bedroom and
then<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.319> library<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.950> is

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
then this is this is a library this is

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.580 
then this is this is a library this is
the<00:02:17.160> study<00:02:17.370> space<00:02:20.300> okay<00:02:21.300> with<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.599> whatever

going you got some little hiding spaces

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.570 
going you got some little hiding spaces
you<00:02:29.099> figure<00:02:29.489> out<00:02:29.520> how<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.670> work<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.120> stairs<00:02:31.580> it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
you figure out how to work the stairs it
