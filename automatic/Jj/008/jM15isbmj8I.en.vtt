out<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.280> date<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.930> think<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.439> time<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.220> do

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
out of date and I think it's time to do

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.330 
out of date and I think it's time to do
something<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:07.170> wasn't<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.220> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
something about that I wasn't going to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.130 
something about that I wasn't going to
do<00:01:08.520> anything<00:01:08.700> about<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.630> think<00:01:09.750> now

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
do anything about that but I think now

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.929 
do anything about that but I think now
things<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.890> getting<00:01:10.920> getting<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> little

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
things are getting getting a little

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
wasting memory so I've decided I'm not

Lambert oz I can't exactly take that

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.990 
Lambert oz I can't exactly take that
world<00:02:18.540> with<00:02:18.810> me<00:02:19.020> either<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.940> be

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
world with me either so it's going to be

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.060 
world with me either so it's going to be
brand-new<00:02:21.900> fresh<00:02:22.260> start<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.970> new<00:02:24.330> server

brand-new fresh start in a new server

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.310 
brand-new fresh start in a new server
but<00:02:26.070> with<00:02:26.790> with<00:02:27.060> kind<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.810> picking<00:02:28.050> up<00:02:28.170> from

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
but with with kind of picking up from

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.500 
but with with kind of picking up from
where<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.590> left<00:02:28.740> off<00:02:29.100> with<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.090> with<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.390> other

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
where we left off with it with the other

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.550 
where we left off with it with the other
two<00:02:30.810> worlds<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:33.000> timings<00:02:33.420> perfect<00:02:33.930> for<00:02:34.410> it

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
two worlds it the timings perfect for it

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.440 
two worlds it the timings perfect for it
really<00:02:34.980> because<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.430> direwolf<00:02:35.850> series<00:02:36.300> is

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
really because the direwolf series is

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.970 
really because the direwolf series is
that<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.930> direwolf<00:02:37.290> mod<00:02:37.470> packs<00:02:37.770> they're

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
that the direwolf mod packs they're

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.070 
that the direwolf mod packs they're
available<00:02:38.310> for<00:02:38.790> us<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.180> lambert<00:02:39.510> haces<00:02:39.840> shut

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
his server down anyway so everything

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.360 
his server down anyway so everything
everything's<00:02:42.960> coming<00:02:43.200> together<00:02:43.290> nicely<00:02:43.740> so

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
everything's coming together nicely so

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.840 
everything's coming together nicely so
that<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.850> one<00:02:45.560> FTB<00:02:46.560> series<00:02:47.100> can<00:02:47.340> come<00:02:47.520> out<00:02:47.550> of
