00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.930
 hi girls welcome to my channel is 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.910
 As you can see we are going to make a make -up 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.679
 last night with the maker press palette 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.080
 first thing we're going to do is apply the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.199
 lanchero first production in color 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.930
 Original from urban de cake to later 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.990
 use a pretty clear umbrella 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.180
 that is the strange color and we are going to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.970
 also use the second color of the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.630
 palette that is color 2 which is a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.730
 rosadito pretty bright beige with a 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.370
 because you can not see a little good 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.320
 the colors due to light but to which 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.719
 I will not leave a photo for you 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.250
 look good how are the colors then 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.920
 let's use a good brush 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.190
 delgadito to mark the external view of 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.890
 eye with the colors dark side and black 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.260
 eyed and that we are going to blur very well 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.300
 I'm using the sigma broach and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.590
 then those colors we will take them to the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 lower eyelid up to half and then 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.660
 in the first half that reaches the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.980
 we will use again the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.500
 color 2 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.250
 let's now use a white pencil 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.960
 to illuminate a little more the look 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.090
 loans our eyelashes very very well 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.860
 and if you want you can put some eyelashes 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.549
 false for it to be much more 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.690
 dramatic 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.700
 we outline our eyes I'm 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.290
 using the tip brush 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.330
 silicone techniques beagle 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.620
 that I'm just learning more or less 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.200
 how to use it why I'm a little 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.760
 sad but good practice is the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.280
 teacher so let's leave some 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.270
 new balls we will give much more 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.439
 beautiful 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.530
 do not forget that they should leave it well 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.450
 polished that suddenly takes its time and 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.970
 practice but the idea is that we're going to 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.550
 learn to be 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.610
 I'm going to use the lash now 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.680
 using a smartbox that is the force 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.680
 or breaking 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.439
 and we paint our eyebrows like 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.509
 custom if you want to see how it was 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.460
 doing it some time ago I'm going to 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.280
 leave a video but I promise to make a 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.050
 routine updates now let's finish 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.790
 to make up all our face I'm 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.069
 using the makeup base of 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.110
 revlon colors of which you know that 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.110
 I love it I love it I love it 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.070
 to then correct some 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.860
 imperfections that we do not like below 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.010
 of the eyes such as dark circles 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.420
 and do not forget please blur it very 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.420
 very good the concealer 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.060
 we seal everything everything absolutely everything 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.060
 with powders 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.640
 we continue our face 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.730
 and we apply a little blush here I am 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.460
 really using one that is more or 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.110
 less as rosita but not very strong the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.720
 idea only contribute a little bit of 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.630
 color and for the lips I'm going to put a 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.330
 little bit of base to neutralize and I'm going to 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.010
 use a close of s &amp; p but in a 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.690
 color very well and ready is our look 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.310
 Here are the photos I promised you 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.050
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.050
 see you next time a little kiss
