games<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.960> think<00:01:52.020> they<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> great

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
games right I think they have a great

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.980 
games right I think they have a great
backlog<00:01:53.579> catalog<00:01:54.119> would<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.540> whatever<00:01:54.720> your

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
backlog catalog would it whatever your

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
backlog catalog would it whatever your
aren't<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.229> make<00:01:55.409> good<00:01:55.560> games<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.340> they

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
aren't they make good games but they

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.330 
aren't they make good games but they
have<00:01:56.670> grown<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.600> too<00:01:57.840> large<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.500> their

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
have grown I think too large and their

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.459 
have grown I think too large and their
deadlines<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.240> too<00:02:00.390> short<00:02:00.689> they<00:02:01.049> crank<00:02:01.350> these

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
deadlines are too short they crank these

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.050 
deadlines are too short they crank these
games<00:02:01.740> out<00:02:01.890> too<00:02:02.040> quickly<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:02.729> do<00:02:02.790> that

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
games out too quickly and they do that

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.480 
games out too quickly and they do that
by<00:02:03.270> using<00:02:03.540> four<00:02:04.229> sometimes<00:02:04.530> five<00:02:04.740> different

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
by using four sometimes five different

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.010 
by using four sometimes five different
Studios<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.210> worked<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.630> watchdogs

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
Studios I think worked on watchdogs

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.499 
Studios I think worked on watchdogs
different<00:02:08.009> elements<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> game<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
different elements of the game so the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.669 
different elements of the game so the
left<00:02:09.690> hand<00:02:09.959> doesn't<00:02:10.170> know<00:02:10.319> what<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.649> right

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
left hand doesn't know what the right

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.390 
left hand doesn't know what the right
hand<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.250> doing<00:02:11.459> they<00:02:11.760> can't

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
hand is doing they can't

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.509 
hand is doing they can't
optimize<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.900> engine<00:02:14.379> across<00:02:14.799> all<00:02:15.159> these

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
optimize the engine across all these

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.369 
optimize the engine across all these
different<00:02:15.730> Studios<00:02:16.299> it<00:02:16.750> because<00:02:17.140> they're<00:02:17.290> all

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
different Studios it because they're all

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.660 
different Studios it because they're all
working<00:02:17.650> on<00:02:17.739> different<00:02:17.769> parts<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.519> game

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
working on different parts of the game

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.280 
working on different parts of the game
and<00:02:18.879> then<00:02:19.239> they<00:02:19.360> cobble<00:02:19.750> them<00:02:19.870> together<00:02:20.019> at

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
and then they cobble them together at

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.660 
and then they cobble them together at
the<00:02:20.409> last<00:02:20.530> minute<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.010> say<00:02:21.190> oh<00:02:21.220> well<00:02:21.519> that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670

didn't work together as well as we

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.430 
didn't work together as well as we
thought<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> might<00:02:24.129> right<00:02:24.879> well<00:02:25.720> some<00:02:26.049> users

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
gamers why would they do this you know

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.940 
gamers why would they do this you know
and<00:03:27.010> there's<00:03:27.400> an<00:03:27.519> understandable<00:03:28.060> amount<00:03:28.269> of

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
and there's an understandable amount of

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.379 
and there's an understandable amount of
outrage<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:29.980> it's<00:03:30.280> not<00:03:30.459> easy<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.970> jump<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.299> the

outrage and it's not easy to jump to the
conclusion<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.989> maybe<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:33.489> know<00:03:33.669> since

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
conclusion that maybe you know since

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.680 
conclusion that maybe you know since
it's<00:03:34.480> not<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.560> PC<00:03:36.129> market<00:03:36.819> is<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:37.239> varied

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
it's not the the PC market is so varied

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.300 
it's not the the PC market is so varied
and<00:03:37.870> different<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.470> there<00:03:39.040> isn't<00:03:39.160> really

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
and different that there isn't really

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.800 
and different that there isn't really
someone<00:03:39.730> there<00:03:39.879> you<00:03:40.299> know<00:03:40.419> pulling<00:03:40.629> the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
someone there you know pulling the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.300 
someone there you know pulling the
strings<00:03:41.109> and<00:03:41.379> saying<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.739> want<00:03:41.919> this<00:03:42.069> I<00:03:42.280> want

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
strings and saying I want this I want

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.979 
strings and saying I want this I want
that<00:03:42.549> make<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.180> make<00:03:43.419> that<00:03:43.629> for<00:03:43.840> me

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
that make this make that for me

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.780 
that make this make that for me
exclusive<00:03:44.620> etc<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:46.389> it's<00:03:46.660> not<00:03:46.810> totally

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
exclusive etc so it's not totally

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.619 
exclusive etc so it's not totally
understandable<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:49.000> people<00:03:49.030> would<00:03:49.389> jump<00:03:49.540> to

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
understandable that people would jump to

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.479 
understandable that people would jump to
that<00:03:49.720> conclusion<00:03:49.780> it's<00:03:50.709> just<00:03:50.889> even<00:03:51.160> they<00:03:51.310> even

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
that conclusion it's just even they even

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.129 
that conclusion it's just even they even
how<00:03:51.579> they<00:03:51.699> phrased<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.239> so<00:03:52.359> odd<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.720> me<00:03:52.750> when

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
how they phrased it is so odd to me when

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.170 
how they phrased it is so odd to me when
the<00:03:53.650> modern<00:03:53.980> question<00:03:54.370> subjectively

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
the modern question subjectively

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.360 
the modern question subjectively
enhances<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.019> game's<00:03:56.260> visual<00:03:56.709> fidelity<00:03:56.889> it's

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
enhances the game's visual fidelity it's

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.069 
enhances the game's visual fidelity it's
sort<00:03:57.549> of<00:03:57.579> saying<00:03:57.849> yeah<00:03:58.060> okay<00:03:58.389> you<00:03:58.449> might<00:03:58.840> think

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
sort of saying yeah okay you might think

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.110 
sort of saying yeah okay you might think
it's<00:03:59.230> better<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.530> can't<00:03:59.889> prove<00:04:00.129> that<00:04:00.160> well

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
it's better you can't prove that well

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.599 
it's better you can't prove that well
you<00:04:01.389> can<00:04:01.569> look<00:04:01.750> at<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.079> yeah<00:04:02.560> exactly

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
you can look at it yeah exactly

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.849 
you can look at it yeah exactly
exactly<00:04:04.299> it's<00:04:05.139> it's<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.160> weird<00:04:06.669> double-talk<00:04:07.629> II

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
exactly it's it's a weird double-talk II

exactly it's it's a weird double-talk II
explanation<00:04:08.859> instead<00:04:09.579> of<00:04:09.730> I<00:04:10.090> think<00:04:10.629> I'd<00:04:10.750> stare

guys<00:04:11.169> behind<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.859> tend<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.849> believe<00:04:13.510> it

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
guys behind it I tend to believe it

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.750 
guys behind it I tend to believe it

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
I have no problem believing that they

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.530 
I have no problem believing that they
just<00:04:19.100> screw<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.090> up

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
just screw it up
