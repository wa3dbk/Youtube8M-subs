00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.160
Hello I'm Clayton and we're here in the Art
Deco splendor of Eltham Palace to look at

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.090
some vintage cocktails.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.250
Now thanks to prohibition a lot of talented
American bartenders left the States to get

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.890
work taking with them their ideas and their
skills creating a global golden age of cocktails.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.960
Now we know that Stephen Courtauld himself
used to make cocktails in this very room in

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.690
the evening. So we're going to be looking
at three classics from the era, running through

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.600
how to make them so you can recreate them
at home.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.540
Mah-Jonng is a Chinese game played with little
counters a bit like Scrabble tiles, and like

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.750
many things it became quite a craze in the
1920s. We can reasonably assume that the Courtauld's

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.030
played this game because they had a pet lemur
whom they named Mah-Jonng. So in honor of

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.059
Mah-Jonng the lemur, we're going to make a
Mah-Jonng cocktail.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.260
What's slightly unusual about this cocktail
is that it has two spirits in it. So we're

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.090
going to start of with some Gin, about 50mls,
two standard cocktail measures. And then to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.210
that, we're going to add some White Rum - another
spirit. Only about half a measure, so that's

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.369
about 12 and a half mls. And finally we're
going to add an orange liqueur, you'll sometimes

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.939
see it called triple sec or Curaçao, it's
all essentially an orange flavoured liqueur,

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:34.770
so again about half a measure of that. Shake
all that up, put it in your shaker, plenty

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.899
of ice. Now do be careful with this because
as you've seen every thing that goes into

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:49.659
this cocktail is spirit strength so it has
got quite a bite. As apparently did the lemur.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:02:01.740
And finally as a garnish, a little bit of
lemon peel.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.350
So there you have it. The Mah-Jonng cocktail.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.229
Chin chin.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.750
From about the nineteen-teens onwards, aviation
became a very popular hobby for those that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.480
could afford it. And the whole world thrilled
to the exploits of aviators like Charles Lindbergh

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.530
who crossed the Atlantic solo in 1927, and
in fact it became quite the commercial enterprise

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.810
pretty soon too, and during prohibition one
American airline teamed up with a Cuban Rum

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.220
producer to lay on what you might call 'Booze
Cruises' - flying out of Florida straight

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.230
into Havanna harbour where they spilled out
and hit the bars.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.260
So it's not surprising that before long someone
would name a cocktail after it.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.560
So start of with about 50mls of Gin, about
two standard measures. And I'm going to add

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.550
about half a measure of Maraschino - 12 and
a half mls.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.370
And about the same amount of lemon juice.
Here's some I squeezed earlier.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.320
And finally just about a teaspoon of Crème
de Violette.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.630
Plenty of ice.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:32.420
And if we have got our proportions right,
there you have it. A sky blue cocktail.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.750
The Aviation cocktail.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.930
Now a Commodore is a rank in the navy and
of course the navy have a fine drinking tradition

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.350
of its own so its not surprising they should
have a cocktail named after the Commodore.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.980
And in fact the Courtaulds themselves had
their own yacht and they were great travelers

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.640
and they even had their own map room where
they plotted their travels.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:05.260
So we're going to start of with about two
shots of Rye Whiskey. And then we're going

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:15.100
to add some lemon juice - about half a measure.
And about the same amount of sugar syrup - literally

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.250
it's just two thirds sugar to one third water,
you can make it yourself.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.940
And the final ingredient is orange bitters.
Now if you have heard of cocktail bitters

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.870
you've probably only heard of Angostura and
for a long time that's pretty much all you

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.710
could get. But back in the day there was a
whole range of different bitters and they

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.580
were very intense infusions of barks and spices
and in this case orange peel, fortunately

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.469
you can now get them all again. Orange bitters,
about two dashes.

00:04:47.469 --> 00:05:05.379
Give it a good shake.

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:10.270
A piece of orange peel.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.039
And there you have it. The Commodore cocktail.
Chin Chin!
