each of the 12 scales such as the key
signature<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:39.360> accidentals<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:40.650> they<00:00:41.129> have

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
signature the accidentals if they have

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.820

sharps<00:00:41.670> or<00:00:41.820> flats<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.420> we'll<00:00:43.170> take<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.379> look<00:00:43.650> at

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
sharps or flats and we'll take a look at

sharps or flats and we'll take a look at
what<00:00:44.100> each<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.580> the<00:00:44.670> scales<00:00:44.940> looks<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.510> on

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
what each of the scales looks like on

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.950 
what each of the scales looks like on
paper<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:47.460> without<00:00:47.699> further<00:00:48.090> rambling<00:00:48.690> let's

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
paper so without further rambling let's

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.650 
paper so without further rambling let's
get<00:00:49.140> started<00:00:52.880> we're<00:00:53.880> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.239> work<00:00:54.420> through

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
get started we're going to work through

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.080 
get started we're going to work through
each<00:00:54.930> major<00:00:55.410> scale<00:00:55.860> using<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.610> circle<00:00:56.910> of

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
each major scale using the circle of

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.790 
each major scale using the circle of
fourths

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
fourths

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.799 
fourths
we'll<00:00:58.800> start<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.190> C<00:00:59.489> major<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:03.480> C<00:01:03.629> major

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
we'll start with C major the C major

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.249 
we'll start with C major the C major
scale<00:01:04.050> has<00:01:04.440> no<00:01:04.619> sharps<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.280> no<00:01:05.700> flats<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:07.140> we

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
scale has no sharps and no flats so we

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.859 
scale has no sharps and no flats so we
leave<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> key<00:01:07.860> signature<00:01:08.280> blank<00:01:08.910> and<00:01:09.210> just

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
leave the key signature blank and just

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.920 
leave the key signature blank and just
play<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:10.410> the<00:01:10.500> root<00:01:10.680> note<00:01:10.890> C<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:12.149> the<00:01:12.509> next
