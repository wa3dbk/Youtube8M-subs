00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
wheel off and then this is the caliper

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.160 
wheel off and then this is the caliper
right<00:00:13.230> here<00:00:14.030> so<00:00:15.030> that's<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.540> that's<00:00:15.960> the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.429 
allow our caliper to come apart so you
take<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> caliper<00:01:48.030> apart<00:01:50.780> now<00:01:51.780> we'll<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.200> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
take the caliper apart now we'll have to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:00.969 
take the caliper apart now we'll have to
push<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:54.000> piston<00:01:54.509> inside<00:01:56.899> using<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.990> C<00:01:58.229> clamp

as<00:02:01.979> far<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.939> pads<00:02:03.329> itself<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.350> see

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
as far as the pads itself you see

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.359 
as far as the pads itself you see
they're<00:02:04.710> very<00:02:04.920> worn<00:02:05.250> out<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:07.649> can<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:07.920> push

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
they're very worn out you can just push

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.470 
they're very worn out you can just push
them<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.869> pull<00:02:10.080> them<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.489> they

just pull it out a little bit so it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:53.050 
just pull it out a little bit so it
loosens<00:02:29.750> it's<00:02:30.750> easier<00:02:50.750> take<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.900> out<00:02:52.050> now

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
loosens it's easier take it out now
