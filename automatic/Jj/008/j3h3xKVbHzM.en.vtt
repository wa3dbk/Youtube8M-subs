and then I'm going to go and do the hind

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.380 
and then I'm going to go and do the hind
wing<00:01:43.600> what<00:01:43.840> we<00:01:43.990> want<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:44.409> achieve<00:01:44.530> as<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.009> V

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
wing what we want to achieve as a V

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.389 
wing what we want to achieve as a V
slight<00:01:46.390> V<00:01:46.720> between<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.619> four<00:01:47.890> wing<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.310> the

slight V between the four wing and the
hind<00:01:48.640> wing<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.159> take<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.940> pin<00:01:52.240> out<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:54.000> I'm

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
hind wing so I take the pin out and I'm

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.529 
hind wing so I take the pin out and I'm
going<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.390> gently<00:01:55.899> move<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.280> hind<00:01:57.580> wing<00:01:57.910> up<00:01:58.179> to

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
going to gently move the hind wing up to

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:05.609 
going to gently move the hind wing up to
achieve<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.320> V<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.520> pin<00:02:03.520> it<00:02:03.670> down<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:05.350> to

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
achieve the V and pin it down I like to

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.749 
achieve the V and pin it down I like to
use<00:02:06.720> glass<00:02:07.720> strips<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.830> hold<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.220> wing<00:02:09.489> in

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
use glass strips to hold the wing in

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.340 
use glass strips to hold the wing in
place<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.940> then<00:02:13.090> we<00:02:13.300> continue<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.050> do<00:02:14.200> the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
place and then we continue and do the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.650 
place and then we continue and do the
other<00:02:14.380> side<00:02:15.010> we're<00:02:15.700> going<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:15.970> move<00:02:16.269> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
other side we're going to move the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.170 
other side we're going to move the
antenna<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.709> I'm<00:02:17.860> also<00:02:18.040> going<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.489> move<00:02:18.700> this

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
antenna and I'm also going to move this

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:30.979 
antenna and I'm also going to move this
antenna<00:02:24.690> gently<00:02:25.690> pushing<00:02:26.320> up<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:27.340> wing

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.289 

putting<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.110> pin<00:02:32.380> close<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:33.610> not<00:02:33.820> through

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
putting the pin close but not through

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:45.050 
putting the pin close but not through
the<00:02:34.329> wing<00:02:39.420> gently<00:02:40.420> pushing<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.650> hind<00:02:42.010> wing

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.289 

again<00:02:46.060> close<00:02:46.810> but<00:02:47.260> not<00:02:47.500> through<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.250> wing

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:58.370 

another<00:02:52.299> glass<00:02:52.690> strip<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:55.470> he<00:02:56.470> his<00:02:56.890> wings<00:02:57.220> are

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
another glass strip and he his wings are

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.449 
another glass strip and he his wings are
mounted<00:02:59.380> upside<00:02:59.650> down<00:03:00.160> now<00:03:01.030> his<00:03:02.459> antennas

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
mounted upside down now his antennas

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.720 
mounted upside down now his antennas
should<00:03:03.489> be<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.120> nice<00:03:04.450> v-shape<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:06.489> can

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
should be in a nice v-shape and you can

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.370 
should be in a nice v-shape and you can
achieve<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:07.600> by<00:03:07.980> making<00:03:09.900> X's<00:03:10.900> out<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.230> your

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
achieve this by making X's out of your

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.810 
achieve this by making X's out of your
pins<00:03:11.709> that's<00:03:12.040> cross<00:03:12.640> pinning<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:18.579> move

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
pins that's cross pinning and you move

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.060 
pins that's cross pinning and you move
your<00:03:19.090> antennas<00:03:19.750> how<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.019> want<00:03:20.440> them<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:20.890> when

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
you get them in the position that you

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.800 
you get them in the position that you
want<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:24.010> hold<00:03:24.310> them<00:03:24.549> down<00:03:24.820> but<00:03:25.329> cross

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
want you hold them down but cross
