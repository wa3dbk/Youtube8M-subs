greeting<00:00:11.610> everybody<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.509> poop<00:00:13.200> Stute

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
greeting everybody this is poop Stute

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.240 
greeting everybody this is poop Stute
and<00:00:14.420> today<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.870> are<00:00:16.049> going<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.830> learning

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
and today we are going to be learning

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.220 
and today we are going to be learning
how<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.640> make<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:20.029> single<00:00:21.029> pulse<00:00:21.240> double<00:00:22.080> pulse

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
how to make a single pulse double pulse

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.800 
how to make a single pulse double pulse
triple-pulse<00:00:23.100> quadruple<00:00:23.939> pulse<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.600> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
triple-pulse quadruple pulse and on and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.429 
triple-pulse quadruple pulse and on and
on<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:26.990> key<00:00:27.990> things<00:00:28.320> here

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
on and on and on and on key things here

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.410 
on and on and on and on key things here
is<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:29.519> have<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.730> make<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.300> regular<00:00:30.750> pulse

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
is we first have to make a regular pulse

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
is we first have to make a regular pulse
to<00:00:33.420> do<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:43.640> okay<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:46.039> this<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
to do that okay so this is going to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.970 
to do that okay so this is going to
there<00:00:49.430> and<00:00:51.379> there<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.469> go<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:55.590> signal<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
there and there we go so the signal is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.290 
there and there we go so the signal is
going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> come<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.699> turn<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.899> block<00:00:59.300> it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
going to come here turn on this block it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.319 
going to come here turn on this block it
will<00:01:00.570> coincidentally<00:01:01.260> turn<00:01:01.980> hit<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
will coincidentally turn hit this and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.350 
will coincidentally turn hit this and
activate<00:01:03.840> this

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.020 

it<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.510> set<00:01:07.720> to<00:01:07.750> two<00:01:08.229> ticks<00:01:08.560> it<00:01:08.860> will<00:01:09.190> have<00:01:09.700> I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
it is set to two ticks it will have I

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.200 
it is set to two ticks it will have I
think<00:01:10.240> one<00:01:10.960> tick<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.650> actually<00:01:12.430> being<00:01:12.640> on<00:01:12.790> one

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
think one tick of actually being on one

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.080 
think one tick of actually being on one
pulse<00:01:13.540> before<00:01:14.200> this<00:01:14.710> line<00:01:15.010> comes<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.670> turns

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
pulse before this line comes and turns

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.700 
pulse before this line comes and turns
it<00:01:16.300> back<00:01:16.450> off<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:23.140> we<00:01:23.470> have<00:01:23.680> a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
it back off like that so we have a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.999 
it back off like that so we have a
one-click<00:01:24.610> pulse<00:01:26.670> done<00:01:27.869> now<00:01:28.869> we<00:01:29.590> want<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:29.890> have

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
one-click pulse done now we want to have

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:43.880 
one-click pulse done now we want to have
two<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.660> and<00:01:41.200> like<00:01:41.759> this

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
two this and like that and like this

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.870 
two this and like that and like this
full<00:01:44.890> delay<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:50.770> at<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.039> full<00:01:51.250> delay<00:01:51.520> to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
full delay this is at the full delay to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.999 
full delay this is at the full delay to
give<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.149> them<00:01:52.330> if<00:01:53.259> you<00:01:53.350> have<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.560> any<00:01:53.680> less

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
give it them if you have it any less

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.130 
give it them if you have it any less
than<00:01:54.039> full<00:01:54.490> delay<00:01:54.789> it<00:01:55.420> won't<00:01:55.720> have<00:01:55.899> enough

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
than full delay it won't have enough

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.980 
than full delay it won't have enough
time<00:01:56.380> for<00:01:56.800> this<00:01:57.789> redstone<00:01:58.240> signal<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.869> be

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
time for this redstone signal to be

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.419 
time for this redstone signal to be
pulsed<00:01:59.680> off<00:02:00.539> okay<00:02:01.539> so<00:02:01.630> that's<00:02:01.869> double<00:02:02.940> triple

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
pulsed off okay so that's double triple

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.130 
pulsed off okay so that's double triple
just<00:02:06.429> extending<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.149> array<00:02:07.660> a<00:02:07.869> little

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
just extending this array a little

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:23.630 
just extending this array a little
further<00:02:16.230> again<00:02:17.340> fold<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.430> way<00:02:20.010> triple-pulse

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:37.880 

easy<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:25.440> for

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.400 

you<00:02:38.890> gotta<00:02:39.070> move<00:02:39.520> this<00:02:39.730> over<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:40.030> little<00:02:40.060> bit

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you gotta move this over a little bit

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:48.960 
you gotta move this over a little bit
don't<00:02:41.410> want<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:42.270> mix<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.420> streams<00:02:46.110> play<00:02:47.970> and

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
don't want to mix the streams play and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.750 
don't want to mix the streams play and
there<00:02:49.120> we<00:02:49.240> go<00:02:49.390> for<00:02:50.110> pulses<00:02:53.340> there<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.430> go

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
there we go for pulses there you go

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.260 
there we go for pulses there you go
now<00:02:55.570> this<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:55.930> completely<00:02:56.290> scalable<00:02:57.120> at<00:02:58.120> one

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
now this is completely scalable at one

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.380 
now this is completely scalable at one
point<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:59.020> signal<00:02:59.709> will<00:03:00.010> get<00:03:00.250> reduced<00:03:01.150> and

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
point this signal will get reduced and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.970 
point this signal will get reduced and
you'll<00:03:01.480> have<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.690> mess<00:03:01.840> with<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.170> timing<00:03:02.709> for

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
you'll have to mess with the timing for

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.979 
you'll have to mess with the timing for
the<00:03:03.070> repeaters<00:03:03.970> but<00:03:06.540> there<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.630> is

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
the repeaters but there it is

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.560 
the repeaters but there it is
four<00:03:08.620> tick<00:03:08.800> delay<00:03:09.000> for<00:03:10.000> every<00:03:10.239> one<00:03:10.390> of<00:03:10.420> these

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
four tick delay for every one of these

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.140 
four tick delay for every one of these
torches<00:03:10.930> there's<00:03:11.370> all<00:03:12.370> night<00:03:12.640> for<00:03:12.880> tick<00:03:13.060> delay

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
torches there's all night for tick delay

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.199 
torches there's all night for tick delay
it's<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.510> four<00:03:13.900> pulse<00:03:15.330> redstone<00:03:16.330> circuit<00:03:18.209> very

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
it's a four pulse redstone circuit very

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.980 
it's a four pulse redstone circuit very
easy<00:03:19.590> thanks<00:03:20.590> for<00:03:20.680> watching<00:03:20.890> guys
