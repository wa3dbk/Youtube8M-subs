00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.410 

Massimo<00:00:24.470> how<00:00:24.770> did<00:00:25.100> the<00:00:25.369> concept<00:00:26.180> of<00:00:26.300> his

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
Massimo how did the concept of his

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.279 
Massimo how did the concept of his
robots<00:00:26.810> come<00:00:27.110> about<00:00:27.490> so<00:00:28.490> we<00:00:28.750> sorry<00:00:29.750> the

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
robots come about so we sorry the

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.729 
robots come about so we sorry the
excitement<00:00:30.710> of<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:31.279> Maker<00:00:31.490> Faire<00:00:31.750> so<00:00:32.750> we

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
excitement of the Maker Faire so we

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.200 
excitement of the Maker Faire so we
always<00:00:33.890> wanted<00:00:34.340> to<00:00:34.460> have<00:00:34.520> an<00:00:34.670> indication<00:00:35.000> a

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
always wanted to have an indication a

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.530 
always wanted to have an indication a
robot<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:35.780> then<00:00:36.500> we<00:00:36.650> met<00:00:37.129> with<00:00:37.309> this<00:00:37.550> group<00:00:38.300> of

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
robot and then we met with this group of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.229 
robot and then we met with this group of
young<00:00:39.200> robot<00:00:39.559> makers<00:00:40.129> from<00:00:40.280> Spain<00:00:40.640> cop<00:00:41.059> the

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
young robot makers from Spain cop the

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.869 
young robot makers from Spain cop the
book<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.690> leader<00:00:42.650> and<00:00:43.070> I<00:00:43.460> thought<00:00:43.699> it

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
book and the leader and I thought it

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.750 
book and the leader and I thought it
would<00:00:44.000> be<00:00:44.090> good<00:00:44.239> to<00:00:44.300> inform<00:00:45.290> their<00:00:45.559> work<00:00:45.800> into

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
would be good to inform their work into

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.180 
would be good to inform their work into
in<00:00:47.210> educational<00:00:47.809> robots<00:00:48.199> for<00:00:48.379> old<00:00:48.590> kids<00:00:51.190> David

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
in educational robots for old kids David

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.770 
in educational robots for old kids David
you're<00:00:52.309> heavily<00:00:52.610> involved<00:00:53.089> in<00:00:53.449> the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
you're heavily involved in the

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.920 
you're heavily involved in the
development<00:00:54.290> of<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.860> Bible

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
development of the Bible

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.870 
development of the Bible
but<00:00:56.050> move<00:00:56.200> about<00:00:56.410> that<00:00:56.680> yeah<00:00:57.280> sure<00:00:57.490> I<00:00:57.670> mean

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
but move about that yeah sure I mean

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.090 
but move about that yeah sure I mean
thing<00:00:58.840> is<00:00:58.960> like<00:00:59.080> these<00:00:59.560> guys<00:00:59.740> that<00:00:59.920> they

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
thing is like these guys that they

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.830 
thing is like these guys that they
usually<00:01:00.580> go<00:01:00.760> into<00:01:00.940> this<00:01:01.030> competition<00:01:01.360> called

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
usually go into this competition called

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.220 
usually go into this competition called
the<00:01:02.280> robocup<00:01:03.280> but<00:01:04.059> it<00:01:04.360> takes<00:01:04.540> about<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.839> year<00:01:04.960> to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
the robocup but it takes about a year to

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.110 
the robocup but it takes about a year to
produce<00:01:05.560> robots<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.370> it's<00:01:06.490> very<00:01:06.790> expensive

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
produce robots and it's very expensive

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.690 
produce robots and it's very expensive
so<00:01:07.570> we<00:01:07.810> need<00:01:08.230> to<00:01:08.440> take<00:01:08.560> their<00:01:08.770> work<00:01:09.340> with<00:01:09.520> them

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
so we need to take their work with them

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.910 
so we need to take their work with them
in<00:01:09.729> getting<00:01:10.540> their<00:01:10.660> know-how<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.050> making<00:01:11.500> and

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
in getting their know-how and making and

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.710 
in getting their know-how and making and
easy<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.550> use<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:12.970> easy<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.240> start<00:01:13.479> with

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
easy to use and easy to start with

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.170 
easy to use and easy to start with
robots<00:01:14.140> you<00:01:14.770> know<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.040> concept<00:01:15.610> in<00:01:15.760> Arduino

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
robots you know the concept in Arduino

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.880 
robots you know the concept in Arduino
is<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.510> if<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.170> knowledge<00:01:17.619> is<00:01:17.740> like<00:01:17.860> a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
is that if the knowledge is like a

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.070 
is that if the knowledge is like a
staircase<00:01:18.250> like<00:01:18.640> this<00:01:18.850> like<00:01:19.090> you<00:01:19.750> first<00:01:19.930> need

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
staircase like this like you first need

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.200 
staircase like this like you first need
to<00:01:20.110> know<00:01:20.260> physics<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:20.920> math<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.520> electronics

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
to know physics and math and electronics

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.120 
to know physics and math and electronics
and<00:01:22.390> mechanics<00:01:22.780> we<00:01:23.260> try<00:01:23.410> to<00:01:23.470> do<00:01:23.619> is<00:01:23.680> do<00:01:23.800> we<00:01:24.100> put

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
and mechanics we try to do is do we put

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.920 
and mechanics we try to do is do we put
you<00:01:24.340> up<00:01:24.520> here<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.060> staircase<00:01:25.450> we<00:01:25.690> take<00:01:25.840> an

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
you up here the staircase we take an

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.350 
you up here the staircase we take an
elevator<00:01:26.140> so<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.710> say<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.100> then<00:01:27.610> we<00:01:28.119> sell

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
elevator so to say and then we sell

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.540 
elevator so to say and then we sell
people<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.780> go<00:01:28.990> into<00:01:29.770> deeper<00:01:30.130> levels<00:01:30.399> of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
people to go into deeper levels of

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.850 
people to go into deeper levels of
knowledge<00:01:30.700> by<00:01:31.600> experimenting<00:01:32.440> I'm<00:01:32.649> having

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
knowledge by experimenting I'm having

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.540 
knowledge by experimenting I'm having
fun<00:01:33.160> while<00:01:33.369> trying<00:01:34.050> so<00:01:35.050> we<00:01:35.259> face<00:01:35.530> us<00:01:35.860> may<00:01:36.220> five

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
fun while trying so we face us may five
