00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
force to the to the hold-down mechanism

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.420 
force to the to the hold-down mechanism
to<00:01:30.110> improve<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.830> thermal<00:01:31.790> transfer<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:34.280> have

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
to improve a thermal transfer you have

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.120 
to improve a thermal transfer you have
your<00:01:34.700> thermal<00:01:35.630> paste<00:01:35.870> which<00:01:36.140> is<00:01:36.260> some<00:01:36.410> cf3

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
your thermal paste which is some cf3

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.070 
your thermal paste which is some cf3
which<00:01:37.550> is<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.700> very<00:01:37.910> nice<00:01:38.090> thermal<00:01:38.510> paste<00:01:41.080> here

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
which is a very nice thermal paste here

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.450 
which is a very nice thermal paste here
we<00:01:42.290> have<00:01:42.560> our<00:01:43.750> base<00:01:44.750> place<00:01:45.310> front<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.369> back

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
we have our base place front and back

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.350 
we have our base place front and back
and<00:01:46.940> then<00:01:47.000> our<00:01:47.710> hold<00:01:48.710> down<00:01:48.950> screws<00:01:49.430> there<00:01:52.360> we

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
and then our hold down screws there we

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.230 
and then our hold down screws there we
got<00:01:53.509> some<00:01:53.720> anti<00:01:54.020> vibration<00:01:54.200> pads<00:01:54.950> if<00:01:55.580> you<00:01:55.790> plan

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
got some anti vibration pads if you plan

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.790 
got some anti vibration pads if you plan
to<00:01:56.270> actually<00:01:56.509> run<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.869> fan<00:01:57.140> on<00:01:57.320> here<00:01:57.500> which<00:01:57.650> is

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
to actually run a fan on here which is

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.450 
to actually run a fan on here which is
nice<00:01:58.040> because<00:01:58.340> they<00:01:58.670> included<00:01:59.180> not<00:01:59.899> only<00:02:00.460> 120

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
nice because they included not only 120

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.790 
nice because they included not only 120
millimeter<00:02:01.820> fan<00:02:02.149> mounts<00:02:02.600> but<00:02:03.410> one<00:02:03.560> hundred

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
millimeter fan mounts but one hundred

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.620 
millimeter fan mounts but one hundred
and<00:02:03.830> forty<00:02:04.220> millimeter<00:02:04.640> fan<00:02:04.940> mounts<00:02:05.300> as<00:02:05.420> well

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
and forty millimeter fan mounts as well

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.320 
and forty millimeter fan mounts as well
so<00:02:05.899> if<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.080> do<00:02:06.290> want<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.680> run<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:07.009> with<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.490> fan

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
so if you do want to run this with a fan

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.210 
so if you do want to run this with a fan
on<00:02:08.360> here<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:08.929> not<00:02:09.110> running<00:02:09.350> passive<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.100> do

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
on here and not running passive you do

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.220 
on here and not running passive you do
have<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.429> option<00:02:10.520> of<00:02:10.880> running<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.239> 120<00:02:11.750> or<00:02:11.870> 140

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
have the option of running a 120 or 140

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.380 
have the option of running a 120 or 140
millimeter<00:02:12.650> fan<00:02:12.890> very<00:02:13.670> nice<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.060> thermal

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390

cpu cooler even more and that is all in
accessories<00:02:33.380> let's<00:02:33.739> take<00:02:33.980> this<00:02:34.160> out<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
accessories let's take this out of the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.410 
accessories let's take this out of the
foam<00:02:35.120> here<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.720> guys<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:36.019> actually

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
foam here so you guys can actually

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:46.000 
foam here so you guys can actually
how<00:02:36.959> big<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:38.490> cpu<00:02:38.970> cooler<00:02:39.300> is<00:02:43.730> as<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.910> can<00:02:45.030> see

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
how big the cpu cooler is as you can see

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.130 
how big the cpu cooler is as you can see
there<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.190> right<00:02:47.250> there<00:02:47.660> very<00:02:48.660> very<00:02:48.840> large

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
there it is right there very very large

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.860 
there it is right there very very large
unit<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:50.340> has<00:02:50.520> six<00:02:50.849> heat<00:02:51.060> pipes<00:02:51.330> as<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.750> can

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
unit it has six heat pipes as you can

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.320 
unit it has six heat pipes as you can
see<00:02:52.050> they're<00:02:52.230> staggered<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:53.150> improve<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
see they're staggered to improve the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.270 
see they're staggered to improve the
cooling<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.959> air<00:02:55.110> flow<00:02:55.350> going<00:02:55.560> by<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.130> if

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
cooling and the air flow going by and if

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.910 
cooling and the air flow going by and if
you<00:02:56.400> notice<00:02:56.610> these<00:02:56.970> fins<00:02:57.330> are<00:02:57.540> very<00:02:57.920> they're

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
you notice these fins are very they're

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.790 
you notice these fins are very they're
spaced<00:02:59.310> apart<00:02:59.840> very<00:03:00.840> widely<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.680> is

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
spaced apart very widely and that is

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.520 
spaced apart very widely and that is
because<00:03:01.950> being<00:03:02.459> this<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> passive<00:03:03.269> cooler

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
because being this is a passive cooler

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.860 
because being this is a passive cooler
you<00:03:04.530> want<00:03:04.739> all<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:04.950> your<00:03:05.250> case<00:03:05.489> airflow<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.750> be

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
you want all of your case airflow to be

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.420 
you want all of your case airflow to be
able<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.140> come<00:03:07.319> through<00:03:07.349> this<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.130> actually

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
able to come through this and actually

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.340 
able to come through this and actually
remove<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.030> heat<00:03:09.209> without<00:03:09.360> causing<00:03:09.959> any<00:03:10.019> kind

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
remove the heat without causing any kind

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.979 
remove the heat without causing any kind
of<00:03:10.470> disruption<00:03:11.100> or<00:03:11.400> blockage<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.480> which<00:03:12.840> will

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
of disruption or blockage and which will

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.530 
of disruption or blockage and which will
cause<00:03:13.200> overheating<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:15.000> another<00:03:15.299> thing<00:03:15.480> to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
cause overheating and another thing to

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.870 
cause overheating and another thing to
note<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.860> if<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:16.950> see<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.370> way<00:03:17.519> this<00:03:17.700> is

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
note is if you see the way this is

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.900 
note is if you see the way this is
angled<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:19.739> actually<00:03:19.980> meant<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.670> sit<00:03:20.880> on

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
angled it is actually meant to sit on

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.259 
angled it is actually meant to sit on
your<00:03:21.090> cpu<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:22.100> actually<00:03:23.100> be<00:03:23.430> closer<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
your cpu and actually be closer to the

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.000 
your cpu and actually be closer to the
rear<00:03:24.480> exhaust<00:03:24.600> fan<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.319> actually<00:03:25.620> help<00:03:25.799> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
rear exhaust fan to actually help the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.390 
rear exhaust fan to actually help the
air<00:03:26.190> come<00:03:27.060> through<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.420> cooler<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:29.069> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
air come through the cooler and the the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.699 
air come through the cooler and the the
base<00:03:29.549> here<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:29.970> very<00:03:30.239> flat<00:03:30.630> it's<00:03:31.440> their

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
base here is very flat it's their

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.090 
base here is very flat it's their
typical<00:03:32.390> machined<00:03:33.560> nickel<00:03:34.560> plated<00:03:34.920> finish

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
typical machined nickel plated finish

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.680 
typical machined nickel plated finish
that<00:03:35.430> they<00:03:35.489> use<00:03:35.819> on<00:03:36.000> all<00:03:36.150> their<00:03:36.299> stuff<00:03:36.540> this

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
that they use on all their stuff this

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.080 
that they use on all their stuff this
whole<00:03:36.750> coolers<00:03:37.260> actually<00:03:37.620> nickel-plated

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
whole coolers actually nickel-plated

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.979 
whole coolers actually nickel-plated
looks<00:03:39.090> very<00:03:39.480> very<00:03:39.569> nice<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:41.510> yeah<00:03:42.510> guys<00:03:42.720> so

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
looks very very nice and yeah guys so

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.340 
looks very very nice and yeah guys so
that<00:03:43.170> is<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.820> HR<00:03:44.820> l2<00:03:45.150> from<00:03:45.420> thermal<00:03:45.870> right<00:03:46.079> I

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
that is the HR l2 from thermal right I

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.949 
that is the HR l2 from thermal right I
will<00:03:47.070> make<00:03:47.220> another<00:03:47.430> video<00:03:47.820> on<00:03:48.060> testing

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
will make another video on testing

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.259 
will make another video on testing
temperature<00:03:49.890> comparisons<00:03:50.549> between<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.970> stock

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
temperature comparisons between a stock

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.930 
temperature comparisons between a stock
cooler<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.470> cooler<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:53.160> then<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.790> will

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
cooler and this cooler and then I will

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.050 
cooler and this cooler and then I will
also<00:03:54.299> do<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.890> closer<00:03:55.890> look<00:03:56.250> video<00:03:56.519> where<00:03:56.940> I'll

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
also do a closer look video where I'll
