00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.039
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.829
 new kitchen here on tape.tv today too 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:15.619
 a top title more specifically future 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.300
 with yes after pandas have seemingly 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.490
 also the karnickel the headscarf for itself 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.860
 discovered as I see you can the 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.500
 Whole is a job in run with relative 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.450
 short level so if you are not too often 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.760
 then dies until 39 to 60 seconds 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.800
 actually through every level through and 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.940
 At the same time, the game is very pleasant 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.260
 to a super meat boy 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.940
 By that I mean everything here 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.890
 almost this jump when you hit the wall 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.480
 you can do that to him almost from the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.300
 squirmed repels again ran to the wall 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.699
 and just so high yes so high hops 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.289
 that's really very pleasant 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.109
 super meat boy the game is in control 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.019
 also similar precise with the gamepad 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.819
 So it makes you moody in any case 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.829
 which is also very cool that in the 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:57.829
 Courses are always hidden and 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.989
 collecting them is really demanding 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.609
 and really fun so many of you 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.899
 carrots are just placed that way 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.339
 first have to think about it okay 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.770
 how do I arrive at you without dying 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.750
 and that really is really pushing 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.100
 the carrots are used for items 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.630
 So you can buy about one 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.640
 buy carrots juice the one faster 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.450
 You can also check yourself 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.160
 buy points 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.290
 usually these levels have none 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.610
 jackpot are also relatively short but 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.020
 if you look at check points force then 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.210
 you can free and level yourself 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.530
 position checkpoints to which one 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.450
 then always returns when you are 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.120
 very practical very cool thing dies 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.500
 thing normally you can only opponents 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.040
 Defeat them when you look at them from behind 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.840
 on but with an upgrade you can 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.880
 Then defeat them by looking at them 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.150
 but I have to jump on it 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.290
 warn these upgrades actually because 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.060
 Here, for example, I actually found it 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.440
 quite demanding that you only have the opponents 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.480
 if you could defeat them from 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.520
 Running at the back so the game is easy 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.100
 much easier and that is unfortunately 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.510
 for many of the updates so if you have one 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.070
 real challenge in this 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.080
 want to have a game then buy yourself 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.060
 simply none of the upgrades they make 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.470
 that really only broke you and you 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.270
 are also permanent and you can 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.080
 they do not take it off so do it 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.570
 best a wide arc 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.060
 Overall, the game has 60 main levels 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.220
 is therefore not quite as extensive so 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.230
 a maximum of two hours is one thinks I 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.240
 but there are 20 more 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.650
 bonus level and they are special here 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.800
 Have fun because they just again 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.600
 a whole corner more demanding are so 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.040
 under the stroke one can say that this 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.630
 game definitely capricious makes it a 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.550
 entertaining fun in between 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.110
 Pretty nice, there is only one problem 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.110
 this game is actually one 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.650
 mobile game and ios devices costs 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.180
 the game 62 and on android system can 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.770
 you can even download it for free 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.959
 and there are five euros in the shop 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.459
 quite difficult to justify so 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.560
 I do not want to say it 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.750
 no added value offers so diverse 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.120
 version certainly has the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.140
 Best control with brains controls 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.500
 the game is just a lot 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.410
 more precise than just with touchscreen but 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.450
 to spend five euros if you have it 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.170
 just with an android system for free 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.170
 can get 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.970
 I'm not quite sure 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.980
 So as I said that the net for 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.959
 in between, it's fun if you 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.739
 new food in the eshop is this 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.260
 certainly not the worst 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.269
 but just if you change 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.489
 Android mobile you should have the 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.410
 buy twice think because as I said 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:29.880
 also android mobile phone one can itself 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:31.709
 the game around otherwise either way I hope 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.640
 I could give you a good impression of 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.019
 mediate play 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.940
 As always, I have two now 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.970
 to offer videos with which you directly 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.930
 can continue to look that would be for one 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:46.080
 left the last retro quickie to the 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.420
 pokÃ©mon trading card game by and with 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.269
 tim and on the other side the last one 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.790
 issue from can do talk to link to 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.870
 the past 2 in quotation marks because we 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.260
 do not know yet if it really like that 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.060
 called 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.070
 In any case, I wish you still 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.640
 a nice rest day until then yours 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.640
