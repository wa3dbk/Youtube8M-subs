better<00:02:19.560> than<00:02:19.770> upstart<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.459> tech<00:02:20.720> triple

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
better than upstart in this tech triple

better than upstart in this tech triple
space<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.790> think<00:02:23.790> that's<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.030> standard<00:02:24.390> at

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
space I think that's just standard at

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.210 
space I think that's just standard at
this<00:02:24.750> point<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.200> think<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.709> will<00:02:25.800> continue<00:02:25.890> to

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
this point I think it will continue to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.640 
this point I think it will continue to
be<00:02:26.280> standard<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.760> tell<00:02:26.880> space<00:02:27.120> gets<00:02:27.330> hit

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
be standard and tell space gets hit

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.190 
be standard and tell space gets hit
