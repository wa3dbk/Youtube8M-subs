00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.469 
I thought oh that's kind of nice I
didn't<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> add<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> little<00:01:32.820> cave<00:01:33.150> because

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
didn't have to add a little cave because

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.510 
didn't have to add a little cave because
they<00:01:34.229> gotta<00:01:34.409> go<00:01:34.530> somewhere<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.979> sleep

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
but I loved the design actually it's so

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.800 
but I loved the design actually it's so
simple<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.360> thought<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.630> was<00:01:39.750> very

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
simple and I just thought it was very

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.679 
simple and I just thought it was very
very<00:01:40.380> nice<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.920> great<00:01:41.100> job<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.700> as

still a lot of exhibits that need to be
done<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.079> think<00:01:58.259> what's<00:01:58.770> gonna<00:01:58.890> end<00:01:59.100> up

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
done and I think what's gonna end up

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.120 
done and I think what's gonna end up
happening<00:01:59.250> is<00:02:00.000> oh<00:02:00.540> here's<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.469> lion<00:02:01.649> exhibit<00:02:01.799> by

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
happening is oh here's a lion exhibit by

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.429 
happening is oh here's a lion exhibit by
the<00:02:02.189> way<00:02:02.460> um<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.479> had<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.719> make<00:02:03.840> some<00:02:03.990> changes<00:02:04.320> on

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the way um I had to make some changes on

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.499 
the way um I had to make some changes on
it<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.770> wanted<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.000> little<00:02:06.210> cave

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
it I I wanted to have like a little cave

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.080 
it I I wanted to have like a little cave
pearl<00:02:06.899> thing<00:02:07.380> um<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.129> love<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.610> light

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
pearl thing um but I love the light

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.479 
pearl thing um but I love the light
design<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.349> was<00:02:10.860> included<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
design here that was included in the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.979 
design here that was included in the
original<00:02:11.610> design<00:02:12.060> thought<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.569> was<00:02:12.720> pretty

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
original design thought that was pretty

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.110 
original design thought that was pretty
nice<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:14.340> think<00:02:14.520> it'll<00:02:14.670> make<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.819> pretty

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
nice and I think it'll make it pretty

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.270 
nice and I think it'll make it pretty
nice<00:02:15.300> at<00:02:15.450> night<00:02:15.480> although<00:02:16.200> I'm<00:02:16.349> hoping<00:02:17.010> that

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
nice at night although I'm hoping that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.880 
nice at night although I'm hoping that
people<00:02:18.270> won't<00:02:18.480> play<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:18.930> at<00:02:19.170> night<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:19.860> I

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
people won't play this at night but I

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.710 
people won't play this at night but I
should<00:02:20.069> probably<00:02:20.129> think<00:02:20.459> about<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.940> because

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
should probably think about that because

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.760 
should probably think about that because
it<00:02:21.870> could<00:02:21.989> be<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.110> dark<00:02:22.349> place<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:22.950> um<00:02:24.650> what<00:02:25.650> I'm

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
it could be a dark place but um what I'm

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.770 
it could be a dark place but um what I'm
thinking<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.459> if<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.209> exhibits<00:02:27.569> aren't

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
thinking is if the exhibits aren't

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.660 
thinking is if the exhibits aren't
coming<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.170> I'm<00:02:28.860> probably<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.310> gonna<00:02:29.550> end<00:02:29.610> up

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
coming in I'm probably just gonna end up

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.390 
coming in I'm probably just gonna end up
doing<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.060> myself<00:02:30.980> because<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.010> do<00:02:32.099> want<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.310> get

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
doing it myself because I do want to get

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.180 
doing it myself because I do want to get
the<00:02:32.519> map<00:02:32.700> out<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.239> finished<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.840> complete<00:02:34.349> so

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the map out and finished and complete so

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.820 
the map out and finished and complete so
we<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.489> move<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.760> with<00:02:35.970> our<00:02:36.030> lives<00:02:36.530> again<00:02:37.530> this

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
we can move on with our lives again this

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.710 
we can move on with our lives again this
is<00:02:37.980> where<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.160> little<00:02:38.670> snack<00:02:38.940> shops<00:02:39.209> gonna<00:02:39.450> be

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
is where the little snack shops gonna be

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.210 
is where the little snack shops gonna be
um<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.860> might<00:02:41.129> just<00:02:41.160> be<00:02:42.920> either<00:02:43.920> more

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
um this might just be either more

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.009 
um this might just be either more
recreational<00:02:44.519> area<00:02:45.300> like<00:02:45.450> tables<00:02:45.840> or

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
recreational area like tables or

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.949 
recreational area like tables or
something<00:02:46.200> like<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.349> um<00:02:46.940> or<00:02:47.940> something<00:02:48.629> else

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
something like that um or something else

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.350 
something like that um or something else
I<00:02:49.170> think<00:02:49.379> what<00:02:50.010> I'm<00:02:50.099> gonna<00:02:50.190> add<00:02:50.400> over<00:02:50.730> here<00:02:51.180> I

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
I think what I'm gonna add over here I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.290 
I think what I'm gonna add over here I
have<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.989> move<00:02:52.920> around<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.220> zoo<00:02:53.550> sign<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.269> I

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
have to move around the zoo sign but I

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.210 
have to move around the zoo sign but I
really<00:02:54.569> liked<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.110> want<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.349> keep<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.709> but

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
really liked it so I want to keep it but

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.680 
really liked it so I want to keep it but
I<00:02:56.250> think<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.519> entire<00:02:56.670> area<00:02:57.120> might<00:02:57.390> just<00:02:57.569> be

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
I think this entire area might just be

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.210 
I think this entire area might just be
like<00:02:57.840> parking<00:02:58.260> lot<00:02:58.470> or<00:02:58.620> something<00:02:58.860> like<00:02:59.010> that

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
like parking lot or something like that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.890 
like parking lot or something like that
and<00:02:59.459> as<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.940> mentioned<00:03:00.330> it's<00:03:00.480> gonna<00:03:00.599> be

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
and as I mentioned it's gonna be

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.440 
and as I mentioned it's gonna be
surrounded<00:03:01.709> by<00:03:01.860> buildings<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:02.849> we<00:03:02.879> can<00:03:03.120> be<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
surrounded by buildings so we can be the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.490 
surrounded by buildings so we can be the
the<00:03:04.050> zoo<00:03:04.379> in<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.069> city<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.700> anyway<00:03:06.090> guys<00:03:06.500> so
