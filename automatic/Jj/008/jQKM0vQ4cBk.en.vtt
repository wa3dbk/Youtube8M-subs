00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.890 
kind of isolates this part of the
business<00:05:37.460> that<00:05:37.670> people<00:05:38.120> don't<00:05:38.240> really<00:05:38.630> see

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
business that people don't really see

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.840 
business that people don't really see
and<00:05:39.560> I<00:05:39.860> think<00:05:40.160> it's<00:05:40.280> going<00:05:40.400> to<00:05:40.490> be<00:05:40.550> exciting

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
and I think it's going to be exciting

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.640 
and I think it's going to be exciting
for<00:05:41.030> America<00:05:41.540> to<00:05:41.660> watch<00:05:41.870> and<00:05:42.140> then<00:05:42.230> having<00:05:42.560> the

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
for America to watch and then having the

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.120 
for America to watch and then having the
added<00:05:43.150> bonus<00:05:44.150> of<00:05:44.450> being<00:05:44.510> able<00:05:44.750> to<00:05:44.900> buy

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
added bonus of being able to buy

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.470 
added bonus of being able to buy
immediately<00:05:46.130> the<00:05:46.610> products<00:05:46.970> that<00:05:47.060> you<00:05:47.240> like

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
immediately the products that you like

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.560 
immediately the products that you like
and<00:05:48.340> so<00:05:49.340> that's<00:05:49.580> very<00:05:49.700> interactive<00:05:50.150> to<00:05:50.510> the

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
and so that's very interactive to the

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.690 
and so that's very interactive to the
public<00:05:51.020> and<00:05:51.200> it's<00:05:51.590> not<00:05:51.860> kind<00:05:52.100> of<00:05:52.220> fantasy

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
public and it's not kind of fantasy

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.790 
public and it's not kind of fantasy
world<00:05:52.940> it's<00:05:53.090> very<00:05:53.300> real<00:05:53.600> and<00:05:54.170> I<00:05:54.500> think<00:05:54.710> this

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
world it's very real and I think this

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.130 
world it's very real and I think this
program<00:05:55.250> is<00:05:55.430> going<00:05:55.640> to<00:05:55.700> be<00:05:55.820> quite<00:05:56.600> educational

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
program is going to be quite educational

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.670 
program is going to be quite educational
but<00:05:57.650> also<00:05:57.800> inspiring<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:58.910> and<00:05:59.480> very<00:06:00.140> tangible

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
but also inspiring and and very tangible

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.910 
but also inspiring and and very tangible
for<00:06:01.040> the<00:06:01.280> amount<00:06:01.460> public's
