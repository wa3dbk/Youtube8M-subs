00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.110
 Hello dear friends today decided 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.750
 shoot a small video that will 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.020
 dedicated to people who are engaged 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.579
 vikings i.e. electronic hovering 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.380
 many of you have probably tried all sorts 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:30.090
 unpretentious electronic cigarettes which 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.369
 sold for 150 200 rubles any 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.440
 grocery stores and other stalls 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.020
 but this video will tell you about more 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.710
 serious fashion which is called 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.239
 and istick 50 watts and component in it 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.070
 mega spire tank with aspire accelerators 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.839
 second generation I'll tell you now 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.179
 about each of these components separately 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.960
 50 watt aystik mod got to me 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:00.420
 Price 4000 in its own way 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.420
 price-quality I think this is the best mod 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.920
 which can in principle be found in Moscow 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.700
 What are its main advantages? 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.140
 yes the fact is that this mod is designed for 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.720
 varivolt then there is a high voltage it 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.770
 allows you to accelerate any evaporators then 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.910
 there is no matter what they will 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.500
 resistance 0 3 ohm 05 or he alone 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.150
 will be able to open the evaporator in all its glory 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.870
 also note it can be a separate charge 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.180
 these are four thousand 400 milliamps that 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.210
 principle enough with moderate soaring 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.250
 for 2-3 days or for those who love 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.060
 soar without stopping you enough it 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.620
 exactly one full day 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 let's see what we have 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.930
 is an aspire evaporator 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.570
 mega and here it is we have so much here 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.550
 different holes to adjust the flow 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.800
 air that is from such a huge 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.330
 which you just saw up to 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.780
 little now I'll show you here 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.170
 something like this if you see us 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.020
 it gives it a matter of habits of everyone then 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.750
 if you are used to smoking cigarettes 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.840
 probably it will be easier for you 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.409
 chicken with a small air supply if 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.300
 do you like hookahs and you like 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.900
 getting the maximum time for two three 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.939
 seconds is a choice for 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.879
 I prefer you big air supply 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.829
 Also in this fashion there are special 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.439
 steam cooling holes which 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:32.260
 are here i prefer to keep them 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.640
 closed because it's just air 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.530
 which will cool your vapors 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.239
 respectively 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.109
 steam ratio will be less by 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.379
 concentration 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:44.489
 well let's move on from words to deeds 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:48.099
 I'll show you this mod in all its glory 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.730
 I have 50 watts now you can 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.530
 see and almost full charge 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.739
 resistance of us 0 3 ohms let's 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.739
 we'll see 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.200
 but me 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.490
 in fact, two or three seconds is enough to 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.240
 completely fill easy couples and me 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.070
 sit all taste full of his beauty like 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.810
 times evaporators from espia differ 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.360
 very good taste transfer and 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.000
 overclocking capability up to 80 watts 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.050
 maybe you don't even need more so 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.440
 this mod is enough for more than that 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.880
 the vaporizer you respectively 50 watts this 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.970
 also a very big number and more 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.230
 use the novel want in principle 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.170
 you can try to breathe at all 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.880
 completely into all lungs and let's 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.880
 let's see how many couples will be 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.980
 house 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.910
 as you could notice the pair is obtained 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.300
 well just a lot so if you 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.130
 love a lot of steam a lot of taste great 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.580
 battery duration 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.760
 if you soar often intensely then i would 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.190
 advised you such a bunch of this mod and 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.700
 this vaporizer for the price of us goes 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.100
 herself from 4000 plus to him the tank is three with 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.170
 half somewhere in Moscow and in the end 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.280
 It turns out for seven and a half 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.890
 full professional set 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.440
 that is something that you will like what 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.180
 you don't want to change it because 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.170
 more than cover the need of any 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.880
 phallic how i believe and can you 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.680
 advise only his case no one 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.770
 buy something there unpretentious 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.080
 fashion there for a thousand and a half for 2 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.350
 This is complete bullshit which is calculated there 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.940
 maximum watts per 10 and it is by no means 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.570
 case will not be able to fully convey 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.190
 tastes give out a lot of steam so 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.790
 which is just a lot of people who 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.830
 used such unpretentious fashions either 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.330
 just some such holidays 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.270
 electronic cigarettes and I think that 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.310
 electronic couples are n't some kind of bullshit and 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.260
 bullshit but I hasten to disappoint you 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.120
 because this is a great thing 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.870
 which allows 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.940
 just feel every zest 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:38.100
 any tastes by the way about the liquid 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.650
 I want to recommend you a few too 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.170
 good ones that i like if you 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.840
 like a light unobtrusive taste then I 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.120
 I would advise you clanwar art this 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.100
 I taste watermelon that is, it is very 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.750
 unpretentious such air very gentle 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.930
 can say 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.010
 if you like the taste more with it 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.030
 you don't want to sacrifice 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:05.580
 the amount of steam I want you 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.570
 recommend taste infinite space 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.030
 such a bubble 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.920
 little principle he has a very taste 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.120
 very good and very concentrated 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.620
 and if you like more taste more 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.290
 feel it in myself then I tell you 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.330
 recommend it 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:26.390
 I personally prefer the most 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.610
 liquid from star base here such here 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.890
 why I love her because she is made 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.950
 based on glycerin for the most part and 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.419
 you just get a maximum of steam from her 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.180
 which you can get 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:42.450
 if you don't fill the tank with clean 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.360
 glycerin and also she is very very very 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.280
 tastes delicious 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.800
 saturated among all the liquids that i 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.140
 I tried it and I like it most 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.580
 I also advise you to try it now 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.960
 costs from 250 rubles in Moscow 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.450
 the blue mist tastes like you should 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.160
 gladden how please me when 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.700
 The first time I tried it for me 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.020
 the best choice so guys if 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.070
 you will have some questions about 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.860
 hovering 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.720
 about the liquid taste of the tanks you 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.300
 can not write comments itself 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.680
 It is interesting for you to help answer this all 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.260
