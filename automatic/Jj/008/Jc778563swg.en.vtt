gallbladder symptoms but she had a
gallbladder<00:01:42.130> removed<00:01:42.550> so<00:01:43.390> it's<00:01:43.540> still<00:01:43.930> a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
gallbladder removed so it's still a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.170 
gallbladder removed so it's still a
deficiency<00:01:44.620> of<00:01:44.800> bio<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:45.460> we<00:01:45.580> know<00:01:45.760> we<00:01:45.970> have<00:01:46.000> a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
deficiency of bio so we know we have a

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.740 
deficiency of bio so we know we have a
deficiency<00:01:46.630> of<00:01:46.900> bile<00:01:47.700> okay<00:01:48.700> but<00:01:49.330> typically

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
deficiency of bile okay but typically

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.440 
deficiency of bile okay but typically
that<00:01:50.250> problem<00:01:51.250> is<00:01:51.340> going<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.520> cause<00:01:51.729> pain<00:01:52.150> on

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
that problem is going to cause pain on

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.560 
that problem is going to cause pain on
the<00:01:52.720> right<00:01:53.290> side<00:01:54.250> of<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.640> shoulder<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.300> neck

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
the right side of the shoulder and neck

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.070 
the right side of the shoulder and neck
not<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.440> left<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.270> she<00:01:58.330> has<00:01:58.570> left<00:01:58.840> sided

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
not the left so she has left sided

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.630 
not the left so she has left sided
shoulder<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.680> come<00:01:59.830> wraps<00:02:00.130> right<00:02:00.310> around<00:02:00.370> the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
shoulder and come wraps right around the

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.670 
shoulder and come wraps right around the
back<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:03.330> would<00:02:04.330> mean<00:02:04.600> that's<00:02:05.049> pancreas

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
back and that would mean that's pancreas

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.999 
back and that would mean that's pancreas
so<00:02:06.370> that's<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.700> pancreatic<00:02:07.299> problem<00:02:08.049> so<00:02:08.830> let's

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
so that's a pancreatic problem so let's

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.530 
so that's a pancreatic problem so let's
write<00:02:09.190> this<00:02:09.220> down

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.830 

pancreatic<00:02:13.540> insufficiency<00:02:17.640> that's<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.939> kind

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
pancreatic insufficiency that's the kind

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.410 
pancreatic insufficiency that's the kind
of<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:21.340> would<00:02:21.489> create<00:02:21.760> these<00:02:22.060> symptoms

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
of that would create these symptoms

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.559 
of that would create these symptoms
because<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.989> pancreas<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.670> swells<00:02:25.060> up<00:02:25.329> or

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
because the pancreas if it swells up or

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.149 
because the pancreas if it swells up or
if<00:02:25.659> it<00:02:25.750> works<00:02:25.930> too<00:02:26.140> hard<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.739> will<00:02:26.890> irritate

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
if it works too hard it will irritate

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.000 
if it works too hard it will irritate
the<00:02:27.819> tissue<00:02:28.120> right<00:02:29.019> around<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.530> pancreas

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
the tissue right around the pancreas

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.339 
the tissue right around the pancreas
which<00:02:30.609> there's<00:02:30.909> a<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.629> little<00:02:31.930> nerve<00:02:32.049> called

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
which there's a is a little nerve called

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.780 
which there's a is a little nerve called
the<00:02:32.439> phrenic<00:02:32.739> nerve<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.250> on<00:02:33.340> both<00:02:33.489> sides

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the phrenic nerve it's on both sides

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.190 
the phrenic nerve it's on both sides
then<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.060> left<00:02:34.299> side<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.540> goes<00:02:34.659> right<00:02:34.959> up<00:02:35.079> to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
then the left side it goes right up to

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.330 
then the left side it goes right up to
your<00:02:35.319> right<00:02:35.530> shoulder<00:02:35.560> right<00:02:35.980> up<00:02:36.189> through

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
your right shoulder right up through

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.849 
your right shoulder right up through
here<00:02:36.519> so<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.689> pancreas<00:02:37.989> now<00:02:38.439> let's<00:02:38.650> take<00:02:38.829> a

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
here so the pancreas now let's take a

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.220 
here so the pancreas now let's take a
look<00:02:39.159> at<00:02:39.689> pancreatic<00:02:40.689> insufficiency<00:02:40.900> what

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
look at pancreatic insufficiency what

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.420 
look at pancreatic insufficiency what
does<00:02:41.319> that<00:02:41.349> mean<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.739> pancreas<00:02:42.159> makes

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
does that mean the pancreas makes

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.449 
does that mean the pancreas makes
enzymes<00:02:42.819> so<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:44.079> also<00:02:44.230> regulates<00:02:44.980> insulin<00:02:45.310> but

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
enzymes so it also regulates insulin but

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.729 
enzymes so it also regulates insulin but
if<00:02:45.609> it's<00:02:45.790> not<00:02:45.970> making<00:02:46.239> all<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.659> enzymes<00:02:47.049> which

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
if it's not making all the enzymes which

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.640 
if it's not making all the enzymes which
makes<00:02:48.069> sense<00:02:48.430> because<00:02:49.230> if<00:02:50.230> she<00:02:50.500> has<00:02:50.620> a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
makes sense because if she has a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.830 
makes sense because if she has a
gallbladder<00:02:50.950> problem<00:02:51.639> she's<00:02:52.389> not<00:02:52.569> going<00:02:52.780> to

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
gallbladder problem she's not going to

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.720 
gallbladder problem she's not going to
actually<00:02:53.019> have<00:02:53.439> a<00:02:53.739> really<00:02:54.220> really<00:02:54.430> healthy

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
actually have a really really healthy

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.759 
actually have a really really healthy
pancreas<00:02:54.909> they<00:02:55.269> both<00:02:55.540> work<00:02:55.780> together<00:02:56.019> in<00:02:56.530> the

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
pancreas they both work together in the

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.369 
pancreas they both work together in the
digestive<00:02:57.310> tract<00:02:57.549> so<00:02:57.790> whatever<00:02:58.599> she<00:02:58.900> ate<00:02:59.139> in

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
digestive tract so whatever she ate in

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.990 
digestive tract so whatever she ate in
the<00:02:59.409> past<00:02:59.560> that<00:03:00.040> destroyed<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.549> gallbladder

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
the past that destroyed that gallbladder

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.839 
the past that destroyed that gallbladder
is<00:03:01.540> probably<00:03:01.989> also<00:03:02.200> made<00:03:02.919> the<00:03:03.069> pancreas<00:03:03.579> weak

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
is probably also made the pancreas weak

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.319 
is probably also made the pancreas weak
as<00:03:04.120> well<00:03:04.359> and<00:03:04.629> depleted<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.310> enzymes<00:03:06.310> but<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
as well and depleted the enzymes but the

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.360 
as well and depleted the enzymes but the
symptoms<00:03:07.900> for<00:03:08.079> pancreatic<00:03:08.379> insufficiency

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
symptoms for pancreatic insufficiency

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.470 
symptoms for pancreatic insufficiency
are<00:03:09.939> very<00:03:10.269> similar<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:11.620> low<00:03:11.889> bile<00:03:12.480> very

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
are very similar to low bile very

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.390 
are very similar to low bile very
similar<00:03:14.049> so<00:03:15.449> right<00:03:16.449> here<00:03:16.799> nausea<00:03:17.799> that<00:03:18.010> could

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
similar so right here nausea that could

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.839 
similar so right here nausea that could
be<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.729> pancreas<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.510> flute<00:03:20.379> the<00:03:20.889> stool<00:03:21.669> that

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
be the pancreas the flute the stool that

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.520 
be the pancreas the flute the stool that
floats<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.419> could<00:03:22.599> be<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.750> pancreatic

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
floats that could be a pancreatic

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.080 
floats that could be a pancreatic
insufficiency<00:03:23.889> because<00:03:24.519> you're<00:03:24.639> not<00:03:24.760> able<00:03:24.909> to

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
insufficiency because you're not able to

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.119 
insufficiency because you're not able to
release<00:03:25.930> enough<00:03:26.319> lipase<00:03:26.919> that's<00:03:27.209> fat<00:03:28.209> enzymes

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
release enough lipase that's fat enzymes

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.920 
release enough lipase that's fat enzymes
so<00:03:30.129> when<00:03:30.729> bile<00:03:30.970> comes<00:03:31.269> in<00:03:31.419> there<00:03:31.569> breaks<00:03:31.750> down

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
so when bile comes in there breaks down

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.719 
so when bile comes in there breaks down
the<00:03:32.049> fat<00:03:32.290> lipase<00:03:33.159> from<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.489> pancreas

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:33.729 
the fat lipase from the pancreas

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.420 
the fat lipase from the pancreas
dissolves<00:03:34.479> that<00:03:34.959> fat<00:03:35.290> even<00:03:35.590> further<00:03:35.799> down<00:03:36.129> to

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
dissolves that fat even further down to

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.649 
dissolves that fat even further down to
a<00:03:37.440> stage<00:03:38.440> where<00:03:38.680> you<00:03:38.709> can<00:03:38.949> digest<00:03:39.159> it<00:03:39.489> so<00:03:40.180> this

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
a stage where you can digest it so this

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.869 
a stage where you can digest it so this
could<00:03:40.900> easily<00:03:41.079> be<00:03:41.319> pancreatic<00:03:42.040> insufficiency

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
could easily be pancreatic insufficiency

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.300 
could easily be pancreatic insufficiency
right<00:03:43.540> here<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.409> so<00:03:44.620> could<00:03:44.769> not

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
right here and so could not

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.409 
right here and so could not
so<00:03:46.060> could<00:03:46.269> pain<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.629> the<00:03:46.720> left<00:03:46.900> side<00:03:47.109> and

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
so could pain on the left side and

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.610 
so could pain on the left side and
irritable<00:03:49.419> bowel<00:03:49.720> because<00:03:50.379> you're<00:03:50.530> gonna

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
irritable bowel because you're gonna

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.649 
irritable bowel because you're gonna
have<00:03:50.769> a<00:03:50.829> lot<00:03:50.949> of<00:03:50.979> inflammatory<00:03:51.400> issues<00:03:51.940> as

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
have a lot of inflammatory issues as

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.199 
have a lot of inflammatory issues as
well<00:03:52.930> if<00:03:53.169> you<00:03:53.260> don't<00:03:53.440> have<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.769> enzymes<00:03:55.709> so

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
well if you don't have the enzymes so

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.759 
well if you don't have the enzymes so
that's<00:03:58.209> one<00:03:58.510> thing<00:03:58.720> now<00:03:58.989> let's<00:03:59.260> just<00:03:59.439> take<00:03:59.739> a

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
that's one thing now let's just take a

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.679 
that's one thing now let's just take a
look<00:04:00.069> at<00:04:01.109> let's<00:04:02.109> see<00:04:02.319> here<00:04:02.919> rash<00:04:03.579> that<00:04:04.479> could

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
look at let's see here rash that could

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.920 
look at let's see here rash that could
be<00:04:04.780> another<00:04:04.989> symptom<00:04:06.299> can't<00:04:07.299> tolerate<00:04:07.479> some

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
be another symptom can't tolerate some

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.610 
be another symptom can't tolerate some
well<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:09.159> is<00:04:09.549> really<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:11.799> low<00:04:12.599> vitamin<00:04:13.620> K

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
well this is really a low vitamin K

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.129 
well this is really a low vitamin K
deficiency<00:04:14.650> because<00:04:15.570> CSUN<00:04:16.570> gives<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.930> a<00:04:16.959> lot

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
deficiency because CSUN gives you a lot

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.170 
deficiency because CSUN gives you a lot
of<00:04:17.259> vitamin<00:04:17.530> D<00:04:17.680> but<00:04:18.609> if<00:04:18.699> you<00:04:18.789> don't<00:04:19.000> have

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
of vitamin D but if you don't have

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.170 
of vitamin D but if you don't have
vitamin<00:04:19.570> K<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:20.709> can<00:04:20.919> create<00:04:21.159> a<00:04:21.370> symptom<00:04:22.029> of

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
vitamin K that can create a symptom of

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.770 
vitamin K that can create a symptom of
vitamin<00:04:22.690> D<00:04:22.840> toxicity<00:04:23.469> okay<00:04:24.430> which<00:04:24.669> is<00:04:24.849> like

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
vitamin D toxicity okay which is like

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.650 
vitamin D toxicity okay which is like
like<00:04:25.960> it's<00:04:26.170> like<00:04:26.380> Sun<00:04:26.920> is<00:04:27.160> toxic<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.670> you<00:04:27.880> but

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
like it's like Sun is toxic to you but

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.320 
like it's like Sun is toxic to you but
because<00:04:28.990> she<00:04:29.470> doesn't<00:04:29.650> have<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.860> gallbladder

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
because she doesn't have a gallbladder

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.600 
because she doesn't have a gallbladder
we<00:04:31.330> know<00:04:31.630> that<00:04:32.320> she<00:04:32.530> doesn't<00:04:32.710> have<00:04:32.860> enough<00:04:33.490> of

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
we know that she doesn't have enough of

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.210 
we know that she doesn't have enough of
the<00:04:33.730> bile<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.780> absorb<00:04:35.440> some<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:35.860> these<00:04:35.950> fats

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
the bile to absorb some of these fats

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.440 
the bile to absorb some of these fats
and<00:04:36.430> vitamins<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:38.080> she's<00:04:38.530> getting<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:40.330> know

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
and vitamins so she's getting you know

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.900 
and vitamins so she's getting you know
she<00:04:40.510> might<00:04:40.840> just<00:04:41.169> basically<00:04:41.530> get<00:04:41.889> all<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.639> Sun

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
she might just basically get all the Sun

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.700 
she might just basically get all the Sun
on<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.060> skin<00:04:43.480> and<00:04:43.720> go<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.139> but<00:04:44.440> she's<00:04:44.590> not

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
on the skin and go in but she's not

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.900 
on the skin and go in but she's not
getting<00:04:44.860> all<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.190> other<00:04:45.340> vitamins<00:04:45.790> to

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
getting all the other vitamins to

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.750 
getting all the other vitamins to
balance<00:04:46.270> it<00:04:46.389> out<00:04:46.540> so<00:04:47.200> this<00:04:47.620> can<00:04:48.280> relate<00:04:48.550> to

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
balance it out so this can relate to

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.290 
balance it out so this can relate to
this<00:04:49.660> vile<00:04:50.110> thing<00:04:50.440> right<00:04:50.590> here<00:04:50.860> dry<00:04:51.790> skin<00:04:52.120> well

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
this vile thing right here dry skin well

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.730 
this vile thing right here dry skin well
that<00:04:52.450> just<00:04:52.690> indicates<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.380> she's<00:04:53.590> not

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
that just indicates that she's not

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.830 
that just indicates that she's not
absorbing<00:04:54.280> some<00:04:54.820> of<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.970> oils<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:55.600> fats

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
absorbing some of the oils and the fats

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.840 
absorbing some of the oils and the fats
in<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.560> skin<00:04:56.889> because<00:04:57.310> she<00:04:57.400> doesn't<00:04:57.639> have<00:04:57.730> the

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
in the skin because she doesn't have the

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.760 
in the skin because she doesn't have the
bile<00:04:59.610> so<00:05:00.610> that's<00:05:00.820> interesting<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.720> then<00:05:02.590> we

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
bile so that's interesting and then we

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.820 
bile so that's interesting and then we
write<00:05:02.890> here<00:05:03.630> Hashimoto's<00:05:04.660> let's<00:05:05.620> try<00:05:05.770> to

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
write here Hashimoto's let's try to

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.280 
write here Hashimoto's let's try to
figure<00:05:06.070> that<00:05:06.400> out

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
figure that out

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.570 
figure that out
Hashimoto's<00:05:08.290> is<00:05:08.470> an<00:05:08.590> autoimmune<00:05:09.010> and

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
Hashimoto's is an autoimmune and

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.010 
Hashimoto's is an autoimmune and
autoimmune<00:05:10.270> there<00:05:10.690> is<00:05:10.780> some<00:05:10.990> data<00:05:11.230> on<00:05:13.020> enzyme

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
autoimmune there is some data on enzyme

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.440 
autoimmune there is some data on enzyme
deficiencies<00:05:14.919> and<00:05:15.160> autoimmune<00:05:15.520> but<00:05:16.210> I<00:05:16.240> don't

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
deficiencies and autoimmune but I don't

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.240 
deficiencies and autoimmune but I don't
know<00:05:16.690> if<00:05:16.840> that<00:05:17.020> relates<00:05:17.380> but<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.650> do<00:05:17.770> know<00:05:18.040> that

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
know if that relates but I do know that

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.450 
know if that relates but I do know that
if<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.580> adrenal<00:05:19.060> is<00:05:19.240> to<00:05:20.169> stress<00:05:20.500> they<00:05:21.130> can<00:05:21.340> get

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
if the adrenal is to stress they can get

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.180 
if the adrenal is to stress they can get
autoimmune<00:05:21.910> of<00:05:22.060> pretty<00:05:22.270> much<00:05:22.330> any<00:05:22.690> organ<00:05:23.190> but

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
autoimmune of pretty much any organ but

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.800 
autoimmune of pretty much any organ but
I<00:05:24.220> would<00:05:24.400> like<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.580> before<00:05:25.270> I<00:05:25.300> evaluate<00:05:25.690> this

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
I would like to before I evaluate this

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.120 
I would like to before I evaluate this
I'd<00:05:25.990> like<00:05:26.080> to<00:05:26.229> get<00:05:26.290> a<00:05:26.350> history<00:05:26.680> of<00:05:26.770> when<00:05:26.950> it

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
I'd like to get a history of when it

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.219 
I'd like to get a history of when it
started<00:05:27.580> what<00:05:28.090> happened<00:05:28.419> just<00:05:28.479> before<00:05:28.690> it<00:05:29.050> was

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
started what happened just before it was

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.330 
started what happened just before it was
there<00:05:29.380> a<00:05:29.410> stress<00:05:29.650> event<00:05:29.800> or<00:05:30.070> reserve

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
there a stress event or reserve

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.400 
there a stress event or reserve
something<00:05:30.669> was<00:05:31.419> it<00:05:31.600> that<00:05:31.930> they<00:05:32.080> took<00:05:32.260> the

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
something was it that they took the

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.990 
something was it that they took the
gallbladder<00:05:32.800> out<00:05:32.919> so<00:05:33.130> I<00:05:33.160> can't<00:05:33.490> really<00:05:33.790> know

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
gallbladder out so I can't really know

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.110 
gallbladder out so I can't really know
that<00:05:34.270> kale<00:05:35.229> makes<00:05:35.500> her<00:05:36.490> hair<00:05:36.669> fall<00:05:36.850> well

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
that kale makes her hair fall well

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.300 
that kale makes her hair fall well
that's<00:05:37.330> too<00:05:38.140> much<00:05:38.260> kale<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.710> some<00:05:38.830> people<00:05:39.130> can

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
that's too much kale and some people can

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.520 
that's too much kale and some people can
block<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:41.220> can<00:05:42.220> block<00:05:42.430> iodine<00:05:43.030> and<00:05:43.260> that<00:05:44.260> can

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
block it can block iodine and that can

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.230 
block it can block iodine and that can
affect<00:05:44.680> especially<00:05:45.340> as<00:05:45.430> she<00:05:45.610> already<00:05:45.970> has<00:05:46.210> a

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
affect especially as she already has a

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.210 
affect especially as she already has a
thyroid<00:05:46.630> issue<00:05:46.840> she<00:05:47.560> probably<00:05:47.830> needs<00:05:48.070> to<00:05:48.130> be

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
thyroid issue she probably needs to be

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.840 
thyroid issue she probably needs to be
taking<00:05:48.610> iodine<00:05:49.000> but<00:05:49.750> look<00:05:50.320> at<00:05:50.440> this<00:05:50.850> she's

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
taking iodine but look at this she's

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.960 
taking iodine but look at this she's
taking<00:05:52.240> estrogen<00:05:53.250> decreased<00:05:54.250> libido<00:05:54.490> this<00:05:54.820> is

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
taking estrogen decreased libido this is

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.130 
taking estrogen decreased libido this is
estrogen<00:05:55.180> dominance<00:05:56.280> see<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.520> thyroid<00:05:58.140> it's

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
estrogen dominance see the thyroid it's

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.990 
estrogen dominance see the thyroid it's
very<00:05:59.470> rare<00:05:59.680> to<00:05:59.710> have<00:05:59.830> a<00:05:59.919> primary<00:06:00.160> thyroid<00:06:00.760> the

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
very rare to have a primary thyroid the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.690 
very rare to have a primary thyroid the
thyroid<00:06:01.470> is<00:06:03.780> usually<00:06:04.780> influenced<00:06:05.320> by<00:06:05.890> three

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
thyroid is usually influenced by three

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.980 
thyroid is usually influenced by three
things<00:06:06.910> one<00:06:07.510> a<00:06:07.830> lack<00:06:08.830> of<00:06:08.860> bile<00:06:09.370> because<00:06:10.270> t4<00:06:10.870> is

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
things one a lack of bile because t4 is

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.770 
things one a lack of bile because t4 is
converted<00:06:11.890> to<00:06:12.340> t3<00:06:12.520> through<00:06:12.910> the<00:06:13.000> liver<00:06:13.210> that

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
converted to t3 through the liver that

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.580 
converted to t3 through the liver that
would<00:06:13.990> make<00:06:14.169> a<00:06:14.200> lot<00:06:14.440> of<00:06:14.470> sense<00:06:15.419> or<00:06:16.419> it<00:06:17.169> can<00:06:17.380> come

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
would make a lot of sense or it can come

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.610 
would make a lot of sense or it can come
from<00:06:17.620> high<00:06:17.919> estrogen<00:06:19.140> associate<00:06:20.140> we<00:06:20.229> have<00:06:20.350> two

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
from high estrogen associate we have two

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.909 
from high estrogen associate we have two
things<00:06:20.979> that<00:06:21.310> can<00:06:21.460> cause<00:06:21.640> that<00:06:21.720> or<00:06:22.720> it<00:06:23.650> could

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
things that can cause that or it could

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.670 
things that can cause that or it could
be<00:06:24.039> the<00:06:24.160> adrenal<00:06:24.580> as<00:06:24.669> well<00:06:24.930> so<00:06:25.930> it<00:06:26.350> could<00:06:26.590> be

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
be the adrenal as well so it could be

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.320 
be the adrenal as well so it could be
any<00:06:26.830> one<00:06:26.979> of<00:06:27.039> those<00:06:27.220> things<00:06:27.460> so<00:06:27.550> what<00:06:27.820> I<00:06:28.030> would

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
any one of those things so what I would

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.420 
any one of those things so what I would
do<00:06:28.510> with<00:06:28.660> this<00:06:28.870> case<00:06:29.200> is<00:06:29.890> that<00:06:30.100> would<00:06:30.220> just

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
do with this case is that would just

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.170 
do with this case is that would just
take<00:06:30.640> one<00:06:30.940> thing<00:06:31.240> I<00:06:31.510> would<00:06:32.410> support<00:06:33.340> the

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
take one thing I would support the

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.620 
take one thing I would support the
pancreas<00:06:34.780> first<00:06:35.909> then<00:06:36.909> the<00:06:37.060> bile<00:06:37.240> and<00:06:37.510> then

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
pancreas first then the bile and then

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.170 
pancreas first then the bile and then
see<00:06:37.840> how<00:06:37.960> many<00:06:38.110> of<00:06:38.169> these<00:06:38.229> things<00:06:38.409> clear<00:06:38.770> up

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
see how many of these things clear up

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.980 
see how many of these things clear up
because<00:06:41.010> for<00:06:42.010> example<00:06:42.390> high<00:06:43.390> pulse<00:06:43.690> rate

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
because for example high pulse rate

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.780 
because for example high pulse rate
that's<00:06:44.620> the<00:06:44.860> heart<00:06:45.040> working<00:06:45.250> harder<00:06:45.670> be

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
that's the heart working harder be

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.250 
that's the heart working harder be
probably<00:06:46.360> because<00:06:46.510> she<00:06:46.630> doesn't<00:06:46.900> have<00:06:47.050> the

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
probably because she doesn't have the

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.990 
probably because she doesn't have the
fat<00:06:47.380> side<00:06:47.590> vitamins<00:06:48.070> to<00:06:48.220> transport<00:06:48.820> the

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
fat side vitamins to transport the

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.390 
fat side vitamins to transport the
minerals<00:06:49.840> and<00:06:50.080> calcium<00:06:50.170> around<00:06:50.680> and<00:06:51.130> see<00:06:51.310> if

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
minerals and calcium around and see if

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.950 
minerals and calcium around and see if
that<00:06:51.550> doesn't<00:06:51.910> just<00:06:52.060> clear<00:06:52.330> these<00:06:52.480> things<00:06:52.780> out

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
that doesn't just clear these things out

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.650 
that doesn't just clear these things out
right<00:06:53.170> here<00:06:53.410> so<00:06:54.220> that's<00:06:54.910> the<00:06:55.000> first<00:06:55.360> thing<00:06:55.480> I

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
right here so that's the first thing I

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.440 
right here so that's the first thing I
would<00:06:55.720> try<00:06:56.080> and<00:06:56.380> then<00:06:57.190> I<00:06:57.520> would<00:06:57.910> support<00:06:58.330> the

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
would try and then I would support the

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.040 
would try and then I would support the
adrenals<00:06:59.110> and<00:06:59.430> then<00:07:00.430> I<00:07:00.790> might<00:07:01.720> you<00:07:02.020> know

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
adrenals and then I might you know

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.660 
adrenals and then I might you know
recommend<00:07:02.680> that<00:07:02.770> she<00:07:02.890> doesn't<00:07:03.070> alternative

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.670 
recommend that she doesn't alternative

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.950 
recommend that she doesn't alternative
for<00:07:03.820> this<00:07:03.940> estrogen<00:07:04.240> thing<00:07:04.630> because<00:07:04.930> that

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
for this estrogen thing because that

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.600 
for this estrogen thing because that
there's<00:07:05.710> too<00:07:05.830> many<00:07:05.920> side<00:07:06.190> effects<00:07:06.490> with

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
there's too many side effects with

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.610 
there's too many side effects with
that's<00:07:06.790> what<00:07:06.910> estrogen<00:07:07.300> so<00:07:07.840> I<00:07:08.200> would<00:07:08.590> just

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
that's what estrogen so I would just

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.160 
that's what estrogen so I would just
take<00:07:09.010> the<00:07:09.220> most<00:07:09.370> likely<00:07:09.670> thing<00:07:10.000> first<00:07:10.330> address

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.170 
take the most likely thing first address

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.600 
take the most likely thing first address
that<00:07:11.380> and<00:07:11.620> then<00:07:11.770> the<00:07:11.830> next<00:07:12.040> one<00:07:12.160> boom<00:07:12.400> boom

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
that and then the next one boom boom

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.970 
that and then the next one boom boom
boom<00:07:12.760> to<00:07:12.940> see<00:07:13.090> what's<00:07:13.720> going<00:07:13.900> to<00:07:13.960> really<00:07:14.230> clear

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 
boom to see what's going to really clear

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.130 
boom to see what's going to really clear
out<00:07:15.130> most<00:07:15.400> of<00:07:15.520> these<00:07:15.580> issues<00:07:15.970> but<00:07:16.210> it<00:07:16.630> looks<00:07:16.930> to

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.140 
out most of these issues but it looks to

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.810 
out most of these issues but it looks to
me<00:07:17.290> that<00:07:17.320> if<00:07:17.800> her<00:07:17.950> digestion<00:07:18.400> is<00:07:18.610> better

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:18.820 
me that if her digestion is better

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.610 
me that if her digestion is better
should<00:07:19.510> be<00:07:19.630> converting<00:07:20.140> more<00:07:20.230> thyroid

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
should be converting more thyroid

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.530 
should be converting more thyroid
hormones<00:07:20.980> should<00:07:21.670> be<00:07:21.760> able<00:07:21.910> to<00:07:21.970> detoxify

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:22.540 
hormones should be able to detoxify

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.650 
hormones should be able to detoxify
estrogen<00:07:23.290> better<00:07:23.500> from<00:07:23.710> her<00:07:23.830> body<00:07:24.040> and<00:07:24.660> she'll

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:25.660 
estrogen better from her body and she'll

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.260 
estrogen better from her body and she'll
be<00:07:25.720> able<00:07:25.810> to<00:07:25.990> absorb<00:07:26.590> more<00:07:26.800> nutrients<00:07:27.310> she's

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
be able to absorb more nutrients she's

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.350 
be able to absorb more nutrients she's
gonna<00:07:28.420> have<00:07:28.720> to<00:07:29.080> take<00:07:29.680> some<00:07:30.220> bile<00:07:30.610> extract<00:07:31.180> for

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 
gonna have to take some bile extract for

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.340 
gonna have to take some bile extract for
the<00:07:31.420> rest<00:07:31.600> of<00:07:31.630> her<00:07:31.720> life<00:07:31.750> because<00:07:32.140> she<00:07:32.230> doesn't

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:32.350 
the rest of her life because she doesn't

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.920 
the rest of her life because she doesn't
have<00:07:32.440> a<00:07:32.530> gallbladder<00:07:33.360> purified<00:07:34.360> bile<00:07:34.570> salts

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
have a gallbladder purified bile salts

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.470 
have a gallbladder purified bile salts
but<00:07:35.680> to<00:07:36.040> support<00:07:36.220> the<00:07:36.520> pancreas<00:07:37.000> and<00:07:37.090> get<00:07:37.360> rid

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:37.480 
but to support the pancreas and get rid

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.510 
but to support the pancreas and get rid
of<00:07:37.510> all<00:07:37.660> these<00:07:37.900> things<00:07:38.200> that<00:07:38.860> would<00:07:39.130> probably

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 
of all these things that would probably

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.240 
of all these things that would probably
give<00:07:39.610> her<00:07:39.730> a<00:07:39.760> huge<00:07:40.240> relief<00:07:40.720> and<00:07:41.050> allow<00:07:41.950> her<00:07:42.130> to

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.250 
give her a huge relief and allow her to

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.310 
give her a huge relief and allow her to
sleep<00:07:42.520> take<00:07:43.180> the<00:07:43.210> stress<00:07:43.540> off<00:07:43.690> the<00:07:43.870> adrenals

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:44.320 
sleep take the stress off the adrenals

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.370 
sleep take the stress off the adrenals
so<00:07:45.040> that's<00:07:45.220> where<00:07:45.430> I<00:07:45.460> would<00:07:45.550> start<00:07:45.670> first<00:07:46.570> all

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:47.380 
so that's where I would start first all

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.140 
so that's where I would start first all
right<00:07:47.440> so<00:07:47.740> that's<00:07:47.830> just<00:07:48.010> kind<00:07:48.250> of<00:07:48.310> a<00:07:48.430> I'm<00:07:48.760> just

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:49.150 
right so that's just kind of a I'm just

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.090 
right so that's just kind of a I'm just
talking<00:07:49.450> out<00:07:49.540> loud<00:07:49.810> but<00:07:50.350> that's<00:07:50.620> how<00:07:50.890> I<00:07:50.920> would

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:51.100 
talking out loud but that's how I would

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.690 
talking out loud but that's how I would
take<00:07:51.970> a<00:07:52.000> look<00:07:52.210> at<00:07:52.330> this<00:07:52.420> case
