I've done a butterfly plunger cutter
which<00:00:13.029> is<00:00:13.270> very<00:00:13.570> easy<00:00:13.869> for<00:00:14.049> choppers<00:00:14.709> for

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
which is very easy for choppers for

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.189 
which is very easy for choppers for
cupcakes<00:00:15.699> the<00:00:16.420> other<00:00:16.539> one<00:00:16.810> that's<00:00:16.960> really

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
cupcakes the other one that's really

cupcakes the other one that's really
nice<00:00:17.500> is<00:00:17.770> this<00:00:18.310> daisy<00:00:19.060> pattern<00:00:19.720> so<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.740> daisy

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
nice is this daisy pattern so the daisy

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.160 
nice is this daisy pattern so the daisy
pattern<00:00:21.460> is<00:00:21.610> again<00:00:21.910> another<00:00:22.210> plunger<00:00:22.930> cutter

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
pattern is again another plunger cutter

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.200 
pattern is again another plunger cutter
this<00:00:23.440> one<00:00:23.620> doesn't<00:00:23.830> have<00:00:23.980> any<00:00:24.160> sort<00:00:24.820> of<00:00:24.910> and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
this one doesn't have any sort of and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.080 
this one doesn't have any sort of and
pattern<00:00:26.110> on<00:00:26.350> it<00:00:26.590> but<00:00:27.190> it<00:00:27.340> does<00:00:27.520> have<00:00:27.730> sort<00:00:27.940> of<00:00:28.000> a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
pattern on it but it does have sort of a

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.060 
pattern on it but it does have sort of a
little<00:00:28.210> dip<00:00:28.660> in<00:00:28.780> the<00:00:28.900> middle<00:00:29.140> it<00:00:29.560> comes<00:00:29.890> in

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
little dip in the middle it comes in

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.029 
little dip in the middle it comes in
four<00:00:30.369> different<00:00:30.400> sizes<00:00:31.410> which<00:00:32.410> means<00:00:32.439> that

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
four different sizes which means that

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.520 
four different sizes which means that
you<00:00:33.250> can<00:00:33.489> find<00:00:34.449> the<00:00:34.570> size<00:00:34.750> to<00:00:35.079> suit<00:00:35.319> whatever

have a look to see how to do that and as

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.529 
have a look to see how to do that and as
I<00:01:59.020> said<00:01:59.229> I've<00:01:59.469> already<00:01:59.619> done<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.490> little<00:02:00.880> video

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
I said I've already done a little video

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.309 
I said I've already done a little video
for<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.429> butterfly<00:02:03.429> cover<00:02:04.119> so<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.929> can<00:02:05.170> also

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.989 
for the butterfly cover so you can also
click<00:02:05.740> on<00:02:05.859> that<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.249> see<00:02:06.460> what<00:02:06.579> that<00:02:06.759> looks

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
click on that to see what that looks

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:08.370 
click on that to see what that looks
like<00:02:07.090> if<00:02:07.359> that's<00:02:07.630> something<00:02:07.960> that<00:02:08.110> you're

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
like if that's something that you're

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.389 
like if that's something that you're
interested<00:02:08.590> in<00:02:08.950> making

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
interested in making

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.430 
interested in making
so<00:02:10.640> I'm<00:02:11.060> basically<00:02:11.299> rolling<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:12.049> out<00:02:12.260> this

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
so I'm basically rolling this out this

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.680 
so I'm basically rolling this out this
is<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.650> little<00:02:12.860> rolling<00:02:13.640> pin<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:13.970> has<00:02:14.120> spacers

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
is a little rolling pin that has spacers

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.589 
is a little rolling pin that has spacers
on<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:14.959> already<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.830> makes<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.489> stick<00:02:17.450> his

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
on it already so it makes it I stick his

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.690 
on it already so it makes it I stick his
little<00:02:17.900> spacer<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.799> comes<00:02:19.069> with<00:02:19.370> two

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
little spacer and it comes with two

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.640 
little spacer and it comes with two
different<00:02:19.730> sizes<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.629> you<00:02:20.959> tend<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.409> use<00:02:21.530> a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
different sizes so you tend to use a

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.309 
different sizes so you tend to use a
thicker<00:02:21.920> one<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.599> these<00:02:23.750> have<00:02:23.989> a<00:02:24.019> little

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
thicker one so that these have a little

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.130 
thicker one so that these have a little
bit<00:02:24.440> more<00:02:25.180> rigidity<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.599> them<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:26.959> they<00:02:27.049> don't

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
bit more rigidity to them and they don't

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.559 
bit more rigidity to them and they don't
sort<00:02:27.409> of<00:02:27.470> move<00:02:27.650> around<00:02:27.799> quite<00:02:28.280> as<00:02:28.400> much<00:02:28.579> so<00:02:29.299> I'm

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
sort of move around quite as much so I'm

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.970 
sort of move around quite as much so I'm
just<00:02:29.750> going<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:29.959> make<00:02:30.110> sure<00:02:30.349> that<00:02:30.379> that<00:02:30.680> isn't

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
just going to make sure that that isn't

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.520 
just going to make sure that that isn't
stuck<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.849> my<00:02:32.239> mat<00:02:32.480> by<00:02:32.870> running<00:02:33.079> my<00:02:33.200> little

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
spatula underneath and I'm going to use

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.520 
spatula underneath and I'm going to use
the<00:02:36.799> large<00:02:37.040> flour<00:02:37.849> cutter<00:02:38.209> I'm<00:02:38.810> making<00:02:39.349> some

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530

that<00:04:00.130> so<00:04:01.130> that<00:04:01.280> gives<00:04:01.460> it<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.670> little<00:04:01.790> bit<00:04:01.910> more

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
that so that gives it a little bit more

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.910 
that so that gives it a little bit more
of<00:04:02.270> a<00:04:02.330> 3d<00:04:02.750> look<00:04:02.780> which<00:04:03.110> is<00:04:03.140> really<00:04:03.290> pretty<00:04:03.620> and

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
instead of having a little raised Center

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.280 
instead of having a little raised Center
you<00:04:07.160> can<00:04:07.190> make<00:04:07.520> a<00:04:07.550> little<00:04:07.820> hole<00:04:08.120> like<00:04:08.570> that<00:04:08.840> and

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
and as they come in different shapes you

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.360 
and as they come in different shapes you
can<00:06:08.069> easily<00:06:09.349> change<00:06:10.349> the<00:06:10.620> size<00:06:10.830> so<00:06:11.189> if<00:06:11.250> you

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370
