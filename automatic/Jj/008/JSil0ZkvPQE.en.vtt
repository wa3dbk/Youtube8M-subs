00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:04.000
Freedom of speech means many things.

00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:09.656
The most important point of this concept is 
 the right to receive and express information.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.012
What does freedom of speech also mean?

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.366
Freedom of speech protects many areas of "SPEECH".

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.800
Speech is not just about receiving and expressing information in general.

00:00:22.296 --> 00:00:23.800
It is not so! 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Freedom of speech has a long list of things. Only a few examples will be displayed here. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.229
This is what freedom of speech is really about. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.800
The long list of ideas derived from the word "Speech". 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
With all of this information...

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.000
What about protecting the Deaf children?

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.288
If Deaf children have no access to an interpreter, 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.300
then how can they access all kinds of information that is protected by Freedom of Speech?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.900
How will they ever learn about such things? How are they supposed to be educated? 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.494
How will they move on in life making progress?

00:01:12.608 --> 00:01:15.608
Hearing children have access to all of this, why can't the Deaf children have the same privilege?

00:01:16.124 --> 00:01:20.000
This Deaf child here has no access to an interpreter. 

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:21.999
Is this supposed to be his First Amendment protection?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.688
Deaf children have the right to access any information, especially the kind of information listed earlier. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.999
They have the right to receive that information regardless of how awful it may be, and the right to express by getting involved if they desire to do so.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.490
See this Deaf child?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.900
If he had access to an interpreter, he would know how to put a tire on and look into a trunk. He would actually know what to do. 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.999
But he does not. He is so frustrated that he throws the tire away. Then he walks away alone.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.000
Without an interpreter, he is alone, isolated, and lonely. 

00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:58.000
Is that fair?

00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:01.520
That's not Freedom of Speech.

00:02:04.015 --> 00:02:07.020
Will this child have access to information with this type of interpreter? (Lousy, slow, and limited vocabulary signer)

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.170
or this one? (No interpreter provided)

00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:17.480
or... this one? (Fluent, wide range of vocabulary, and ASL signer)

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.460
The third one would be the choice. That would be the Deaf child's right. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.130
It is important to hire an interpreter who is a fluent signer, can communicate clearly, and uses the Deaf child's natural language which is ASL.

00:02:28.617 --> 00:02:32.620
That would be their Freedom of Speech. The right to receive and express information. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.080
Since the Deaf children are not protected, are you violating the First Amendment?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.070
To deny the Deaf children the First Amendment rights: the right to access and express information through an interpreter... 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.960
is like ripping their soul out.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.690
Having an interpreter is their right, more specifically, their First Amendment right. 

00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:56.040
That would be their Freedom of Speech. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.690
Give a Deaf child an interpreter because that is their First Amendment protection.
