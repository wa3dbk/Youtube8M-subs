00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 

Oh<00:00:00.089> friend<00:00:00.810> of<00:00:00.900> mine<00:00:01.020> asked<00:00:01.290> me<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.500> show<00:00:01.800> how

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
Oh friend of mine asked me to show how

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.110 
Oh friend of mine asked me to show how
to<00:00:02.070> do<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:03.230> delayed<00:00:04.230> sweep<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.920> use<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.730> delaying

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
to do a delayed sweep and use a delaying

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.000 
to do a delayed sweep and use a delaying
sweep<00:00:06.450> on<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.960> lot<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.350> Tektronix

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
sweep on a lot of the Tektronix

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.860 
sweep on a lot of the Tektronix
oscilloscopes<00:00:08.670> so<00:00:09.389> here's<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.630> quick<00:00:09.840> example

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
oscilloscopes so here's a quick example

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.890 
oscilloscopes so here's a quick example
using<00:00:10.559> two<00:00:10.710> different<00:00:11.040> scopes<00:00:11.780> starting<00:00:12.780> off

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
using two different scopes starting off

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.570 
using two different scopes starting off
with<00:00:13.080> I've<00:00:13.410> got<00:00:13.559> two<00:00:13.769> signals<00:00:14.130> coming<00:00:14.429> into

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
with I've got two signals coming into

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.290 
with I've got two signals coming into
the<00:00:14.759> scope<00:00:15.000> down<00:00:15.210> here<00:00:15.509> one<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:17.300> gating

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
the scope down here one is a gating

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.939 
the scope down here one is a gating
signal<00:00:18.570> which<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> square<00:00:19.529> wave<00:00:19.859> if

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
signal which is just the square wave if

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.580 
signal which is just the square wave if
you<00:00:20.070> see<00:00:20.250> below<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.910> then<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> other<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.170> kind

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
you see below and then the other is kind

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.009 
you see below and then the other is kind
of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.890> an<00:00:23.100> RF<00:00:23.789> signal<00:00:23.820> or<00:00:24.300> should<00:00:24.510> say<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> sine

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
of the an RF signal or should say a sine

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.710 
of the an RF signal or should say a sine
wave<00:00:25.050> that's<00:00:25.529> being<00:00:25.740> gated<00:00:26.250> by<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.390> gating

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
wave that's being gated by that gating

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.419 
wave that's being gated by that gating
signal<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.769> see<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> pretty<00:00:29.160> stable

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
signal so we can see a pretty stable

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.970 
signal so we can see a pretty stable
waveform<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.869> want<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.260> zoom<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
waveform but if we want to zoom in to a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.530 
waveform but if we want to zoom in to a
particular<00:00:32.279> area<00:00:32.700> that's<00:00:33.090> kind<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.329> what<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
particular area that's kind of what the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.260 
particular area that's kind of what the
delaying<00:00:33.809> time<00:00:34.140> basis<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.059> scope

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
delaying time basis for so on this scope

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.010 
delaying time basis for so on this scope
here<00:00:36.570> which<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> an<00:00:37.680> odor<00:00:37.800> 485<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.570> controls

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
here which is a an odor 485 the controls

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.410 
here which is a an odor 485 the controls
are<00:00:40.230> right<00:00:40.410> here<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> horizontal<00:00:41.730> display

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
are right here with a horizontal display

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.150 
are right here with a horizontal display
so<00:00:43.050> right<00:00:43.290> now<00:00:43.410> we're<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.590> looking<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
so right now we're just looking at the a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.240 
so right now we're just looking at the a
time<00:00:44.489> base<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.570> adjust<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.379> see

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
time base and we can adjust that and see

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.700 
time base and we can adjust that and see
different<00:00:47.730> changes<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.500> wanted

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
different changes in here if we wanted

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770 
different changes in here if we wanted
to<00:00:49.829> kind<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.100> take<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> closer<00:00:50.969> look<00:00:51.090> at<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.629> of

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
to kind of take a closer look at one of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
to kind of take a closer look at one of
these<00:00:51.870> pulses<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.710> still<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
these pulses and still have this the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.000 
these pulses and still have this the
overall<00:00:53.850> view<00:00:54.120> kind<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.510> zooming<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.860> would

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
overall view kind of zooming in we would

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.459 
overall view kind of zooming in we would
use<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.309> delayed<00:00:56.579> time-base<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:58.350> this

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
use the delayed time-base so in this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.990 
use the delayed time-base so in this
case<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.800> start<00:00:59.070> off<00:00:59.190> by<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.910> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
case you start off by going to the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
case you start off by going to the
intensified<00:01:00.660> version<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.559> intensified

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
intensified version the intensified

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460 
intensified version the intensified
display<00:01:02.699> what<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.120> does<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:04.260> highlights

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
display what that does is it highlights

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.500 
display what that does is it highlights
an<00:01:04.799> area<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.309> cover<00:01:05.640> display<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> can

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
an area this cover display and you can

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.570 
an area this cover display and you can
see<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.930> highlighted<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.250> what<00:01:08.490> you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
see that highlighted here and what you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.620 
see that highlighted here and what you
can<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.180> change<00:01:09.210> that

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
can do is you can change that

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.810 
can do is you can change that
highlighted<00:01:10.020> area<00:01:10.470> by<00:01:10.680> changing<00:01:11.220> by<00:01:11.400> pulling

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
highlighted area by changing by pulling

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.480 
highlighted area by changing by pulling
on<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> horizontal<00:01:12.890> sweep<00:01:13.890> knob<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
on the horizontal sweep knob and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.550 
on the horizontal sweep knob and
adjusting<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.110> how<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.320> have

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
adjusting it and you can see how we have

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.320 
adjusting it and you can see how we have
a<00:01:16.590> different<00:01:17.009> highlighted<00:01:17.520> area<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.150> now

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
a different highlighted area here now

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.899 
a different highlighted area here now
and<00:01:18.540> by<00:01:19.020> adjusting<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.680> display<00:01:20.220> control<00:01:20.700> or

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and by adjusting this display control or

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.450 
and by adjusting this display control or
the<00:01:21.090> delay<00:01:21.390> control<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.619> delay<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.250> look

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the delay control we can delay and look

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
the delay control we can delay and look
at<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.850> given<00:01:24.360> portion<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.049> wave<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.530> him

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
at a given portion of that wave for him

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.899 
at a given portion of that wave for him
so<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:27.080> increase<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.500> sweep<00:01:29.369> speed<00:01:29.520> of

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so we can increase the sweep speed of

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.289 
so we can increase the sweep speed of
the<00:01:30.390> B<00:01:30.630> time<00:01:31.020> base<00:01:31.290> okay<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.369> narrow<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:33.030> that

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
the B time base okay and narrow up that

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.170 
the B time base okay and narrow up that
intensified<00:01:34.170> portion<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.040> as<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
intensified portion and as you go to the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.819 
intensified portion and as you go to the
intensified<00:01:36.720> portion<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.560> actually

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
intensified portion here we can actually

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.190 
intensified portion here we can actually
see<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.159> intensified<00:01:38.880> now<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.020> do

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
see that intensified now what we can do

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
see that intensified now what we can do
is<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.430> intensify

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
is we can go from the intensify

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.800 
is we can go from the intensify
intensified<00:01:42.960> display<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.270> call<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
intensified display to what we call the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.960 
intensified display to what we call the
alternate<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> alternate<00:01:47.430> will<00:01:47.579> do<00:01:47.729> is

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
alternate what the alternate will do is

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.730 
alternate what the alternate will do is
will<00:01:48.119> alternate<00:01:48.630> between<00:01:48.689> sweeping<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
will alternate between sweeping the a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
will alternate between sweeping the a
sweep<00:01:50.250> which<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.610> what<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
sweep which is what we see up here and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.810 
sweep which is what we see up here and
just<00:01:52.649> sweeping<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> area<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.790> see

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
just sweeping the area that we see

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.139 
just sweeping the area that we see
intensified<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.380> hit<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.680> off<00:01:55.829> button

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
intensified so if I hit the off button

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.450 
intensified so if I hit the off button
we<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.540> two<00:01:58.439> more<00:01:58.619> traces<00:01:58.920> show<00:01:59.280> up

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
we now can see two more traces show up

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.050 
we now can see two more traces show up
there's<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.530> trace<00:02:01.530> separation<00:02:02.250> knob<00:02:02.490> here<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
there's a trace separation knob here and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.179 
there's a trace separation knob here and
if<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.450> adjust<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:04.920> see<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.159> just

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
if we adjust that you can see it just

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.789 
if we adjust that you can see it just
adjusts<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.030> traces<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.380> really<00:02:07.619> what

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
adjusts as the traces so really what

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.430 
adjusts as the traces so really what
we've<00:02:07.950> got<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.720> intensified

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
we've got here now is this intensified

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.199 
we've got here now is this intensified
portion<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.099> see<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> sweep<00:02:11.970> is

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
portion that you see on the a sweep is

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.309 
portion that you see on the a sweep is
now<00:02:12.360> being<00:02:12.569> shown

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
now being shown

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.130 
now being shown
down<00:02:13.409> here<00:02:13.709> expand<00:02:14.249> it<00:02:14.400> out<00:02:14.519> horizontally<00:02:15.140> so

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
down here expand it out horizontally so

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.989 
down here expand it out horizontally so
if<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.319> change<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.920> time<00:02:17.159> base<00:02:17.400> again<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:17.849> can

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:17.999 
if I change that time base again we can

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.149 
if I change that time base again we can
see<00:02:18.180> if<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.359> make<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.569> narrower<00:02:19.079> or<00:02:19.170> wider<00:02:19.319> we

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
see if I make that narrower or wider we

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.369 
see if I make that narrower or wider we
can<00:02:20.310> actually<00:02:20.430> see<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.480> wider<00:02:21.719> area<00:02:22.170> or<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
can actually see the wider area or the

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.489 
can actually see the wider area or the
narrow<00:02:22.590> area<00:02:22.859> being<00:02:23.129> intensified<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.499> now

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:25.499 
narrow area being intensified in and now

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.140 
narrow area being intensified in and now
you<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.769> adjust<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.219> delay<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.819> look<00:02:27.030> at

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
you can adjust the delay and look at

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.819 
you can adjust the delay and look at
that<00:02:27.299> way<00:02:27.480> form<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.900> different<00:02:28.049> portion<00:02:28.469> for

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
that way form a different portion for

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.319 
that way form a different portion for
example<00:02:29.189> if<00:02:29.249> you<00:02:29.340> want<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.609> see<00:02:29.790> like<00:02:30.239> I

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
example if you want to see like I

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.030 
example if you want to see like I
actually<00:02:30.450> see<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:30.810> sine<00:02:31.049> wave<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.829> in

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
actually see the sine wave that is in

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.149 
actually see the sine wave that is in
that<00:02:32.400> burst<00:02:32.730> up<00:02:33.000> there<00:02:33.290> okay<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.319> as<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:34.829> drop

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
that burst up there okay and as we drop

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.500 
that burst up there okay and as we drop
it<00:02:35.340> down<00:02:35.370> we<00:02:35.549> can<00:02:35.670> actually<00:02:35.790> see<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.180> falling

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
it down we can actually see the falling

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.360 
it down we can actually see the falling
edge<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.840> gating<00:02:37.139> pulse<00:02:37.409> and<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:38.159> sine

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
edge of the gating pulse and the sine

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.759 
edge of the gating pulse and the sine
wave<00:02:38.549> being<00:02:38.849> cut<00:02:39.120> off<00:02:39.299> okay<00:02:40.260> right<00:02:40.500> there<00:02:40.650> at

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
wave being cut off okay right there at

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.890 
wave being cut off okay right there at
the<00:02:40.889> end<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.189> that<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.579> kind<00:02:42.359> of<00:02:42.450> zoom<00:02:42.659> out<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
the end of that I kind of zoom out a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.089 
the end of that I kind of zoom out a
little<00:02:43.079> bit<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:43.349> can<00:02:43.469> see<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.799> a<00:02:43.829> little<00:02:43.950> bit

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
little bit we can see that a little bit

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.399 
little bit we can see that a little bit
better<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.969> I<00:02:44.999> can<00:02:45.120> delay<00:02:45.540> over<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.230> next

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
better so I can delay over to the next

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.709 
better so I can delay over to the next
pulse<00:02:46.739> as<00:02:47.189> I<00:02:47.400> work<00:02:47.700> my<00:02:47.730> way<00:02:47.909> across<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.569> can

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
pulse as I work my way across and I can

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.119 
pulse as I work my way across and I can
see<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.019> next<00:02:49.200> one<00:02:49.379> kind<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.650> popping<00:02:49.859> up

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
see that next one kind of popping up

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.339 
see that next one kind of popping up
there<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:50.579> can<00:02:50.639> see<00:02:50.939> it<00:02:51.139> okay

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
there and you can see it okay

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.679 
there and you can see it okay
now<00:02:52.889> also<00:02:53.069> there's<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.459> way<00:02:53.639> what<00:02:54.359> this<00:02:54.510> is

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
now also there's a way what this is

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.709 
now also there's a way what this is
doing<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.739> B<00:02:56.370> time<00:02:56.669> base<00:02:56.939> if<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.299> look<00:02:57.480> at<00:02:57.599> the

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
doing the B time base if we look at the

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.709 
doing the B time base if we look at the
B<00:02:57.930> triggering<00:02:58.799> controls<00:02:59.219> up<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.459> the<00:03:00.329> B<00:03:00.540> is

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:00.719 
B triggering controls up here the B is

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.959 
B triggering controls up here the B is
set<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.199> the<00:03:01.469> uppermost<00:03:01.769> position<00:03:02.430> here<00:03:02.699> which

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
set in the uppermost position here which

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.309 
set in the uppermost position here which
is<00:03:03.500> says<00:03:04.530> run<00:03:05.010> or<00:03:05.340> B<00:03:05.669> runs<00:03:06.269> after<00:03:06.599> delay<00:03:07.079> time

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
is says run or B runs after delay time

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.470 
is says run or B runs after delay time
so<00:03:07.739> after<00:03:07.919> we<00:03:08.129> adjust<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.549> delay<00:03:08.909> time<00:03:09.150> right

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
so after we adjust the delay time right

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.020 
so after we adjust the delay time right
here<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.650> B<00:03:10.829> sweep<00:03:11.129> is<00:03:11.340> just<00:03:11.519> running<00:03:11.790> and

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
here the B sweep is just running and

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.240 
here the B sweep is just running and
that's<00:03:12.150> what<00:03:12.359> we<00:03:12.480> see<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:13.409> also<00:03:13.620> possible<00:03:13.949> to

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
that's what we see it's also possible to

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.099 
that's what we see it's also possible to
tell<00:03:14.579> B<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:15.209> be<00:03:15.389> triggered

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
tell B to be triggered

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.149 
tell B to be triggered
so<00:03:16.949> it<00:03:17.129> can<00:03:17.250> be<00:03:17.370> triggered<00:03:17.609> after<00:03:18.889> the<00:03:19.889> delay

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
so it can be triggered after the delay

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.219 
so it can be triggered after the delay
time<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.430> what<00:03:20.790> we'll<00:03:20.939> see<00:03:21.180> as<00:03:21.389> we<00:03:21.959> scoot

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229 
time and what we'll see as we scoot

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:23.569 
time and what we'll see as we scoot
across<00:03:22.349> here<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.829> see<00:03:22.979> I<00:03:23.009> was<00:03:23.159> jumping

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
across here you see I was jumping

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.949 
across here you see I was jumping
because<00:03:24.209> that's<00:03:24.389> jumping<00:03:24.599> to<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.930> next

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
because that's jumping to the next

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.929 
because that's jumping to the next
triggered<00:03:25.500> event<00:03:25.829> because<00:03:26.370> I'm<00:03:26.489> triggering

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
triggered event because I'm triggering

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.569 
triggered event because I'm triggering
on<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.900> burst<00:03:28.139> itself<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.400> can<00:03:29.489> actually

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
on the burst itself so you can actually

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.789 
on the burst itself so you can actually
see<00:03:29.879> how<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.030> delay<00:03:30.659> is<00:03:30.810> now<00:03:30.959> jumping<00:03:31.470> because

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
see how the delay is now jumping because

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.319 
see how the delay is now jumping because
it's<00:03:32.069> going<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.430> delay<00:03:32.699> a<00:03:32.729> certain<00:03:33.060> period<00:03:33.299> of

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
it's going to delay a certain period of

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.240 
it's going to delay a certain period of
time<00:03:33.419> it's<00:03:33.780> waiting<00:03:34.049> for<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.229> trigger<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.159> you

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
time it's waiting for a trigger so you

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.860 
time it's waiting for a trigger so you
can<00:03:35.340> cause<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.729> have<00:03:35.879> a<00:03:35.909> more<00:03:36.180> stable<00:03:36.449> event

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
can cause you have a more stable event

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.869 
can cause you have a more stable event
and<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.049> keep<00:03:37.259> delaying<00:03:37.590> it's<00:03:38.340> going<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.609> delay

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
and I keep delaying it's going to delay

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.300 
and I keep delaying it's going to delay
across<00:03:39.239> here<00:03:39.569> now<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.049> then<00:03:40.229> BOOM<00:03:40.829> jump<00:03:41.220> to

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
across here now and then BOOM jump to

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.429 
across here now and then BOOM jump to
the<00:03:41.430> next<00:03:41.549> pulse<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.959> that's<00:03:43.109> kind<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:43.349> what

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 
the next pulse so that's kind of what

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.640 
the next pulse so that's kind of what
the<00:03:43.560> delaying<00:03:43.889> time<00:03:44.129> basis<00:03:44.609> on<00:03:44.849> this<00:03:45.650> 485
