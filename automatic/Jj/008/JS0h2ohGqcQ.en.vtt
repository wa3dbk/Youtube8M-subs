00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 In this class I will talk about the wand. 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.189
 medical magic in a little more selections 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.010
 complex of multiple objects 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.620
 Good art objects will show the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.120
 difference and has and another method of 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:36.930
 selection, I explained 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:38.640
 this select method without the same form 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.309
 similar only that you can determine 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:01:20.009
 levels of tolerance 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:01:23.280
 an example if I'm going to change from one to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:34.409
 blue tint and another tint 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:37.130
 blue and five point change now in 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.130
 ten points 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:47.700
 another selected light red tone 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:51.560
 of good ones then you double click 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.560
 here the medical tool in 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:19.800
 settings of the tool or the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:22.310
 still less or select doctor is 32 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.310
 points 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.610
 this object of a tolerance between the 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.310
 object of the same color plus a tolerance 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.350
 of object color graduation 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.690
 Look how nice the same thing would be 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.350
 which are two points of blue the tolerance 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.019
 bigger 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.750
 click here this one selected the two 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.280
 there was a greater tolerance here among 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.950
 color tones 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.860
 now I can use other resources that 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:15.720
 collor if they apply a select 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:22.560
 here everyone around this one by 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.250
 example a little more clear in this one 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.250
 with the doctor 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:36.480
 select tolerance 32 did not work 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.480
 increase tolerance here for 110 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:04:25.599
 selected is on the scale the tolerance 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:32.430
 up to 5 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:32.430
 in one it tolerates a selection of 12 345 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:05:17.440
 45 points to put more 29 11 19 a 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.940
 all god tolerance has mattered until 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.810
 here by 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:27.010
 is very useful this selection method has 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:52.990
 also opacity object option 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:52.990
 select it's capacity from 70 and 80 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:26.380
 even select all multiple objects 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.640
 a tool in the course
