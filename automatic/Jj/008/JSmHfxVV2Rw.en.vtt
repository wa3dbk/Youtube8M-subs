I can't explain what they're doing right

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.260 
I can't explain what they're doing right
now<00:01:10.429> essentially<00:01:11.780> what<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.899> we<00:01:13.289> try<00:01:13.469> to<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:14.270> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
now essentially what we we try to do the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.599 
now essentially what we we try to do the
rotor<00:01:15.479> wash<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.929> a<00:01:15.960> Chinook<00:01:16.609> hovering

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
rotor wash on a Chinook hovering

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.249 
rotor wash on a Chinook hovering
produces<00:01:18.359> about<00:01:18.539> a<00:01:18.600> hundred<00:01:18.780> mile<00:01:19.020> an<00:01:19.170> hour

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
produces about a hundred mile an hour

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.789 
produces about a hundred mile an hour
wind<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.759> mitigate<00:01:20.969> a<00:01:21.240> lot<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.630> debris<00:01:22.469> and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
wind and to mitigate a lot of debris and

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.770 
wind and to mitigate a lot of debris and
things<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.100> are<00:01:23.189> flying<00:01:23.340> around

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
things that are flying around

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.179 
things that are flying around
unfortunately<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.049> cAL<00:01:25.649> FIRE<00:01:25.679> here

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
unfortunately we have cAL FIRE here

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.999 
unfortunately we have cAL FIRE here
that's<00:01:26.459> helping<00:01:27.149> us<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.409> they're<00:01:28.920> going

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that's helping us out and they're going

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.469 
that's helping us out and they're going
to<00:01:29.069> water<00:01:29.250> down<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> site<00:01:29.819> and<00:01:30.090> that'll<00:01:30.329> just

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
to water down the site and that'll just

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.870 
to water down the site and that'll just
limit<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.869> amount<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.259> grass<00:01:31.890> dust<00:01:32.609> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
limit the amount of grass dust and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.160 
limit the amount of grass dust and
debris<00:01:32.969> there<00:01:33.329> flies<00:01:33.509> around<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:33.899> we<00:01:33.990> come

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
debris there flies around when we come

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.529 
debris there flies around when we come
in<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.409> pick<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:34.859> this<00:01:34.950> bar<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.209> explain

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
in and pick up this bar you can explain

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.770 
in and pick up this bar you can explain
the<00:01:36.689> procedure<00:01:36.840> when<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.289> Chinook<00:01:37.590> comes<00:01:37.770> in

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
the procedure when the Chinook comes in

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.419 
the procedure when the Chinook comes in
essentially<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.810> aircraft<00:01:40.349> is<00:01:40.500> rigged<00:01:40.709> in<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
essentially the aircraft is rigged in a

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:42.859 
essentially the aircraft is rigged in a
sling<00:01:41.670> load<00:01:41.819> fast<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.420> basically<00:01:42.539> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
sling load fast and so basically you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.779 
sling load fast and so basically you
know<00:01:42.959> just<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.289> he<00:01:43.500> had<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:44.459> a<00:01:44.579> it's

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
know just like he had a it's a it's

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.600 
know just like he had a it's a it's
flying<00:01:45.179> crane<00:01:45.569> you<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:45.989> a<00:01:46.489> come<00:01:47.489> in

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
flying crane you know it's a come in

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.050 
flying crane you know it's a come in
with<00:01:47.789> a<00:01:47.819> sling<00:01:48.090> load<00:01:48.709> hook<00:01:49.709> up<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.129> rigged

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
with a sling load hook up to the rigged

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.770 
with a sling load hook up to the rigged
