having<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.150> script<00:03:01.450> made<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.959> easier<00:03:02.319> to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
having a script made it easier to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.009 
having a script made it easier to
understand<00:03:03.040> what<00:03:03.129> my<00:03:03.280> role<00:03:03.579> should<00:03:03.969> be<00:03:04.030> later

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019

understand what my role should be later
on<00:03:05.139> they<00:03:05.439> did<00:03:05.889> the<00:03:06.040> repeated<00:03:06.609> exercises<00:03:07.420> I

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:07.749 
on they did the repeated exercises I

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:09.809 
on they did the repeated exercises I
think<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.349> was<00:03:08.469> put<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.799> team<00:03:09.129> data<00:03:09.340> assigned

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
think it was put the team data assigned

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.080 
think it was put the team data assigned
the<00:03:10.000> roles<00:03:10.650> when<00:03:11.650> she<00:03:11.799> walked<00:03:12.010> in<00:03:12.219> right<00:03:12.459> at

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
the roles when she walked in right at

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.259 
the roles when she walked in right at
the<00:03:13.209> start<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.799> how<00:03:15.219> did<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.430> feel<00:03:15.609> to<00:03:15.939> be<00:03:16.060> team

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
found it difficult when you have

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.480 
found it difficult when you have
multiple<00:03:54.020> conversations<00:03:54.170> but<00:03:54.860> yeah<00:03:55.280> there

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
overwhelming when you first walk in here

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.000 
overwhelming when you first walk in here
there's<00:03:59.660> so<00:03:59.840> much<00:03:59.990> going<00:04:00.200> on<00:04:00.440> you're<00:04:00.620> not<00:04:00.740> sure

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
through it's nice to have the script but

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.830 
through it's nice to have the script but
even<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.500> second<00:04:09.800> time<00:04:09.830> I<00:04:09.950> was<00:04:10.130> told

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
even the second time I was told

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.720 
even the second time I was told
sometimes<00:04:11.840> trying<00:04:12.080> to<00:04:12.140> catch<00:04:12.320> up<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:13.130> did<00:04:13.550> you

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
notice a difference the first time you

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.150 
notice a difference the first time you
did<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.600> from<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.750> last<00:04:17.900> time<00:04:18.050> you<00:04:18.320> did<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.590> and

by the time we got to the final exercise
yeah<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.600> was<00:04:23.750> much

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.540 

honestly<00:04:32.259> it's<00:04:32.440> going<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.710> get<00:04:32.800> off-script<00:04:32.979> -

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
honestly it's going to get off-script -

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.550 
honestly it's going to get off-script -
as<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.090> thirst<00:04:34.539> for<00:04:34.750> more<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:35.020> script<00:04:35.380> we're

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
as a thirst for more on script we're

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.140 
as a thirst for more on script we're
kind<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:35.800> worried<00:04:36.130> about<00:04:36.310> sticking<00:04:36.729> to<00:04:36.940> that

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
kind of worried about sticking to that

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.029 
kind of worried about sticking to that
and<00:04:37.870> we're<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.050> think<00:04:38.229> we're<00:04:38.470> thinking<00:04:38.680> less

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
and we're I think we're thinking less

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.550 
and we're I think we're thinking less
about<00:04:39.069> the<00:04:39.900> experience<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:41.050> working<00:04:41.229> as<00:04:41.530> a

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
about the experience of working as a

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.230 
about the experience of working as a
team<00:04:41.830> so<00:04:42.340> even<00:04:42.699> though<00:04:42.759> it<00:04:42.880> felt<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.150> little

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
team so even though it felt a little

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.999 
team so even though it felt a little
uncomfortable<00:04:43.479> at<00:04:43.930> first<00:04:43.960> getting<00:04:44.830> rid<00:04:44.979> of

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
uncomfortable at first getting rid of

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.339 
uncomfortable at first getting rid of
that<00:04:45.160> script<00:04:45.660> they<00:04:46.660> definitely<00:04:46.960> love<00:04:47.169> the

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
that script they definitely love the

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.309 
that script they definitely love the
flow<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:48.599> thought<00:04:49.599> we<00:04:49.810> were<00:04:49.900> going<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.110> learn

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
flow I thought we were going to learn

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.040 
flow I thought we were going to learn
more<00:04:50.620> about<00:04:50.680> like<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.430> medications<00:04:52.150> and<00:04:52.720> the

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
more about like the medications and the

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.570 
more about like the medications and the
compressions<00:04:53.680> like<00:04:53.979> I<00:04:54.009> was<00:04:54.250> supposed<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.490> be

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
compressions like I was supposed to be

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.300 
compressions like I was supposed to be
doing<00:04:54.789> continuous<00:04:55.120> or<00:04:55.630> supposed<00:04:56.440> to<00:04:56.590> do<00:04:56.680> 32<00:04:57.130> -

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
doing continuous or supposed to do 32 -

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.909 
doing continuous or supposed to do 32 -
like<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.789> was<00:04:57.880> really<00:04:57.910> confusing<00:04:58.630> so<00:04:58.919> and

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
like that was really confusing so and

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.370 
like that was really confusing so and
that's<00:05:00.069> a<00:05:00.160> good<00:05:00.340> point<00:05:00.690> but<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.900> point<00:05:02.199> of<00:05:02.289> the

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
that's a good point but the point of the

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.469 
that's a good point but the point of the
exercise<00:05:03.120> really<00:05:04.120> is<00:05:04.389> not<00:05:04.630> to<00:05:04.960> learn<00:05:05.229> CPR<00:05:06.479> but

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
exercise really is not to learn CPR but

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.809 
exercise really is not to learn CPR but
those<00:05:07.720> other<00:05:07.930> features<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:09.370> when<00:05:09.520> you<00:05:09.639> work

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
those other features that when you work

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.740 
those other features that when you work
on<00:05:09.970> a<00:05:10.030> team<00:05:10.360> can<00:05:10.840> impact<00:05:11.610> outcome<00:05:12.610> even<00:05:13.449> as

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
on a team can impact outcome even as

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.480 
on a team can impact outcome even as
much<00:05:13.990> as<00:05:14.050> epinephrine<00:05:15.009> and<00:05:15.069> good<00:05:15.250> chest

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
much as epinephrine and good chest

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.760 
much as epinephrine and good chest
compressions<00:05:16.090> so<00:05:16.720> when<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.110> look<00:05:17.289> at<00:05:17.440> it<00:05:17.590> like

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
compressions so when you look at it like

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.670 
compressions so when you look at it like
that<00:05:18.330> what<00:05:19.330> were<00:05:19.479> those<00:05:19.659> key<00:05:19.960> features<00:05:20.139> what

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
that what were those key features what

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.379 
that what were those key features what
were<00:05:20.889> those<00:05:21.099> things<00:05:21.460> that<00:05:21.610> you<00:05:21.819> did<00:05:22.120> learn

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
were those things that you did learn

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.629 
were those things that you did learn
that<00:05:22.740> could<00:05:23.740> be<00:05:23.889> as<00:05:23.979> important<00:05:24.550> as

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
that could be as important as

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.300 
that could be as important as
epinephrine<00:05:25.389> I<00:05:25.930> think<00:05:26.830> you<00:05:26.889> get<00:05:27.039> it<00:05:27.130> done<00:05:27.280> a

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
epinephrine I think you get it done a

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:35.339 
epinephrine I think you get it done a
little<00:05:27.490> look<00:05:27.909> as<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.120> team<00:05:28.419> better<00:05:28.659> job<00:05:29.020> not

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:36.899 

and<00:05:35.830> I'd<00:05:35.889> like<00:05:36.039> to<00:05:36.159> see<00:05:36.339> a<00:05:36.520> little<00:05:36.699> bit<00:05:36.819> more

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
and I'd like to see a little bit more

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.510 
and I'd like to see a little bit more
knowledge<00:05:37.689> sharing<00:05:37.960> as<00:05:38.229> well<00:05:38.469> a<00:05:38.740> lot<00:05:39.159> of<00:05:39.279> some

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
knowledge sharing as well a lot of some

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.549 
knowledge sharing as well a lot of some
of<00:05:39.639> the<00:05:39.759> chest<00:05:40.509> compressions<00:05:41.080> we're<00:05:41.199> doing<00:05:41.469> in

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:41.559 
of the chest compressions we're doing in

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:43.829 
of the chest compressions we're doing in
the<00:05:41.619> medications<00:05:42.219> you<00:05:42.369> have<00:05:42.490> given<00:05:42.789> listen<00:05:43.509> so

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:43.839 
the medications you have given listen so

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.970 
the medications you have given listen so
that<00:05:43.990> we<00:05:44.110> can<00:05:44.259> learn<00:05:44.439> during<00:05:45.159> the

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
that we can learn during the

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.800 
that we can learn during the
those<00:05:47.550> two<00:05:47.820> things<00:05:47.970> kind<00:05:48.210> of<00:05:48.330> collide<00:05:48.630> with

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
those two things kind of collide with

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.600 
those two things kind of collide with
each<00:05:48.900> other<00:05:49.080> because<00:05:49.410> for<00:05:49.890> example<00:05:49.950> with<00:05:50.430> the

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
each other because for example with the

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.540 
each other because for example with the
emulator<00:05:51.120> almost<00:05:52.080> no<00:05:52.320> one<00:05:52.590> is<00:05:52.980> really

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
emulator almost no one is really

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.760 
emulator almost no one is really
familiar<00:05:53.760> with<00:05:54.060> that<00:05:54.330> device<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:54.900> so<00:05:55.620> if

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
familiar with that device and so if

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.560 
familiar with that device and so if
there's<00:05:56.010> someone<00:05:56.340> who<00:05:56.460> is<00:05:56.580> familiar<00:05:56.850> and<00:05:57.360> they

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
there's someone who is familiar and they

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.510 
there's someone who is familiar and they
start<00:05:57.870> giving<00:05:58.350> advice<00:05:58.680> on<00:05:58.890> how<00:05:59.010> to<00:05:59.070> use<00:05:59.310> it

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
start giving advice on how to use it

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.180 
start giving advice on how to use it
then<00:06:00.060> to<00:06:00.630> your<00:06:00.780> point<00:06:01.050> they<00:06:01.230> start<00:06:01.470> getting<00:06:02.100> to

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
then to your point they start getting to

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.890 
then to your point they start getting to
be<00:06:02.310> people<00:06:02.730> talking<00:06:03.060> over<00:06:03.300> each<00:06:03.390> other<00:06:03.510> so

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
be people talking over each other so

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.960 
be people talking over each other so
sorting<00:06:04.800> that<00:06:04.950> out<00:06:05.010> is<00:06:05.340> kind<00:06:05.610> of<00:06:05.670> a<00:06:05.790> challenge

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
sorting that out is kind of a challenge

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.470 
sorting that out is kind of a challenge
sometimes<00:06:06.420> maybe<00:06:06.870> if<00:06:07.020> we<00:06:07.200> just<00:06:07.740> took<00:06:07.920> the

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
sometimes maybe if we just took the

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.370 
sometimes maybe if we just took the
communication<00:06:09.480> through<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:09.840> team<00:06:10.080> leader

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
communication through the team leader

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.580 
communication through the team leader
and<00:06:10.650> it's<00:06:11.010> one<00:06:11.220> way<00:06:11.370> to<00:06:11.430> do<00:06:11.640> it<00:06:12.080> so<00:06:13.080> I<00:06:13.110> can<00:06:13.380> see

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
and it's one way to do it so I can see

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:21.010 
and it's one way to do it so I can see
how<00:06:14.780> the<00:06:15.780> way

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.860 

certain<00:06:21.349> procedures
