00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
key building and i'll get to that near

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.310 
key building and i'll get to that near

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
on the map and also how the maps laid

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.860 
on the map and also how the maps laid
out<00:02:40.430> but<00:02:41.430> as<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.330> now<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.660> was<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
out but as you can see now this was a

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.630 
out but as you can see now this was a
really<00:02:43.110> annoying<00:02:43.500> spot<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.099> people<00:02:44.370> like<00:02:44.519> to

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
really annoying spot that people like to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.640 
really annoying spot that people like to
hold<00:02:44.790> down<00:02:44.970> there<00:02:45.870> was<00:02:46.049> always<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.349> two<00:02:46.500> or

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
hold down there was always like two or

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.110 
hold down there was always like two or
three<00:02:46.680> people<00:02:46.920> up<00:02:47.190> here<00:02:47.310> with<00:02:47.459> sniper<00:02:47.670> rifles

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
three people up here with sniper rifles

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.650 
three people up here with sniper rifles
and<00:02:49.080> orgy<00:02:49.530> 11's<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.239> seems<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.630> be

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
and orgy 11's so so that seems to be

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.360 
and orgy 11's so so that seems to be
kind<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.079> camp<00:02:52.319> heavy<00:02:52.560> spot<00:02:52.920> I'm<00:02:53.190> sure

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
kind of a camp heavy spot I'm sure

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.660 
kind of a camp heavy spot I'm sure
people<00:02:53.670> will<00:02:53.760> stop<00:02:54.000> going<00:02:54.299> there<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.569> do<00:02:55.019> time

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
people will stop going there and do time

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.949 
people will stop going there and do time
once<00:02:56.670> people<00:02:57.030> start<00:02:57.239> watching<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.720> really

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
once people start watching it really

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.720 
once people start watching it really

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
that overlooks the be flag by the way

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.750 
that overlooks the be flag by the way
but<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.620> can<00:03:08.040> definitely<00:03:08.130> tell<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.489> it's<00:03:08.670> not

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
but I can definitely tell you it's not

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.160 
but I can definitely tell you it's not
it's<00:03:09.030> not<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.180> good<00:03:09.390> spot<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.630> be<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.110> you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
it's not a good spot to be a so you

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.039 
it's not a good spot to be a so you
don't<00:03:10.380> want<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.560> really<00:03:10.890> hold<00:03:11.069> that<00:03:11.220> down<00:03:11.310> um

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
don't want to really hold that down um

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.280 
don't want to really hold that down um
but<00:03:13.049> yeah<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.569> TDM<00:03:15.569> people<00:03:15.870> like<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.110> stick

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
but yeah so in TDM people like to stick

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.599 
but yeah so in TDM people like to stick
to<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.410> outside<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:16.890> map<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.430> middle

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
to the outside of the map so the middle

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.069 
to the outside of the map so the middle
of<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.730> map<00:03:17.880> isn't<00:03:18.060> as<00:03:18.299> important<00:03:18.750> although

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
of the map isn't as important although

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.750 
of the map isn't as important although
if<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.680> can<00:03:19.799> control<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.280> middle<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.579> map

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
if you can control the middle of the map

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.550 
if you can control the middle of the map
or<00:03:21.000> if<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.600> can<00:03:21.720> show<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:21.900> middle<00:03:22.200> building

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
or if you can show that middle building

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.849 
or if you can show that middle building
it<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.670> going<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.060> give<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.480> lot<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.709> lot

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
it is going to give you a lot of a lot

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.650 
it is going to give you a lot of a lot
of<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.280> lot<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.730> good<00:03:26.819> things<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.299> lot<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.450> easy

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
access to a lot of key points in a map

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.599 
access to a lot of key points in a map
and<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:30.780> mean<00:03:31.500> whenever<00:03:31.709> there's<00:03:32.010> really<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.370> big

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
and I mean whenever there's really a big

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.610 
and I mean whenever there's really a big
middle<00:03:32.850> building<00:03:33.209> like<00:03:33.329> this<00:03:33.510> it's<00:03:34.290> always

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
middle building like this it's always

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.300 
middle building like this it's always
really<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.130> good<00:03:35.220> idea<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.850> run<00:03:36.150> for<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.540> um<00:03:37.310> now

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
really a good idea to run for it um now

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.680 
really a good idea to run for it um now
I'll<00:03:38.459> get<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.760> second<00:03:39.030> level<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.329> second

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
I'll get to the second level in a second

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.009 
I'll get to the second level in a second
but<00:03:40.290> some<00:03:40.590> i<00:03:41.000> think<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.090> map<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.450> awesome<00:03:42.840> so

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
but some i think the map is awesome so

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.590 
but some i think the map is awesome so
it's<00:03:43.109> supposed<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.410> be<00:03:43.560> kind<00:03:43.829> of<00:03:43.920> like<00:03:44.069> a

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
forget what it is like a in area 5051 or

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.379

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
little jump spot but Tmart will really

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.210 
little jump spot but Tmart will really
go<00:04:06.569> over<00:04:06.599> all<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.109> jump<00:04:07.349> spots<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:08.040> look

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
go over all the jump spots so so look

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.129 
go over all the jump spots so so look
for<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.459> annotation<00:04:08.880> his<00:04:09.060> screen<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.810> his

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
to know all those jumps and key spots

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.289 
to know all those jumps and key spots
out<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.400> didn't<00:04:14.609> know<00:04:14.639> if<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:14.880> can<00:04:15.000> jump<00:04:15.150> back

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
it but yeah so um I like this map I

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.380 
it but yeah so um I like this map I
really<00:04:20.340> do<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.609> think<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.030> good<00:04:21.180> map<00:04:21.359> I

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
really do I think this is a good map I

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.460 
really do I think this is a good map I
think<00:04:21.630> they<00:04:21.690> did<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> good<00:04:21.959> job<00:04:22.019> putting<00:04:22.320> it

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
think they did a good job putting it
