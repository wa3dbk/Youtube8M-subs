00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.030 

I'd<00:00:03.720> wanted<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.110> shoot<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.440> water<00:00:04.650> housing

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
I'd wanted to shoot a water housing

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.120 
I'd wanted to shoot a water housing
photo<00:00:05.250> for<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> while<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.750> just<00:00:07.710> like<00:00:07.890> this

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
photo for a while I just like this

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.660 
photo for a while I just like this
photos<00:00:08.880> where<00:00:09.620> like<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.740> surfer<00:00:11.130> will<00:00:11.250> be<00:00:11.400> on

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
photos where like the surfer will be on

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.450 
photos where like the surfer will be on
a<00:00:11.730> wave<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.480> then<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.590> photographer<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:14.219> kind

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
a wave and then the photographer is kind

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.120 
a wave and then the photographer is kind
of<00:00:14.580> halfway<00:00:15.120> like<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.049> line<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
of halfway like on that line of the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.710 
of halfway like on that line of the
water<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.550> can<00:00:17.640> see<00:00:17.789> underneath<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.690> well

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
water so you can see underneath as well

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.470 
water so you can see underneath as well
finding<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.500> spot<00:00:19.859> where<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.340> would<00:00:20.640> work<00:00:20.820> for

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
finding a spot where that would work for

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.830 
finding a spot where that would work for
the<00:00:21.660> trick<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.130> or<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:23.939> lighting<00:00:24.420> being

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the trick and or you know lighting being

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.220 
the trick and or you know lighting being
able<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.050> actually<00:00:25.320> light<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.890> water

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
able to actually light up the water

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.230 
able to actually light up the water
somewhere<00:00:28.230> where<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.650> not<00:00:28.800> too<00:00:29.130> deep<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.849> mean

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
somewhere where it's not too deep I mean

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.970 
somewhere where it's not too deep I mean
there<00:00:30.359> are<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.539> many<00:00:30.630> complicated<00:00:31.410> factors<00:00:31.769> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
there are so many complicated factors to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.370 
there are so many complicated factors to
finding<00:00:32.369> out<00:00:32.489> finding<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.030> spot<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.260> then

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
finding out finding that spot and then

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.430 
finding out finding that spot and then
he<00:00:34.440> thought<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.790> digs<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
he thought of this one and digs in

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.200 
he thought of this one and digs in
building<00:00:37.440> California<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.820> like<00:00:39.030> you

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
building California to you not like you

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.280 
building California to you not like you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
know what we should do that do you have

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.139 
know what we should do that do you have
a<00:00:40.350> trick<00:00:40.530> or<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.040> said<00:00:41.100> yeah<00:00:41.610> I'm<00:00:41.760> down<00:00:41.969> I've

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
a trick or if I said yeah I'm down I've

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.030 
a trick or if I said yeah I'm down I've
always<00:00:42.329> wanted<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.629> eat<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.780> spot<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.890> so

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
you drove down just to try to shoot it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.540 
you drove down just to try to shoot it
and<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> whole<00:00:46.050> time<00:00:46.230> they're<00:00:46.469> thinking<00:00:46.829> like

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.369 

this<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.670> gonna<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:51.030> easy<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this is gonna be easy so I get the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.750 
this is gonna be easy so I get the
camera<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> housing<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.579> some

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
camera in the housing we get some

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.010 
camera in the housing we get some
flashes<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.300> everything<00:00:54.660> sit<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:57.020> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
flashes and everything sit up and to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.139 
flashes and everything sit up and to
skate<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.379> spot<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> put<00:00:59.149> two

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
skate that spot you have to put two

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.779 
skate that spot you have to put two
letters<00:01:00.960> together<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.129> back<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> wall

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
letters together on the back of the wall

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.660 
letters together on the back of the wall
what<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.510> getting<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.870> roll-up<00:01:04.229> from<00:01:04.670> also

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
what was getting the roll-up from also

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.109 
what was getting the roll-up from also
the<00:01:06.680> fountain<00:01:07.680> started<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.250> off<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.909> one

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the fountain started going off and one

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.550 
the fountain started going off and one
of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> fountains

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
of the fountains

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.690 
of the fountains
it<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.009> broken<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:12.930> me<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.280> was<00:01:14.430> aimed

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
it was broken so it was me it was aimed

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.039 
it was broken so it was me it was aimed
right<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.860> runway<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.720> water<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.930> going

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
right at the runway so water was going

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.330 
right at the runway so water was going
off<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.590> was<00:01:19.680> kind<00:01:19.829> of<00:01:19.860> windy<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.130> day<00:01:20.189> so

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
off and it was kind of windy that day so

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.370 
off and it was kind of windy that day so
a<00:01:20.520> little<00:01:20.670> water<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.060> getting<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.390> tiles<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
a little water was getting up tiles the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.100 
a little water was getting up tiles the
runway<00:01:22.680> was<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.000> them<00:01:24.210> was<00:01:24.360> trenching

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
runway was but one of them was trenching

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.410 
runway was but one of them was trenching
the<00:01:25.259> runway<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.549> eventually<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:27.030> figured<00:01:27.330> out

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the runway so eventually we figured out

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.590 
the runway so eventually we figured out
a<00:01:27.450> way<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> block<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.259> was

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
a way to block it was

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.290 
a way to block it was
it's<00:01:29.810> about<00:01:29.990> him<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.740> then<00:01:31.729> I<00:01:31.760> just<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:32.240> just

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
it's about him and then I just I just

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.130 
it's about him and then I just I just
had<00:01:32.510> to<00:01:32.659> use<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.810> t-shirt<00:01:33.320> every<00:01:33.590> time<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.990> use

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
had to use a t-shirt every time to use

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.310 
had to use a t-shirt every time to use
those<00:01:36.350> water<00:01:36.590> housings<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:38.479> make<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.080> that

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
those water housings to make it so that

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.500 
those water housings to make it so that
the<00:01:39.620> water<00:01:39.800> beads<00:01:40.310> off<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.000> front<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.360> them

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
the water beads off of the front of them

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.080 
the water beads off of the front of them
the<00:01:42.260> best<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.830> have<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.070> spit<00:01:43.430> on<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.820> front

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
the best you have to spit on the front

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.940 
the best you have to spit on the front
of<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.510> housing<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:44.960> kind<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.260> kind<00:01:45.710> of<00:01:45.770> rub

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
of the housing and kind of kind of rub

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.370 
of the housing and kind of kind of rub
the<00:01:46.130> port<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:47.150> thing<00:01:47.420> that<00:01:47.600> was<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.020> hardest

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
the port the thing that was the hardest

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.290 
the port the thing that was the hardest
about<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.920> was<00:01:50.050> once<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.229> fountains<00:01:51.710> were<00:01:51.950> on

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
about it was once the fountains were on

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.580 
about it was once the fountains were on
there<00:01:53.300> was<00:01:53.420> spray<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:54.020> was<00:01:54.170> coming<00:01:54.500> and

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
there was spray that was coming and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.560 
there was spray that was coming and
getting<00:01:54.890> on<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.100> front<00:01:55.310> port<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.119> housing

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
getting on the front port of the housing

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.140 
getting on the front port of the housing
so<00:01:57.259> I<00:01:57.290> couldn't<00:01:57.680> just<00:01:57.800> hold<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.310> camera<00:01:58.520> there

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
so I couldn't just hold the camera there

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.480 
so I couldn't just hold the camera there
and<00:01:59.330> wait<00:01:59.509> for<00:01:59.660> him<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.869> come<00:02:00.400> because<00:02:01.400> it

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
and wait for him to come because it

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.249 
and wait for him to come because it
would<00:02:01.610> get<00:02:01.700> water<00:02:02.030> all<00:02:02.210> over<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.750> then<00:02:02.960> you

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
would get water all over it and then you

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.719 
would get water all over it and then you
know<00:02:03.440> there<00:02:03.590> were<00:02:03.649> big<00:02:03.770> drops<00:02:04.190> of<00:02:04.340> water<00:02:04.550> in

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
know there were big drops of water in

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.779 
know there were big drops of water in
front<00:02:04.940> of<00:02:05.060> his<00:02:06.050> body<00:02:06.289> on<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.590> photo<00:02:06.890> so<00:02:07.640> each

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
front of his body on the photo so each

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.699 
front of his body on the photo so each
time<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.270> went<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.690> shoot<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:08.959> photo<00:02:09.170> I<00:02:09.470> would<00:02:09.619> be

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
time I went to shoot a photo I would be

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.300 
time I went to shoot a photo I would be
looking<00:02:10.039> at<00:02:10.130> him<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.520> if<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.759> saw<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.450> he<00:02:11.630> was

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
looking at him and if I saw that he was

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.760 
looking at him and if I saw that he was
going<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.550> go<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:14.239> would<00:02:15.140> pull<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.470> camera<00:02:15.680> out

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
going to go I would pull the camera out

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.270 
going to go I would pull the camera out
spit<00:02:16.489> on<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.880> housing<00:02:17.360> rub<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.140> lens<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:19.160> get

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
spit on the housing rub the lens to get

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.220 
spit on the housing rub the lens to get
a<00:02:19.310> nice<00:02:19.520> little<00:02:19.730> saliva<00:02:20.390> coating<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.580> would<00:02:23.230> put

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
a nice little saliva coating I would put

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.990 
a nice little saliva coating I would put
it<00:02:24.320> back<00:02:24.470> in<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.739> water<00:02:24.920> then<00:02:25.580> when<00:02:25.790> he<00:02:25.910> was

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.720 
it back in the water then when he was
going<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.300> go<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.750> would<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:27.140> pull<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.560> out

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
going to go I would just pull it out

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.020 
going to go I would just pull it out
line<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.940> photo<00:02:29.180> up<00:02:29.450> through<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.170> eyepiece

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
line the photo up through the eyepiece

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.220 
line the photo up through the eyepiece
with<00:02:32.030> my<00:02:32.150> head<00:02:32.330> like<00:02:32.480> right<00:02:32.570> on<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.810> level<00:02:33.170> of

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
with my head like right on the level of

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.110 
with my head like right on the level of
the<00:02:33.320> water<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.709> then<00:02:34.070> look<00:02:34.640> out<00:02:34.790> there<00:02:34.970> them

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
the water and then look out there them

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.770 
the water and then look out there them
and<00:02:35.390> shoot<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.959> when<00:02:36.230> he<00:02:36.350> went<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:38.390> sometimes

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
and shoot it when he went and sometimes

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.690 
and shoot it when he went and sometimes
I<00:02:38.870> didn't<00:02:39.080> time<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.470> well<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.010> so<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.400> like

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
I didn't time that well and so I like

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.180 
I didn't time that well and so I like
wasn't<00:02:41.120> ready<00:02:41.330> or<00:02:41.660> there<00:02:42.260> was<00:02:42.380> spray<00:02:42.739> all<00:02:42.950> over

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
wasn't ready or there was spray all over

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.720 
wasn't ready or there was spray all over
the<00:02:43.280> lens<00:02:43.489> and<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.269> was<00:02:44.420> kind<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.840> nightmare

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.590 

I<00:02:50.790> think<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.420> happening

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
I think it happening

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.870 
I think it happening
I<00:02:53.660> thought<00:02:54.410> ahead<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:54.950> got<00:02:55.220> like<00:02:55.400> an<00:02:55.520> extra

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
I thought ahead to I got like an extra

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.390 
I thought ahead to I got like an extra
set<00:02:56.150> up<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.420> was<00:02:56.570> not

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.220 

so<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.459> had<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.819> set<00:03:03.090> up<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:04.700> don't<00:03:05.700> know<00:03:05.819> how

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
so I had to set up so I don't know how

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.869 
so I had to set up so I don't know how
such<00:03:07.230> facts<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.620> pleaded<00:03:07.920> not<00:03:08.099> being<00:03:08.310> too<00:03:08.550> but<00:03:08.819> I

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
such facts I pleaded not being too but I

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.729 
such facts I pleaded not being too but I
wasn't<00:03:09.060> sure<00:03:09.360> which<00:03:09.540> one<00:03:09.810> do<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.470> think<00:03:10.530> about

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
wasn't sure which one do you think about

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.119 
wasn't sure which one do you think about
that<00:03:10.860> spot<00:03:11.280> for<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.610> wall<00:03:11.940> there<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:13.500> kind

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
that spot for the wall there so I kind

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.500 
that spot for the wall there so I kind
of<00:03:14.250> figured<00:03:14.580> out<00:03:14.670> how<00:03:14.879> to<00:03:14.910> make<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.330> angle

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
of figured out how to make the angle

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.300 
of figured out how to make the angle
first<00:03:15.900> which<00:03:16.200> they<00:03:16.470> aware<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.010> could<00:03:17.190> just

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
first which they aware so I could just

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.210 
first which they aware so I could just
avoid<00:03:18.030> hitting<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.629> wall<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.830> then<00:03:19.950> after

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
avoid hitting that wall but then after

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.710 
avoid hitting that wall but then after
the<00:03:20.340> switch<00:03:20.519> tre<00:03:20.700> happened<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.180> didn't<00:03:21.599> even

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
the switch tre happened it didn't even

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.270 
the switch tre happened it didn't even
feel<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:21.989> we've<00:03:22.290> had<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.470> speed<00:03:22.799> session<00:03:23.190> you
