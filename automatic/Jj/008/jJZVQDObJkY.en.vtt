00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
some time on that cut me a little bit of

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.550 
some time on that cut me a little bit of
slack<00:02:39.850> one<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.840> other<00:02:40.990> reasons<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.380> don't

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
day a week thing is because I feel like

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.580 
day a week thing is because I feel like
sometimes<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.270> does<00:02:46.480> sacrifice<00:02:47.110> having

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
sometimes that does sacrifice having

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.050 
sometimes that does sacrifice having
time<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:47.830> do<00:02:48.160> some<00:02:48.340> really<00:02:48.520> good<00:02:48.670> quality

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
time to do some really good quality

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.110 
time to do some really good quality
videos<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.560> ecig<00:02:50.920> 101<00:02:51.520> when<00:02:51.760> we<00:02:51.880> went<00:02:52.060> to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
videos like the ecig 101 when we went to

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.430 
videos like the ecig 101 when we went to
school<00:02:52.480> or<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.620> vaping<00:02:54.160> bad<00:02:54.370> videos<00:02:54.880> they

those<00:02:56.440> type<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.710> videos<00:02:57.130> can<00:02:57.370> take<00:02:57.550> up<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.760> like

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
those type of videos can take up to like

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.060 
those type of videos can take up to like
12<00:02:58.300> hours<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:59.020> do<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.290> entire<00:02:59.560> thing<00:02:59.620> from

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070

performing each of the parts and then

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.860 
performing each of the parts and then
putting<00:03:03.670> everything<00:03:03.970> together<00:03:04.210> you<00:03:04.690> know<00:03:04.840> and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
all the editing that's involved so it's

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.140 
all the editing that's involved so it's
not<00:03:07.810> like<00:03:07.960> I've<00:03:08.050> got<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.230> crew<00:03:08.500> here<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.970> of

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
not like I've got a crew here and of

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
course everybody has expectations on

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.680 
course everybody has expectations on
them<00:03:12.280> I've<00:03:12.670> always<00:03:12.880> felt<00:03:13.120> like<00:03:13.270> that's<00:03:13.390> one<00:03:13.600> of

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
them I've always felt like that's one of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.360 
them I've always felt like that's one of
the<00:03:13.750> reasons<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.380> never<00:03:14.590> liked<00:03:14.770> to<00:03:14.860> hang<00:03:15.040> on<00:03:15.220> to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
as well although that can be difficult

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.070 
as well although that can be difficult
sometimes<00:04:28.009> to<00:04:28.520> because<00:04:29.000> I'm<00:04:29.150> not<00:04:29.389> a<00:04:29.449> comedian

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080

sometimes to because I'm not a comedian
you<00:04:30.919> know<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.370> so<00:04:31.460> it's<00:04:31.610> not<00:04:31.729> something<00:04:32.060> that

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
you know and so it's not something that

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.939 
you know and so it's not something that
I<00:04:32.389> can<00:04:32.569> always<00:04:32.810> just<00:04:33.259> have<00:04:33.470> something<00:04:33.830> ready

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
I can always just have something ready

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.180 
I can always just have something ready
to<00:04:34.220> get<00:04:34.370> up<00:04:34.490> there<00:04:34.669> and<00:04:34.729> do<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:34.970> comic<00:04:35.660> bit

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
to get up there and do a comic bit

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.230 
to get up there and do a comic bit
generally<00:04:37.190> it's<00:04:37.340> just<00:04:37.580> when<00:04:37.759> I<00:04:37.789> think<00:04:37.940> of

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
generally it's just when I think of

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.150 
generally it's just when I think of
something<00:04:38.449> you<00:04:38.660> know<00:04:38.780> during<00:04:39.139> the<00:04:39.410> week<00:04:39.620> or<00:04:39.979> if

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
something you know during the week or if

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.620 
something you know during the week or if
I'm<00:04:40.310> reading<00:04:40.550> comments<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.360> something

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
I'm reading comments and something

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.540 
I'm reading comments and something
strikes<00:04:41.900> me<00:04:42.110> as<00:04:42.199> funny<00:04:42.229> then<00:04:43.099> there<00:04:43.430> we<00:04:43.580> go<00:04:45.550> so

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
strikes me as funny then there we go so

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.189 
strikes me as funny then there we go so
I<00:04:46.580> guess<00:04:46.819> my<00:04:46.849> point<00:04:47.270> is<00:04:47.539> and<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:47.900> matter<00:04:48.080> how

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
I guess my point is and I matter how

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.200 
I guess my point is and I matter how
hard<00:04:48.440> it<00:04:48.530> is<00:04:48.650> in<00:04:48.860> life<00:04:49.069> you<00:04:49.669> need<00:04:49.819> to<00:04:49.970> try<00:04:50.150> to

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
hard it is in life you need to try to

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.120 
hard it is in life you need to try to
remain<00:04:50.539> true<00:04:50.810> to<00:04:50.840> yourself<00:04:51.440> because<00:04:51.770> that's

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
remain true to yourself because that's

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.990 
remain true to yourself because that's
