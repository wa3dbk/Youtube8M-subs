00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 french theme we started yes how 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.130
 you understand today we will cook 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.679
 mashed parisian in french style as well 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.420
 we will prepare chicken and sauce for it 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.700
 Roquefort 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.490
 means after such a dish your betrothed 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.949
 come to you disguised 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.470
 will fall on your knee and tell you mary anne and 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.080
 believe really gorgeous 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.320
 the dish is very simple performed by course 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.920
 will take a little time and pollute 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.020
 several plates and pots but it 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.480
 worth it so let's try and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.450
 sacrifice our time to start we 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.450
 brew eat potatoes and so water I already 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.489
 put chopped potatoes into cubes 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.030
 so that we have it faster 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.030
 opened 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.280
 until our potatoes are prepared we need 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.780
 boil another pot of water and 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.550
 also cook another bowl with 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.190
 ice water i.e. cold water and 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.670
 ice me ran out of ice forms 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.470
 so I prepare ice like this 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.500
 I freeze water in plastic 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.500
 cups 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.050
 the next step we need 3 4 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:41.270
 sprig of basil basil growing on my 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.180
 windowsill's happened here is 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.700
 approximate amount of basil and so 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.700
 weakly boiling water I took my basil 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.810
 and count to ten 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.560
 or 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.930
 56 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.930
 8 9 10 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:15.360
 so here we take out the basil and omit 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.400
 in icy water ready basil further to us 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.360
 will need parmesan cheese and we have it 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.360
 grated 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.380
 add cream to the pan 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.980
 heated up quite lightly and on 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.980
 slow fire and fall asleep there parmesan 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.200
 Basil folded in a blender and poured 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:52.900
 there cream with parmesan 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:03:00.730
 beat when the potato reached 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:02.530
 readiness drain hot water well here 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.540
 potatoes are very soft, that is, you can 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:12.070
 already practically turn it into a mash 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:14.819
 slightly remember and add cream sauce 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.819
 Parmesan and 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:27.040

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.040
 in the present air tours 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.000
 close the finished mashed potatoes and cover 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.890
 a towel and so that it does not cool us 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.090
 leave everything on the stove doing the sauce 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:55.230
 for the sauce we need 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.390
 so where is my butter sauce for us 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.090

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.810
 basil its remains more truly cheese 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.180
 Roquefort 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.849
 if roquefort cheese no replace it 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:12.590
 gorgonzola or some other 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:18.389
 very very fragrant cheese but 80 grams and 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:25.700
 butter as much all this we 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.700
 fold the blender and whisk 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.240
 Okay, you should get this paste 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:49.990

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.850
 use ordinary foil or just 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.350
 ordinary baking pan is created 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.820

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:26.650

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.970

 rosemary from a jar which is sold in 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.600
