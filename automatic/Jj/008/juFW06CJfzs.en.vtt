00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.299 

so<00:00:08.519> we<00:00:08.760> needed<00:00:09.120> something<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:10.130> grow<00:00:11.130> potatoes

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
so we needed something to grow potatoes

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.930 
so we needed something to grow potatoes
I<00:00:12.590> didn't<00:00:13.590> think<00:00:13.679> about<00:00:13.830> tires<00:00:14.250> but<00:00:14.759> they

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
I didn't think about tires but they

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.410 
I didn't think about tires but they
ended<00:00:15.240> up<00:00:15.360> being<00:00:15.660> apparently<00:00:16.230> poisonous<00:00:16.970> so<00:00:17.970> I

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
ended up being apparently poisonous so I

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.920 
ended up being apparently poisonous so I
thought<00:00:18.690> I'd<00:00:18.990> make<00:00:19.250> some<00:00:20.250> form<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.520> drum<00:00:20.930> so

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
thought I'd make some form of drum so

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.640 
thought I'd make some form of drum so
this<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.140> 122<00:00:23.070> litre<00:00:23.430> drum<00:00:24.500> it's<00:00:25.500> actually

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
this is 122 litre drum it's actually

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.710 
this is 122 litre drum it's actually
they've<00:00:26.010> not<00:00:26.220> usually<00:00:26.820> used<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.150> coke<00:00:27.510> syrup

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
they've not usually used for coke syrup

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.589 
they've not usually used for coke syrup
able<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.769> add<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> disposal<00:00:29.519> shop<00:00:29.730> for<00:00:29.970> about<00:00:30.029> 30

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
out the bottom so I've tried a few

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.770 
out the bottom so I've tried a few
things<00:00:46.050> I've<00:00:46.500> tried<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.430> Hotwire<00:00:47.879> all<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
things I've tried you Hotwire all the

things I've tried you Hotwire all the
rest<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.140> cut<00:00:49.320> into<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.770> hot<00:00:50.670> wire<00:00:50.850> sort<00:00:51.180> of

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
rest to cut into this hot wire sort of

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.930 
rest to cut into this hot wire sort of
worth<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.930> overloaded<00:00:52.820> wasn't<00:00:53.820> any

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
worth it just that overloaded wasn't any

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.350 
worth it just that overloaded wasn't any
good<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.629> I've<00:00:54.989> come<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.230> next<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.280> friend<00:00:56.610> he

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360

said<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.930> jigsaw<00:00:58.410> might<00:00:58.559> work<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.399> i'm

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
said that a jigsaw might work so i'm

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.880 
said that a jigsaw might work so i'm
actually<00:00:59.579> using<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.120> six<00:01:00.719> blade<00:01:01.430> jigsaw<00:01:02.430> piece

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
actually using a six blade jigsaw piece

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
actually using a six blade jigsaw piece
yeah<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.180> pretty<00:01:06.479> slow<00:01:06.840> going

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.310 

again<00:01:22.840> after<00:01:23.560> cutting<00:01:23.860> left<00:01:24.460> we'd<00:01:24.670> sort<00:01:24.940> of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
again after cutting left we'd sort of

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.630 
again after cutting left we'd sort of
sharpen<00:01:26.320> day<00:01:26.830> looking<00:01:27.250> edges<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:30.280> insane

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
sharpen day looking edges just insane

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.940 
sharpen day looking edges just insane
people<00:01:30.820> do<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.990> else<00:01:35.140> is<00:01:35.380> coming<00:01:35.770> these

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
people do what else is coming these

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.690 
people do what else is coming these
turns<00:01:36.940> out<00:01:37.120> that<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:38.440> lid<00:01:38.680> itself<00:01:39.070> has<00:01:39.400> her

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
turns out that the lid itself has her

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.610 
turns out that the lid itself has her
spit<00:01:40.270> sticker<00:01:40.540> than<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.110> actual<00:01:41.230> inside

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
spit sticker than the actual inside

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.840 
spit sticker than the actual inside
walls<00:01:41.860> as<00:01:42.790> you<00:01:43.060> see<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.270> long<00:01:43.560> one<00:01:44.560> here<00:01:44.890> it's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
walls as you see a long one here it's

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.450 
walls as you see a long one here it's
really<00:01:46.000> thick<00:01:46.390> look<00:01:47.350> punch<00:01:47.650> actually<00:01:48.010> and<00:01:48.370> so

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
really thick look punch actually and so

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.830 
really thick look punch actually and so
actually<00:01:48.700> got<00:01:48.790> first<00:01:49.030> down<00:01:49.210> at<00:01:49.360> three<00:01:49.510> lift<00:01:49.690> in

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
actually got first down at three lift in

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.690 
actually got first down at three lift in
it's<00:01:50.470> getting<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.770> bit<00:01:50.800> dark<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:51.370> hopefully

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
it's getting a bit dark so hopefully

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.520 
it's getting a bit dark so hopefully
video<00:01:52.360> quality<00:01:52.600> isn't<00:01:53.080> too<00:01:53.230> bad<00:01:53.440> but<00:01:54.000> I've

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
video quality isn't too bad but I've

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.660

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
here like along the edges here I got a

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.090 
here like along the edges here I got a
bit<00:02:01.720> worried<00:02:01.930> because<00:02:02.140> because<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:02.770> see<00:02:02.920> here

the<00:02:05.950> slides<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:08.350> thought<00:02:08.530> well<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:09.130> know

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
the slides and I thought well you know

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.130 
the slides and I thought well you know
with<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.460> my<00:02:09.670> dress<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.450> don't<00:02:10.899> really

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
with that my dress and I don't really

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.250 
with that my dress and I don't really
want<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.560> split<00:02:12.070> open<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.660> I'm<00:02:13.750> doing<00:02:13.870> instead

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
want to split open so I'm doing instead

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.370 
want to split open so I'm doing instead
is<00:02:14.320> actually<00:02:14.710> going<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.890> cut<00:02:15.100> just<00:02:15.760> spit<00:02:15.970> out

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
is actually going to cut just spit out

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.960 
is actually going to cut just spit out
if<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.500> make<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.739> bit<00:02:17.950> harder<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.400> get<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> stuff

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
if I make a bit harder to get the stuff

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.140 
if I make a bit harder to get the stuff
out<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.660> there's<00:02:20.470> my<00:02:20.820> whole<00:02:21.820> what<00:02:22.030> I've<00:02:22.120> just

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
out but there's my whole what I've just

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.780 
out but there's my whole what I've just
rude<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:23.290> then<00:02:23.440> had<00:02:23.920> jigsaw<00:02:24.280> go<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.580> there<00:02:24.730> and

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
rude so then had jigsaw go in there and

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.880 
rude so then had jigsaw go in there and
hopefully<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.989> isn't<00:02:26.200> too<00:02:26.350> sharp<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.830> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
hopefully this isn't too sharp of the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.510 
hopefully this isn't too sharp of the
circle<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.550> do<00:02:27.670> with<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:30.750> okay<00:02:31.750> it's<00:02:32.110> done

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
circle to do with it okay it's done

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:43.119 
circle to do with it okay it's done
looks<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.580> bit<00:02:33.670> like<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.880> toilet<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.450> that

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.080 

we<00:02:44.129> go<00:02:44.310> have<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> planter<00:02:45.540> done<00:02:46.610> okay<00:02:47.610> these<00:02:47.819> are

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
we go have a planter done okay these are

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.110 
we go have a planter done okay these are
our<00:02:48.209> seed<00:02:48.629> potatoes<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:50.340> put<00:02:50.549> in<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.730> box<00:02:50.879> for

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
our seed potatoes and put in a box for

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.100 
our seed potatoes and put in a box for
all<00:02:52.370> that's<00:02:53.370> cool<00:02:53.670> what<00:02:54.450> potatoes<00:02:54.690> for<00:02:54.989> me<00:02:55.080> I

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
all that's cool what potatoes for me I

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.720 
all that's cool what potatoes for me I
guess<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.250> upside<00:02:59.580> down

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
guess and this is the upside down

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.420 
guess and this is the upside down
version<00:03:00.120> I've<00:03:00.569> put<00:03:00.629> holes<00:03:01.200> on<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.980> outside<00:03:02.400> of

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
version I've put holes on the outside of

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.990 
version I've put holes on the outside of
this<00:03:03.140> just<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.379> bit<00:03:04.530> worried<00:03:04.799> about<00:03:05.010> drainage

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
this just a bit worried about drainage

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.289 
this just a bit worried about drainage
and<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:06.480> forth<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.890> um<00:03:08.430> guess<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.000> next<00:03:09.120> step

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
and so forth so um guess the next step

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.410 
and so forth so um guess the next step
is<00:03:09.659> to<00:03:09.690> start<00:03:10.650> planting<00:03:11.129> them<00:03:11.280> we've<00:03:11.849> chosen<00:03:12.209> a

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
is to start planting them we've chosen a

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.130 
is to start planting them we've chosen a
nice<00:03:12.599> sunny<00:03:12.959> spot<00:03:13.079> for<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.069> potatoes<00:03:15.140> now

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
nice sunny spot for the potatoes now

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.770 
nice sunny spot for the potatoes now
preferably<00:03:16.980> down<00:03:17.280> some<00:03:17.549> with<00:03:17.819> weeds<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.750> a

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
preferably down some with weeds is it a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.140 
preferably down some with weeds is it a
lot<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.109> weed<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.700> what<00:03:20.819> we're<00:03:20.940> gonna<00:03:21.030> do

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
lot of weed and so what we're gonna do

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.960 
lot of weed and so what we're gonna do
is<00:03:21.239> we're<00:03:21.299> going<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.480> put<00:03:21.629> down<00:03:21.810> newspaper

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
is we're going to put down newspaper

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.059 
is we're going to put down newspaper
underneath<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.120> pocket<00:03:24.980> sprinkle<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.040> with

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
underneath the pocket sprinkle it with

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.830 
underneath the pocket sprinkle it with
water<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.549> starts<00:03:26.849> degrading<00:03:27.060> pretty<00:03:27.720> much

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
water so it starts degrading pretty much

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.949 
water so it starts degrading pretty much
straight<00:03:28.200> away<00:03:29.060> ideally<00:03:30.060> don't<00:03:30.390> want<00:03:30.690> the

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
centimeters in there some are there and

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.840 
centimeters in there some are there and
put<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.680> potatoes<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.430> then<00:04:14.610> put<00:04:14.820> another

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.819 
put the potatoes in and then put another
20<00:04:15.360> yards<00:04:15.630> centimeters<00:04:16.170> above<00:04:16.290> them<00:04:16.500> right

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
20 yards centimeters above them right

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.650 
20 yards centimeters above them right
here<00:04:16.859> we<00:04:17.130> go<00:04:17.310> I've<00:04:18.239> planted<00:04:18.690> 8<00:04:19.500> 45<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.850> 448

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
here we go I've planted 8 45 is a 448

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.610 
here we go I've planted 8 45 is a 448
yep<00:04:22.910> it<00:04:23.910> might<00:04:24.270> be<00:04:24.540> too<00:04:24.780> many<00:04:24.930> as<00:04:25.170> you<00:04:25.350> see<00:04:25.470> that

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
yep it might be too many as you see that

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.330 
yep it might be too many as you see that
pretty<00:04:25.830> actually<00:04:26.400> growing<00:04:26.730> it's<00:04:27.030> crazy<00:04:27.360> but

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
pretty actually growing it's crazy but

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.440 
pretty actually growing it's crazy but
so<00:04:29.340> I'm<00:04:29.460> just<00:04:29.640> going<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.880> give<00:04:30.180> them<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.330> quick

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
going to put more of the potting mix and

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.470 
going to put more of the potting mix and
so<00:04:44.100> forth<00:04:44.370> over<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.850> they're<00:04:45.030> pretty<00:04:45.450> much

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
so forth over to they're pretty much

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.530 
so forth over to they're pretty much
covered<00:04:45.980> that's<00:04:46.980> all<00:04:47.100> there<00:04:47.190> is<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:47.540> you

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
covered that's all there is to it you

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.770 
covered that's all there is to it you
don't<00:04:48.840> want<00:04:49.050> some<00:04:49.230> water<00:04:49.410> think<00:04:50.120> young<00:04:52.760> so<00:04:53.780> now

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
don't want some water think young so now

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.960 
don't want some water think young so now
i've<00:04:54.930> covered<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.440> potatoes<00:04:55.890> it<00:04:56.730> didn't

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
i've covered the potatoes it didn't

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.030 
i've covered the potatoes it didn't
quite<00:04:57.090> put<00:04:57.390> as<00:04:57.510> much<00:04:57.690> as<00:04:57.930> I<00:04:58.080> think<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.860> should

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
quite put as much as I think you should

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
put over it about 20 centimeters just

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.480
