00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.830
 related to beats audio the brand of helmets 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.959
 the dr dre the windows phone of htc 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.700
 are so certified bits with an effort 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.260
 all particular was carried high

 built-in speakers on smartphones

 these two novelties of htc will be 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.120
 available in November and there is no 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.120
 the moment no price announced 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.250
 at the same time as the new iphone of the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.600
 from apple we are now entitled 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.730
 every year a beautiful comparative pub 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.660
 filled with humor or not for the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.890
 Samsung smartphones 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.990
 she finally arrived two days 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.430
 before the release of the iphone 5 once 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.810
 moreover samsung does not take gloves 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.490
 to disassemble his competitor for 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.290
 the action is always in the same 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.120
 decor a queues in front of a 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.340
 store that looks furiously like a 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.320
 apple store or will scroll as per 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.209
 chance of users of galaxy s iii 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.800
 they will fill the eyes with the apple 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.390
 addicts raving about the 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.760
 fact that the headphone jack of an iphone 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.860
 or down the screen is larger 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.230
 or that it is equipped with a new 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.700
 connection port the lightning as 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.620
 last year samsung explains us 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.630
 implicitly that the brand new iphone 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.430
 is completely overwhelmed even before 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.110
 to be released and small novelty this 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.450
 year the Korean clearly has us 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.070
 make it clear that the iphone is for 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.510
 the old ones but we can still get 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.880
 ask what is the real impact 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.230
 on consumers and in any case that 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.180
 gets drunk shows clearly that he has 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.530
 need apple to communicate because 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.030
 if there was no iphone 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.310
 we would never have talked so much about 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.989
 samsung these days the question of the day 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.310
 it comes from manon pieces that we 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.410
 ask what are the novelties of 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.390
 the iphone 5 not present on the mac ipod 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.709
 touch good question but no because it's 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.489
 true that both devices have a lot 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.920
 points in common 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.720
 the new screen retina 4 inches syria the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.310
 video in full hd the panorama function the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.810
 bluetooth the new headphones and the 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.100
 new lightning connector 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.320
 the difference will therefore be at the level 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.549
 of the processor the ipod touch is a lot 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.320
 less powerful since it inherits from to 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.180
 five processors that equip and 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.620
 the iphone 4s released in 2011 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.360
 it is less powerful but also less 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.680
 greedy and so he will have a better 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.989
 autonomy than the iphone 5 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.790
 finally the shell is different iphone 5 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.100
 is made up of an ultra lignol 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.780
 resistant new generation a lot 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.180
 less fragile than that of iphone 4 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.070
 while the ipod touch has a rating 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.450
 did I did not have any more classic but 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.790
 it has the advantage of being available in several 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.560
 colors and then finally I think I do not 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.090
 not take it if you can use skype 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.190
 imessage to talk to your friends or 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.090
 your girlfriends you will not be able to call 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.650
 with the ipod touch 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.820
 news is over for today 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.530
 I remind you that you have 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.090
 currently pronouns on our 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.890
 t-shirt shop for a few 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.669
 days we meet tomorrow for the 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.960
 weekend flash 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.960
 hi to all and have a good day
