in<00:00:03.620> this<00:00:04.620> short<00:00:04.680> video<00:00:05.130> tutorial<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.509> will

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
in this short video tutorial we will

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.080 
in this short video tutorial we will
first<00:00:06.930> create<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.379> simple<00:00:07.770> cube<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.550> Google

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
first create a simple cube and Google

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.450 
first create a simple cube and Google
Sketchup<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.809> then<00:00:10.290> bring<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.800> into<00:00:10.980> 3d

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
Sketchup and then bring it into 3d

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.079 
Sketchup and then bring it into 3d
exchange<00:00:11.910> for<00:00:12.300> or<00:00:12.570> repurposing<00:00:13.849> the<00:00:14.849> first

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
exchange for or repurposing the first

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.710 
exchange for or repurposing the first
thing<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:16.139> open<00:00:16.379> Google<00:00:16.859> Sketchup

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
thing we do is open Google Sketchup

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.990 
thing we do is open Google Sketchup
inside<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:19.350> will<00:00:19.529> create<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> square<00:00:20.400> base<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
inside we will create a square base and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.570 
inside we will create a square base and
then<00:00:21.300> extruded<00:00:21.869> upwards<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.800> create<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> cube

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
then extruded upwards to create a cube

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.630 
then extruded upwards to create a cube
we<00:00:24.539> will<00:00:24.720> also<00:00:24.990> delete<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.619> top<00:00:25.859> part<00:00:26.189> in

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
we will also delete the top part in

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.670 
we will also delete the top part in
order<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.060> see<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> inner<00:00:27.630> texture<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
order to see the inner texture of the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.799 
order to see the inner texture of the
object<00:00:31.130> once<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.309> cube<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.700> completed<00:00:33.270> we

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
object once the cube is completed we

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.680 
object once the cube is completed we
save<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.469> import<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.430> into<00:00:35.550> 3d<00:00:36.210> exchange

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
save it and import it into 3d exchange

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:50.960 
save it and import it into 3d exchange
for

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.630 

now<00:00:51.630> we<00:00:51.690> drag<00:00:52.200> and<00:00:52.380> drop<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> map<00:00:52.950> image<00:00:53.310> onto

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
now we drag and drop a map image onto

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.080 
now we drag and drop a map image onto
the<00:00:53.940> diffuse<00:00:54.360> channel<00:00:54.810> of<00:00:54.990> the<00:00:55.110> cube<00:00:55.670> here<00:00:56.670> we

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the diffuse channel of the cube here we

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.450 
the diffuse channel of the cube here we
notice<00:00:57.450> of<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> texture<00:00:58.140> seems<00:00:58.440> grainy<00:00:58.800> just

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
notice of the texture seems grainy just

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.090 
notice of the texture seems grainy just
like<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.640> single<00:00:59.970> color<00:01:00.360> map<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.740> because

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
like a single color map this is because

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.520 
like a single color map this is because
the<00:01:02.250> tiling<00:01:02.700> size<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.180> different<00:01:03.660> this

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the tiling size is different this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.530 
the tiling size is different this
happens<00:01:04.980> when<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.220> create<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> phasing<00:01:06.240> Google

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
happens when you create a phasing Google

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
happens when you create a phasing Google

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
Sketchup without giving a texture

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
Google Sketchup the default tiling

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.950 
Google Sketchup the default tiling

a texture inside 3d exchange for it will

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.960 
a texture inside 3d exchange for it will
mimic<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.380> original<00:01:19.830> high<00:01:20.100> value<00:01:20.550> of<00:01:20.760> the

mimic the original high value of the

mimic the original high value of the
tiling<00:01:22.010> to<00:01:23.010> correct<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:24.270> open<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
tiling to correct this just open the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.960 
tiling to correct this just open the
material<00:01:24.900> channel<00:01:25.680> section<00:01:25.920> where<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.760> have

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
material channel section where you have

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.410 
material channel section where you have
the<00:01:27.119> diffuse<00:01:27.540> map<00:01:27.890> then<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.550> increase<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the diffuse map then just increase the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.600 
the diffuse map then just increase the
tiling<00:01:30.990> until<00:01:31.410> you<00:01:31.560> reach<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.800> proportion

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
tiling until you reach the proportion

00:01:32.610 --> 00:02:04.080 
tiling until you reach the proportion
that<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.150> are<00:01:33.270> looking<00:01:33.660> for

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.410 

later<00:02:04.719> we<00:02:05.320> also<00:02:05.530> add<00:02:05.890> image<00:02:06.399> maps<00:02:06.700> for<00:02:07.299> the

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
later we also add image maps for the

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
later we also add image maps for the
opacity<00:02:07.719> and<00:02:08.200> bump<00:02:08.560> channels<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:10.119> i<00:02:10.810> choose<00:02:11.170> to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
opacity and bump channels if i choose to

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.770 
opacity and bump channels if i choose to
offset<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.099> diffuse<00:02:12.550> map<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.360> will<00:02:13.510> notice

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
offset the diffuse map you will notice

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.509 
offset the diffuse map you will notice
how<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.260> will<00:02:14.440> lose<00:02:14.680> sync<00:02:15.040> with<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.370> other

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
how it will lose sync with the other

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.790 
how it will lose sync with the other
material<00:02:16.209> channels<00:02:16.599> such<00:02:17.019> as<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.260> path<00:02:17.560> city
