00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.910
 I usually hire but do the same thing 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.979
 simply a compilation the games 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.600
 they are mostly to play it 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.909
 physically in a 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.310
 a computer although there is also one 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.520
 which is for the psp for devices 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.040
 mobile and also others that does not 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.159
 missing in the company of a person 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.290
 but to play online so 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.070

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.220

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.299
 When we recap, we are all 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.039
 focused to make them juices 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.880
 cooperative ballet cooperative games 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.130
 you can play alone too if you want 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.679
 of course but they also have the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.600
 modality of playing with another person by 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.710
 that I decided to put this list of games 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.190
 today in valentines are about 41 more or 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.619
 less but with issues that is likely and 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.970
 if it is happening other new ones that I 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.380
 has forgotten a few I'm going to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.750

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.130
 anyone 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.350
 the fact that normally 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.940
 friendships are for when one is 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.980
 going well but also when one 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.750

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.090

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.340
