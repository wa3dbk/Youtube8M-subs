00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hi comrades how are you confident that 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.589
 today you are fucking mother country because 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.380
 I bring you another new episode of crazy 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.389
 patrols in 5 minutes always for 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.429
 drive a tank in conquest and power 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.710
 split the enemy's eye but we can 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.800
 get more out of the vehicles 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.199
 with a patrol the armored patrol 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.269
 the ingredients for this patrol are 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.460
 the next we need a tank or 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.380
 a vc guide in which they have to be 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.210
 two members of the patrol a support 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.219
 as a driver and an engineer as 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.410
 co-pilot with the vehicle's soft plan 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.480
 to designate targets by laser in addition 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.820
 personalization of the vehicle as much as 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.070
 part of the driver and the co-pilot is a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.600
 choice that it is imperative that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.550
 this engineer has the tool 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 repair and it is advisable to take a 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.870
 anti-vehicle weapon the three members 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.510
 remaining of the patrol will be out 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.730
 of the vehicle and accompany it wherever 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.829
 it would be best to bring all 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.899
 Assault soldiers with resuscitation kits 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.210
 and first aid kits and the patrol member 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.219
 remaining would be an engineer who would 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.780
 repair tool if there 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.760
 some urgent repair in the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.560
 vehicle and will also take to a hub 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.810
 to take advantage of the soft land of 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.700
 vehicle a rocket launcher or even a 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.370
 stinger to scare the helicopters 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.650
 the mission of this patrol is to be the 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.210
 perfect standard patrol for modes 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.160
 as conquest where the vehicles 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.860
 they reach their maximum power when they are 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.500
 accompanied by infantry the infantry 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.180
 and the vehicle support each other is 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.370
 simple both the vehicle and the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.500
 infantry arrive at a flag or up 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.210
 to a target the vehicle takes care of 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.010
 do the work harder while the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.020
 three remaining soldiers of the patrol 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.360
 ends up at work if there is a problem 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.310
 the vehicle 7 helps engineers 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.530
 they repair it and support it with their 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.640
 rocket launcher against other vehicles and if 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.130
 it is the soldiers who have 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.200
 difficulties then is the vehicle 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.760
 who frighten the problems in 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.430
 battlefield the vehicles as the 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.830
 tanks the vc and etcetera some pieces 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.690
 keys to attack the enemy but 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.220
 usually have deficiencies to the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.530
 time to face melee 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.510
 against the infantry is why that if 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.450
 we managed to move the vehicles along with 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.920
 the infantry both are fulfilled the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.860
 armored vehicles pay for the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.940
 short-range attack deficiencies 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.280
 firepower 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.440
 of infantry and infantry 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.600
 Solves combat deficiencies 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.250
 melee that kind of patrol 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.500
 crazy is designed for the mode 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.050
 conquest although it can also adapt 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.610
 for other game modes where they have 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.400
 armored vehicles 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.830
 the armored car at its points 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.830
 strong or we achieve perfection in 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.540
 infantry battlefield more vehicles yes 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.550
 we have a head and we do not know how to move without 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.060
 throwing we can make ourselves true 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.070
 massacre victory is near us 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.690
 we become a very effective patrol 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.180
 when capturing flags and 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.040
 defend them therefore to participate in 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.260
 the bleeding of enemy tickets 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.030
 together for all practically all 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.550
 the patrol members are winning 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.560
 a lot of points for killing capture or 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.360
 repair if we do not know how to organize well 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.250
 we can finish the game in the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.800
 first places 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.630
 the armored patrol but watch your 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.300
 Weak points already to consider are 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.520
 problems to follow the allied vehicle 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.710
 the goal objective path can be 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.060
 quite heavy for the infantry already 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.900
 moving slower than 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.879
 vehicles 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.439
 degrees although this is solved using 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.439
 small transport vehicles 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.030
 as a good jeep take care of the vehicle is 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.280
 very important to make sure that the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.049
 vehicle is not destroyed the vehicle 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.629
 is the nucleus of this patrol and if 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.379
 it is massacred everything can go to the 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.030
 shit 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.709
 good comrades and this has been all for 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.290

 let's see if we can reach 800 likes 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.549
