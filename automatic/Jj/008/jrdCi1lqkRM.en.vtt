00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.400
 or 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello pink world girls we were 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.670
 throwing us a coffee as you can see and 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.650
 We said that the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.689
 graduations and you have to give the basics 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.750
 tips that in pink world can find 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.579
 how to look the best we have in the best 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.520
 always the best and the trends are 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.919
 very good because there is like everything 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.509
 little no yes then and not now 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.070
 you have to have the typical 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.920
 black dress or the typical red dress or 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.559
 the typical gold you do not have options 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.300
 all colors and flavors for any 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.500
 body type for any kind of 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.050
 skin color then there is no excuse 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.940
 to look divine in this in this 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.070
 gradation we chose the five 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.220
 trends that we believe are 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.410
 the best there are many others but good 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.630
 here we will see the five favorites 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.250
 for the leoneses is in blue yes 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.840
 I think the neon colors is not for 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.450
 example, I'm super white, not me 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.850
 they stay but I have a lot of fun 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.890
 you have to be a girl more owed 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.780
 more daring or na 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 I think if it's a dress like the one 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.040
 has all and if you can put your hair 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.190
 loose yes yes it's worth it because 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.229
 have so much stuff up then if 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.170
 you are going to encourage more here you take these 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.470
 and you let him be this 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.660
 red lip recommend it to ana brenda 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.540
 have seen in lately in their 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.580
 red carpets and so on is a dress 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.890
 very typical of ana brenda 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.290
 the lip could be very red 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.870
 very sharp cat line 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.410
 in the eyes and the chongo this licked 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.910
 high up here a black dress is very 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.560
 good option also at graduation 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.660
 we generally think of other colors 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.090
 but if you are going to use it with a 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.910
 application has been nothing or something very 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.950
 take out of the normal black is a very 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.020
 good choice I'm in a moment 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.020
 of swelling but if you go to your graduation 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.970
 I'm not going to segregation in such 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.340
 the same ones no no but to which 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.510
 I say yes yes they have the little arm 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.670
 xavi cover the arm is what today because 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.310
 it has thin acb is better you can 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.290
 put on a girdle etcetera etcetera and you look 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.240
 I'm like I think it's very my style is 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.130
 totally three typical colors that have 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.800
 been in trend these last this 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.810
 last year the yellow they say yes in 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.520
 you trusted beauty dress in yellow 4 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.470
 is the yellow I saw it in one of the 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.970
 magazines last week carpet 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.340
 red and they put it as a trend of 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.600
 celebrities another one of the rules very 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.730
 Classics for any graduation 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.620
 girls agreement if they are going to teach a lot 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.090
 back as they teach a lot forward if 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.950
 they are going to teach a lot of leg 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.410
 much forward without teaching much 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.959
 forward back 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.790
 a big neckline and then we have the 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.189
 another trend that are lace 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.810
 in all kinds of cafes of all color 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.549
 all flavors that has a good 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.939
 application you know what's good about this 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.310
 kind of things that you waist and who 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.750
 does not want more waist because all the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.870
 world wants more waistline I imagine 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.799
 that now the lace that we are 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.540
 seeing here they are black and with a background in 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.180
 neutral not like the baby this baby or 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.159
 like this beige but what we've been 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.799
 seeing a lot in trend is the nude with 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.260
 Lace white with lace with colors 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.939
 clearer not and the latest trend that 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.780
 we found a dress but there are many 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.459
 more is like the metal copper and is 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.519
 a trend that was very strong in 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.060
 fabrics as metalized I bring 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.310
 felipe massa metallized as well 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.239
 as leathers as how are these applications 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:46.010
 that maybe the skirt is a tulle and the part 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.530
 of the corset is that is leather but this 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.269
 metal trend fascinates me 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.810
 it gives you a lot of security gives you 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.120
 a lot of solidity 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.590
 be there in the event then those 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.540
 were the five trends that the world 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.940
 Rosa proposes for future 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.780
 graduations that are already at the door of 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.610

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.050
 check the entire turn of which all 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.520
 the dresses that we were teaching them 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.720

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.220

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.200

 colors the flavors and already if flat 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.340
 I would not do a Friday 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.739

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.780

 among all goes well the fun 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.870
 Of course, it is already ensured that they do not go 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.669

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.669
