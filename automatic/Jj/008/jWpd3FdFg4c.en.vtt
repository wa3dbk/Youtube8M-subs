for<00:00:16.080> actual<00:00:16.590> care<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.369> think<00:00:17.699> it's<00:00:17.789> three

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
for actual care but I think it's three

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.599 
for actual care but I think it's three
actual<00:00:18.420> codes<00:00:18.750> but<00:00:19.350> depends<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:19.770> how<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.010> how

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
actual codes but depends on how you how

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.099 
actual codes but depends on how you how
you<00:00:20.640> say<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:20.939> guess<00:00:21.480> there<00:00:21.600> was<00:00:21.689> war<00:00:21.869> zone

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
you say I guess there was war zone

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.400 
you say I guess there was war zone
Armageddon<00:00:23.039> which<00:00:23.130> was<00:00:23.310> included<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:25.080> in

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
Armageddon which was included in the in

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.710 
Armageddon which was included in the in
the<00:00:25.470> actual<00:00:25.830> apocalypse<00:00:26.550> book<00:00:26.880> itself<00:00:27.300> unless

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.419 
the actual apocalypse book itself unless
you<00:00:27.960> got<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> collectors<00:00:28.529> edition<00:00:28.590> where<00:00:29.099> I

you got the collectors edition where I

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.160 
you got the collectors edition where I
think<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.939> was<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.359> more<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.720> supplement

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
think it was like more of a supplement

think it was like more of a supplement

actually<00:00:45.629> kind<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.289> kind<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.590> took<00:00:46.710> me<00:00:46.860> by

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
surprise but it so it totally makes

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.660 
surprise but it so it totally makes
sense<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.590> know<00:00:49.710> Imperial<00:00:50.550> Knights

which<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.659> really<00:01:18.810> cool<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.170> obviously

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
which is really cool to see obviously

which is really cool to see obviously
all<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.400> takes<00:01:20.670> place<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:21.810> after<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
all this takes place way after the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.039 
all this takes place way after the
initial<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.460> first<00:01:24.210> first<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.810> second

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
sphere expansions into that region I

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.100 
sphere expansions into that region I
believe<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.479> far<00:01:27.689> sites<00:01:27.930> already

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
believe you know far sites already

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.289 
believe you know far sites already
established<00:01:28.590> his<00:01:28.770> thing<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.790> now<00:01:30.090> they're

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
established his thing so now they're

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.060 
established his thing so now they're
kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.509> battling<00:01:31.020> over<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.320> route<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.829> guess

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
kind of battling over this route I guess

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.060 
kind of battling over this route I guess

two into Imperium space along the bottom

the<00:01:39.329> far<00:01:39.930> side<00:01:40.110> enclaves<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.460> takes<00:01:41.670> place

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the far side enclaves so it takes place

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.359 
the far side enclaves so it takes place

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
was the the night tighten formation one

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.840 
was the the night tighten formation one
which<00:05:49.650> was<00:05:49.860> which<00:05:50.100> is<00:05:50.220> really<00:05:50.430> cool<00:05:50.610> because<00:05:50.730> I

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
which was which is really cool because I

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.370 
which was which is really cool because I
mean<00:05:51.060> hey<00:05:51.270> who<00:05:51.510> doesn't<00:05:51.630> want<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:51.960> scout<00:05:52.200> and

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
mean hey who doesn't want to scout and

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.670 
mean hey who doesn't want to scout and
have<00:05:52.530> intercept<00:05:52.980> and<00:05:53.190> things<00:05:53.340> like<00:05:53.460> that<00:05:54.680> not

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
have intercept and things like that not

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.080 
have intercept and things like that not
that<00:05:55.800> it<00:05:55.920> does<00:05:56.070> well<00:05:56.250> against<00:05:56.580> fires<00:05:56.790> because

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
that it does well against fires because

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.030 
that it does well against fires because
they<00:05:57.300> have<00:05:57.390> blast<00:05:57.630> templates<00:05:58.050> but<00:05:58.260> I<00:05:58.500> guess

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
they have blast templates but I guess

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.800 
they have blast templates but I guess
you<00:05:59.190> could<00:05:59.220> grab<00:05:59.520> some<00:05:59.580> fly<00:06:00.420> moss<00:06:00.660> which

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
you could grab some fly moss which

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.500 
you could grab some fly moss which
features<00:06:01.230> with<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.470> Stuber<00:06:01.800> perhaps<00:06:02.190> so<00:06:03.120> a

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
features with the Stuber perhaps so a

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.990 
features with the Stuber perhaps so a

heavy<00:06:51.169> support<00:06:51.530> cadre<00:06:51.980> one<00:06:52.160> this<00:06:52.340> is<00:06:52.700> really

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
heavy support cadre one this is really

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.120 
heavy support cadre one this is really
cool<00:06:53.210> stuff<00:06:53.360> so<00:06:53.660> the<00:06:53.750> formations<00:06:54.260> there's<00:06:54.770> ten

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
cool stuff so the formations there's ten

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.010 
cool stuff so the formations there's ten
pages<00:06:55.340> worth<00:06:55.639> they're<00:06:56.150> really<00:06:56.270> nice<00:06:56.510> I'm<00:06:56.840> not

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
pages worth they're really nice I'm not

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.330 
pages worth they're really nice I'm not
sure<00:06:57.080> if<00:06:57.290> they<00:06:57.410> do<00:06:57.500> this<00:06:57.650> double<00:06:57.919> page<00:06:58.040> things

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
sure if they do this double page things

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.350 
sure if they do this double page things
is<00:06:58.490> because<00:06:58.639> they<00:06:58.850> didn't<00:06:59.060> have<00:06:59.090> a<00:06:59.180> lot<00:06:59.300> of

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
is because they didn't have a lot of

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.790 
is because they didn't have a lot of
content<00:06:59.750> or<00:06:59.900> they<00:06:59.990> actually<00:07:00.320> needed<00:07:00.500> space

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
content or they actually needed space

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.190 
content or they actually needed space
but<00:07:01.460> it's<00:07:01.730> still<00:07:01.880> cool<00:07:01.940> to<00:07:02.090> see<00:07:02.389> like<00:07:02.600> I<00:07:03.020> said

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.200 
but it's still cool to see like I said

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.750 
but it's still cool to see like I said
there's<00:07:03.380> a<00:07:03.440> bunch<00:07:03.620> of<00:07:03.740> them<00:07:03.889> in<00:07:03.980> here<00:07:04.040> and<00:07:04.430> then

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.760 
there's a bunch of them in here and then

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.330 
there's a bunch of them in here and then
you<00:07:04.820> get<00:07:04.910> to<00:07:04.970> the<00:07:05.120> back<00:07:06.070> there's<00:07:07.070> a<00:07:07.130> brief

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
you get to the back there's a brief

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.120 
you get to the back there's a brief
appendix<00:07:07.880> with<00:07:08.600> some<00:07:08.960> background<00:07:09.410> on<00:07:09.650> a<00:07:09.770> whole

bunch<00:07:10.940> of<00:07:11.000> stuff<00:07:11.060> raising<00:07:11.870> in<00:07:11.990> the<00:07:12.130> from<00:07:13.130> the

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.220 
bunch of stuff raising in the from the
