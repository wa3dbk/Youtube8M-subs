00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 in two that must come hard yes me 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.360
 think its good analysis gives 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.929
 thing that we learn ourselves without being real 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.940
 having had good opportunities 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.550
 beyond that header, I think of a how 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.980
 the bottom can be flat 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.619
 does not fall into target I think we had the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.019
 law under control and they had 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.019
 I think outside in millions of initial stages 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.859
 some corners not real or none 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.360
 threat that are under pressure then know 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.370
 you that you still have some people on the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.230
 couch that attacking 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.800
 possibly make the difference and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.600
 then at the first corner they make 0 1 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.050
 yes that was just a teac to the we it 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.450
 just as difficult and then we think we will make it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.690
 yelp enthusiasm the one out and the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.420
 tipping moment as garden also says is think 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.629
 I like that chance of patosi if you then direct 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.039
 then the two one made that moment 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.440
 and then I think he has it 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.420
 competition wins ok then in us 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 enthusiasm we run into their knives 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.530
 then remember two options afterwards 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.330
 where they have forgotten to finish 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.130
 we still have a number of options 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.409
 opportunities to enter the competition 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.780
 and then it is a dime yes 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.580
 that can fall after two sides and okay 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.170
 today it falls to the side of wax 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.150
 him again 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.280
 therefore we are still five 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.450
 points down a beard you worry 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.890
 lots too few and I think you 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.670
 like garden you also say you have to 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.950
 moments 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.530
 you have a number of more points 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.840
 but that is past because there 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.650
 are focusing on the future and now 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.110
 after two weeks of hard work and then the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.939
 next versus knew and attack 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.130
 that work extremely hard and in which direction 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.140
 Do you want to see what I think in particular 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.930
 I think that we are more efficient 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.399
 must be in itself you do not play 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.170
 bad to the zone of the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.610
 truth and you have to take your moment there 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.469
 suits and they do have today 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.780
 we have neglected acted 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.810
 again it's like being in a made in 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.399
 then breaks the two into yes then then 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.259
 punish the opponent and then you can 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.239
 you go from an organization 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.190
 said football must come but instead 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.900
 of two and then it becomes 1 2 yes and then 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.959
 then you know it will be difficult 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.519
 and who will tell you it is weak in it 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.019
 attacking compartment but you will 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.299
 should the players there are 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.310
 you have to go to more for each corner 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.409
 lead to efficiency 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.610
 yes okay that's why we have to train 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.099
 also have a whole week on it 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.810
 trained and you need those players too 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.390
 give you the confidence you need 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.590
 indeed finish schedule now but they 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.780
 have eventually 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.879
 I think both teams have 100% the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.560
 go to win that match 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.540
 ok you lose because it is a pity 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.829
 must have faith in quality 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.099
 that we have and it is still a long one 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.730
 away 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.159
 they are also 24 matches, I think 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.599
 to still use a remonte we 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.430
 for hey at waasland-beren 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.379
 dressing room at lokeren 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.510
 the cups down can use that 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.129
 be positive 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.959
 where I think you should do everything now 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.700
 let it sink we have two weeks 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.359
 for the next match is of course 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.280
 not nice because yes you would like that derby 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.560
 and I say the true one 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.120
 number of side on moments and ok today 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.299
 is that necessary in us 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.299
 books
