less bonus we get so let's pull out our
item<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.629> direct<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.079> from<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
item we have to direct it from one to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.569 
item we have to direct it from one to
the<00:00:53.129> other<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.860> you<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.250> makes<00:00:56.489> it

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the other so you see this makes it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.189 
the other so you see this makes it
bounce<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.940> little<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.480> also<00:00:57.600> angle<00:00:58.109> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
bounce a little but we can also angle it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.900 
bounce a little but we can also angle it
from<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.100> circle<00:00:59.550> just<00:01:00.030> touch<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> side

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
from that circle just touch on the side

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.530 
from that circle just touch on the side
you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:04.850> angles<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.240> say<00:01:06.420> we

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you can see it kind of angles you say we

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.380 
you can see it kind of angles you say we
fill<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:06.930> at<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.110> bottom<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.970> goal<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
fill it up at the bottom the goal is to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.679 
fill it up at the bottom the goal is to
get<00:01:09.630> 40<00:01:10.170> water<00:01:10.470> droplets<00:01:11.570> within<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
get 40 water droplets within a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.780 
get 40 water droplets within a
reasonable<00:01:13.200> amount<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.950> time<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> go

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
reasonable amount of time like if you go

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.840 
reasonable amount of time like if you go
one<00:01:15.540> drop<00:01:15.869> wait<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> few<00:01:17.070> seconds<00:01:17.369> another<00:01:17.549> drop

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
one drop wait a few seconds another drop

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.030 
one drop wait a few seconds another drop
wait<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> few<00:01:18.180> seconds<00:01:18.570> another<00:01:18.750> drop<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
wait a few seconds another drop of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.710 
wait a few seconds another drop of
pnina<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> water<00:01:20.700> will<00:01:20.880> dry<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.570> will

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
pnina the water will dry up and it will

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.670 
pnina the water will dry up and it will
make<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.470> more<00:01:22.500> than<00:01:22.770> actual<00:01:23.310> 40<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:25.560> can

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.460 

then<00:02:33.460> you<00:02:33.550> see<00:02:33.730> we<00:02:33.760> have<00:02:34.000> two<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.630> water<00:02:34.930> f-fire

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
then you see we have two of water f-fire

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.410 
then you see we have two of water f-fire
and<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:36.460> also<00:02:36.610> have<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.850> button<00:02:37.270> right<00:02:37.480> there<00:02:39.420> so

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
and we also have a button right there so

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.490 
and we also have a button right there so
we<00:02:40.810> have<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.080> hit<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.530> fire<00:02:41.860> button<00:02:42.270> to

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
we have to hit the fire button to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.440 
we have to hit the fire button to
initiate<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.820> fire<00:02:46.300> lava<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.150> see<00:02:52.300> we're

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
initiate the fire lava so you see we're

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.240 
initiate the fire lava so you see we're
hitting<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.660> fire<00:02:52.900> button<00:02:53.170> which<00:02:53.800> is<00:02:53.830> going

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
hitting the fire button which is going

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.610 
hitting the fire button which is going
that<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.730> we're<00:02:54.880> getting<00:02:55.120> water<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.630> then<00:02:56.500> we

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
that so we're getting water and then we

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:12.950 
that so we're getting water and then we
also<00:02:56.770> have<00:02:56.920> fire

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:23.820 

so<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.860> fires<00:03:14.040> counting<00:03:14.490> up

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.640

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
this may seem easy at first but I was

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.090 
this may seem easy at first but I was
stuck<00:03:26.890> on<00:03:27.010> level<00:03:27.190> two<00:03:27.490> for<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.940> longest<00:03:28.540> time

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
stuck on level two for the longest time

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.100 
stuck on level two for the longest time
it<00:03:30.100> just<00:03:30.280> takes<00:03:30.490> a<00:03:30.640> minute<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.900> grasp<00:03:31.900> your

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110

it just takes a minute to grasp your
head<00:03:32.230> around<00:03:32.410> what<00:03:32.680> these<00:03:32.890> items<00:03:33.190> do<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:34.380> how

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
head around what these items do and how

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.900 
head around what these items do and how
you<00:03:35.470> can<00:03:35.740> incorporate<00:03:35.980> them<00:03:37.230> together<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.910> get

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
you can incorporate them together to get

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.250 
you can incorporate them together to get
from<00:03:40.090> one<00:03:40.120> side<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.720> other<00:03:40.750> like<00:03:41.110> you're

pouring down you have to pull it up to a

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.230 
pouring down you have to pull it up to a
higher<00:03:52.270> level<00:03:52.300> it<00:03:53.290> gets<00:03:54.040> complicated<00:03:54.340> but<00:03:55.120> it

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
higher level it gets complicated but it

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.870 
higher level it gets complicated but it
is<00:03:55.360> fun<00:03:55.600> at<00:03:55.990> least<00:03:56.410> if<00:03:56.590> you'd<00:03:56.710> like<00:03:56.800> done<00:03:57.100> that

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
kind of challenge this kind of puzzles

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.080 
kind of challenge this kind of puzzles
so<00:04:01.120> if<00:04:01.420> we<00:04:01.450> double<00:04:02.410> tap<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.709> screen<00:04:02.880> we<00:04:03.880> bring

so if we double tap the screen we bring

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.449 
so if we double tap the screen we bring
pause<00:04:04.450> menu<00:04:04.720> we're<00:04:05.530> going<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.770> go<00:04:05.950> directly<00:04:06.310> to
