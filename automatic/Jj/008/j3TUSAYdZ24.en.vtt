myself this is pretty freaky like
this<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.140> perfect<00:01:43.710> example<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.340> movie

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
this is a perfect example of a movie

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.760 
this is a perfect example of a movie
that<00:01:44.850> would<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.570> nearly<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.290> good<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that would not be nearly as good if it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.280 
that would not be nearly as good if it
were<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:46.890> animated<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.000> stop<00:01:48.720> motion<00:01:49.140> air

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
were not animated and stop motion air

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.280 
were not animated and stop motion air
and<00:01:49.439> start<00:01:49.619> with<00:01:49.799> an<00:01:49.920> MA<00:01:50.159> at<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.960> 3d

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and start with an MA at that and the 3d

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.719 
and start with an MA at that and the 3d
just<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:52.680> enhances<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.549> got<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
just really enhances that it's got a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.080 
just really enhances that it's got a

to<00:02:27.340> get<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.670> length<00:02:27.880> but<00:02:28.570> never<00:02:28.780> anything<00:02:29.110> too

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
to get the length but never anything too

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.590 
to get the length but never anything too
bad<00:02:29.680> you're<00:02:29.980> never<00:02:30.070> really<00:02:30.790> distracted<00:02:31.510> by

bad you're never really distracted by

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.910 
bad you're never really distracted by
just<00:02:31.900> something<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.320> noted<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:32.740> retrospect<00:02:33.310> and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
just something I noted in retrospect and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.800 
just something I noted in retrospect and
it's<00:02:35.920> generally<00:02:36.490> well<00:02:36.670> developed<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.300> climax

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
it's generally well developed the climax

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.270 
it's generally well developed the climax
moves<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.230> little<00:02:38.380> faster<00:02:38.680> than<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.100> would<00:02:39.220> like

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
moves a little faster than I would like

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.920 
moves a little faster than I would like
but<00:02:39.820> overall<00:02:40.270> very<00:02:40.420> enjoyable<00:02:41.260> pacing

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
but overall very enjoyable pacing

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.420 
but overall very enjoyable pacing
definitely<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.960> good<00:02:44.140> conclusion<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:45.010> thought

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
definitely a good conclusion I thought

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.410 
definitely a good conclusion I thought
and<00:02:46.620> though<00:02:47.620> they<00:02:47.800> do<00:02:47.860> have<00:02:48.190> kind<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:49.090> ID<00:02:49.240> I'm

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
and though they do have kind of ID I'm

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.420 
and though they do have kind of ID I'm
not<00:02:49.570> going<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.780> spoil<00:02:50.020> anything<00:02:50.200> but<00:02:50.440> uh<00:02:50.650> it's

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
not going to spoil anything but uh it's

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.020 
not going to spoil anything but uh it's
not<00:02:51.670> over<00:02:52.090> yet<00:02:52.120> moment<00:02:52.930> oh<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:54.280> doesn't<00:02:54.730> feel

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
not over yet moment oh it doesn't feel

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.730 
not over yet moment oh it doesn't feel
too<00:02:55.270> tacked<00:02:55.510> on<00:02:55.750> which<00:02:56.020> is<00:02:56.170> surprising

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
too tacked on which is surprising

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.260 
too tacked on which is surprising
because<00:02:56.770> these<00:02:56.980> Mon<00:02:57.190> dolls<00:02:57.460> always<00:02:57.820> do<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.150> me

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
because these Mon dolls always do to me

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.850 
because these Mon dolls always do to me
but<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.750> did<00:02:58.930> flow<00:02:59.140> well<00:02:59.350> like<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.530> said<00:02:59.650> the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
but it did flow well like I said the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.750 
but it did flow well like I said the
characters<00:03:00.370> um<00:03:01.560> maybe<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.740> little<00:03:02.980> lacking<00:03:03.310> I

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
characters um maybe a little lacking I

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.760 
characters um maybe a little lacking I
thought<00:03:04.000> Cole<00:03:04.330> align<00:03:04.600> yourself<00:03:04.960> as<00:03:05.140> was<00:03:05.560> it

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
thought Cole align yourself as was it

thought Cole align yourself as was it
was<00:03:05.920> good<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.430> this<00:03:06.820> means<00:03:07.030> we're<00:03:07.480> not

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
was good and this means we're not

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.880 
was good and this means we're not
expecting<00:03:07.900> some<00:03:08.320> deep<00:03:08.590> psychological

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890
