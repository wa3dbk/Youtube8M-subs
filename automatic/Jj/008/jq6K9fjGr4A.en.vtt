guess-<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:17.970> project<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.540> how<00:02:18.870> like

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
guess- on this project is that how like

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.650 
guess- on this project is that how like
this<00:02:19.880> disjointed<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.000> sounds<00:02:21.360> but<00:02:21.510> that's

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
this disjointed it sounds but that's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.450 
this disjointed it sounds but that's
because<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> combination<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.280> know

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
because it's a combination so you know

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.970 
because it's a combination so you know
like<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> lot<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:24.030> tracks<00:02:24.330> or<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:25.080> lot<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.500> it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
like a lot of tracks or a lot of it it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.470 
like a lot of tracks or a lot of it it
just<00:02:26.010> doesn't<00:02:26.550> sometimes<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.180> album<00:02:27.420> don't

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
just doesn't sometimes the album don't

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.120 
just doesn't sometimes the album don't
seem<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.870> flows<00:02:28.140> well<00:02:28.530> together<00:02:28.710> you

think that would be another thing that I

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.110 
think that would be another thing that I
didn't<00:04:05.010> like<00:04:05.100> about<00:04:05.160> this<00:04:05.520> project<00:04:05.730> that<00:04:06.030> kind

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
again I can understand that because it's

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.020
