00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
development this year is an important

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.280 
development this year is an important
year<00:00:08.320> for<00:00:08.380> a<00:00:08.590> UV<00:00:09.070> and<00:00:09.600> one<00:00:10.600> of<00:00:10.720> the<00:00:10.810> key<00:00:10.990> things

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
year for a UV and one of the key things

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.980 
year for a UV and one of the key things
is<00:00:11.530> to<00:00:11.740> get<00:00:11.980> the<00:00:12.280> productivity<00:00:13.150> up<00:00:13.360> on<00:00:13.599> these

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
is to get the productivity up on these

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.259 
is to get the productivity up on these
early<00:00:14.440> generation<00:00:15.040> euv<00:00:15.400> systems<00:00:15.849> so<00:00:16.119> the

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:16.269 
early generation euv systems so the

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.870 
early generation euv systems so the
process<00:00:16.510> development<00:00:17.109> can<00:00:17.410> really<00:00:17.710> get<00:00:18.699> going

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
process development can really get going

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.019

you know I would say that you know we're

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.529 
you know I would say that you know we're
not<00:01:26.249> we're<00:01:27.249> not<00:01:27.279> giving<00:01:27.670> up<00:01:27.759> innovating<00:01:28.359> in

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
not we're not giving up innovating in

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.109 
not we're not giving up innovating in
deep<00:01:28.749> UV<00:01:28.959> lithography<00:01:29.649> and<00:01:29.679> we<00:01:30.189> have<00:01:30.369> a<00:01:30.399> talk

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119

lithography<00:01:37.299> light<00:01:37.479> sources<00:01:37.929> so<00:01:38.169> i<00:01:38.200> would

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
lithography light sources so i would

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.830 
lithography light sources so i would
encourage<00:01:38.499> people<00:01:39.039> to<00:01:39.069> come<00:01:39.279> and<00:01:39.659> check<00:01:40.659> out

encourage people to come and check out

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.139 
encourage people to come and check out
the<00:01:40.990> latest<00:01:41.079> there<00:01:41.499> as<00:01:41.770> well<00:01:42.069> so<00:01:42.729> in<00:01:42.819> both<00:01:42.909> deep

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
the latest there as well so in both deep

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.599 
the latest there as well so in both deep
UV<00:01:43.329> and<00:01:43.569> UV<00:01:44.020> light<00:01:44.200> sources<00:01:44.679> I<00:01:44.859> think<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.429> key

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
UV and UV light sources I think the key

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.089 
UV and UV light sources I think the key
is<00:01:45.639> to<00:01:45.909> build<00:01:46.119> on<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:46.450> learning<00:01:46.889> that's<00:01:47.889> been

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
is to build on the learning that's been

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:50.639 
is to build on the learning that's been

announced for syma I think there's also
a<00:03:01.730> lot<00:03:01.819> of<00:03:01.880> interest<00:03:02.299> in<00:03:02.510> this<00:03:02.750> directed

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
a lot of interest in this directed

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.880 
a lot of interest in this directed
self-assembly<00:03:03.579> approach<00:03:05.079> and<00:03:06.079> that<00:03:06.109> since

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
self-assembly approach and that since

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.009 
self-assembly approach and that since
making<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.340> lot<00:03:07.459> of<00:03:07.489> good<00:03:07.670> progress<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.450> heard

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
making a lot of good progress so I heard

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.080 
making a lot of good progress so I heard
a<00:03:09.049> lot<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.200> people<00:03:09.500> mentioned<00:03:09.829> that<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.250> think

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
a lot of people mentioned that I think

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.520 
a lot of people mentioned that I think
Moore's<00:03:11.299> law<00:03:11.540> has<00:03:11.660> got<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.200> know<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.320> long

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
Moore's law has got a you know a long

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.319 
Moore's law has got a you know a long
future<00:03:12.799> ahead<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.280> we<00:03:13.519> we<00:03:13.850> had<00:03:14.000> some<00:03:14.180> good

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
future ahead of it we we had some good

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.940 
future ahead of it we we had some good
keynote<00:03:14.690> talks<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.530> optical

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
keynote talks and the optical

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.680 
keynote talks and the optical
lithography<00:03:16.040> session<00:03:16.820> yesterday<00:03:16.970> from<00:03:17.480> both

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
lithography session yesterday from both

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.880 
lithography session yesterday from both
the<00:03:17.810> memory<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:18.170> logic<00:03:18.290> side<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.829> the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
the memory and logic side of the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.699 
the memory and logic side of the
business<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:20.150> showed<00:03:20.660> scaling<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.620> know

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
business that showed scaling you know

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.090 
business that showed scaling you know
well<00:03:21.950> into<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.970> next<00:03:23.120> decade<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:24.560> below<00:03:24.859> 10

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
well into the next decade and below 10

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.180 
well into the next decade and below 10
nanometers<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:25.970> think<00:03:26.180> we<00:03:26.480> have<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:27.069> we<00:03:28.069> have

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
nanometers so I think we have a we have

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.940 
nanometers so I think we have a we have
some<00:03:28.220> time<00:03:28.549> ahead<00:03:28.700> of<00:03:28.790> us
