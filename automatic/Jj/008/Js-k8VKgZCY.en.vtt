this<00:02:46.230> man<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.620> particular<00:02:46.769> had<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.459> issue<00:02:47.910> with

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
this man in particular had a issue with

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.740 
this man in particular had a issue with
only<00:02:49.650> producing<00:02:50.220> about<00:02:50.340> 20<00:02:51.090> percent<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.600> its

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
only producing about 20 percent of its

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.140 
only producing about 20 percent of its
power<00:02:52.140> now<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.010> thought<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.400> was<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.880> motor

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
power now I thought it was the motor

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.110 
power now I thought it was the motor
than<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.930> resistor<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.830> then<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.700> found<00:02:56.910> out

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
than the resistor and then I found out

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.660 
than the resistor and then I found out
none<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.510> was<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.930> issue<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.489> still<00:02:59.489> he

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
none of that was the issue and still he

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.360 
none of that was the issue and still he
was<00:02:59.819> scratching<00:03:00.090> my<00:03:00.269> head<00:03:00.569> on<00:03:00.920> what<00:03:01.920> was<00:03:02.069> going

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
was scratching my head on what was going

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.050 
was scratching my head on what was going
on<00:03:02.519> now<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.569> checked<00:03:04.380> all<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.680> pipes<00:03:05.489> made<00:03:05.880> sure

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
on now I checked all the pipes made sure

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.330 
on now I checked all the pipes made sure
they'll<00:03:06.299> clear<00:03:06.599> now<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> thing<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:08.069> was

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
they'll clear now the thing that I was

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.970 
they'll clear now the thing that I was
not<00:03:08.610> expecting<00:03:09.299> it<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.569> be<00:03:09.780> is<00:03:10.049> this<00:03:10.530> air

not expecting it to be is this air
filter<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.910> do<00:03:12.599> not<00:03:12.870> expect<00:03:13.319> an<00:03:13.620> old<00:03:14.069> air<00:03:14.430> filter

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880

did<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.340> check<00:04:01.550> there<00:04:02.000> was<00:04:02.120> no<00:04:02.240> blockages<00:04:02.810> in

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
did to check there was no blockages in

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.510 
did to check there was no blockages in
there<00:04:03.110> because<00:04:03.200> sometimes<00:04:03.890> I've<00:04:04.190> heard

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
there because sometimes I've heard

and that will keep your system on
reverse<00:05:51.740> cycle<00:05:52.810> 24/7<00:05:53.810> it's<00:05:54.620> actually

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
reverse cycle 24/7 it's actually

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.970 
reverse cycle 24/7 it's actually
probably<00:05:55.340> if<00:05:55.940> you<00:05:56.330> want<00:05:56.660> it<00:05:56.840> on<00:05:57.110> reverse<00:05:57.350> cycle

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.540 
probably if you want it on reverse cycle
it<00:05:58.640> will<00:05:58.820> be<00:05:59.030> a<00:05:59.060> lot<00:05:59.300> more<00:05:59.330> better<00:05:59.750> for<00:05:59.900> your

motor<00:06:06.890> to<00:06:07.190> closes<00:06:08.380> okay<00:06:09.380> and<00:06:09.590> why<00:06:10.220> do<00:06:10.280> people

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
motor to closes okay and why do people

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.600 
motor to closes okay and why do people
want<00:06:10.940> to<00:06:11.030> do<00:06:11.150> this<00:06:12.040> another<00:06:13.040> reason<00:06:13.490> is

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
want to do this another reason is

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.000 
want to do this another reason is
because<00:06:13.840> these<00:06:14.840> vans<00:06:15.200> have<00:06:15.500> got<00:06:15.680> an<00:06:15.800> issue

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
because these vans have got an issue

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.200 
because these vans have got an issue
with<00:06:16.190> their<00:06:16.790> air<00:06:17.120> filters<00:06:17.840> and<00:06:18.970> here<00:06:19.970> is<00:06:20.090> the

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
with their air filters and here is the

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.330 
with their air filters and here is the
air<00:06:20.390> filter<00:06:20.500> what<00:06:21.500> they<00:06:21.650> do<00:06:21.710> is<00:06:22.040> they<00:06:22.160> get

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
air filter what they do is they get

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.830 
air filter what they do is they get
blocked<00:06:22.550> up<00:06:22.820> real<00:06:23.240> quick

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
blocked up real quick

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.770 
blocked up real quick
and<00:06:24.610> they're<00:06:25.610> not<00:06:25.790> really<00:06:26.000> big<00:06:26.240> filters

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
and they're not really big filters

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.580 
and they're not really big filters
nonetheless<00:06:27.940> so<00:06:28.990> what<00:06:29.990> people<00:06:30.200> do<00:06:30.410> is<00:06:30.440> they

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
nonetheless so what people do is they

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.520 
nonetheless so what people do is they
remove<00:06:31.010> the<00:06:31.190> filter<00:06:31.640> and<00:06:32.080> then<00:06:33.080> they<00:06:33.230> switch

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
remove the filter and then they switch

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.480 
remove the filter and then they switch
this<00:06:33.830> tool<00:06:34.160> to<00:06:34.730> reverse<00:06:35.060> cycle<00:06:35.590> 24/7<00:06:36.590> so<00:06:37.250> what

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
this tool to reverse cycle 24/7 so what

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.150 
this tool to reverse cycle 24/7 so what
happens<00:06:37.940> is<00:06:38.350> they're<00:06:39.350> constantly<00:06:39.920> breathing

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
happens is they're constantly breathing

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.610 
happens is they're constantly breathing
in<00:06:40.610> the<00:06:40.760> air<00:06:40.880> through<00:06:41.300> the<00:06:41.480> cabin<00:06:41.870> instead<00:06:42.500> of

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
in the air through the cabin instead of

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.580 
in the air through the cabin instead of
from<00:06:42.860> the<00:06:42.890> road<00:06:43.540> this<00:06:44.540> will<00:06:44.750> increase<00:06:45.110> the<00:06:45.260> air

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
from the road this will increase the air

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.710 
from the road this will increase the air
flow<00:06:45.620> into<00:06:46.220> your<00:06:46.280> cabin<00:06:46.700> dramatically<00:06:47.540> and

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 
flow into your cabin dramatically and

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.530 
flow into your cabin dramatically and
you<00:06:48.320> your<00:06:48.860> air<00:06:49.070> conditioning<00:06:49.580> here<00:06:49.940> work<00:06:50.360> a

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:50.540 
you your air conditioning here work a

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.560 
you your air conditioning here work a
lot<00:06:50.840> better<00:06:51.050> this<00:06:51.320> way<00:06:51.590> for<00:06:51.850> full<00:06:52.850> power<00:06:53.150> you

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
lot better this way for full power you

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.690 
lot better this way for full power you
could<00:06:53.720> hear<00:06:53.900> the<00:06:53.990> fan<00:06:54.230> going<00:06:54.650> and<00:06:54.830> you<00:06:55.550> could

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
could hear the fan going and you could

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.580 
could hear the fan going and you could
barely<00:06:55.880> feel<00:06:56.270> any<00:06:56.570> air<00:06:56.930> now<00:06:57.880> at<00:06:58.880> full<00:06:59.180> power

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
barely feel any air now at full power

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.380 
barely feel any air now at full power
you<00:07:00.590> can<00:07:00.740> hear<00:07:00.920> the<00:07:01.040> fan<00:07:01.250> going<00:07:01.490> you<00:07:01.910> can<00:07:02.150> feel

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.390 
you can hear the fan going you can feel

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.680 
you can hear the fan going you can feel
lots<00:07:03.290> of<00:07:03.500> it
