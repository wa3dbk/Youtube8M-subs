00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.770
 back in the 1960s, 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.680
 Mikhail Vasin Alexander Shcherbakov from 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.900
 Academy of Sciences of the USSR and returned the hypothesis 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.750
 that our satellite is actually 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.670
 created by artificial means 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.129
 This hypothesis has 8 main 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.129
 postulates called popular riddles 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:36.890
 the first mystery of the moon is actually an orbit 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.399
 motion and magnitude of the moon's satellite 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.140
 are physically impossible 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.140
 due to the fact that the magnitude of the moon 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.700
 equals a quarter of magnitude and earth 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.340
 ratio of satellite and planet 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.680
 always much smaller than the distance from the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.250
 the moons to the earth are such that sizes 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.079
 suns and he and visually the same 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.670
 if the moon were a body which 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.940
 certain moment was attracted 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.830
 earth and found a natural orbit too 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.710
 it would be given that this orbit should have been 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.890
 be elliptical instead she 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.670
 is striking round second 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.690
 the mystery of the moon 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.490
 improbable curvature which 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.390
 possesses the moon's surface is 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.010
 unexplained geological results 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.640
 research leads the conclusion that this 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.380
 the planetoid is actually a full ball one of 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.670
 explanations 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.770
 is that the moon crust was 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.740
 made of solid titanium 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.940
 carcass and it was really proven 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.340
 that moon crust 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.560
 searched and have extraordinary level 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.539
 content titans third moon puzzle 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.070
 explanation of the presence of a huge amount 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.710
 meteorite craters on the surface of the moon 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.860
 is widely known lack 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.930
 the atmosphere of the moon does not have the ability 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.850
 which would protect its surface from 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.550
 scars left by all 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.250
 craters crashing into meteorites 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.350
 of all sizes what remains 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.990
 inexplicable so is the shallow depth 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.640
 which could penetrate 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.789
 above bodies 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.060
 even craters with a diameter of 150 kilometers and 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.610
 exceed 4 kilometers corner plans 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.820
 4 mystery of the moon as formed so 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.040
 called the moon seas these gigantic 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.450
 solid lava areas which occurs 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.270
 from the inside of the bath 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.550
 could easily be explained 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.950
 if she was a hot planet with 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.250
 liquid inside I could not 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.710
 occur after meteorite strikes 5 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.660
 the mystery of the moon is gravitational attraction 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.780
 on the surface of the moon is not 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.630
 uniform this effect has already been noted 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.300
 the crew of apollo 8 when he acquired the zone 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.790
 moon seas 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.250
 6 mystery of the moon is quite shocking 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.040
 gnome fact is geographic 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.390
 moon surface asymmetry 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.910
 the famous dark side of the moon has 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.790
 much more craters of mountains and elements 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.130
 relief besides most of the maries 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.330
 on the contrary is on the side that we 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.200
 can see 7 low moon mystery 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.640
 density of our satellite 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.200
 makes up 60 percent of the density 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.550
 land 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.070
 This fact together with various 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.120
 research proves that the moon is 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.220
 hollow object 8 mystery of the moon 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.739
 last century for a long 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.769
 conditionally accepted were three 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.140
 theory of the origin of the moon in the present 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.269
 time most of the scientific community 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.640
 adopted the artificial hypothesis 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:41.500
 the origin of the moon planetoid as not 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.500
 less reasonable than others
