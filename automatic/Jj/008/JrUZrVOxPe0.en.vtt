causing that connection problem a little
bit<00:00:05.200> now<00:00:05.950> you<00:00:06.580> know<00:00:06.640> just<00:00:06.910> keep<00:00:07.149> this<00:00:07.330> bigger

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:07.599

than<00:00:07.870> dramatic<00:00:08.340> outside<00:00:09.340> on<00:00:09.460> that<00:00:09.610> we<00:00:09.700> got<00:00:09.820> to

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
than dramatic outside on that we got to

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.120 
than dramatic outside on that we got to
make<00:00:10.030> his<00:00:10.150> matrices<00:00:10.960> he<00:00:11.350> is<00:00:11.440> making<00:00:11.680> three

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130 
make his matrices he is making three

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.900 
make his matrices he is making three
there<00:00:12.309> it's<00:00:12.970> making

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.859 

doesn't<00:00:16.539> mean<00:00:16.600> you<00:00:16.900> just<00:00:18.240> look<00:00:19.240> that<00:00:19.360> kills<00:00:19.720> a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
doesn't mean you just look that kills a

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.260 
doesn't mean you just look that kills a
couple<00:00:20.140> mutalisks<00:00:20.470> that<00:00:21.100> is<00:00:21.279> actually<00:00:21.640> huge

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
couple mutalisks that is actually huge

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.929 
couple mutalisks that is actually huge
so<00:00:23.230> this<00:00:23.770> is<00:00:23.950> this<00:00:24.130> is<00:00:24.279> actually<00:00:24.580> really<00:00:24.610> great

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
so this is this is actually really great

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.580 
so this is this is actually really great
if<00:00:25.060> you<00:00:25.090> knew<00:00:25.420> that<00:00:25.450> this<00:00:25.810> expansion<00:00:26.230> was<00:00:26.410> here

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
if you knew that this expansion was here

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.230 
if you knew that this expansion was here
you<00:00:26.950> could<00:00:26.980> actually<00:00:27.220> just<00:00:27.400> go<00:00:27.640> kill<00:00:27.939> it<00:00:28.000> right

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
you could actually just go kill it right

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.970 
you could actually just go kill it right
now<00:00:28.419> Boyd<00:00:28.660> is<00:00:28.810> actually<00:00:29.110> very<00:00:29.140> very<00:00:29.470> long<00:00:29.830> he

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
now Boyd is actually very very long he

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.339 
now Boyd is actually very very long he
that<00:00:30.460> virus<00:00:30.939> in<00:00:31.240> the<00:00:31.330> other<00:00:31.540> two<00:00:31.750> bases<00:00:32.169> and

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
that virus in the other two bases and

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.560 
that virus in the other two bases and
not<00:00:32.619> that<00:00:32.830> one<00:00:33.070> for<00:00:33.519> instance<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.120> gets<00:00:34.300> skin

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
not that one for instance and gets skin

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.290 
not that one for instance and gets skin
here<00:00:35.019> and<00:00:35.199> here<00:00:35.860> instead<00:00:36.370> he<00:00:36.970> could<00:00:37.180> have<00:00:37.269> just

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
here and here instead he could have just

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.240 
here and here instead he could have just
walked<00:00:37.510> down<00:00:37.840> right<00:00:38.140> now<00:00:38.260> killed<00:00:38.590> that<00:00:38.650> boy

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
walked down right now killed that boy

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.560 
walked down right now killed that boy
would<00:00:39.309> have<00:00:39.580> nothing<00:00:40.000> to<00:00:40.090> say<00:00:40.239> about<00:00:40.360> any

would have nothing to say about any

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.229 
would have nothing to say about any
virus<00:00:40.989> would<00:00:41.110> be<00:00:41.260> way<00:00:41.620> way<00:00:42.040> ahead<00:00:42.220> but<00:00:43.030> you

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
virus would be way way ahead but you

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.880 
virus would be way way ahead but you
know<00:00:43.360> void<00:00:43.660> with<00:00:43.989> his<00:00:44.170> random<00:00:44.470> weird

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
know void with his random weird

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.610 
know void with his random weird
expansion<00:00:45.519> spot<00:00:45.900> and<00:00:46.900> the<00:00:47.019> luckiness<00:00:47.320> of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
expansion spot and the luckiness of

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.220 
expansion spot and the luckiness of
choir<00:00:48.070> is<00:00:48.250> not<00:00:48.370> scanning<00:00:49.090> it<00:00:49.360> you<00:00:49.989> know<00:00:50.079> it's

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
choir is not scanning it you know it's

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.380 
choir is not scanning it you know it's
working<00:00:50.559> out<00:00:50.649> for<00:00:50.829> me<00:00:50.890> we<00:00:51.100> see<00:00:51.340> void<00:00:51.610> he's<00:00:52.120> got

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
working out for me we see void he's got

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.450 
working out for me we see void he's got
two<00:00:52.629> evos<00:00:52.989> up<00:00:53.170> already<00:00:53.649> so<00:00:53.739> he's<00:00:54.070> going<00:00:54.219> to<00:00:54.309> be

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
two evos up already so he's going to be

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.220 
two evos up already so he's going to be
doing<00:00:54.850> probably<00:00:55.360> a<00:00:55.480> bill<00:00:55.660> that<00:00:55.750> goes<00:00:55.899> straight

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
doing probably a bill that goes straight

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.049 
doing probably a bill that goes straight
into<00:00:56.410> ultras<00:00:56.739> making<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.309> lot<00:00:57.640> of<00:00:57.670> zerglings

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
into ultras making a lot of zerglings

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.420 
into ultras making a lot of zerglings
right<00:00:58.450> now<00:00:58.660> along<00:00:59.379> with<00:00:59.440> mule<00:00:59.800> escs<00:01:00.129> no

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
right now along with mule escs no

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.520 
right now along with mule escs no
hydrolysed<00:01:01.000> been<00:01:01.270> quite<00:01:01.629> yet<00:01:01.899> so<00:01:02.410> it<00:01:02.469> looks

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
hydrolysed been quite yet so it looks

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.900 
hydrolysed been quite yet so it looks
like<00:01:02.680> he<00:01:02.829> just<00:01:02.860> wants<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.250> bus<00:01:03.460> up<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.699> screen

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
like he just wants to bus up the screen

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.340 
like he just wants to bus up the screen
medica<00:01:04.210> I<00:01:04.270> mean<00:01:04.420> I<00:01:04.449> think<00:01:04.479> he's<00:01:04.899> gonna<00:01:05.110> have

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
medica I mean I think he's gonna have

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.290 
medica I mean I think he's gonna have
enough<00:01:05.560> used<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:05.950> do<00:01:06.130> it<00:01:06.310> all<00:01:06.490> right<00:01:07.000> here<00:01:07.060> we

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
enough used to do it all right here we

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.749 
enough used to do it all right here we
go<00:01:07.539> we've<00:01:07.990> got<00:01:08.140> no<00:01:08.500> real<00:01:08.890> medic<00:01:09.190> walls<00:01:09.430> here

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
go we've got no real medic walls here

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.749 
go we've got no real medic walls here
and<00:01:10.660> flies<00:01:11.140> trying<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.560> run<00:01:11.680> away<00:01:11.710> but<00:01:12.190> he's

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
and flies trying to run away but he's

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.340 
and flies trying to run away but he's
just<00:01:13.060> getting<00:01:13.240> slaughtered<00:01:13.899> here

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
just getting slaughtered here

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.250 
just getting slaughtered here
unfortunately<00:01:14.729> he<00:01:15.729> had

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
unfortunately he had

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.780 
unfortunately he had
one<00:01:18.260> more<00:01:18.440> time<00:01:18.620> like<00:01:18.950> if<00:01:19.160> you<00:01:19.280> had<00:01:19.340> those<00:01:19.550> from

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
one more time like if you had those from

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.730 
one more time like if you had those from
units<00:01:20.060> with<00:01:20.300> his<00:01:20.540> units<00:01:20.900> he<00:01:21.350> would<00:01:21.560> have<00:01:21.590> been

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
units with his units he would have been

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.380 
units with his units he would have been
able<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.040> hold<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:22.370> off<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.550> lot<00:01:22.880> better<00:01:23.150> at

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
able to hold this off a lot better at

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.380 
able to hold this off a lot better at
least<00:01:23.960> trade<00:01:24.530> armies<00:01:24.980> approximately<00:01:25.970> but<00:01:26.330> he

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
least trade armies approximately but he

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.660 
least trade armies approximately but he
does<00:01:26.630> have<00:01:26.810> four<00:01:27.020> barracks<00:01:27.410> he<00:01:27.920> does<00:01:28.160> have<00:01:28.400> two

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
does have four barracks he does have two

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.850 
does have four barracks he does have two
sciences<00:01:29.330> I<00:01:29.570> rather<00:01:29.840> snark<00:01:30.290> respond<00:01:30.650> up<00:01:30.740> he

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
sciences I rather snark respond up he

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.840 
sciences I rather snark respond up he
has<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.010> signs<00:01:31.220> were<00:01:31.310> still<00:01:31.460> be<00:01:31.520> almost<00:01:31.670> done

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
has the signs were still be almost done

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.020 
has the signs were still be almost done
there<00:01:32.510> we<00:01:32.660> go<00:01:34.060> just<00:01:35.060> a<00:01:36.020> plus<00:01:36.320> one<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:37.030> avoid
