00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:10.490
 Yes, I heard about the Ozashiki Racer Channel 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.940
 Now I think I want to do the second round color springs 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.850
 It is 9 courses 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.850
 Oh dear 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:24.039
 Or even a disconnect or put the accelerator remains horizontal milk remained well at much that wonder if you know you 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:29.410
 By'm composition that very machine becomes unstable and that say 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.360
 Now 787 3 It's full open It is a very difficult car to spin and accelerator control 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:38.570
 In 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:38.570
 This time there is here where a little suspicious, but I think that I want to take Good luck 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.270
 End of the navigation me 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.530
 Me divided the spritz 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.970
 Early 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.230
 Naa early 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.380
 This is seven of Kan's relief 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.380
 Let's 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:04.010
 Well here is where the day is very easy to go Miura 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:08.240
 If I put sweat in this way, I will have a spacia. 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.310
 It seems like the nose and mouth can be carefully 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.450
 Otto got stuck too 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.159
 so 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.159
 Good luck here 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.290
 Finally Now is the next is very difficult left it is 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.760
 It's Koga, so I'm disturbing your moving attitude 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:34.620
 Probably so Hey Oh It is also here I 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:41.910
 You're over there too and you're in lift if you attack too much 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:43.290
 If you are bad, there is a great possibility that you will be that major , so the factor that does not attack in much 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:49.020
 is not it 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.860
 Please note that you will know the shortcut if you attack too much as you did earlier 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.790
 Ne 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.040
 It is so easy to come out 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.050
 Now 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.460
 9th 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.670
 Because there is something , this time too 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.390
 There is only one crowd 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.560
 Yonesu guitar department 1 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:10.950
 It's okay, I'll pull it out here 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.300
 I entered the inn but it's a bit suspicious 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.300
 Oh Sha It is ok 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.180
 Naa's easier and still there is a power 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.799
 It is very easy 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.799
 I can't leave it on the rise 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:31.470
 If it is not necessary to put together the necessary point a little 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.200
 I do spin, but this is the place 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.140
 truly 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.520
 Carefully carefully god 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.630
 Control 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.630
 I aimed for a moment 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.830
 Let's say there is power 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:58.390
 Such a course was also wide, but when I was doing with 86 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:03:02.840
 When it comes to speed from the real cat, it will use the entire road full 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.170
 It seems like a very narrow course. 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.680
 OK here 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.969
 Great 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.969
 It does not flow out 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.099
 HayashiOsamu of Ah-tier unit 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.020

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.300
 Oh you can see the third place 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.940
 It is easy to come here 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.430
 Is it web? 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.430

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.439

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.000
 Well I'm sorry 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.890

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.460
 I want me to join me, the methane department wants to participate there 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.630

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:17.320

 Anna is a push Hong feeling 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.419
 Bad idea 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.419
 The line is amazing and it's Sapphire's lap 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.969
 I'm screwing up so as not to miss 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.480
 I would like to go without water 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:37.190

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.400
 Kana from beginning to end good good good person lined want to pass the 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.670
 Let's meet the score 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.490
 Tofuku flour 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:52.849
 there is no line 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:55.839
 I have no line if it overhangs every time I meet so much 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.839
 Yeah remember One 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.930

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.190
 Sweet 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.190
 I'm sorry 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.670
 I wonder if this was dropped 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.310
 Early 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.840
 Fast 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.840
 Michael will be a brake too 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.699
 Push down 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.020
 Was a mother useless 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.020
 It was useless 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.360
 Naa it was rising and voice anywhere 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.540
 I see, ha ha ha 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:45.220
 ho can not help 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.220
 I do not guess this just is insanely fast guy in the v 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.250
 Not say that 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:58.070
 This time my brother is over, sorry 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:01.660
 What does it mean Toyota 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:07.449
 Is it written that it is because Mazda is hated? 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:11.230
 Well, but it has become just a good point difference it a little top 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:17.320
 How does the third round move next time 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:18.820
 It is expected by all means, but it will be 4 minutes and 5 minutes a little in animation 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.510
 Oh dear 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:28.280
 It is this time because I want to do it carefully It is one by one 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.000
 I 'll run away one more voice, but I'm thinking that I'm going to finish here this time 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.890
 I am 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.270
 Sorry to say a little selfish and if it is possible to become take a look, but Seriously or Iwane 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.660
