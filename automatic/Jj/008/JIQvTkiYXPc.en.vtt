00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.840
 but by all guys fourth book 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.270
 hachette 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 today this our new video vi 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.639
 they'll show you a trick on how 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.679
 camping on the already presses first 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.379
 you must have the pon pon and as a weapon 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.199
 secondary and the shield then 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.570
 first of all you have to do mainly 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.269
 domain and you must be born on this side 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.820
 that people now my one 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.830
 fuzzy sensibility born of this 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.619
 what why leave this way with 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 the shield first thought one 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.489
 claymore which with the shield you will put on 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.489
 here I go on to check if two 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.770
 doors and how this strategy o 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.500
 solicit 70 even if a little 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.230
 assholes because I wo n't like kings 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.350
 just to maybe raise a little wrong but 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.350
 so it is you can see so it is not which 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.120
 are looked at I'm sure more fields 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.739
 scarce will succeed in doing good 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.780
 obviously you need to have vouchers 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.430
 reflections because if you do maybe 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.890
 checking paintings with enemy from here 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.710
 you need to have some reflexes 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.040
 to move the veni language collector 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.799
 that is, if no one comes to the beginning 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.500
 north that you are angry that is not to do 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.909
 this this trick must have 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.950
 very much patience 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.409
 exactly why not wait 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.570
 a few friends arrive since ie 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.960
 frightened over the other part in the wall 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.820
 that had already arrived now we are here and 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.439
 you will really have serious moments 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.890
 of points are passive I would recommend 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.900
 use the guardian and the turret because 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.220
 you want to control better to choose 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.049
 better people than told 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.030
 guardian lands here the enemies 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.220
 they will come more calmly and they will be 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.259
 really bothered by the guardian 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.260
 severely collector of Venice 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.500
 you are monsters with 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.010
 the core of the exact guard towers 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.670
 then as the trophy system c4 the bombs 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.860
 grenades all things will not have 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.780
 effect on you so I recommend you 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.760
 put wait for it to arrive some 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.090
 another hollow enemy and we know that not 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.180
 finish the video we got a bit of 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.770
 enemies we will show you that you use that i 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.020
 our videos can last a while 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.320
 last maximum 6 7 minutes and sensible but 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.870
 then we'll take some pmi milk maybe 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.390
 whoever wants to excuse another will do it again 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.010
 lobuono much better videos in hd 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.230
 the arrival of enemies a little strange because of 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.330
 usually they arrive after a little bit for 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.120
 have slowly come to life he was born he gets up 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.360
 exact is a method of raising a lot 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.540
 the radio to eat but a friend is 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.440
 they remain my companion what it is 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.510
 good to do in fact a certain friend mode 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.700
 because now with co-presence because 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.930
 as a reward I usually know what 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.930

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.190
