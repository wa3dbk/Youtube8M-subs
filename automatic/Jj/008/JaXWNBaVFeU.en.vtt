00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.890 
we're going to talk a little bit about
the<00:00:10.320> drop<00:00:10.620> cast<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.059> something<00:00:12.270> that<00:00:12.480> is

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the drop cast this is something that is

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.180 
the drop cast this is something that is
just<00:00:13.440> hugely<00:00:14.040> important<00:00:14.639> as

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.070 

the<00:00:18.190> primary<00:00:18.490> goal<00:00:19.000> is<00:00:19.030> whenever<00:00:19.750> your

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
the primary goal is whenever your

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.690 
the primary goal is whenever your
nymphing<00:00:20.410> you<00:00:20.529> want<00:00:20.710> to<00:00:20.800> get<00:00:20.920> down<00:00:21.160> to<00:00:21.550> those

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
nymphing you want to get down to those

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.350 
nymphing you want to get down to those
fish<00:00:22.090> fast<00:00:22.390> you<00:00:23.260> know<00:00:23.410> and<00:00:23.710> that<00:00:24.010> is<00:00:24.250> it's<00:00:25.210> one

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
fish fast you know and that is it's one

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.790 
fish fast you know and that is it's one
of<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:25.510> toughest<00:00:25.869> things<00:00:25.869> to<00:00:26.200> do<00:00:26.320> I<00:00:26.349> mean<00:00:26.590> once

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
of the toughest things to do I mean once

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.290 
of the toughest things to do I mean once
you<00:00:26.920> started<00:00:27.160> get<00:00:27.340> dragged<00:00:27.610> involved<00:00:28.180> and

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
you started get dragged involved and

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.420 
you started get dragged involved and
whatnot<00:00:28.630> your<00:00:29.140> fly<00:00:29.380> is<00:00:29.410> going<00:00:29.680> to<00:00:29.740> ride<00:00:29.980> really

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
whatnot your fly is going to ride really

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.210 
whatnot your fly is going to ride really
high<00:00:30.820> in<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.210> water<00:00:31.450> but<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.560> drop<00:00:32.800> cast<00:00:33.070> is

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
high in the water but the drop cast is

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.950 
high in the water but the drop cast is
going<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.430> give<00:00:33.579> you<00:00:33.670> your<00:00:33.850> best<00:00:34.180> advantage<00:00:34.540> to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
going to give you your best advantage to

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.430 
going to give you your best advantage to
get<00:00:35.170> that<00:00:35.290> fly<00:00:35.620> down<00:00:35.920> there<00:00:36.160> fast<00:00:36.579> so<00:00:37.540> we<00:00:38.260> got

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
get that fly down there fast so we got

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.440 
get that fly down there fast so we got
our<00:00:38.470> nymph<00:00:38.770> tied<00:00:39.010> on<00:00:39.190> here<00:00:39.579> I'm<00:00:40.120> going<00:00:40.239> to<00:00:40.329> go

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
our nymph tied on here I'm going to go

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.440 
our nymph tied on here I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:40.690> set<00:00:41.079> my<00:00:41.230> depth<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.850> my<00:00:43.000> indicator

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
ahead and set my depth on my indicator

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.840 
ahead and set my depth on my indicator
you<00:00:44.260> know<00:00:44.380> and<00:00:44.530> i'm<00:00:44.649> gonna<00:00:44.770> i'm<00:00:45.640> going<00:00:45.790> to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
you know and i'm gonna i'm going to

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.849 
you know and i'm gonna i'm going to
target<00:00:46.030> this<00:00:46.300> thing<00:00:46.600> for<00:00:46.870> what<00:00:47.079> i<00:00:47.110> think<00:00:47.710> is

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
target this thing for what i think is

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.369 
target this thing for what i think is
the<00:00:48.039> depth<00:00:48.309> that<00:00:48.460> i'm<00:00:48.730> fishing<00:00:49.000> too<00:00:49.359> and<00:00:50.079> maybe

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
the depth that i'm fishing too and maybe

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.000 
the depth that i'm fishing too and maybe
add<00:00:50.769> you<00:00:51.579> know<00:00:51.699> 12<00:00:52.359> inches<00:00:52.750> extra<00:00:53.109> maybe<00:00:53.469> you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
add you know 12 inches extra maybe you

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.770 
add you know 12 inches extra maybe you
want<00:00:54.190> maybe<00:00:54.429> you<00:00:55.059> probably<00:00:55.359> want<00:00:55.539> to<00:00:55.570> be<00:00:55.660> on

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
want maybe you probably want to be on

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.240 
want maybe you probably want to be on
the<00:00:55.870> deep<00:00:56.079> side<00:00:56.379> rather<00:00:56.649> than<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.039> shallow

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
the deep side rather than the shallow

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.889 
the deep side rather than the shallow
side<00:00:57.550> but<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.559> drop<00:00:59.890> cast<00:01:00.749> what<00:01:01.749> we're

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
side but so the drop cast what we're

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.829 
side but so the drop cast what we're
basically<00:01:02.019> doing<00:01:02.530> is<00:01:02.890> we<00:01:03.100> want<00:01:03.339> to<00:01:03.429> kind<00:01:03.609> of

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
basically doing is we want to kind of

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.080 
basically doing is we want to kind of
overpower<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:05.230> cast<00:01:05.470> just<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:06.010> little<00:01:06.310> bit<00:01:06.520> or

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
overpower the cast just a little bit or

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.640 
overpower the cast just a little bit or
sometimes<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.690> even<00:01:07.780> helps<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.260> think<00:01:08.440> of<00:01:08.590> it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
sometimes it even helps to think of it

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.910 
sometimes it even helps to think of it
as<00:01:08.710> drawing<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.460> rod<00:01:09.610> back<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:11.470> pretty

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
as drawing the rod back it's pretty

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.950 
as drawing the rod back it's pretty
similar<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.460> a<00:01:12.610> parachute<00:01:13.150> cast<00:01:13.450> with<00:01:13.659> a<00:01:13.690> dry

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
similar to a parachute cast with a dry

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.110 
similar to a parachute cast with a dry
fly<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.890> what's<00:01:15.070> like<00:01:15.220> what<00:01:15.640> that's<00:01:15.850> going<00:01:16.060> to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
fly and what's like what that's going to

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.570 
fly and what's like what that's going to
do<00:01:16.420> is<00:01:17.140> when<00:01:17.350> you're<00:01:17.500> nine<00:01:17.680> straightens<00:01:18.340> out

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
do is when you're nine straightens out

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.249 
do is when you're nine straightens out
it's<00:01:19.210> going<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.420> come<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.869> end<00:01:20.020> of<00:01:20.079> its

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
it's going to come to the end of its

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.380 
it's going to come to the end of its
travel<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:20.979> it's<00:01:21.100> going<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.369> kind<00:01:21.520> of<00:01:21.670> stopped

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
travel and it's going to kind of stopped

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.630 
travel and it's going to kind of stopped
dead<00:01:22.750> at<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.049> end<00:01:23.079> of<00:01:23.290> that<00:01:23.380> travel<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.430> when

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
dead at the end of that travel and when

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.319 
dead at the end of that travel and when
it<00:01:24.790> does<00:01:25.000> that<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:27.040> fly<00:01:27.399> is<00:01:27.430> gonna<00:01:27.939> swing

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
it does that your fly is gonna swing

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.810 
it does that your fly is gonna swing
down<00:01:28.600> below<00:01:29.200> your<00:01:29.470> indicator<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.189> it's<00:01:30.700> going

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
down below your indicator and it's going

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.120 
down below your indicator and it's going
to<00:01:30.880> drop<00:01:31.240> and<00:01:31.600> hit<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.200> water<00:01:32.409> before<00:01:32.740> your

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
to drop and hit the water before your

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.160 
to drop and hit the water before your
indicator<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:34.360> you<00:01:34.509> might<00:01:34.659> not<00:01:34.810> think<00:01:34.869> that

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
indicator and you might not think that

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.620 
indicator and you might not think that
that<00:01:35.380> would<00:01:35.500> be<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.680> huge<00:01:36.009> deal<00:01:36.340> but<00:01:36.759> when<00:01:37.210> that

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
that would be a huge deal but when that

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.389 
that would be a huge deal but when that
fly<00:01:38.079> when<00:01:38.469> it's<00:01:38.590> something<00:01:38.829> like<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.070> tungsten

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
fly when it's something like a tungsten

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.410 
fly when it's something like a tungsten
nymph<00:01:39.909> it's<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.810> water<00:01:41.049> a<00:01:42.149> second<00:01:43.149> two

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
nymph it's the water a second two

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.810 
nymph it's the water a second two
seconds<00:01:43.869> before<00:01:44.079> your<00:01:44.409> indicator<00:01:44.860> does<00:01:45.100> that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
seconds before your indicator does that

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.120 
seconds before your indicator does that
thing<00:01:46.000> has<00:01:46.240> no<00:01:46.570> drag<00:01:46.990> whatsoever<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.009> is

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
thing has no drag whatsoever and it is

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.249 
thing has no drag whatsoever and it is
sinking<00:01:48.579> straight<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.210> bottom<00:01:49.390> it's<00:01:50.079> the

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
sinking straight to the bottom it's the

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.080 
sinking straight to the bottom it's the
best<00:01:50.560> possible<00:01:50.829> way<00:01:51.159> that<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.520> can<00:01:51.729> get<00:01:51.909> your

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
best possible way that you can get your

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.749 
best possible way that you can get your
your<00:01:52.600> fly<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.140> bottom<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:54.189> know<00:01:54.340> a

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
your fly to the bottom and you know a

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.370 
your fly to the bottom and you know a
lot<00:01:55.299> of<00:01:55.329> times<00:01:55.659> when<00:01:55.810> you're<00:01:55.960> fishing<00:01:56.140> a

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
lot of times when you're fishing a

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.529 
lot of times when you're fishing a
riffle<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:56.979> very<00:01:57.280> important<00:01:57.939> that<00:01:58.149> you

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
riffle it is very important that you

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.779 
riffle it is very important that you
maximize<00:01:59.469> your<00:01:59.500> drift<00:02:00.039> time<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.609> get

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
maximize your drift time that you get

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.389 
maximize your drift time that you get
down<00:02:01.090> as<00:02:01.479> quick<00:02:01.780> as<00:02:01.930> possible<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:03.280> is

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
down as quick as possible and this is

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.520 
down as quick as possible and this is
going<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.609> allow<00:02:03.789> you<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.090> do<00:02:04.329> that<00:02:04.530> especially

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
going to allow you to do that especially

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.260 
going to allow you to do that especially
you<00:02:05.649> know<00:02:05.770> here's<00:02:06.039> a<00:02:06.100> prime<00:02:06.460> example<00:02:06.490> this

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
you know here's a prime example this

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.380 
you know here's a prime example this
riffle<00:02:07.719> we've<00:02:07.869> got<00:02:08.080> right<00:02:08.320> here<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.610> it's

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
riffle we've got right here it is it's

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.750 
riffle we've got right here it is it's
fast<00:02:10.750> water<00:02:11.110> right<00:02:11.560> next<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.950> some<00:02:12.130> slow<00:02:12.490> water

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
fast water right next to some slow water

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.910 
fast water right next to some slow water
and<00:02:13.720> I'm<00:02:13.840> going<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.020> be<00:02:14.140> trying<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.560> hit<00:02:14.740> as

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and I'm going to be trying to hit as

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.610 
and I'm going to be trying to hit as
tight<00:02:15.280> as<00:02:15.460> I<00:02:15.550> can<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.120> seem<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:17.290> try<00:02:17.470> and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
tight as I can to that seem to try and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.920 
tight as I can to that seem to try and
pick<00:02:17.740> up<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:18.010> fish<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:19.360> know<00:02:19.600> it's<00:02:19.780> got

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
pick up a fish and you know it's got

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.690 
pick up a fish and you know it's got
some<00:02:20.080> good<00:02:20.290> depth<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.070> want<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.340> get<00:02:21.430> down

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
some good depth so I want to get down

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.420 
some good depth so I want to get down
where<00:02:22.120> those<00:02:22.300> fish<00:02:22.570> are<00:02:22.690> at<00:02:22.840> right<00:02:23.170> away

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
where those fish are at right away

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.679 
where those fish are at right away
so<00:02:24.579> I'm<00:02:24.760> going<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.939> go<00:02:25.090> ahead<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.269> start

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
so I'm going to go ahead and start

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:31.360 
so I'm going to go ahead and start
making<00:02:26.579> making<00:02:27.579> a<00:02:27.790> few<00:02:28.030> cast<00:02:28.269> here

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.309 

you<00:02:31.879> see<00:02:32.030> I'm<00:02:32.150> gonna<00:02:32.299> just<00:02:32.659> stop<00:02:33.290> my<00:02:33.530> rod<00:02:33.769> hi

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
you see I'm gonna just stop my rod hi

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.840 
you see I'm gonna just stop my rod hi
and<00:02:36.319> I'll<00:02:36.440> do<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.799> few<00:02:36.950> times<00:02:37.159> for<00:02:37.670> here

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.440 

you<00:02:41.450> know<00:02:41.540> normally<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:42.910> would<00:02:43.910> be<00:02:44.030> making<00:02:44.240> a

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
you know normally I would be making a

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.770 
you know normally I would be making a
cast<00:02:44.720> where<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.650> would<00:02:46.010> um<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.580> would<00:02:47.270> finish<00:02:47.480> off

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
cast where I would um I would finish off

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.860 
cast where I would um I would finish off
my<00:02:47.990> forward<00:02:48.440> cast<00:02:48.740> and<00:02:49.210> just<00:02:50.210> bring<00:02:50.390> my<00:02:50.630> line

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
my forward cast and just bring my line

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.170 
my forward cast and just bring my line
down<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.380> water<00:02:51.590> but<00:02:52.460> on<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.640> drop<00:02:52.850> cast

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
down to the water but on the drop cast

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.020 
down to the water but on the drop cast
I'm<00:02:53.600> going<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.780> stop<00:02:54.170> high<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.890> it's<00:02:55.820> going<00:02:55.940> to

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
I'm going to stop high and it's going to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.050 
I'm going to stop high and it's going to
drop<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.600> fly<00:02:56.960> down<00:02:57.320> below<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:58.010> indicator

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.420 

and<00:03:02.060> then<00:03:02.320> hopefully<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:03.590> gets<00:03:03.710> us<00:03:03.890> down<00:03:04.130> deep

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
and then hopefully it gets us down deep

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.570 
and then hopefully it gets us down deep
into<00:03:04.640> that<00:03:04.930> into<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:05.960> edge<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.560> we<00:03:06.650> can<00:03:06.830> pick

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
into that into that edge and we can pick

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.630 
into that into that edge and we can pick
up<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.850> fish<00:03:10.570> yeah<00:03:11.570> that<00:03:11.810> was<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:11.960> good<00:03:12.110> one<00:03:12.640> he

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
up a fish yeah that was a good one he

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.310 
up a fish yeah that was a good one he
you<00:03:14.150> know<00:03:14.240> if<00:03:14.300> you've<00:03:14.420> got<00:03:14.630> really<00:03:14.870> good<00:03:15.080> eyes

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
you know if you've got really good eyes

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.850 
you know if you've got really good eyes
you<00:03:15.620> can<00:03:15.800> keep<00:03:16.010> an<00:03:16.130> eye<00:03:16.310> on<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.710> you<00:03:18.710> can

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
you can keep an eye on that and you can

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.770 
you can keep an eye on that and you can
actually<00:03:19.040> see<00:03:19.250> your<00:03:19.790> nymph<00:03:20.030> splash<00:03:20.450> down

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
actually see your nymph splash down

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.410 
actually see your nymph splash down
before<00:03:21.320> your<00:03:21.500> indicator<00:03:21.950> hits<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:24.620> that's

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
before your indicator hits and that's

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.870 
before your indicator hits and that's
that's<00:03:26.420> when<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.810> know<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:28.340> drop<00:03:28.580> it<00:03:28.790> in

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
that's when you know you and drop it in

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:37.440 
that's when you know you and drop it in
there<00:03:29.030> just<00:03:29.330> right

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.480 

another<00:03:38.450> nice<00:03:38.690> thing<00:03:38.720> about<00:03:38.990> it<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:40.190> helps

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
another nice thing about it is it helps

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.420 
another nice thing about it is it helps
orient<00:03:40.990> orient<00:03:41.990> orientate<00:03:42.950> your<00:03:43.100> flies

orient orient orientate your flies
