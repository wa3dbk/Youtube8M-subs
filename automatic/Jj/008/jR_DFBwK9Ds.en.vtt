00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
dessert cocktail they order this by

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.329 
dessert cocktail they order this by
default<00:00:16.900> a<00:00:17.140> White<00:00:17.650> Russian

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:18.339 
default a White Russian

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.909 
default a White Russian
started<00:00:18.849> off<00:00:18.970> its<00:00:19.210> life<00:00:19.449> as<00:00:19.660> a<00:00:19.720> black<00:00:20.409> Russian

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
started off its life as a black Russian

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.980 
started off its life as a black Russian
which<00:00:21.460> is<00:00:21.640> an<00:00:21.789> alcohol<00:00:22.269> and<00:00:22.390> ice<00:00:22.480> only<00:00:22.779> drink

which is an alcohol and ice only drink

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.589 
which is an alcohol and ice only drink

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
so therefore it goes into a rocks glass

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.599 
so therefore it goes into a rocks glass
so<00:00:26.259> little<00:00:26.710> bit<00:00:26.800> smaller<00:00:27.069> than<00:00:27.189> your<00:00:27.339> highball

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
one that they know this is the first one

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
one that they know this is the first one
that<00:01:43.659> comes<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.960> mind<00:01:44.080> so<00:01:44.200> they<00:01:44.290> disorder

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
that comes to mind so they disorder

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.980 
that comes to mind so they disorder
White<00:01:45.430> Russian<00:01:45.729> they<00:01:46.450> don't<00:01:46.630> really<00:01:46.750> know

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
White Russian they don't really know

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.740 
White Russian they don't really know
that<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.350> thing<00:01:47.409> is<00:01:48.030> two<00:01:49.030> ounces<00:01:49.420> of<00:01:49.479> alcohol

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
that this thing is two ounces of alcohol

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.490 
that this thing is two ounces of alcohol
so<00:01:50.619> this<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:51.010> breaking<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.820> highball<00:01:52.240> glass

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
