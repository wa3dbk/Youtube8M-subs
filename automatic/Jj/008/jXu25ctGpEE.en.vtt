00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:22.530
 pou dou dou 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.270
 What 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:31.070
 It is such a pattern that I would like to introduce you soon 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.240
 It is a lifetime No. 2 is this kind of pattern 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.900
 turn to ah 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.560
 Usual 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.800
 Since this in you Yes by connecting towards the shake of Tteyuu 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.650
 Two chapters explanation pattern of flexible one woman 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.250
 It feels a little similar 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:52.280
 And the 18th day I went last time 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.470
 It looks like I'm looking a little more into the pattern 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.340
 If you can also steam , there is 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.810
 Because 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.740
 think 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.740
 Well then yeah 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:09.050
 Let's do it together really slowly 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:11.890
 The headache and the peg not a throat Pasupasu Park Pan and language 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.890
 It is the taste of this time 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.590
 Booby orz 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.530
 Would have went I How do and and and second chapter describes a little Polyrhythm 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.500
 The 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.490
 Heavy a 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.490
 Something like this 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.400
 Belgium is the second night 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.810
 It seems to be coming in twice from now but now 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:03.180
 2 and 2 from this left hand 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.180
 Capture and from here I feel it 's Fi down 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.539
 Have 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.790
 Selfish dream it was tanka was 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:19.329
 It was like 56 May with three 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:23.140
 First of all the first run usually but little in making it to the head which also introduces the procedure a little 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:28.190
 Taking souvenir and is usually 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.550
 'S dad is the beginning of a strong third night burn 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.160
 The 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.580
 And the eighth beat 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.250
 r 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.910
 Ah ah ah ah ah 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.640
 It has become 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:47.750
 Do you understand ? A little bit once and practice without that poly rhythm or something like that 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.750
 It may be good too 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.640
 headache 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.980

 Poop 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.010
 Design road has become To Dawn It is the beginning of the next beat 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.519
 It feels poly rhythm like a Once you ne 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.519
 Feeling flow 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.450
 I think I Na or not it can be cool playing when you can 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:28.560
 So far for blogs I 'm writing a little more 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:30.590
 I think it will be easy to understand if you look at this person because it is in the Diet 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.819
 Then 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.000

 1 pool e o 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.560
 I feel that if I do this fairly quickly, the seven ways are complicated 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.620
 I mean move Naha line Okkii you covered Chitcha 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.769
 Reason to use is quite difficult 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.150
 If you can not do it, please try if it is really slow 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.690
 If you can net speed up 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.690
 Cool rhythm 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:05:00.050
