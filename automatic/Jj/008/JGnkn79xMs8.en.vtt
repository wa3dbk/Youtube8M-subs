00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 and a very brave locomotive never 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.519
 he stopped protesting he complained that he did not 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.469
 I had illustrated it enough that 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.870
 I had a lot of work and especially 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.210
 I complained about the passengers 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.670
 new shame duncan sons carlos 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.740
 thank god kings will come back soon 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.710
 maybe I'll teach you to go into reasons 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.650
 before it's too late 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.300
 little you had with me 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.000
 first except our rail 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.560
 I answered is carlo today please 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.410
 tell us what happened 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.000
 he asked to sound good healthy began to take it out 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.010
 today they play since you will arrive 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.020
 here things were wrong 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.090
 rené well I had to keep the 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.230
 running trains or the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.230
 railroad would close 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.820
 what fright murmured peter shan 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.820
 I did everything I could to continue Carlos 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.590
 but my old wheels hurt lines 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.710
 understood the situation now is my 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.390
 shift he told me sometimes he ran out 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.710
 steam but he always tried hard to 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.199
 get to the station and then 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.540
 I rested a bit, I should not stop at 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.840
 three stations said to the passengers not 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.310
 they would like 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.670
 do not 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.320
 snorts he had never stopped at the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.630
 viaduct and it had not mattered 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.850
 more minimum continuous passengers 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.950
 Carlos gets angry if one stops in a 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.600
 place that is not appropriate once 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.979
 rené stopped at a place that was not the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.979
 appropriate and that's what happened 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.640
 a wet and windy afternoon the tracks 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.150
 They were wet and rené as was coming back with 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.730
 a train full of people there were passengers 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.770
 even in the caboose 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.770
 It was a trip for nothing comfortable 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.090
 the hostage wheels were still 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.840
 backing up and the slope was 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.840
 pronounced 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.420
 finally the wheels adhered well 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.660
 to the tracks again the worst happened 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.660
 he thought we're leaving but it was not like that 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.380
 I have a cramp growled 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.610
 and rené ace stopped in the most 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.820
 lonely travel 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.040
 the engineer go over it carefully if 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.800
 it locked the valve we have to get to 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.700
 the next station you think you can 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.340
 take us there 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.340
 I will do my best replied rené as 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.390
 in that effort all he could 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.000
 If the station did not arrive, he thought 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.600
 passengers will get angry and close the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.600
 railway 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.050
 everything became blurry and it was too 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.770
 tired to keep spinning his 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.770
 wheels but the curls over and over again 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.220
 finally exhausted but triumphant 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.060
 gullies came to the station finally 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.060
 come whistle 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.990

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.240
 passengers we will tell our 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.810
 friends that this railroad is very good 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.820
 the machinist was delighted you are a 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.010
 very brave little locomotive told him 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.870

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.010
 we will repair so that you are ready to 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.400
 morning 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.769
 they are garlow rivers 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.400
 reverse was always ready for the day 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.049
 following 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.959
 thank you for telling us your story 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.310
 Whisper was never wrong 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.310
 passengers if they are important 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.370
 rené as the next day return 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.730
 all the locomotives were there 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.860
 to greet him 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.420
 Edward pushed his van to a track 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.239
 dead where they put it back 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.890
 on tracks formed of a chorus 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.250
 whistles of large locomotives and 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.299
 little ones were all happy and I rented 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.419
 he will be the happiest of all 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.220
 you know one thing I whisper to scar I heard this 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.990

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.990
 feel like I 'm coming home
