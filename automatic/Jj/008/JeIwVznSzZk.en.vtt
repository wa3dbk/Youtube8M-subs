and<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.440> other<00:00:58.650> thing<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:59.040> really<00:00:59.190> cool

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
and the other thing that's really cool

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.970 
and the other thing that's really cool
about<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.180> layout<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.500> thing<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.829> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
about this layout the the thing that I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.050 
about this layout the the thing that I
think<00:01:02.190> makes<00:01:02.370> him<00:01:02.550> win<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.329> much<00:01:03.570> defenses<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
think makes him win so much defenses is

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.639 
think makes him win so much defenses is
this<00:01:06.060> right<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.630> level<00:01:07.079> 1<00:01:07.229> cannon

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
this right here that level 1 cannon

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.289 
this right here that level 1 cannon
that's<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.039> star<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.609> defense<00:01:08.999> right<00:01:09.179> in

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that's the star of the defense right in

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.999 
that's the star of the defense right in
the<00:01:09.390> middle<00:01:09.569> really<00:01:10.200> ties<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.829> base

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
the middle really ties to the base

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.760 
the middle really ties to the base
together<00:01:11.249> but<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.210> any<00:01:12.359> case<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.619> most

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
together but in any case for the most

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.639 
together but in any case for the most
part<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.429> goal<00:01:14.969> wipe<00:01:15.420> attack<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:16.469> the

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
part we have a goal wipe attack at the

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.020 
part we have a goal wipe attack at the
moment<00:01:17.039> I'm<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.579> to<00:01:17.640> show<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.789> another

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030

replay and then I'll show you like the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.830 
replay and then I'll show you like the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
traps in the Tesla's let me go ahead and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.069 
traps in the Tesla's let me go ahead and
speed<00:01:22.079> this<00:01:22.229> rate<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.649> little<00:01:22.679> bit<00:01:23.009> more<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
speed this rate up a little bit more and

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.999 
speed this rate up a little bit more and
so<00:01:25.079> he's<00:01:25.200> basically<00:01:25.469> sending<00:01:25.829> in<00:01:25.950> those

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
so he's basically sending in those

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.219 
so he's basically sending in those
golems<00:01:26.429> not<00:01:26.819> a<00:01:26.850> lot<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.119> wall<00:01:27.359> breakers<00:01:27.749> but

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
golems not a lot of wall breakers but

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.550 
golems not a lot of wall breakers but
it's<00:01:28.530> pretty<00:01:29.100> much<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.869> townhall<00:01:30.869> type<00:01:31.319> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
it's pretty much a townhall type of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.889 
it's pretty much a townhall type of
troll<00:01:31.950> base<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.429> he's<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.899> teasing

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
troll base because he's kind of teasing

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.419 
troll base because he's kind of teasing
that<00:01:33.929> Town<00:01:34.289> Hall<00:01:34.469> on<00:01:34.499> the<00:01:34.649> bottom<00:01:35.039> side<00:01:35.219> of<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
that Town Hall on the bottom side of the

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.249 
that Town Hall on the bottom side of the
base<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:35.819> you<00:01:36.149> try<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.389> break<00:01:36.600> into<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.990> middle

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
base if you try to break into the middle

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.349 
base if you try to break into the middle
or<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> bottom<00:01:38.340> side<00:01:38.670> then<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:38.999> have<00:01:39.149> those

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
or the bottom side then you have those

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.739 
or the bottom side then you have those
Tesla's<00:01:39.990> those<00:01:40.679> Inferno<00:01:41.429> towers<00:01:41.880> those<00:01:42.149> Expos

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:42.749 
Tesla's those Inferno towers those Expos

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:44.719 
Tesla's those Inferno towers those Expos
so<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> really<00:01:43.590> sort<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.009> teases<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.609> go

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

for<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:44.999> Town<00:01:45.240> Hall<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.009> have

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
for that Town Hall and then you have

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.919 
for that Town Hall and then you have
that<00:01:47.219> sort<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.609> Louisville<00:01:48.179> clan<00:01:48.450> castle<00:01:48.840> at

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
that sort of Louisville clan castle at

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.139 
that sort of Louisville clan castle at
the<00:01:48.959> on<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.469> right<00:01:49.920> hand<00:01:50.189> side<00:01:50.279> and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the on the right hand side and then the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.999 
the on the right hand side and then the
air<00:01:51.270> sweeper<00:01:51.630> facing<00:01:51.990> downwards<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.859> if<00:01:52.920> you

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
air sweeper facing downwards so if you

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.230 
air sweeper facing downwards so if you
were<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.279> try<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.520> attack<00:01:53.819> this<00:01:53.969> base<00:01:54.209> you

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
were to try to attack this base you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.580 
were to try to attack this base you
might<00:01:54.479> want<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.689> try<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> attack<00:01:55.139> from<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.380> top

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
might want to try to attack from the top

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.319 
might want to try to attack from the top
but<00:01:56.130> overall<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.639> sort<00:01:56.819> of<00:01:56.880> good<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.240> terms

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
but overall it's sort of good in terms

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.899 
but overall it's sort of good in terms
of<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.659> symmetry<00:01:58.139> perspective<00:01:59.039> alright<00:01:59.759> so

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
of that symmetry perspective alright so

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.289 
of that symmetry perspective alright so
that<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:01.079> attack<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.789> then<00:02:02.969> let's<00:02:03.119> go

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
that was that attack and then let's go
