it's a 1 by 10 it puts out 25 watts with
two<00:00:32.989> el84<00:00:34.149> power<00:00:35.149> tubes<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:35.890> it<00:00:36.890> can<00:00:37.069> also

two el84 power tubes and it can also
switch<00:00:37.579> down<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:37.819> five<00:00:38.420> watts<00:00:38.719> it<00:00:39.170> allows<00:00:39.409> the

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
switch down to five watts it allows the

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.910 
switch down to five watts it allows the
amp<00:00:39.769> to<00:00:40.039> go<00:00:40.190> from<00:00:40.460> Class<00:00:40.699> A<00:00:40.909> B<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.809> Class<00:00:42.050> A<00:00:42.319> and

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
amp to go from Class A B to Class A and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.549 
amp to go from Class A B to Class A and
in<00:00:43.489> Class<00:00:43.699> A<00:00:43.969> it's<00:00:44.359> true<00:00:44.870> single<00:00:45.260> ended

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
in Class A it's true single ended

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.410 
in Class A it's true single ended
running<00:00:46.159> at<00:00:46.219> five<00:00:46.429> watts<00:00:48.760> so<00:00:49.760> anyway<00:00:50.089> this<00:00:50.210> amp

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
running at five watts so anyway this amp

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.020 
running at five watts so anyway this amp
has<00:00:50.589> these<00:00:51.589> little<00:00:51.800> toggles<00:00:52.339> here<00:00:52.579> right<00:00:52.909> next

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
has these little toggles here right next

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.299 
has these little toggles here right next
to<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.239> input<00:00:53.479> jack<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.440> it<00:00:54.620> gives<00:00:54.799> you<00:00:54.979> it

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
to the input jack and it gives you it

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.430 
to the input jack and it gives you it
basically<00:00:56.030> changes<00:00:56.479> the<00:00:56.600> gain<00:00:56.780> structure<00:00:57.109> for

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
basically changes the gain structure for

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.500 
basically changes the gain structure for
each<00:00:57.469> channel<00:00:57.979> like<00:00:58.129> in<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.609> case<00:00:58.909> of<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:59.209> clean

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
each channel like in the case of a clean

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.739 
each channel like in the case of a clean
Channel<00:00:59.959> it's<00:01:00.499> got<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.069> the<00:01:01.609> upper<00:01:02.479> part

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
Channel it's got the the upper part

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.469 
Channel it's got the the upper part
upper<00:01:03.229> part<00:01:04.040> of<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.159> switch<00:01:04.370> is<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.580> clean<00:01:05.149> side

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
upper part of the switch is a clean side

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.420 
upper part of the switch is a clean side
then<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.869> move<00:01:06.259> it<00:01:06.380> down<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.130> goes<00:01:07.250> to

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
then you move it down and it goes to

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.190 
then you move it down and it goes to
crunch<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.030> obviously<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.539> can<00:01:08.659> go<00:01:08.840> from<00:01:09.079> a

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
crunch so obviously you can go from a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.149 
crunch so obviously you can go from a
real<00:01:09.380> clean

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
real clean

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.310 
real clean

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.880 

and<00:01:15.250> by<00:01:15.880> switching<00:01:16.300> it<00:01:16.390> down<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:17.050> maybe<00:01:17.680> by

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
and by switching it down and maybe by

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.830 
and by switching it down and maybe by
adjusting<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.400> gain<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.610> little<00:01:18.760> bit<00:01:18.880> you<00:01:19.120> get

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
adjusting the gain a little bit you get

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.710 
adjusting the gain a little bit you get

lower type gain setting it gets like you

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:47.130 
lower type gain setting it gets like you
know<00:01:38.590> kind<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.160> a<00:01:39.220> fat<00:01:39.400> overdrive<00:01:39.850> set<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:47.050> if
