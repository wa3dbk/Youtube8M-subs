00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
and I thought it would be a good way to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.020 
and I thought it would be a good way to
close<00:01:15.049> this<00:01:16.049> some<00:01:16.320> rotor<00:01:17.130> xenoverse<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.850> had

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
close this some rotor xenoverse we had

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.109 
close this some rotor xenoverse we had
going<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:19.140> um<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.890> game<00:01:20.070> itself<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.759> really
