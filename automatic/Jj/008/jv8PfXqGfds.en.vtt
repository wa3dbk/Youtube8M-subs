over<00:01:58.140> resource<00:01:58.469> development<00:01:58.710> what<00:01:59.159> do<00:01:59.399> you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
over resource development what do you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.709 
over resource development what do you
think<00:01:59.579> are<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.700> biggest<00:01:59.820> forces<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.540> year

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
think are the biggest forces this year

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.530 
think are the biggest forces this year
well<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.530> gold<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.670> know<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:02.969> basically

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
well for gold you know it's basically

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.539 
well for gold you know it's basically
supply<00:02:04.110> demand<00:02:04.380> fundamentals<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.369> it's

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
supply demand fundamentals and it's

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.910 
supply demand fundamentals and it's
bifurcated<00:02:06.390> between<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
bifurcated between a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.130 
bifurcated between a
a<00:02:08.009> paper<00:02:08.490> gold<00:02:08.819> market<00:02:09.240> which<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.450> much<00:02:09.840> bigger

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
a paper gold market which is much bigger

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.589 
a paper gold market which is much bigger

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
than physical gold mark we still see

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.080 
than physical gold mark we still see
very<00:02:12.959> strong<00:02:13.319> physical<00:02:13.950> buying<00:02:14.190> especially

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090

from China China and India but the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.720 
from China China and India but the
perception<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.230> not<00:02:19.260> always<00:02:19.920> what's<00:02:20.370> really

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
perception is not always what's really

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.910

prices<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.150> these<00:02:57.330> commodity<00:02:57.900> prices<00:02:58.380> world

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
prices so these commodity prices world

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.750 
prices so these commodity prices world
demand<00:02:59.430> remains<00:03:00.060> strong<00:03:00.569> except<00:03:01.110> for<00:03:01.290> oil<00:03:01.760> but

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
demand remains strong except for oil but

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.000 
demand remains strong except for oil but
certainly<00:03:03.120> for<00:03:03.420> copper<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.049> so<00:03:04.739> from<00:03:04.980> that

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
certainly for copper and so from that

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.610 
certainly for copper and so from that
point<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.489> view<00:03:05.549> i<00:03:05.940> would<00:03:06.450> think<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.750> it

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
point of view i would think that it

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.710 
point of view i would think that it
might<00:03:08.190> be<00:03:08.250> time<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.760> pick<00:03:08.940> up<00:03:09.060> some<00:03:09.299> copper

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
might be time to pick up some copper
