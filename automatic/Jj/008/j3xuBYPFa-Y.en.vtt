00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
the same thing but they don't know how

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.650 
the same thing but they don't know how
to<00:00:17.320> take<00:00:17.530> the<00:00:17.800> third<00:00:18.490> brake<00:00:18.790> light<00:00:18.820> down<00:00:19.270> in

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
to take the third brake light down in

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.310 
to take the third brake light down in
order<00:00:20.080> to<00:00:20.290> get<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.680> module<00:00:21.510> wired<00:00:22.510> up<00:00:22.750> and<00:00:22.930> put

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
order to get the module wired up and put

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.150 
order to get the module wired up and put
in<00:00:23.470> I<00:00:24.280> did<00:00:24.700> a<00:00:24.760> search<00:00:25.030> on<00:00:25.410> YouTube<00:00:26.410> and<00:00:26.800> Google

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
in I did a search on YouTube and Google

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.750 
in I did a search on YouTube and Google
and<00:00:27.870> nobody<00:00:28.870> to<00:00:29.080> my<00:00:29.200> surprise<00:00:29.619> has<00:00:29.950> a<00:00:30.310> tutorial

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
and nobody to my surprise has a tutorial

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.860 
and nobody to my surprise has a tutorial
so<00:00:31.119> I<00:00:31.150> figured<00:00:31.630> I<00:00:31.810> would<00:00:31.840> be<00:00:32.289> the<00:00:32.439> first<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
so I figured I would be the first to

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.149 
so I figured I would be the first to
show<00:00:35.050> you<00:00:35.109> how<00:00:35.289> to<00:00:35.350> get<00:00:35.469> the<00:00:35.649> third<00:00:35.920> brake

you'll feel it click twice and that's as

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.700 
you'll feel it click twice and that's as
far<00:00:54.879> as<00:00:54.940> you<00:00:55.120> want<00:00:55.329> it<00:00:55.389> to<00:00:55.510> come<00:00:55.690> down<00:00:55.719> same

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
far as you want it to come down same

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.450 
far as you want it to come down same
thing<00:00:56.739> with<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.129> other<00:00:57.249> one<00:00:58.710> pry<00:00:59.710> down<00:00:59.769> very

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
thing with the other one pry down very

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.119 
thing with the other one pry down very
gently<00:01:00.850> maybe<00:01:01.499> if<00:01:02.499> you<00:01:02.739> have<00:01:02.889> a<00:01:02.920> rough

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
gently maybe if you have a rough

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.560 
gently maybe if you have a rough
screwdriver<00:01:03.760> put<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.059> piece<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.360> electrical

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
screwdriver put a piece of electrical

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.450 
screwdriver put a piece of electrical
tape<00:01:04.900> or<00:01:05.230> masking<00:01:05.350> tape<00:01:05.830> around<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:06.220> so<00:01:06.400> it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
tape or masking tape around it so it

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.600 
tape or masking tape around it so it
won't<00:01:06.610> scratch<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.360> third<00:01:07.570> brake<00:01:07.780> light<00:01:08.610> so

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
won't scratch the third brake light so

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.890 
won't scratch the third brake light so
that's<00:01:09.670> basically<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.240> can<00:01:10.390> pull<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.660> tabs

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
that's basically you can pull the tabs

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.890 
that's basically you can pull the tabs
down<00:01:11.020> that<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.650> far<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.220> then<00:01:13.180> right<00:01:13.630> here

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
down that that far and then right here

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.110 
down that that far and then right here
you'll<00:01:14.080> feel<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:14.320> little<00:01:14.590> groove<00:01:15.100> in<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.940> third

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
you'll feel a little groove in the third

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.180 
you'll feel a little groove in the third
brake<00:01:16.390> light<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:17.260> want<00:01:17.410> to<00:01:17.530> take<00:01:17.920> the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
brake light you want to take the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.670 
brake light you want to take the
flat-head<00:01:18.670> screwdriver<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.600> gently<00:01:20.200> pry

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
flat-head screwdriver and gently pry

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.340 
flat-head screwdriver and gently pry
down<00:01:20.920> on<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:22.870> go<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:24.220> loose<00:01:24.490> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
down on it there you go it's loose you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.560 
down on it there you go it's loose you
can<00:01:26.350> see<00:01:26.770> without<00:01:27.490> me<00:01:27.610> taking<00:01:27.910> it<00:01:28.030> completely

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
can see without me taking it completely

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.510 
can see without me taking it completely
down<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.900> can<00:01:29.050> see<00:01:29.320> what<00:01:29.800> it's<00:01:29.950> held<00:01:30.160> in<00:01:30.310> with

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
down you can see what it's held in with

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.270 
down you can see what it's held in with
there's<00:01:31.210> two<00:01:31.510> little<00:01:31.930> nubs<00:01:32.680> I<00:01:32.980> guess<00:01:33.160> you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
there's two little nubs I guess you

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.850 
there's two little nubs I guess you
could<00:01:33.430> call<00:01:33.640> them<00:01:33.760> and<00:01:33.940> they<00:01:34.870> sit<00:01:35.200> inside<00:01:35.440> of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
could call them and they sit inside of

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.020 
could call them and they sit inside of
this<00:01:37.260> crevice<00:01:38.260> here<00:01:38.680> and<00:01:38.920> when<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:39.640> push<00:01:39.880> it

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
this crevice here and when you push it

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.470 
this crevice here and when you push it
back<00:01:40.180> up<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.540> kind<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:40.750> locks<00:01:40.900> them<00:01:41.170> into<00:01:41.350> place

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
back up it kind of locks them into place

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.470 
back up it kind of locks them into place
so<00:01:43.480> I<00:01:43.870> guess<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.710> can't<00:01:45.670> be<00:01:45.820> any<00:01:45.970> more<00:01:46.120> simple

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
so I guess it can't be any more simple

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.250 
so I guess it can't be any more simple
than<00:01:46.570> that<00:01:48.540> same<00:01:49.540> thing<00:01:49.780> when<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:49.990> put<00:01:50.170> it

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
than that same thing when you put it

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.580 
than that same thing when you put it
back<00:01:50.290> in<00:01:50.470> here's<00:01:50.980> my<00:01:51.540> here's<00:01:52.540> my<00:01:52.780> module<00:01:53.320> that

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
when I did this I wired in I used to but

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.520 
when I did this I wired in I used to but
connectors<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.220> t-connector<00:02:59.750> in<00:03:00.750> order<00:03:01.440> to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
do that you have to take this rubber

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.690 
do that you have to take this rubber
boot<00:03:03.840> off<00:03:04.050> that's<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.590> factory<00:03:05.010> from<00:03:05.520> the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
boot off that's on the factory from the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.500 
boot off that's on the factory from the
factory<00:03:06.410> once<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.730> did<00:03:08.730> everything<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.180> wrapped

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
factory once I did everything I wrapped

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.450 
factory once I did everything I wrapped
it<00:03:09.660> really<00:03:10.020> tight<00:03:10.260> with<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> lot<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:10.980> electrical

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
it really tight with a lot of electrical

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.730 
it really tight with a lot of electrical
tape<00:03:11.520> because<00:03:12.210> there<00:03:12.570> is<00:03:12.750> dirt<00:03:13.080> in<00:03:13.230> here<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:13.710> I

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
tape because there is dirt in here so I

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.800 
tape because there is dirt in here so I
assumed<00:03:14.580> moisture<00:03:15.120> gets<00:03:15.300> in<00:03:15.480> there<00:03:15.630> and

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
assumed moisture gets in there and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.470 
assumed moisture gets in there and
