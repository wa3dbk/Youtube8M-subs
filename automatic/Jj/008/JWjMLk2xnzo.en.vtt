00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
in preparation to installing the head or

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.500 
in preparation to installing the head or
the<00:00:06.930> head<00:00:07.859> here<00:00:08.160> what<00:00:08.639> we<00:00:08.790> do<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.000> we<00:00:09.269> put

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
the head here what we do is we put

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.299 
the head here what we do is we put
grease<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:11.870> to<00:00:12.870> hold<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.710> gasket<00:00:13.980> in

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
grease on on this to hold the gasket in

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.450 
grease on on this to hold the gasket in
place<00:00:15.049> so<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.080> when<00:00:16.379> we<00:00:16.529> turn<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.010> flip

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
place so that when we turn this flip

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.820 
place so that when we turn this flip
this<00:00:17.580> over<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.090> go<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> install<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.050> it

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
this over and we go to install it it

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.650 
this over and we go to install it it
doesn't<00:00:20.039> fall<00:00:20.400> out<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:21.020> get<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> way<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
have a lot of trouble so we kind of hold

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.609 
have a lot of trouble so we kind of hold
it<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.699> place<00:00:30.000> or<00:00:30.390> glue<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.170> whatever<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.210 
this o-ring here and it's going to go
right<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.190> here

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
few other ro rings that come with this

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.700 
few other ro rings that come with this
and<00:01:14.100> I'll<00:01:14.520> show<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.760> where<00:01:14.970> those<00:01:15.150> go<00:01:15.710> let's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
go around the bolt holes and again if

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.969 
go around the bolt holes and again if
you<00:01:26.190> want<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.030> use<00:01:27.180> grease<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:28.800> hold

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you want you can just use grease to hold

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.480 
you want you can just use grease to hold
these<00:01:29.160> in<00:01:29.190> position<00:01:30.770> until<00:01:31.770> you're<00:01:31.950> ready<00:01:32.160> and

that's what I'm going to do because they

00:01:33.990 --> 00:02:01.080 
that's what I'm going to do because they
don't<00:01:34.860> state<00:01:35.850> stuff<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.330> my<00:01:36.450> finger

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
so now you're ready to install the head

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.080 
so now you're ready to install the head
you<00:02:03.700> have<00:02:03.939> all<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.630> your<00:02:05.049> o-rings<00:02:05.680> in<00:02:06.090> position

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090

and<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.720> ring<00:02:07.990> that<00:02:08.289> goes<00:02:08.440> from<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.950> head<00:02:09.130> to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
and the ring that goes from the head to

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:21.740 
and the ring that goes from the head to
the<00:02:09.429> cylinder

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.330 

I<00:02:23.300> like<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.450> leave<00:02:24.690> these<00:02:25.260> studs<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.890> and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
I like to leave these studs in and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.310 
I like to leave these studs in and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
install them all at one time so I can

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.350 
install them all at one time so I can
keep<00:02:28.500> track<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.890> my<00:02:29.070> oring<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.820> make<00:02:29.970> sure<00:02:30.180> that

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
keep track of my oring to make sure that

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.170 
keep track of my oring to make sure that
they<00:02:30.540> don't<00:02:30.750> slide<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.740> fall<00:02:31.950> off<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:33.030> now<00:02:33.120> I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
they don't slide and fall off and now I

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.940 
they don't slide and fall off and now I
know<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.420> all<00:02:33.630> my<00:02:33.690> overhangs<00:02:34.260> are<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
know that all my overhangs are in the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.800 
know that all my overhangs are in the
correct<00:02:35.250> positions<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.480> gasket<00:02:39.480> on

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
correct positions and that the gasket on

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.830 
correct positions and that the gasket on
the<00:02:39.900> top<00:02:40.080> isn't<00:02:40.440> going<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.800> move<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.660> that's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the top isn't going to move and that's

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.360 
the top isn't going to move and that's
it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
it

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.330 
it
so<00:02:47.370> I'll<00:02:47.490> start<00:02:47.760> tightening<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.330> all<00:02:48.570> up<00:02:49.340> and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
so I'll start tightening this all up and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.520 
so I'll start tightening this all up and
you<00:02:50.940> got<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> hose<00:02:51.360> here<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.930> needs<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.260> be

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
you got a hose here that needs to be

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.830 
you got a hose here that needs to be
reattached<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.880> got<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> hose<00:02:54.300> down<00:02:54.570> there

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
reattached and you got a hose down there

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.510 
reattached and you got a hose down there
it<00:02:55.680> needs<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.130> rigid<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.190> what<00:02:59.370> it's

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
it needs to be rigid this is what it's

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.220 
it needs to be rigid this is what it's
supposed<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.820> look<00:02:59.910> like<00:03:00.090> when<00:03:00.330> it's<00:03:00.690> fully

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
supposed to look like when it's fully

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.030 
supposed to look like when it's fully
installed<00:03:01.770> now<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.810> eliminated<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
installed now and the eliminated the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.790 
installed now and the eliminated the
loop<00:03:05.370> back<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.880> was<00:03:06.030> right<00:03:06.209> here<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.800> this

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
loop back that was right here and this

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.610 
loop back that was right here and this
here<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:08.580> goes<00:03:09.060> directly<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.200> front<00:03:10.530> of

Iridium<00:03:33.900> plug<00:03:38.540> this<00:03:39.540> plug<00:03:39.840> here<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:42.170> iridium

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
Iridium plug this plug here is iridium

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.630 
Iridium plug this plug here is iridium
and<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:44.790> seems<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.180> run<00:03:45.360> much<00:03:45.660> smoother<00:03:46.640> with

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
and it seems to run much smoother with

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.080 
and it seems to run much smoother with
this<00:03:48.450> plug<00:03:51.470> then<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.680> stock<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.280> GK<00:03:53.760> plug

this plug then the stock and GK plug

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:04.910 
this plug then the stock and GK plug
would<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.170> simply<00:03:57.200> remove<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.350> cap<00:03:58.620> on<00:03:59.489> it

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.550 

should've<00:04:05.920> done<00:04:05.950> right<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.980> top<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.220> off

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
should've done right and to top it off

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:19.229 
should've done right and to top it off
the<00:04:11.560> Radian<00:04:12.100> plug<00:04:17.340> what<00:04:18.340> we<00:04:18.489> have<00:04:18.640> left<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:19.060> do

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
the Radian plug what we have left to do

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:27.080 
the Radian plug what we have left to do
after<00:04:19.750> this<00:04:19.930> is<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:24.780> put<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.930> pipe<00:04:26.140> on<00:04:26.380> and

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
after this is to put the pipe on and

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:39.630 
after this is to put the pipe on and
fill<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.240> for<00:04:28.480> this<00:04:29.850> antifreeze<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:39.430> that

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
fill it for this antifreeze but that

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.000 
fill it for this antifreeze but that
will<00:04:39.930> conclude<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:43.240> install<00:04:43.750> of<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.620> liquid

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
will conclude the install of a liquid

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.510 
will conclude the install of a liquid
cooled<00:04:45.640> head<00:04:45.970> and<00:04:46.440> basically<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.890> plumbing

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
cooled head and basically the plumbing

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.880 
cooled head and basically the plumbing
this<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:49.000> capped<00:04:49.240> off<00:04:49.480> this<00:04:50.140> goes<00:04:50.350> around<00:04:50.530> to

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
this is capped off this goes around to

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.970 
this is capped off this goes around to
the<00:04:50.980> front<00:04:52.110> these<00:04:53.110> pipes<00:04:53.410> here<00:04:53.560> they're

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
the front these pipes here they're

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.730 
the front these pipes here they're
pretty<00:04:54.160> straightforward
