00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.680
 lots of people who ask them the advice where the blind spot is I stepped 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.109
 his sister is off quickly in the red signal 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.229
 the 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:13.839
 in the eye he tells the police ten years 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.230
 mirrors but beware of forbidden, best people should agree 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.050
 late simendo does there is a lot I think it is completely behind but put that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.529
 just sit next to him say one percent 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 and in that one person the entire car or another truck or van disappears 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.160
 I will also disappear that I will go to show 76 yes 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.860
 but we see in the interior mirror and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.850
 get parking 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.530
 thereby you can rear view mirror I'm leaving 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.340
 in the mirror brook mountains 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.920
 that is indeed an outside mirror 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.160
 after i got through 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.830
 and of course also a lot of smoke the editors proceed carefully also work 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.879
 4 is correct 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.879
 after and when you look at them I am very concerned that this is a blind spot 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.230
 yes a lot of people look at the perpetrator 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.210
 just look at the south that has come to see call comes after is watching 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.750
 naturally dangerous because the Christmas hour is going to start 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.510
 it is not necessary because you look again 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.450
 and we see but also stare but look in the mirror 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.330
 there is much easier yes so the smoke makes me literally yes 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.970
 here the disappearance can 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.180
 then it would be 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.720
 the rebels what is where and what time that girl looks at the shoulders underneath 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.430
 then you have only his replacement, I really have a whole bone 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.960
 on highway and a store 9 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 yes so you also get a lot of rest if you just 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.350
 also know well how to use mirrors, you wouldn't go there either 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.580
 look around with you know eighty percent inside mirror 9 this is one 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.130
 one percent outside mirror is that blind spot 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.000
 you have 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.650
 also a 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.940
 the non-lethal nature of this newspaper of course 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.530
 in between and then I am now 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.560
 the management says he corner 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.990
 man a little bit 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.370
 you have to plan that yes 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.150
 that is a nazi time 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.170
 the blind spot during rush hour 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.950
 but is this more pleasant living you are much further from a bit much better 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.989
 view and the left 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.739
 you have 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.739
 set the local time very nicely displayed 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:17.939
 these people 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.980
 eighty percent what your rear view mirror is 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.280
 The booty rush is to see what is caught up and when you get in 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.280
 always include the damage 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.779
 we put a short piece over the blind spot
