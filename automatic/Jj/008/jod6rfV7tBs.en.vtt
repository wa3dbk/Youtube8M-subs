surrounding universe so what i've got
here<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.810> chromis<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.740> i<00:00:28.770> but<00:00:29.039> i<00:00:29.100> can<00:00:29.279> use

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
here is a chromis you i but i can use

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.609 
here is a chromis you i but i can use

all<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> above<00:00:39.989> i<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.320> come<00:00:40.470> up<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.710> some

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
all of the above i can come up with some

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.790 
all of the above i can come up with some
really<00:00:41.040> fast<00:00:41.460> fluid<00:00:41.850> smooth<00:00:42.840> gestures<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
really fast fluid smooth gestures that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.380 
really fast fluid smooth gestures that
will<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.579> hard<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.970> do<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
will be really hard to do with a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.150 
will be really hard to do with a
keyboard<00:00:45.630> and<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.079> mouse<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.070> would

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
keyboard and a mouse and but would

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.680 
keyboard and a mouse and but would
probably<00:00:47.430> want<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> add<00:00:47.730> some<00:00:47.940> control<00:00:48.329> sooner

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
probably want to add some control sooner

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.389 
probably want to add some control sooner
or<00:00:48.750> later<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.079> i<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.290> just<00:00:49.410> drag<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> control<00:00:50.219> in

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
or later so i can just drag a control in

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.799 
or later so i can just drag a control in
from<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> edge<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> screen<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.540> this<00:00:51.690> is

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
from the edge of the screen and this is

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.690 
from the edge of the screen and this is
a<00:00:51.840> multi-directional<00:00:52.350> platform<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.460> i<00:00:53.520> can

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
a multi-directional platform so i can

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.459 
a multi-directional platform so i can
drag<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.120> controls<00:00:54.540> from<00:00:54.719> any<00:00:54.899> side<00:00:55.200> of<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
drag in controls from any side of the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.290 
drag in controls from any side of the
screen<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.980> they<00:00:56.190> will<00:00:56.340> fo<00:00:56.640> face<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
screen and they will fo face the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.060 
screen and they will fo face the
appropriate<00:00:57.840> direction<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> user<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.829> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
appropriate direction for a user on that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.639 
appropriate direction for a user on that
side<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> device<00:00:59.789> um<00:01:00.450> actually<00:01:01.170> i<00:01:01.410> can

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
side of the device um actually i can

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.170 
side of the device um actually i can
change<00:01:01.920> settings<00:01:02.430> around<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.789> camera<00:01:03.059> here

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
change settings around the camera here

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.549 
change settings around the camera here
so<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.570> example<00:01:03.629> i<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.049> Pan<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.439> camera

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
so for example i can Pan the camera

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.469 
so for example i can Pan the camera
around<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.309> way<00:01:05.489> actually<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.330> get

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
around in this way actually I can get

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.390 
around in this way actually I can get
really<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.049> close<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.890> how<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
really in close here this how can have a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.370 
really in close here this how can have a
look<00:01:08.549> at<00:01:08.729> Lake<00:01:09.330> Ontario<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:10.049> anyone<00:01:10.260> here

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
look at Lake Ontario there anyone here

from Canada anyone from Canada yeah so I
can<00:01:14.310> move<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.940> look<00:01:15.060> at<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> horizon

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
can move out and look at the horizon

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.719 
can move out and look at the horizon
from<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.140> point<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.500> space<00:01:16.530> above<00:01:17.189> Lake<00:01:17.520> Ontario

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
from a point in space above Lake Ontario

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.719 
from a point in space above Lake Ontario
really<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:18.869> easily<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.380> using<00:01:19.680> touch<00:01:19.890> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
really really easily just using touch so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.340 
really really easily just using touch so
let's<00:01:20.909> zoom<00:01:21.180> out<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> little<00:01:21.570> bit<00:01:21.869> more<00:01:22.140> here

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
let's zoom out a little bit more here

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.260 
let's zoom out a little bit more here
and<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.340> see<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.640> use<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:23.970> dial

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and you can see I can use this dial

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.000 
and you can see I can use this dial
control<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.470> use<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.619> single

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
control to do that I can use a single

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.679 
control to do that I can use a single
touch<00:01:26.130> where<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.549> use<00:01:26.640> multi-touch<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.540> do

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
touch where I can use multi-touch to do

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.840 
touch where I can use multi-touch to do
that<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.590> drag<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.100> another<00:01:29.369> control

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
that and if I drag in another control

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.789 
that and if I drag in another control
here<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.720> control<00:01:31.110> lets<00:01:31.259> me<00:01:31.380> change<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
here this control lets me change the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.560 
here this control lets me change the
field<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.189> view<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.460> camera<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.360> can

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
field of view of the camera then I can

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.960 
field of view of the camera then I can
use<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:34.170> hand<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.619> change<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.189> control<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
use one hand to change this control the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.730 
use one hand to change this control the
other<00:01:36.119> hand<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> change<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.960> control<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
other hand to change this control and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.230 
other hand to change this control and
you<00:01:37.830> can<00:01:37.860> start<00:01:38.189> coming<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.700> some<00:01:38.939> really

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
you can start coming up with some really

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.910 
you can start coming up with some really
interesting<00:01:39.630> user<00:01:40.049> interfaces<00:01:40.650> when<00:01:40.799> you've

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
interesting user interfaces when you've

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
interesting user interfaces when you've
got<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.189> many<00:01:41.490> touch<00:01:41.729> points<00:01:41.759> who<00:01:42.750> could

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
got this many touch points who could

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
got this many touch points who could
give<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> bit<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.770> god<00:01:43.950> complex<00:01:44.220> though

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
give you a bit of a god complex though

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.690 
give you a bit of a god complex though
yeah<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.900> let's<00:01:46.079> zoom<00:01:46.409> out<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.770> little<00:01:46.979> bit<00:01:47.430> more

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
yeah so let's zoom out a little bit more

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.730 
yeah so let's zoom out a little bit more
and<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.630> where<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> moon<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.560> is

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
and this is where the moon is this is

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.609 
and this is where the moon is this is
the<00:01:50.070> inner<00:01:50.250> solar<00:01:50.520> system<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.930> drag<00:01:52.439> on

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the inner solar system and I can drag on

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.710 
the inner solar system and I can drag on
the<00:01:52.680> background<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.520> well<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the background as well as the the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.330 
the background as well as the the
control<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.500> come<00:01:55.650> up<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:55.890> some<00:01:56.040> really

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
control here to come up with some really

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.990 
control here to come up with some really
fluid<00:01:56.909> gesture<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.689> day<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.619> song<00:01:59.000> so

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
fluid gesture like that day that song so

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.899 
fluid gesture like that day that song so
let's<00:02:00.180> let's<00:02:00.750> hop<00:02:00.990> over<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.290> Saturn<00:02:01.909> there's

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
let's let's hop over to Saturn there's

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.550 
let's let's hop over to Saturn there's
sudden<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.360> its<00:02:03.479> rings<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> live

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
sudden and its rings and this is a live

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.590 
sudden and its rings and this is a live
simulation<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> solar<00:02:05.939> system<00:02:06.060> i<00:02:06.420> can

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
simulation of the solar system i can

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.199 
simulation of the solar system i can
actually<00:02:06.720> unpause<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.590> turn<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.519> time<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
actually unpause this turn up time to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.370 
actually unpause this turn up time to
about<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> thousand<00:02:10.139> time

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
about a thousand time

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.020 
about a thousand time
means<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.620> started<00:02:10.980> looking<00:02:11.130> around<00:02:11.430> Saturn

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
means I started looking around Saturn

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.900 
means I started looking around Saturn
and<00:02:12.120> its<00:02:12.180> moons<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.810> change<00:02:13.170> time<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.730> let's

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
and its moons as I change time so let's

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.030 
and its moons as I change time so let's
zoom<00:02:15.120> out<00:02:15.270> even<00:02:15.660> further<00:02:15.960> at<00:02:16.320> this<00:02:16.440> point<00:02:16.740> and

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
zoom out even further at this point and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800 
zoom out even further at this point and
one<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.580> great<00:02:17.820> things<00:02:18.090> about<00:02:18.210> pixel

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
one of the great things about pixel

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.260 
one of the great things about pixel
sense<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.380> lets<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.920> device<00:02:20.490> actually<00:02:20.790> see

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
sense is it lets the device actually see

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.640 
sense is it lets the device actually see
what's<00:02:21.540> going<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:21.900> above<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.320> I've<00:02:22.500> got

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
what's going on above it so I've got

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.710 
what's going on above it so I've got
these<00:02:22.800> transparent<00:02:23.490> plastic<00:02:23.910> discs<00:02:24.570> here

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
these transparent plastic discs here

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.960 
these transparent plastic discs here
when<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> place<00:02:25.530> these<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.160> screen<00:02:26.490> what

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
when I place these on the screen what

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.000 
when I place these on the screen what
you<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.210> see<00:02:27.360> projected<00:02:27.930> through<00:02:28.230> them<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.830> a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
you can see projected through them is a

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.620 
you can see projected through them is a
little<00:02:29.310> crosshair<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:29.880> can<00:02:30.150> move<00:02:30.360> these<00:02:30.570> around

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
little crosshair I can move these around

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.600 
little crosshair I can move these around
that<00:02:31.080> directional<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:32.310> you're<00:02:32.400> on<00:02:32.580> a

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
that directional so if you're on a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.400 
that directional so if you're on a
particular<00:02:32.940> side<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.690> device<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.260> can

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
particular side of the device you can

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.320 
particular side of the device you can
orientate<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.190> appropriately<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.180> get

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
orientate it appropriately and I can get

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.090 
orientate it appropriately and I can get
information<00:02:36.570> about<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.140> stars<00:02:37.560> underneath

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
information about the stars underneath

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.770 
information about the stars underneath
that<00:02:38.280> crosser<00:02:38.610> by<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.240> moving<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
that crosser by the moving the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.450 
that crosser by the moving the
background<00:02:40.200> or<00:02:40.350> moving<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.830> plastic<00:02:41.250> discs

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
background or moving the plastic discs

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.760 
background or moving the plastic discs
around<00:02:41.610> only<00:02:42.360> pixel<00:02:42.750> sense<00:02:42.990> can<00:02:43.170> actually<00:02:43.410> see

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
around only pixel sense can actually see

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.770 
around only pixel sense can actually see
what's<00:02:44.040> going<00:02:44.340> on<00:02:44.520> above<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.910> table<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.660> this

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
what's going on above the table so this

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.020 
what's going on above the table so this
entire<00:02:45.930> panel<00:02:46.620> day<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.070> entire<00:02:47.190> screen<00:02:47.700> has<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
entire panel day the entire screen has a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.480 
entire panel day the entire screen has a
set<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.390> cameras<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.140> pixel<00:02:49.590> absolutely<00:02:50.250> two

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
set of cameras as pixel absolutely two

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.010 
set of cameras as pixel absolutely two
million<00:02:50.790> cameras<00:02:51.270> are<00:02:51.420> embedded<00:02:51.780> into<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
million cameras are embedded into the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.090 
million cameras are embedded into the
screen<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:52.590> stitch<00:02:52.830> them<00:02:52.980> together

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
screen and we stitch them together

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.680 
screen and we stitch them together
produce<00:02:53.460> an<00:02:53.760> image<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:54.090> what's<00:02:54.270> going<00:02:54.570> on

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
produce an image of what's going on

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.990 
produce an image of what's going on
above<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.170> device<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:56.610> finally<00:02:56.970> let's

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
above the device and so finally let's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.090 
above the device and so finally let's
just<00:02:57.270> have<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> look<00:02:57.510> at<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.440> constellations

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
just have a look at the constellations

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.180 
just have a look at the constellations
now<00:02:59.370> most<00:02:59.850> of<00:02:59.970> us<00:03:00.030> are<00:03:00.180> familiar<00:03:00.330> with<00:03:00.630> the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
now most of us are familiar with the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.250 
now most of us are familiar with the
constellations<00:03:02.190> at<00:03:02.490> least<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.760> lines<00:03:03.260> let's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
constellations at least the lines let's

these beautiful beautiful images around
the<00:03:21.480> sky<00:03:22.100> so<00:03:23.100> let's<00:03:23.250> just<00:03:23.460> hop<00:03:23.790> back<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:24.150> earth

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
the sky so let's just hop back to earth

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.790 
the sky so let's just hop back to earth
again<00:03:24.480> I'll<00:03:24.690> use<00:03:24.720> another<00:03:25.080> control<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.650> do

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
again I'll use another control to do

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.740 
again I'll use another control to do
that<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.880> see<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.180> still<00:03:27.360> spinning

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
that you can see it's still spinning

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.930 
that you can see it's still spinning
around<00:03:27.840> here<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.770> competitor<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.820> down

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
around here so I competitor and down

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.180 
around here so I competitor and down
time<00:03:30.240> just<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.600> little<00:03:30.840> bit<00:03:30.990> I'll<00:03:31.770> just<00:03:31.980> pause

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
time just a little bit I'll just pause

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.940 
time just a little bit I'll just pause
time<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:33.020> we've<00:03:34.020> got<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.170> few<00:03:34.350> satellites<00:03:34.770> in

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
time and we've got a few satellites in

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.590 
time and we've got a few satellites in
orbit<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.520> i'll<00:03:35.610> just<00:03:35.640> select<00:03:36.270> this<00:03:36.540> one

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
orbit here so i'll just select this one

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.880 
orbit here so i'll just select this one
here<00:03:37.080> will<00:03:38.070> zoom<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:39.410> we<00:03:40.410> got<00:03:40.560> here<00:03:40.680> some

of you might recognize this actually
it's<00:03:42.420> amazing<00:03:42.780> what<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:42.959> can<00:03:43.020> find<00:03:43.140> in<00:03:43.440> orbit

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
it's amazing what you can find in orbit

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.610 
it's amazing what you can find in orbit
