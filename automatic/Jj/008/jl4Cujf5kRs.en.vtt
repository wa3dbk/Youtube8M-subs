00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
test of the new Sonax wheel cleaner on

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.780 
test of the new Sonax wheel cleaner on
my<00:00:08.660> 2008<00:00:10.040> GTI<00:00:11.059> my<00:00:12.059> wheels<00:00:12.300> are<00:00:12.570> not<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.259> dirty

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
my 2008 GTI my wheels are not that dirty

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.439 
my 2008 GTI my wheels are not that dirty
but<00:00:14.790> let's<00:00:14.969> say<00:00:15.120> they're<00:00:15.299> mildly<00:00:15.780> swilled<00:00:16.770> I

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
but let's say they're mildly swilled I

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.189 
but let's say they're mildly swilled I
have<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> layer<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.470> cold<00:00:19.680> night<00:00:19.859> 845<00:00:20.580> on<00:00:20.939> them

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
have a layer of cold night 845 on them

throughout<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> winter<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.859> they've<00:00:23.130> been

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
throughout the winter so they've been

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.259 
throughout the winter so they've been
relatively<00:00:24.029> well<00:00:24.420> protected<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:26.000> we'll<00:00:27.000> see

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
inside of the barrel there it's already

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.210 
inside of the barrel there it's already
getting<00:01:56.440> pretty<00:01:56.470> red<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:59.710> just<00:01:59.890> going<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.040> let

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
getting pretty red I'm just going to let

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.790 
getting pretty red I'm just going to let
it<00:02:00.370> sit<00:02:00.640> there<00:02:00.880> for<00:02:01.240> another<00:02:01.869> minute<00:02:02.140> or<00:02:02.500> so

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
it sit there for another minute or so

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:15.449 
it sit there for another minute or so
and<00:02:03.100> then<00:02:04.090> we'll<00:02:04.240> agitate<00:02:14.220> seems<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.340> be

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
and then we'll agitate seems to be

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.590 
and then we'll agitate seems to be
working<00:02:15.820> pretty<00:02:16.030> well<00:02:16.300> on<00:02:16.570> rotors<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.560> the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
working pretty well on rotors and the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:38.339 
working pretty well on rotors and the
calipers<00:02:19.600> as<00:02:19.959> well<00:02:21.239> which<00:02:22.239> is<00:02:22.270> nice

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.569 

I'm<00:02:39.349> just<00:02:39.530> going<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.709> go<00:02:39.890> with<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.159> barrels

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
I'm just going to go with the barrels

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:51.660 
I'm just going to go with the barrels
first<00:02:40.989> with<00:02:41.989> my<00:02:42.140> race<00:02:42.379> glazed<00:02:43.209> brush<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:50.239> far

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
first with my race glazed brush so far

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.619 
first with my race glazed brush so far
seems<00:02:52.670> pretty<00:02:52.849> nice<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.150> me<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:53.359> cutting

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
seems pretty nice to me it's cutting

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:05.129 
seems pretty nice to me it's cutting
through<00:02:53.810> everything<00:02:55.900> with<00:02:57.519> relative<00:02:58.519> ease

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.879 

doesn't<00:03:06.139> smell<00:03:06.349> that<00:03:06.409> great<00:03:07.810> but<00:03:08.810> not<00:03:09.709> too

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
doesn't smell that great but not too

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:10.720
