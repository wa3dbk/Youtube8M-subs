00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.630
 we have here is a facade with a type 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.850
 of material that protects the façade against 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.150
 uv rays doing what you have to 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.100
 lower incidence of the solar rays is is 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.060
 beating directly into a structure of 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.260
 concrete 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.470
 this causes you to have a 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.720
 heat is decreased in the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.820
 internally facilitating the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.030
 refrigeration or air conditioning 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.030
 environments 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.170
 the system used to cover the 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.440
 sand is a mixed system that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.790
 uses one- page dilima one part in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.489
 zinc tile 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.920
 then a coating that is made of a 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.410
 and a membrane insulating material and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.600
 waterproofing a synthetic membrane 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.900
 which covers all this giving him a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 insulation aspect is thermal and acoustic 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.470
 on all faces as is the ring do not 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.910
 close it was necessary to have this 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.009
 characteristic for us to have 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.810
 a preserved acoustics inside the arena 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.119
 marshland 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.060
 we do not have the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.770
 corners or the corners of the stadium that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.030
 are positions that we usually have 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.649
 two situations where the public has the worst 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.570
 angle of vision because it is where 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.470
 distance is greater in relation to the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.450
 and where you have mobility 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.240
 difficult due to the climate of Cuiabá 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.610
 ah ah ah the fact that we do not have this 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.190
 this oval closure and we do not have the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.260
 four cones facilitated the entry of air 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.299
 i.e. by improving the thermal condition 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.939
 also of the stage in the part of seats 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.900
 of the pantanal arena has 100% of the seats 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.000
 folding 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.670
 these seats have a differentiation of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.820
 finishes are padded and backed 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.250
 arm is thus differentiated from the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.610
 finish of the seat that is facing the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.610
 general public 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.830
 all colors are between getting married 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.480
 project of the pantanal arena was 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.209
 in an ecosystem that the state of bush 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.150
 thick had the facade for example had 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.910
 a green color to make an allusion to 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.970
 date of the forests of the region a of the forest 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.550
 Amazonian dark blue light blue part 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.400
 was to make an allusion to the whole 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.920
 ecosystem is around the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.989
 and the rivers because we have 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.569
 three mato Grosso ecosystems 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.569
 wetland the Amazon rainforest and cerrado 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.840
 planting is a hand do not give to 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.590
 to the agent's home machine used 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.420
 fiber 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.550
 after that of this planting the hand to people 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.100
 we get wet 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.770
 there was only a glance at him and 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.750
 in this process only had the fertilizer and has 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.820
 process that also took in fragas 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.620
 We have lots of snow to play. 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.460
 to spray various organizations 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.950
 and more is was the fertilizer is fertilizer in the 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.760
 root also that this is the important not 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.940
 is for her and raises faster and why 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.120
 this grass does not grow and it's the next 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.980
 She is creeping there after leaving people. 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.930
 arrived at this point that you 're not 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.930
 this wonder that is now the lawn 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.680
 the grass this grass is decorative is not this 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.080
 can see which decorative grass she she 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.030
 has almost the same shade of grass 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.310
 natural ea and this one is the grass it 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.320
 Go to the player will happen here. 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.490
 then this grass will have a bigger son 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.500
 that will have rubber on it will not 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.330
 show the erasers but she's drunk 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.330
 Mandela but would make heating 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.010
 from the north and south of bleachers 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.040
 that are in goal funds they were 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.400
 built with metal structures 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.990
 removable 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.460
 so in the future so some operator 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.980
 want to decrease the capacity of the stadium 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.590
 he can remove all the bleachers that 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.910
 It is made all metal is to raise to one 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.760
 other development 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.920
 another situation that was thought of is that 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.930
 there are many structures used in 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.210
 part of which are structures 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.560
 removable or that they can be 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.090
 modified according to the use 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.910
 internal environment 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.490
 we also have there part everywhere 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.890
 coverage it receives these waters 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.540
 to a reservoir and this 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.890
 reservoir is made an entire treatment 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.300
 for the reuse of this water is so 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.400
 bathrooms and in the areas of 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:16.130
 modeling of soccer club and areas 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:18.650
 is also the pantanal 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.030
 over the pantanal arena of this area have 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.980
 some leisure areas that were 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.230
 also thought for this audience is in the 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.350
 arrival or also in use on the day to 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:30.950
 day that are restaurants choperias areas 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.350
 with artificial lakes is a clue 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.150
 and around the arena that the 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.390
 population can integrate with this 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.200
 environment is even the arena not being 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:45.440
 being used for a major event 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:48.560
 are new options that we are going to have 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.200
 it will not be just the field itself we will 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.480
 have space for big events we 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.060
 we will have the leisure area 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.850
 walk will be a real point of the 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.490
 A true city. 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:05.480
 multiple use is multipurpose that people 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.820
 here you can here are other activities 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.680
 until university if you want 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.140
 because she has space so I have 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.040
 sure that people here have seen and will 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.040
 feel at home
