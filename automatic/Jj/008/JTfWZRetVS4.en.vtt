00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
something like this see how close the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.700 
something like this see how close the
sprocket<00:00:28.300> is<00:00:28.390> right<00:00:28.660> here<00:00:28.900> at<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.439> ground

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
sprocket is right here at the ground

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.300 
sprocket is right here at the ground
that<00:00:30.640> becomes<00:00:31.090> of<00:00:31.270> your<00:00:31.419> problem<00:00:31.960> so<00:00:32.950> you<00:00:33.040> can

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
that becomes of your problem so you can

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.660 
that becomes of your problem so you can
put<00:00:33.520> this<00:00:33.760> here<00:00:34.120> on<00:00:34.980> sprocket

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
put this here on sprocket

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:46.819 
put this here on sprocket
as<00:00:37.180> you<00:00:37.329> can<00:00:37.450> see<00:00:43.260> says<00:00:44.260> right<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:44.800> 35<00:00:45.609> teeth

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
as you can see says right the 35 teeth

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.040 
as you can see says right the 35 teeth
so<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:48.429> original<00:00:48.550> sprocket<00:00:49.539> right<00:00:49.750> here<00:00:50.019> I

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
so the original sprocket right here I

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.639 
so the original sprocket right here I
breathe

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
breathe

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.880 
breathe
71<00:00:51.280> teeth<00:00:51.550> in<00:00:51.820> it<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:53.379> can<00:00:53.559> see<00:00:53.739> the

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
71 teeth in it you can see the

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.430 
71 teeth in it you can see the
difference<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:58.210> you<00:00:58.390> want<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.660> do<00:00:58.899> is<00:00:59.140> put

difference so what you want to do is put

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.660 
difference so what you want to do is put
this<00:00:59.710> on<00:01:00.039> which<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:00.640> a<00:01:01.859> $10<00:01:02.859> split<00:01:03.339> rings

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
this on which is a $10 split rings

this on which is a $10 split rings
rocket<00:01:04.360> of<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.629> go-kart<00:01:04.870> see<00:01:06.210> no<00:01:07.210> it's<00:01:07.360> 54

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
rocket of the go-kart see no it's 54

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.890 
rocket of the go-kart see no it's 54
teeth<00:01:08.170> I'm<00:01:08.440> sorry<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.970> you<00:01:10.000> probably<00:01:10.450> want<00:01:10.840> to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
teeth I'm sorry so you probably want to

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.410 
teeth I'm sorry so you probably want to
go<00:01:11.050> somewhere<00:01:11.320> between<00:01:11.770> 54<00:01:12.730> and<00:01:14.340> 71<00:01:15.340> teeth<00:01:15.670> to

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
go somewhere between 54 and 71 teeth to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.609 
go somewhere between 54 and 71 teeth to
get<00:01:16.630> your<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:18.040> you<00:01:18.250> don't<00:01:18.430> get<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.380> lose<00:01:20.380> the

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
get your so you don't get the lose the

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.310 
get your so you don't get the lose the
torque<00:01:20.979> just<00:01:21.640> might<00:01:21.880> be<00:01:22.090> really<00:01:22.479> too<00:01:22.720> high<00:01:22.990> and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
torque just might be really too high and

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.870 
torque just might be really too high and
then<00:01:23.439> you'll<00:01:23.619> be<00:01:23.740> able<00:01:23.829> to<00:01:24.070> go<00:01:24.220> like<00:01:24.250> probably

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
then you'll be able to go like probably

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.959 
then you'll be able to go like probably
twice<00:01:25.210> as<00:01:25.420> fast<00:01:26.159> probably<00:01:27.159> might<00:01:27.460> be<00:01:27.670> able<00:01:27.820> to

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
twice as fast probably might be able to

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:28.530 
twice as fast probably might be able to
do

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
do

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.959 
do
I<00:01:28.979> don't<00:01:29.979> know<00:01:30.100> you'll<00:01:30.369> have<00:01:30.430> to<00:01:30.700> do<00:01:30.850> it

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
I don't know you'll have to do it

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.850 
I don't know you'll have to do it
yourself<00:01:31.360> but<00:01:31.570> when<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:31.840> put<00:01:32.049> this<00:01:32.229> on<00:01:32.469> that's

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
yourself but when you put this on that's

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.340 
yourself but when you put this on that's
where<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.159> get<00:01:33.369> it<00:01:33.520> right<00:01:33.670> there<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:35.140> might

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
where you get it right there they might

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.639 
where you get it right there they might
give<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:35.649> one<00:01:35.829> of<00:01:35.950> them<00:01:36.070> stick<00:01:36.399> or<00:01:36.610> so<00:01:37.649> they

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
give you one of them stick or so they

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.990 
give you one of them stick or so they
have<00:01:38.680> these<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:41.039> what<00:01:42.039> I<00:01:42.070> did<00:01:42.490> was<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:42.789> used

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.060 
have these and what I did was I used
stainless<00:01:43.689> steel<00:01:44.020> bolts<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:46.659> I<00:01:46.719> put<00:01:47.140> six

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
stainless steel bolts and then I put six

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.249 
stainless steel bolts and then I put six
millimeter<00:01:48.990> lock<00:01:49.990> washers<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:52.259> six

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
millimeter lock washers and six

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.340 
millimeter lock washers and six
millimeter<00:01:53.829> flat<00:01:54.159> washers<00:01:54.759> on<00:01:54.969> and<00:01:55.960> I<00:01:56.140> used

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
millimeter flat washers on and I used

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.580 
millimeter flat washers on and I used
these<00:01:56.530> locking<00:01:56.859> nuts<00:01:57.329> they're<00:01:58.329> quarter<00:01:58.899> inch

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.320 

allen<00:02:02.590> by<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:04.979> 3/4<00:02:05.979> long<00:02:06.189> and<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:07.689> I<00:02:07.719> use<00:02:08.080> these

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
allen by a 3/4 long and then I use these

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.820 
allen by a 3/4 long and then I use these
nuts<00:02:10.330> on<00:02:10.690> it

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
nuts on it

and yeah you shouldn't really use

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.580 
and yeah you shouldn't really use
stainless<00:02:15.700> steel<00:02:15.970> for<00:02:16.600> uh<00:02:16.630> sprocket<00:02:17.230> but<00:02:17.410> I'm

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
stainless steel for uh sprocket but I'm

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.900 
stainless steel for uh sprocket but I'm
going<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.800> use<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.190> because<00:02:18.250> I've<00:02:18.490> done<00:02:18.700> the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
going to use it because I've done the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.350 
going to use it because I've done the
math<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.930> they<00:02:20.080> figured<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:21.640> it's<00:02:21.910> not

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
math and they figured that it's not

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.520 
math and they figured that it's not
going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.810> shear<00:02:23.220> because<00:02:24.220> with<00:02:24.700> those<00:02:25.530> flat

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
going to shear because with those flat

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.590 
going to shear because with those flat
washer<00:02:27.070> pulling<00:02:27.520> up<00:02:27.700> against<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.360> little

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
washer pulling up against it little

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.620 
washer pulling up against it little
tight<00:02:28.810> like<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.940> by<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.000> way<00:02:31.180> I'm<00:02:31.330> going<00:02:31.540> to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
tight like that by the way I'm going to

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.990 
tight like that by the way I'm going to
use<00:02:31.780> lock<00:02:32.020> not<00:02:32.320> lock<00:02:33.190> tight<00:02:33.430> on<00:02:33.460> all<00:02:33.850> these

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
use lock not lock tight on all these

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.060 
use lock not lock tight on all these
before<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.480> put<00:02:34.750> them<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:34.990> just<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.560> blue<00:02:35.740> stuff

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
before I put them on just the blue stuff

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.380 
before I put them on just the blue stuff
because<00:02:36.340> they're<00:02:36.460> going<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.730> be<00:02:36.790> changing

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
because they're going to be changing

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.600 
because they're going to be changing
sprockets<00:02:37.870> out<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.260> might<00:02:38.470> go<00:02:38.680> with<00:02:38.710> the<00:02:38.980> 62s

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
sprockets out I might go with the 62s

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.680 
sprockets out I might go with the 62s
myself<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.680> yeah<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.940> why<00:02:43.120> would<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.420> want<00:02:43.600> to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
myself so yeah so why would you want to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.060 
myself so yeah so why would you want to
put<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:43.990> on<00:02:44.460> one<00:02:45.460> reason<00:02:45.970> why<00:02:46.890> because<00:02:47.890> it

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
put this on one reason why because it

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.940 
put this on one reason why because it
hits<00:02:48.310> right<00:02:48.550> here<00:02:48.960> number<00:02:49.960> two<00:02:50.320> reason<00:02:50.530> why<00:02:50.890> is

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
hits right here number two reason why is

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.950 
hits right here number two reason why is
because<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.430> watched<00:02:51.730> all<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.390> do<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.750> bug

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
because I watched all you do to bug

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.710 
because I watched all you do to bug
videos<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.740> can<00:02:53.770> see<00:02:54.160> like<00:02:54.460> that<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.510> don't

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
videos and I can see like that you don't

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.290 
videos and I can see like that you don't
go<00:02:55.870> any<00:02:56.080> faster<00:02:56.560> with<00:02:56.710> a<00:02:56.740> 6.5<00:02:57.550> but<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.090> guy

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
go any faster with a 6.5 but that guy

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.720 
go any faster with a 6.5 but that guy
that<00:02:58.480> doesn't<00:02:58.720> know<00:02:58.960> any<00:02:59.170> better<00:02:59.520> that<00:03:00.520> guy

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
that doesn't know any better that guy

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.090 
that doesn't know any better that guy
also<00:03:01.000> can<00:03:01.360> do<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.540> wheelie<00:03:01.810> by<00:03:02.050> just<00:03:02.350> just

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
also can do a wheelie by just just

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.310 
also can do a wheelie by just just
cracking<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.150> throttle<00:03:04.570> just<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.870> little<00:03:05.140> bit

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
cracking the throttle just a little bit

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.440 
cracking the throttle just a little bit
with<00:03:05.710> this<00:03:05.890> sprocket<00:03:06.190> on<00:03:06.520> there<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:06.970> just<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
with this sprocket on there and just the

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.850 
with this sprocket on there and just the
6.5<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:09.760> know<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:09.970> Harbor<00:03:10.330> Freight<00:03:10.860> so

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
6.5 in it you know the Harbor Freight so

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.710 
6.5 in it you know the Harbor Freight so
if<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.160> put<00:03:12.430> this<00:03:12.640> sprocket<00:03:12.910> on<00:03:13.270> its<00:03:13.480> what<00:03:13.630> I'm

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
if you put this sprocket on its what I'm

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.360 
if you put this sprocket on its what I'm
saying<00:03:13.990> it's<00:03:14.200> not<00:03:14.380> going<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.710> do<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.010> wheelies

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
saying it's not going to do the wheelies

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.280 
saying it's not going to do the wheelies
anymore<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.120> it's<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:16.420> gonna<00:03:16.750> probably<00:03:17.050> go

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
anymore and it's just gonna probably go

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.810 
anymore and it's just gonna probably go
I<00:03:19.590> don't<00:03:20.590> know<00:03:20.739> but<00:03:21.100> it's<00:03:21.220> not<00:03:21.400> going<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.640> go

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
I don't know but it's not going to go

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.420 
I don't know but it's not going to go
it's<00:03:22.720> not<00:03:22.930> gonna<00:03:23.080> spin<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.500> tire<00:03:23.860> like<00:03:24.130> that

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
it's not gonna spin a tire like that

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.550 
it's not gonna spin a tire like that
real<00:03:24.760> easy<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.150> do<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.720> wheelie<00:03:26.020> right<00:03:26.170> out<00:03:26.530> of

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
the original bolts that come with the

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.050 
the original bolts that come with the
Doodlebug<00:03:38.890> but<00:03:39.190> you're<00:03:39.340> still<00:03:39.580> going<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.850> have

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
Doodlebug but you're still going to have

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.490 
Doodlebug but you're still going to have
to<00:03:40.239> get<00:03:40.420> these<00:03:41.010> three<00:03:42.010> quarter<00:03:42.430> inch<00:03:42.700> long

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.250 

quarter<00:03:47.500> inch<00:03:48.570> probably<00:03:49.570> at<00:03:49.660> least<00:03:49.810> grade

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
quarter inch probably at least grade

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.310 
quarter inch probably at least grade
five<00:03:51.030> but<00:03:52.030> then<00:03:52.270> like<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.630> said<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:53.080> Ross

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
five but then like I said the Ross

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.070 
five but then like I said the Ross
because<00:03:53.830> this<00:03:54.790> you<00:03:55.000> get<00:03:55.180> them<00:03:55.300> chrome-plated

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
because this you get them chrome-plated

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.170 
because this you get them chrome-plated
which<00:03:56.230> are<00:03:56.440> hard<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.709> find<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:57.250> find<00:03:58.000> a

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
which are hard to find I find a

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.210 
which are hard to find I find a
stainless<00:03:58.660> steel<00:03:58.690> better<00:04:00.090> see<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:03.040> can

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
stainless steel better see and you can

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.610 
stainless steel better see and you can
see<00:04:03.430> how<00:04:03.850> small<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.209> is<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:04.900> practically

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
see how small that is it is practically

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.710 
see how small that is it is practically
right<00:04:05.980> up<00:04:06.130> against<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.730> backing<00:04:07.150> plate<00:04:07.420> there

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
right up against the backing plate there

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.060 
right up against the backing plate there
the<00:04:08.709> adapter<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:11.080> yeah<00:04:11.290> that's<00:04:11.590> where<00:04:11.800> you<00:04:11.890> get

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
the adapter so yeah that's where you get

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.449 
the adapter so yeah that's where you get
it

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
it

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.890 
it
old<00:04:12.850> minibike<00:04:13.660> comm<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:16.239> can<00:04:16.419> change<00:04:16.720> it

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
old minibike comm you can change it

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.420 
old minibike comm you can change it
right<00:04:17.019> over<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.500> yet<00:04:17.709> look<00:04:17.980> I<00:04:18.130> didn't<00:04:18.400> even
