we'll<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.150> removing<00:00:30.630> those<00:00:30.929> energy<00:00:31.439> cysts

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
we'll be removing those energy cysts

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:41.299 
we'll be removing those energy cysts
through<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> fossa<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:40.040> feeling<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.100> little

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
through the fossa and feeling a little

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.580 
through the fossa and feeling a little
bit<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:42.920> like<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> vibratory<00:00:44.430> movement<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.750> the

the ribcage and because we're working

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840 
the ribcage and because we're working
with<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> area<00:00:55.469> near<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.800> diaphragm

with the area near the diaphragm

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.299 
with the area near the diaphragm
we'll<00:00:57.719> also<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:58.020> affecting<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> lungs<00:00:58.949> and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
we'll also be affecting the lungs and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.639 
we'll also be affecting the lungs and
the<00:00:59.370> capacity<00:00:59.879> for<00:00:59.910> breath<00:01:00.359> by<00:01:01.079> really<00:01:01.379> seeing

my<00:01:21.479> hand<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.960> little<00:01:22.140> bit<00:01:22.850> again<00:01:23.850> there's<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
my hand a little bit again there's a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.810 
my hand a little bit again there's a
constant<00:01:24.600> sense<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.680> monitoring<00:01:26.130> your<00:01:26.580> body

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
constant sense of monitoring your body

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.080 
constant sense of monitoring your body
in<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.090> clients<00:01:27.450> body<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.520> softening

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
my contact with the body that should

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.270 
my contact with the body that should
encourage<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.780> fossa<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.380> move<00:01:42.950> I'm<00:01:43.950> feeling

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
encourage the fossa to move I'm feeling

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.370 
encourage the fossa to move I'm feeling
a<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.640> bit<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> restriction<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.810> upper

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
a little bit of restriction in the upper

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.800 
a little bit of restriction in the upper
thoracic<00:01:46.950> area<00:01:47.700> near<00:01:48.149> my<00:01:48.270> clients<00:01:48.810> throat<00:01:49.700> I'm

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
thoracic area near my clients throat I'm

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.090 
thoracic area near my clients throat I'm
observing<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.899> my<00:01:52.049> clients<00:01:52.500> pulse<00:01:52.829> is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
observing that my clients pulse is

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.770 
observing that my clients pulse is
actually<00:01:53.430> accelerating<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.180> little<00:01:54.450> bit<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
actually accelerating a little bit the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330 
actually accelerating a little bit the
heartbeat<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.290> actually<00:01:55.560> accelerating<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
heartbeat is actually accelerating a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310 
heartbeat is actually accelerating a
little<00:01:56.549> bit<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.810> keep<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.140> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
little bit so I'm going to keep that in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.310 
little bit so I'm going to keep that in
mind<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:59.369> I'm<00:01:59.490> actually<00:02:00.200> stimulating<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
mind that I'm actually stimulating the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.289 
mind that I'm actually stimulating the
body<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.680> opposed<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.130> making<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.640> relaxed

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
body as opposed to making it relaxed

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.480 
body as opposed to making it relaxed
just<00:02:03.420> by<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.710> presence<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.860> my<00:02:04.950> hands<00:02:05.189> right

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
just by the presence of my hands right

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.050 
just by the presence of my hands right
now

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.370 

and<00:02:12.060> because<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.780> change<00:02:13.080> I'm<00:02:13.230> actually

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
and because of that change I'm actually

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:22.670 
and because of that change I'm actually
just<00:02:13.650> gonna<00:02:13.770> remove<00:02:14.280> my<00:02:14.640> upper<00:02:15.000> hand<00:02:21.680> I'm

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
just gonna remove my upper hand I'm

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.500 
just gonna remove my upper hand I'm
feeling<00:02:23.069> more<00:02:23.280> expansion<00:02:23.970> now<00:02:24.150> through<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
feeling more expansion now through the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.670 
feeling more expansion now through the
lower<00:02:24.750> left<00:02:25.290> aspect<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.099> rib<00:02:26.280> cage<00:02:30.680> my

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
lower left aspect of the rib cage my

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.250 
lower left aspect of the rib cage my
observation<00:02:32.519> is<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.849> by<00:02:33.540> placing<00:02:33.780> my<00:02:34.050> hand

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
observation is that by placing my hand

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.050 
observation is that by placing my hand
on<00:02:34.410> top<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.920> diaphragm<00:02:35.190> I'm<00:02:35.730> actually

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
on top of the diaphragm I'm actually

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.030 
on top of the diaphragm I'm actually
creating<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.690> sense<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.110> tension<00:02:37.680> through<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
creating a sense of tension through the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.120 
creating a sense of tension through the
breathing<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.150> now<00:02:39.510> by<00:02:39.690> releasing<00:02:39.900> my<00:02:40.260> hand<00:02:40.739> I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
breathing and now by releasing my hand I

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.699 
breathing and now by releasing my hand I
feel<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:41.910> my<00:02:42.060> clients<00:02:42.690> breath<00:02:42.989> is<00:02:43.230> slowing

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
feel like my clients breath is slowing

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.229 
feel like my clients breath is slowing
down<00:02:43.739> there's<00:02:44.280> less<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.549> restriction<00:02:45.120> up

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
down there's less of restriction up

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.240 
down there's less of restriction up
through<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.569> upper<00:02:45.750> thoracic<00:02:46.380> cavity<00:02:46.769> and

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
through the upper thoracic cavity and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.070 
through the upper thoracic cavity and
her<00:02:48.180> pulse<00:02:48.510> rate<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.810> slowing<00:02:49.019> down<00:02:49.470> again<00:02:51.080> so

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
her pulse rate is slowing down again so

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.380 
her pulse rate is slowing down again so
in<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.380> particular<00:02:52.709> instance<00:02:53.160> by<00:02:53.910> placing

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
in this particular instance by placing
