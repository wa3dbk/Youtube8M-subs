I'm doing a project today for the studio
decor<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:08.250> thought<00:00:08.760> since<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.750> just<00:00:09.809> got<00:00:10.080> an

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
decor and I thought since I just got an

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.870 
decor and I thought since I just got an
iPhone<00:00:10.679> which<00:00:10.889> I'm<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.160> right<00:00:11.309> now<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.670> would

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
iPhone which I'm on right now I would

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.150 
iPhone which I'm on right now I would
try<00:00:12.090> doing<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.660> quick<00:00:13.080> video<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.830> think

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
try doing a quick video on it I think

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.880 
try doing a quick video on it I think
it's<00:00:14.280> gonna<00:00:14.370> be<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> lot<00:00:14.639> easier<00:00:14.730> for<00:00:14.969> me<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.299> do

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
it's gonna be a lot easier for me to do

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.580 
it's gonna be a lot easier for me to do
so<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.920> found<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.430> great<00:00:17.640> antler<00:00:18.359> mount<00:00:18.630> at

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
so I found this great antler mount at

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.439 
so I found this great antler mount at
the<00:00:19.890> antique<00:00:20.340> store<00:00:20.369> today<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.119> has<00:00:21.180> like

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the antique store today and it has like

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.939 
the antique store today and it has like
such<00:00:21.630> cool<00:00:22.050> detail<00:00:22.500> around<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.420> antlers<00:00:24.420> and

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
such cool detail around the antlers and

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.470 
such cool detail around the antlers and
but<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:26.279> don't<00:00:26.460> really<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.269> wood

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
but I just don't really like the wood

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.640 
but I just don't really like the wood
color<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:30.359> thought<00:00:31.230> even<00:00:31.470> though

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
color on it so I thought even though

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.729 
color on it so I thought even though
it's<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.920> brown<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.250> ivory<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.450> could<00:00:34.440> paint

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
it's like brown and ivory I could paint

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.950 
it's like brown and ivory I could paint
it<00:00:34.890> black<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.730> thought<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.420> might<00:00:36.480> also<00:00:36.809> be

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
it black but I thought it might also be

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.500 
it black but I thought it might also be
cool<00:00:37.260> too<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.510> copper

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
cool too because I have this copper

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.950 
cool too because I have this copper

patina stuff from Lowe's and then just

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.630 
patina stuff from Lowe's and then just
regular<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.500> brown<00:00:43.800> craft<00:00:44.219> paint<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.520> was

original color I got didn't really match

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.080 
original color I got didn't really match
the<00:03:55.150> string<00:03:55.810> like<00:03:56.020> I<00:03:56.140> wanted<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.470> but<00:03:56.860> so<00:03:57.760> I

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
the string like I wanted to but so I

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.920 
the string like I wanted to but so I
mixed<00:03:58.750> a<00:03:58.840> little<00:03:59.050> bit<00:03:59.170> of<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.440> copper<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.930> raw

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
mixed a little bit of the copper and raw

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.660 
mixed a little bit of the copper and raw
umber

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
umber

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.250 
umber
together<00:04:03.670> so<00:04:04.450> there's<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.720> little<00:04:04.990> bit<00:04:05.110> of<00:04:05.170> the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
together so there's a little bit of the

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.500 
together so there's a little bit of the
copper<00:04:05.590> sheen<00:04:05.800> to<00:04:06.070> it<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:06.760> it's<00:04:06.970> a<00:04:07.060> glaze<00:04:07.300> so

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
copper sheen to it and it's a glaze so

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.670 
copper sheen to it and it's a glaze so
it<00:04:07.570> kind<00:04:07.720> of<00:04:07.750> thins<00:04:07.990> the<00:04:08.140> paint<00:04:08.350> so<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.530> can

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
it kind of thins the paint so you can

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.220
