00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.440
Braving the cold and going to meet the King of busking(street performance)

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.340
Who are they going to meet..?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.920
The King of busking as well as the owner of this cozy cafÃ©, singer Ilac

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.440
SeungHyun - shall we sit down?

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.520
We desperately need his help for busking

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.700
Ilac - so you were watching a performance when you just decided you wanted to do this?

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.320
Yes pweeze HELP us try this
Hongdae = Busking

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.420
Hongdae = Busking this is true.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.400
It would be great to not get boo-ed

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.760
Ilac - the culture of busking in Korea has changed a lot recently

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.680
But busking is completely different from what you would normally experience at concert halls or live clubs

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.040
Because at these venues, you have people who have paid to be there and watch the show

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.020
They are there with an open mind but it's not like that at buskings

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.040
Busking and regular performances are very different

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.240
1st rule of busking by the King of Busking

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.320
First, the ones performing must be enjoying it

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.480
Round of seal-claps for oh-so-generous Ilac

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.220
Another master is joining us

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.020
The survival audition program SuperStar K's Jo MoonGeun, runner-up of season 1 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.160
Welcome!! Greeting with open arms

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.600
MoonGeun - you guys are all so tall..

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.280
Ilac - so we are helping with the busking tomorrow

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.120
SeungHyun - so this guy knows how to sing

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.260
Jang KiYong = guy who knows how to sing

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.380
Seriously good

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.940
SeungHyun - well I can't say he's bad

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.560
KiYong - let's say I 'like' singing

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.540
Jang KiYong who 'like's singing's favorite number

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.860
KiYong's choice 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.780
Wintery night with some sweet tunes

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.840
Happy Hyoni alongside KiYong who 'likes' to sing

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.260
Done

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.400
SeungHyun - you're gonna start playing right away?

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.500
King of Busking playing his guitar when he's only heard the song once

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.600
Perfect replay of those sweet tunes

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.960
I knew from the first sight.  That you would be mine

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.840
I couldn't look away

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.640
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.880
Ilac - that's pretty good!

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.020
SeungHyun - wow.. aren't you too good?

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.920
Everyone's impressed at Ilac's perfect guitar and KiYong's singing

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.300
Ilac - I think this will be good enough

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.480
SeungHyun - so we passed?

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.960
King of Busking says : Jang KiYong who 'likes' singing - pass!

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.240
Ilac and MoonGeun are going join as a chorus

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.000
SeungHyun - since we are really doing this I should..

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.460
Hyoni feels bad asking for another favor

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.940
Asks Ilac and MoonGeun to chip in with a song for a richer show

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.480
MoonGeun - I haven't done busking in Hongdae in a long time

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.660
SeungHyun - really?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.180
MoonGeun - I think it's been about a year

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.540
Should be fun 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.960
Yes.. done.. 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.020
Wee

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.440
Ilac - what's a good one we could do

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.580
.. you.. you.. you.. (Busker Busker's song)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.160
SeungHyun - it's a popular one so should be good 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.940
Ilac - when you do a lot of busking you see that there are some songs that really get people going 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.140
Recommendation from the two Kings of Busking

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.520
MoonGeun - like this

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.540
MoonGeun - as if you are in a forest In New Zealand, being a Maori 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.400
Maori chief

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.160
1! 2! 3! 4!

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.600
Maori 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.940
This is a New Zealand forest right here

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.180
Shake and shout

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.180
Ilac - this should be good

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.120
Maori children are still concerned

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.240
MoonGeun - just join in freely

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.000
Ilac - we'll try it 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.500
homework from the King of Busking : practice a verse or two you'd like to think

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.420
Solemn / SeungHyun - yes sir

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.640
So we'll practice and show you tomorrow

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.680
Practical and precious advice from Ilac, all from his experiences

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.300
There might not be anyone to watch the show until the end of it

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.020
SeungHyun - then we should get some PR going

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.180
If there are still no people, we'll keep singing

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.040
Hyoni Film expecting endless performances

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.240
SeungHyun - let's also think of the PR

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.880
SeungHyun - so I'm not going to be helpful at singing, could I do anything else

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.340
Shaker is often used in acoustic performances

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.900
Shaker is often used in acoustic performances

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.600
Ilac - you could both hold the shaker

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.840
KiYong with the singing, HyeongSeop and Hyoni in charge of shaking

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.560
Ilac - shaker's actually very difficult

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.980
You have to play very precise beats on the shaker

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.660
SeungHyun - I make some good mixed drinks

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.320
Let me mix this up too

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.360
Ilac demonstrates shaking

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.080
SeungHyun - we've got a lot on our hand.. let's practice

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.360
Ilac - we are on a same boat now

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.460
Energized with the help of Kings of Busking, Ilac and MoonGeun

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.980
SeungHyun - down or up?

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.480
Don't forget K is in this too

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.280
Kind of sudden but for a fun performance tomorrow all the same, let's go!

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.240
First night of Hongdae tour almost over

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.720
Arrived at the guesthouse

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.840
Seems to have quite a crowd staying at the guesthouse

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.320
These four are shy as they walk in

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.840
SeungHyun - you guys are staying at the guesthouse?

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.860
wow, big head

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.360
But still cute
Nobody fails to recognize K's big head

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.380
SeungHyun - we are on a Seoul tour

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.620
HyeongSeop - do you know us?

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.700
A blatant question by weirdo HyeongSeop

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.320
SeungHyun - wow! this is a cool space! what is this

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.920
1st floor is used as dining and gaming area

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.220
Guests gather around in the morning to eat breakfast together

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.660
SeungHyun- let's look around more

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.040
Looking around in a hurry

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.000
SeungHyun - I guess this is the sleeping area! Boys and girls are separated, too bad huh

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.660
Embarrassed at her bold provocative comment

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.300
Get down to business and practice in a more comfortable clothing!
