short video call restoration is

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.670 
short video call restoration is
difficult<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:37.840> intense<00:03:38.230> work<00:03:38.970> it's<00:03:39.970> very

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
difficult and intense work it's very

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.650 
difficult and intense work it's very
labor-intensive<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.700> we<00:03:42.850> can<00:03:43.030> always<00:03:43.360> use<00:03:43.630> a

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
labor-intensive so we can always use a

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.770 
labor-intensive so we can always use a
lot<00:03:44.050> of<00:03:44.200> volunteers<00:03:44.790> they<00:03:45.790> want<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.180> get<00:03:46.300> hands
