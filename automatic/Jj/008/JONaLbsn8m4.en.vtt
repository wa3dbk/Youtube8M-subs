attaches of blood monitor a healthy
oxygen<00:03:56.570> saturation<00:03:57.170> level<00:03:57.470> is<00:03:57.640> 97%<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:58.760> above

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
oxygen saturation level is 97% and above

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.010 
oxygen saturation level is 97% and above
so<00:03:59.330> saying<00:04:00.050> is<00:04:00.200> 91<00:04:01.190> 91<00:04:01.880> %<00:04:02.450> is<00:04:02.750> cause<00:04:02.990> for

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
so saying is 91 91 % is cause for

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.320 
so saying is 91 91 % is cause for
concern<00:04:03.290> low<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:04.520> it's<00:04:04.640> really<00:04:04.790> good<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:05.090> we

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
concern low so it's really good that we

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.870 
concern low so it's really good that we

brought you up here for further checkup
so<00:04:08.090> an<00:04:08.900> oxygen<00:04:09.380> mask<00:04:09.530> will<00:04:09.800> help<00:04:09.860> get<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.370> back

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
so an oxygen mask will help get it back

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.050 
so an oxygen mask will help get it back
to<00:04:10.670> normal

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
to normal

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.410 
to normal

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
getting more oxygen in but it still

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.950 
getting more oxygen in but it still
needs<00:04:16.850> to<00:04:17.209> get<00:04:17.480> water<00:04:17.780> out

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
teaspoon of salt water in the lungs your

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.360 
teaspoon of salt water in the lungs your
body<00:04:29.120> has<00:04:29.390> to<00:04:29.420> balance<00:04:29.960> that<00:04:30.590> out<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:31.130> salt

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
body has to balance that out the salt

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.430 
body has to balance that out the salt
water<00:04:31.550> out<00:04:31.670> and<00:04:32.060> it'll<00:04:32.240> draw<00:04:32.600> more<00:04:32.930> water<00:04:33.170> into

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
water out and it'll draw more water into

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.380 
water out and it'll draw more water into
the<00:04:33.620> lungs<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.220> that's<00:04:34.670> why<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:34.910> actually
