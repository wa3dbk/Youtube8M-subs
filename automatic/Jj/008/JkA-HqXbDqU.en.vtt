this game and the reason why I look at
the<00:02:32.350> am<00:02:32.800> game<00:02:33.010> for<00:02:33.040> similarities<00:02:33.850> when<00:02:34.180> you

the am game for similarities when you

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.060 
the am game for similarities when you
spread<00:02:34.630> out<00:02:34.690> Alabama<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.530> are<00:02:35.650> able<00:02:35.860> to

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
spread out Alabama and are able to

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.620 
spread out Alabama and are able to
attack<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.550> short<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:36.910> intermediate<00:02:37.060> passing

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
attack the short to intermediate passing

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.880 
attack the short to intermediate passing
game<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.170> have<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> tight<00:02:38.590> end<00:02:38.740> that's

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
game and you have a tight end that's

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.320 
game and you have a tight end that's
very<00:02:39.070> talented<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.940> can<00:02:40.090> run<00:02:40.240> the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
very talented and you can run the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.970 
very talented and you can run the
football<00:02:40.480> that's<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.350> tough<00:02:41.560> that's<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.830> lot<00:02:41.950> to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
football that's a tough that's a lot to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.160 
football that's a tough that's a lot to
handle<00:02:42.250> for<00:02:42.400> any<00:02:42.640> defense<00:02:43.060> let<00:02:43.450> alone<00:02:43.540> Alabama

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
handle for any defense let alone Alabama

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.780 
handle for any defense let alone Alabama
I<00:02:44.290> think<00:02:44.500> George's<00:02:44.950> offensive<00:02:45.580> game<00:02:45.760> plan

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
I think George's offensive game plan

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.270 
I think George's offensive game plan
gives<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.510> bama<00:02:46.720> defense<00:02:47.200> problems<00:02:47.710> spread

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
gives the bama defense problems spread

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.950 
gives the bama defense problems spread
them<00:02:48.460> out<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.820> weakens<00:02:49.300> their<00:02:49.450> pressure<00:02:49.720> and

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
them out it weakens their pressure and

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.450 
them out it weakens their pressure and
they<00:02:50.380> will<00:02:50.590> be<00:02:50.740> able<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.980> run<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.190> football

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
they will be able to run the football

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.310 
they will be able to run the football
vs.<00:02:51.880> they're<00:02:52.000> very<00:02:52.210> tough<00:02:52.480> defense<00:02:52.900> i<00:02:53.020> look

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320
