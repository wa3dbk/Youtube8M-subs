00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.170
 good morning to all of you guys then this 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.320
 it is a video that is a bit special because not 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.780
 I will talk about teaching 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.080
 I'm here for at the request of some of 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.270
 you who have seen this box 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.560
 modular have asked me questions one 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.330
 Specifically, there is a reduction 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.510
 external internal acoustic and so on 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.989
 it's a tory box or a modular I use it 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.350
 since 2004 so I am still almost there 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.510
 ten years that I have this box 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.300
 not disassembled several times so it's a lot 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.409
 practical though obviously it takes a 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.329
 little experience and in doing so I have to say 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.069
 that a box inside that has 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.979
 truly perfect acoustics 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:56.729
 I hardly have the answer from 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:59.350
 instrument and listening as in here 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.690
 so many of you have seen it anyway 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.579
 my videos and tutorials both didactic and 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.080
 demonstratives have seen that anyway 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.530
 both despite registering with the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.200
 camera enough let's say simple e 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.270
 not in the 14s nor in the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.230
 microphones presented because apart from that 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.850
 it would take me a long time indeed 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.340
 future someone opportunity to say that 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.110
 I will set myself up to do this 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.610
 so obviously because the audio will come 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.950
 even better 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.630
 but at this moment you have heard 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.590
 the acoustics inside are very balanced and 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.070
 very beautiful and now I'll give an example a 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.780
 example with an open door to make you understand 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.510
 how the battery actually how many 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.440
 decibel shoots the battery and then I'll do a 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.240
 small we say bearing on the group 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.159
 with films such that with the door 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.360
 closed you will understand what the felling of the 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.860
 box obviously can go I repeat 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.860
 I feel a great relationship very well 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.650
 with alberto 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.910
 however regardless of this I want to do 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.120
 this thing because I was asked 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.310
 and because anyway I think he has a great one 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.050
 product even if then on the market there 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.960
 they are many but it is obviously I chose 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.030
 this and so I will do this to you 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.740
 demonstration on this product here 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.530
 in the others we obviously tried them 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.420
 so I wouldn't know what to tell you there 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.540
 I do this demonstration by door 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.540
 open 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.930
 this is the sound that in practice the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.150
 farm obviously has inside with 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.220
 the head door now closes the door in 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.420
 very hermetic way and I will do the same 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.420
 what soon 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.810
 here I am of course I made one 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.900
 demonstration where I used to beat 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.390
 because otherwise it makes no sense to make one 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.880
 such a thing would obviously be one 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.800
 useless demonstration to go there to 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.150
 james james in here 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.370
 so I did a demonstration 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.950
 just to let you know what beating 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.310
 is the volume that can be perceived above 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.670
 out 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.770
 It is obvious that if you are inside a box from 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.620
 a garage and even better but inside the house 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.430
 I assure you it is a very good one 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.340
 product 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.340
 so I hope I have been useful 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.930
 for any contact whatsoever 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.270
 information you can contact 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.100
 directly alberto dori on the site 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.630
 by email or by phone to 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.660
 anything but I am always 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.480
 also available to let him do it anyway 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.970
 of tests in the area of ​​course 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.250
 Rome and for now I thank you there 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.880
 see the next instructional video 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.880
