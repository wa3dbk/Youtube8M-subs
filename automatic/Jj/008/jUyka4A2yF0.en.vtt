00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 then the triangle graft is a 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.120
 graft that is usually done without 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.030
 keep the slips so February 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.360
 March the period cannot be carried out 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.100
 even when the scars are the gem 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.189
 almost move is made on the grafts 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.580
 from two to three centimeters in diameter up to 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.310
 4 5 centimeters maybe by adding 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.189
 larger woods and a couple of March yes 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.500
 does to change the variety eg on 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.989
 a peach we could graft more 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.579
 varieties of yellow or white peaches or 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.489
 nectarines at various ages of maturation 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.770
 for example or on the peach tree as 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.680
 we could graft some apricot or 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.780
 the first thing to do is to plum 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.180
 have to be firmly on the legs 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.399
 then legs slightly open so 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.250
 that the trunk is wise enough and 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.320
 then it is the handle of the knife a 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.969
 common grafting knife 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.520
 I remind you that there are knives for 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.890
 right and left handed looking at him by 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.360
 back the knife for the right to one 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.260
 straight wall and one that goes down to 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.180
 chisel while lefties and vice versa 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.310
 the knife is in this way 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.150
 reach out in front of the operator 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.810
 and leans the knife with all the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.060
 handle inside the hand the finger 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.110
 thumb must be on the opposite side 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.159
 at the wire practically ideal position 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.829
 this a few millimeters away from the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.920
 blade edge and like the thumb 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.100
 of course the march must be challenged with the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.500
 left hand pushing it against the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.240
 chest and keeping the elbow open and the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.649
 almost horizontal wood 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.340
 then like the thumb and the other side 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.310
 the mass will have to bend a lot 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.030
 knife seeing only the wire not 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.549
 it must be you don't have to see the back 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.630
 and neither the belly nor towards the operator 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.149
 then below for those who are not capable of 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.550
 graft you have to do in a manner of 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.250
 take off small slices of her 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.610
 I sliding the whole blade e 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:23.130
 going upwards like the elbow 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:25.170
 practically so removing some 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.410
 small slices of wood until 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.540
 a single slice can be removed 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:36.450
 that you go through all the wood doing 4 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.280
 3 4 cm in length two thirds of the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.530
 cut wood then turns 90 degrees e 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.050
 always removing small slices 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.590
 of wood until leaving 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:55.020
 from the beginning we get two 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.900
 equal cuts where the marrow must 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.240
 be careful at the center 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.300
 main one of the good foresight is 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.070
 that of ensuring that the first gem is 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:12.390
 find the march behind the cuts 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:16.260
 cut 23 gems without ever touching i 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.570
 points of cut Italian points go 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.750
 touch yourself because your hands sweat 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.830
 you can pollute the cut made this 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.220
 operation 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.680
 we have to put the gear on mine 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.340
 graft holder in this case, however, I will have to 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.580
 do I have to calculate the length of the 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.480
 my cuts about 4 centimeters and the 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.989
 width of my gear about 4 mm 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.110
 I will make a central nod that does not serve 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:50.040
 nothing only serves for novices like 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.350
 I went to say now 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.220
 the depth within four centimeters 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:00.959
 of my cuts and I move 2 mm to the right 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:05.030
 of the central cut by directing the blade 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.030
 towards the center of the wood 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.050
 then 2 mm to the right of the cut 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.269
 direction now blade towards the center raise 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.560
 just barely out because if i get up 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:22.090
 too go wrong and working at peak 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.910
 I make a cut 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.300
 the same thing I'll do on the other side at 2 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.970
 mm to the left direction the blade towards the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:36.130
 high center just barely tip e 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.680
 I create a joint if I see the joint 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.810
 which is a little smaller I can 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.810
 widen by repositioning the blade 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:52.750
 then I put my my march 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.750
 taking care to ensure that the below 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.300
 stock of the rootstock touch the below 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.330
 rind of the march that is where it comes off 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.600
 the calf rind must touch where 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.620
 the rind of the rootstock comes off 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:11.220
 logically if my plug-in ports is a 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.610
 3 4 cm wood from 4 to 5 years 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.370
 will certainly have a thickness of 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.620
 bark much higher than that 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.360
 which is my calm that he knows he must 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.060
 still have a year 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:30.430
 in that case my gear will be 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:33.700
 slightly encased when I read I will have to 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:37.720
 take this into account because I will have to put one 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.520
 often that keeps the march in place 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:45.340
 that keeps the march in that one 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:48.660
 position you make a first turn you put 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.660
 below the eno thickness 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:03.880
 and then binds us all openings now 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.280
 that there are all the cuts made 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.860
 the eventual hole that can be formed 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.100
 when the joint is made, they must be protected 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:16.450
 with mastics we usually use waxes from 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:19.660
 grafts but at the most you can use del 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.830
 wine you try to cover all well 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:26.080
 the cut parts and possibly 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.480
 go over the next day because masses 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.150
 being very soft they could 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.250
 form gaps and then the day 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.030
 later it would be appropriate to cover the 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.100
 all 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.070
 if we move to this plant by 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.220
 peach I could make a triangle up here 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:45.400
 this fairly thick wood up here 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:49.840
 this on this 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.700
 on this I could do it on type wood 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.000
 this pa and then another in point in 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:58.090
 that position practically this 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.720
 I could graft 45 peach varieties from 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:04.930
 the 45 varietal apricot fair 45 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.940
 variety of plum trees logically some 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.700
 variety or some species could 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.890
 vegetate more than others, however, with the 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.510
 green pruning the winter pruning us 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.510
 we could regulate its vigor
