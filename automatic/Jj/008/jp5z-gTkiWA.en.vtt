00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:05.810
 so had and welcome to the Muscat to the next and as well 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.559
 Last Times rumbled off Jobs 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.019
 Percent right from the start 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.480
 NN excuse me not so much in that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 It took ages for this last few divisions 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.019
 Aral i hate processes time is 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:23.409
 to much to do 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.409
 and percent in the few days where I go 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.109
 nothing or less had to be honest at all 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.270
 do not go straighter on this game 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.270
 Year percent nevertheless 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 next to Amazon that we get this finished today 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.790
 the found papacy I have to add percent weakens real 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.160
 abysmal 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.790
 let's see if I can somehow manage it anyway FIFA not percent and me 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.250
 Me again hit me in place 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.360
 so may 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.180
 the charge for it 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 it starts already 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.530
 and from this 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.530
 Constellation they are here US 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.870
 complete a whole series 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.360
 it can only be hours 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.360
 it was terrible 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.330
 the TuS is still promised 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.540
 I've already tried percent ever 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.910
 the next parts 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.640
 often next door 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.510
 and that's what s 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.590
 Much was relatively late in the evening 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.600
 percent 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.100
 Nevertheless 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.030
 St that 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.570
 just times 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.570
 a more difficult game 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.990
 So almost impossible to do 4 with the time that got his feet 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.540
 have 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.600
 Hanover 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 so 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.020
 or he tries it approx 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.149
 good so if i percent in august 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:19.549
 someone wet because Manthan that the Camorra set their car 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.549
 Eintrachts halfway 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.400
 so now I'm just krah her with 2 Hanna Merkel in a keyboard 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.949
 instead of a phasing out 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.219
 Yael otherwise damaged 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.219
 the four when trying the animal 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.189
 decent 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.519
 the army is clear 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.859
 and 8 Zetsche 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.859
 Montreux I'll be fine 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.659
 that is certainly well done 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.719
 and awarded as expected 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.779
 Alright 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.399
 Semester to that we get there 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.619
 so percent a year 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:23.689
 what's new 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.569
 March Heinrich Cactus already 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.249
 at first 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:30.249
 I made a beautiful bad buy 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:32.219
 Köhler 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:34.099
 by trying 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.100
 more one 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.049
 get new mouse 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.059
 per se 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:43.579
 Pluto you do not suspect that you have devoured so much money there 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.679
 So I had not suspected last 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:51.409
 Aproz Eck I have then but kind of committed but actually 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.190
 I suppose I could 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.889
 buy a mouse from Microsoft which then still works 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.449
 it is yes 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.079
 I Knocke crazy presentation I do not know what to think 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.399
 to have 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:05.609
 her heart to my eyes 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.759
 already enthusiastic 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.529
 the mouse percent more from 11 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.529
 works why does not work properly 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.249
 it's a WHO Laser Mouse 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:20.479
 The supposedly prof especially many observers count 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.430
 especially good Elz 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.249
 so it works very well 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:29.979
 To be honest, however, I did not manage to do that 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.529
 Meinert 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:35.529
 Percent of you also used for this game because the um 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:38.870
 I also can not use a mouse from Microsoft 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.680
 is by percent Logitech Brest Pink is not 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.680
 Certainly throws ten or eleven years now 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.180
 and 15 debut 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.360
 the mouse of Microsoft which cost me almost 30 euros what 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.479
 Companies are not that busy but still more than me 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.189
 would like to spend working out 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:03.189
 Percent laughs she works 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.909
 that is 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.300
 what am I doing worse here 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.039
 and not later 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.639
 that means it works stone 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.639
 but just 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.650
 more off bad than right 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.770
 that is to say 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.350
 I usually always play games or mousepads on a slip of the tongue 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.650
 Driving Chef Marketplace 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.650
 Dell Architects has no problem at all 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.300
 however had 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.250
 Obviously, percent of Microsoft Maurus has followed the years so there is one 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.250
 almost a surface protection Dieter Merten extreme problem 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.999
 Noise, therefore, I have now unceremoniously show my old as completed 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:57.000
 The year 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Wars finally 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.949
 They are not bad either 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.319
 but have 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.319
 Hayes 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.389
 Röder for this passage 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.210
 and is definitely in front of your eyes 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.639
 applaud fans at the suitcase 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.369
 short sense and purpose of this 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.369
 over a long history 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.529
 Merry on 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.409
 to test that 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.409
 not on rules 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.830
 crib 

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:12.629
 at point 11 

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:14.740
 he holds hard 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.740
 you know that ICN cramp 

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:22.669

 Chatton that Porsche on Sylt 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:29.539
 They play relatively 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:32.539
 complicated 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:36.210
 and continue horn 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.210
 hamlet 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.349
 that was a cramp 

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:44.800
 saying that's exactly what it is 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.929
 I thought they want to fuck me 

00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:49.169
 oil 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:51.240
 limited to some with the nice small box
