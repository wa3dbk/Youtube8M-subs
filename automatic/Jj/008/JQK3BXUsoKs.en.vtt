like<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.209> better<00:02:19.450> than<00:02:19.750> oculus<00:02:20.319> which<00:02:20.470> was

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590

are kind of cut back it was one of those

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.650 
are kind of cut back it was one of those
movies<00:02:52.000> where<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.180> could<00:02:52.330> have<00:02:52.360> been<00:02:52.510> either

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
movies where it could have been either

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.600 
movies where it could have been either
way<00:02:52.950> hopefully<00:02:53.950> when<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.160> comes<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.459> blu-ray

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
way hopefully when it comes to blu-ray

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.970 
way hopefully when it comes to blu-ray
they<00:02:54.880> do<00:02:54.940> on<00:02:55.540> cut<00:02:55.900> edition<00:02:56.290> which<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.500> have<00:02:56.890> a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
they do on cut edition which I have a

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.780 
they do on cut edition which I have a
feeling<00:02:57.190> they're<00:02:57.310> going<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.489> do<00:02:57.640> because

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
feeling they're going to do because

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.400 
feeling they're going to do because
there's<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.090> lot<00:02:58.300> of<00:02:58.330> more<00:02:58.569> stuff<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.319> think

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
there's a lot of more stuff that I think

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.920 
there's a lot of more stuff that I think
that<00:02:59.650> they<00:02:59.800> could<00:02:59.860> have<00:03:00.069> shown<00:03:00.510> out<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.690> 5

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
that they could have shown out of 5

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.000 
that they could have shown out of 5
stars<00:03:02.970> probably<00:03:03.970> three<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.540> half<00:03:05.010> wasn't
