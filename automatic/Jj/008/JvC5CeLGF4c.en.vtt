beautiful engraving of a bluebird there
was<00:02:12.790> something<00:02:13.120> we<00:02:13.210> focused<00:02:13.600> huge<00:02:13.930> design

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
was something we focused huge design

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.650 
was something we focused huge design

excellence<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.150> clock<00:02:25.360> for<00:02:25.570> example

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
excellence like the clock for example

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.870 
excellence like the clock for example
where<00:02:26.140> we<00:02:26.230> develop<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.620> brand<00:02:26.860> new<00:02:27.190> clock

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
where we develop a brand new clock

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.540 
where we develop a brand new clock
purely<00:02:28.360> for<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:28.630> car<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:30.010> an<00:02:30.100> infinity

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
purely for this car that an infinity

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.890 
purely for this car that an infinity
symbol<00:02:30.910> is<00:02:31.000> something<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.540> picked<00:02:31.780> up

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
symbol is something that we picked up

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.780 
symbol is something that we picked up
off<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.140> globe<00:02:32.350> aircraft

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
off the globe aircraft

off the globe aircraft
for<00:02:35.599> the<00:02:35.690> steering-wheel<00:02:36.319> we<00:02:36.830> drew<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.489> design

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
for the steering-wheel we drew a design
