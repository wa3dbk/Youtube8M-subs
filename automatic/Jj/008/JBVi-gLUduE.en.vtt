00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
another like 40 kilowatts to the retread

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.960 
another like 40 kilowatts to the retread
mean<00:00:44.750> it's<00:00:45.440> gotta<00:00:45.680> look<00:00:45.920> as<00:00:46.160> fast<00:00:46.610> as<00:00:46.820> it's

nearly measure one of those just a
reference<00:01:06.439> we<00:01:06.920> can<00:01:06.950> scan<00:01:07.310> it<00:01:07.340> up<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:07.700> real<00:01:07.850> size

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
reference we can scan it up to real size

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.660 
reference we can scan it up to real size
on<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.299> computer<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:09.020> then<00:01:09.979> actual<00:01:10.430> stick

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
on the computer and then actual stick

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.190 
on the computer and then actual stick
will<00:01:10.820> be<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.000> actual<00:01:11.090> size<00:01:11.479> like<00:01:11.750> what<00:01:11.960> we're

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
will be the actual size like what we're

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.539 
will be the actual size like what we're
actually<00:01:12.320> going<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.619> do<00:01:12.770> is<00:01:13.189> you're<00:01:13.340> going<00:01:13.460> to

red so I thought the bleach end up
rather<00:01:22.970> than<00:01:23.090> what<00:01:23.990> we<00:01:24.110> expected<00:01:24.439> so<00:01:24.950> much
