00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 and welcomes everyone knows that and 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.429
 people no end up for a new 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.160
 video on minecraft in event archer so 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.929
 we are on the event archers of the gentleman 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.670
 marine angelo and so we're all from 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.500
 afterwards I took the undermine kit 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.180
 in order to have the gender term here 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.520
 Besides, I will immediately 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.410
 explain why there was a lack of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.070
 videos and here is a lack 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.570
 business 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.619
 it was felt on my channel 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.140
 simply because of the holidays 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.310
 here I was not there and on top of that 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.740
 with the return all that is enough 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.690
 complicated so I apologize but one does not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.899
 you make paul I take them back 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.059
 videos from now 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.620
 so if the market adventures so I 'm going 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.050
 do it more often and zinkers 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.660
 game i will attack z kai games 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.239
 So here is still a lot of leaves to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.780
 you introduce all that so I 'm getting 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.610
 to follow 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:58.260
 it's not really done and here we are 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.410
 will recover meaning 2 I do not know at all 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.580
 what it was they were our 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.010
 kits we will say ok so the baiona I 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.530
 I'm just going to do something 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.530
 this is in order to switch bow compass 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.119
 it is much more practical 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.119
 so if there was a phase down j c 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.760
 you agree ok so here is still 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.950
 once I apologize for one for the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.830
 lack of activity we will not stay at 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.840
 talk about that but that's it 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.940
 you know it but at the cheater you 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.550
 see then there you could very well 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.270
 drink the bohemian boot of the guy 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:43.970
 visio of people and touch me that's 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:48.020
 did sir I kill them and buyers of 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.570
 me so level is still white so 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.600
 I go no kill with him and so we go 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:00.350
 to others the hosts piot port so 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:03.140
 there there is someone ok or not malkin 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.210
 so it was a well played tank 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.210
 to you ferry now 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.450
 or this is very good and still a turn ok 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:24.460
 so and we continue continues launches a 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.350
 excellent player I will say it and that's it 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.640
 it's a nice little carnage for 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.260
 the moment I think I'm going when 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.190
 even put on youtube even though I'm dying 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.190
 Oh 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:49.530
 ok so I blutch point and a pretty 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:56.150
 little carnage frankly after the no 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.150
 kill elky 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.990
 okay 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.000
 okay 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.920
 I do not want to skip a mom 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.140
 because it simply remains 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:19.680
 still there are still media days 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.599
 stop 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.730
 whore but what is needed of 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.989
 so that's ok, he must stop me 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:32.069
 aim otherwise without an accident the friend of 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.750
 their yeah ok so no go and blutch the 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.659
 pretty little carnage wood a you have it 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.629
 seen it's an optical egg thing I'm 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.370
 well happy then I will give them 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:47.450
 under earth there you see my stuff 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.450
 not bad here we go we believe 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:55.319
 well, we went to and we go 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.139
 to go we left hoping that 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:02.040
 sir al kidd arquennes are doing 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:05.189
 kill by month or even others this 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.629
 would be stupid to die like that and we 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:10.049
 hope there is no day accident 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.900
 another shock between team here is so we 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.510
 left in the hope that it happens 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.609
 well and that I point another player 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.049
 so I do not really know I'm 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.370
 pleased with me I made a really a 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.370
 nice little one that a regular 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.289
 a nice little team of 3 it was a 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.599
 little carnage because there is really 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.370
 much bigger but frankly pretty 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.840
 so now so now it must be fast 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.990
 that I find other players for 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.759
 not that it stops now I 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.780
 hockey jarre here and so we go 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.610
 I do not need to be too 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.720
 confident because when we are too 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.580
 confident that's the problem 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.860
 we do anything so we have to 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.479
 stay focused even when filming 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.099
 it's a bit more complicated to keep 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.550
 his calm in addition to that one must speak 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.770
 to activate an iv act that lives for 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.229
 animate a little bit the video 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.380
 anyway because it can be pretty 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.880
 filled rather complicated during so 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.120
 So here I am going to 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.400
 move to 34 so apparently he's at 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:15.090
 someone and he folds so this turn 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:16.860
 is quite complicated chivet so that makes 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.289
 from 3 v 2 maybe it's a small 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.210
 little I see them sir it's not the 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.370
 shit that there I saw them I'm going 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.690
 try to take them both sides that's fine 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:36.409
 to be quite dangerous anyway but I 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.409
 think he's lying here a hot anthem 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:45.280
 it would have been good and omg that I have 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.280
 eat more 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.360
 yeah so be really a lot 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.440
 white goose power has seen it's 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.620
 really very good 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.030
 gg to you blutch so suddenly what makes 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.880
 we are still 1,2 v 1 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.640
 so it's still good but we'll say 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.870
 that everything can be played in here is a 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:14.090
 moment it's a game it continues 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.090
 maybe darkhan will win it smells 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.310
 if I lie I think I post 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.440
 here I am post and I had a big lag 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.180
 excuse me here so I hope that 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.820
 this video will have pleased you it was a 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.370
 pretty little carnage waking up market on 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.200
 the marin angelo servers and we say to ourselves 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.860
 see you soon for a next video 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.860
 go bye
