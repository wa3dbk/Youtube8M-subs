the gun gets wedged in it it kind of

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.720 
the gun gets wedged in it it kind of
have<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.850> tuck<00:03:25.300> it<00:03:25.510> around<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.890> area<00:03:27.370> now<00:03:29.730> I

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
have to tuck it around that area now I

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.640 
have to tuck it around that area now I
would<00:03:31.000> likely<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.630> would<00:03:31.870> likely<00:03:32.080> have<00:03:32.440> him

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
would likely I would likely have him

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.830 
would likely I would likely have him
holding<00:03:33.010> his<00:03:33.040> whip<00:03:33.370> more<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.000> than<00:03:34.030> his<00:03:34.300> gun<00:03:34.540> so

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
holding his whip more so than his gun so

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.449 
holding his whip more so than his gun so
I<00:03:34.870> would<00:03:35.050> probably<00:03:35.290> just<00:03:35.410> keep<00:03:35.980> his<00:03:36.220> gun

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
I would probably just keep his gun

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.910 
I would probably just keep his gun
indefinitely<00:03:37.209> in<00:03:37.480> his<00:03:37.600> belt<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.170> just<00:03:38.680> leave

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
indefinitely in his belt and just leave

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.460 
indefinitely in his belt and just leave
it<00:03:39.040> at<00:03:39.130> that<00:03:39.300> we<00:03:40.300> zoom<00:03:40.480> into<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.780> details<00:03:41.200> of

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
it at that we zoom into the details of

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.660 
it at that we zoom into the details of
tigra<00:03:44.340> he<00:03:45.340> doesn't<00:03:45.579> have<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.730> bad<00:03:45.880> looking<00:03:46.239> face

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
tigra he doesn't have a bad looking face

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.250 
tigra he doesn't have a bad looking face
it<00:03:48.670> feels<00:03:48.910> like<00:03:49.060> it's<00:03:49.209> missing<00:03:49.450> something<00:03:49.630> but

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
it feels like it's missing something but

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.380 
it feels like it's missing something but
I<00:03:50.500> think<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:51.010> kind<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.400> just<00:03:51.549> get<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:51.910> general

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
I think I kind of just get that general

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.789 
I think I kind of just get that general
feeling<00:03:52.870> with<00:03:52.989> a<00:03:53.019> lot<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.470> Thundercats

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
feeling with a lot of the Thundercats

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.830 
feeling with a lot of the Thundercats
toys<00:03:54.459> they'll<00:03:54.760> smaller<00:03:55.120> scale<00:03:55.480> at<00:03:55.630> least

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
toys they'll smaller scale at least

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.840 
toys they'll smaller scale at least
they're<00:03:56.500> nice<00:03:56.680> but<00:03:57.100> they<00:03:57.220> just<00:03:57.400> kind<00:03:57.610> of<00:03:57.640> feel

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
they're nice but they just kind of feel

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.569 
they're nice but they just kind of feel
