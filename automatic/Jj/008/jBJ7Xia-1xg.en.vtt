00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 We will now look at how a fuel cell works. 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.620
 There are several different types of fuel cells. 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.760
 We will look at a fuel cell that extracts energy from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.860
 The fuel cell uses hydrogen as a fuel to make electricity. 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.720
 Cars with fuel cells can be driven by hydrogen gas from a tank and oxygen from the air. 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.400
 The waste product is water. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.220
 We'll see how this works. 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.660
 A fuel cell consists of an anode and a cathode. 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.980
 We recognize them from, among other things, electrolysis of water. 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.200
 We are now going to look at a cross section of a fuel cell. 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.580
 Between the anode and the cathode there is a membrane that only passes through hydrogen ions. 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.400
 We release hydrogen gas to the anode and oxygen gas to the cathode. 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.900
 On the anode there is a catalyst that splits up hydrogen gas - 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.440
 - to two free electrons and two positive hydrogen ions. 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.240
 A positive hydrogen ion consists of only one proton. 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.700
 The hydrogen ions will pass through the membrane and over to the cathode side. 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.320
 The electrons cannot pass through the membrane, since it only releases hydrogen ions. 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.660
 They have to go through the anode through a circuit before they reach the cathode. 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.520
 On the cathode, hydrogen ions, oxygen gas and electrons meet. 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.360
 And we get formed water. 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.660
 Electrons will flow from the anode to the cathode, ie a current. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.200
 Between the anode and the cathode we can plug in a light bulb and make it light. 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.360
 In electric cars, the power drives an electric motor.
