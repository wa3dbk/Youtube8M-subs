don't think I've had anybody actually

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.130 
don't think I've had anybody actually
coming<00:00:20.610> to<00:00:21.610> tell<00:00:21.849> me<00:00:21.970> that<00:00:22.150> they<00:00:22.300> are<00:00:22.329> burning

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
themselves with erasers but I certainly

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.370 
themselves with erasers but I certainly
have<00:00:24.939> had<00:00:25.029> a<00:00:25.090> lot<00:00:25.300> of<00:00:25.390> kids<00:00:25.599> in<00:00:25.779> here<00:00:26.080> that<00:00:26.140> I've

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
have had a lot of kids in here that I've

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.960 
have had a lot of kids in here that I've
been<00:00:26.470> talking<00:00:26.980> to<00:00:27.070> about<00:00:27.189> other<00:00:27.460> things<00:00:27.730> and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
been talking to about other things and

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.480 
been talking to about other things and
I've<00:00:28.089> noticed<00:00:28.500> eraser<00:00:29.500> burns<00:00:29.710> on<00:00:29.890> their<00:00:30.039> hands

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
I've noticed eraser burns on their hands

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.229 
I've noticed eraser burns on their hands
and<00:00:30.640> I<00:00:30.699> think<00:00:31.179> we're<00:00:31.330> having<00:00:31.480> a<00:00:31.750> big<00:00:33.239> epidemic

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
and I think we're having a big epidemic

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.860 
and I think we're having a big epidemic
of<00:00:34.720> eraser<00:00:35.140> burns<00:00:35.379> this<00:00:35.980> year<00:00:36.330> so<00:00:37.330> why<00:00:37.690> are

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
of eraser burns this year so why are

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.350 
of eraser burns this year so why are
eraser<00:00:38.350> burns<00:00:38.589> such<00:00:38.860> big<00:00:39.190> deals<00:00:39.809> well<00:00:40.809> I<00:00:40.839> think

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
eraser burns such big deals well I think

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.509 
eraser burns such big deals well I think
as<00:00:43.360> you<00:00:43.449> mentioned<00:00:44.350> earlier<00:00:44.739> that<00:00:44.799> I<00:00:45.070> think

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
as you mentioned earlier that I think

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.219 
as you mentioned earlier that I think
kids<00:00:45.760> can<00:00:46.000> do<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.239> and<00:00:46.570> get<00:00:46.690> away<00:00:46.780> with<00:00:47.080> in

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:47.229 
kids can do it and get away with in

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.560 
kids can do it and get away with in
class<00:00:47.530> where<00:00:47.860> people<00:00:48.159> don't<00:00:48.369> notice<00:00:48.610> it<00:00:48.940> but<00:00:49.510> I

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
class where people don't notice it but I

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.049 
class where people don't notice it but I
also<00:00:49.869> think<00:00:50.260> it<00:00:50.379> becomes<00:00:50.949> kind<00:00:51.190> of<00:00:51.339> a<00:00:51.489> you<00:00:52.030> know

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
also think it becomes kind of a you know

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.660 
also think it becomes kind of a you know
everybody's<00:00:52.930> kind<00:00:53.080> of<00:00:53.290> doing<00:00:53.650> it<00:00:53.799> and<00:00:54.159> we're

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
everybody's kind of doing it and we're

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.700 
everybody's kind of doing it and we're
real<00:00:54.820> concerned<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.390> it's<00:00:55.600> stopped<00:00:55.989> and<00:00:56.379> and

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
real concerned that it's stopped and and

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.670 
real concerned that it's stopped and and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
mostly for the safety of the kids eraser

well again I think it's a fad we as long

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.590 
well again I think it's a fad we as long
as<00:02:57.220> I've<00:02:57.370> been<00:02:57.400> here<00:02:57.790> which<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.120> long<00:02:58.330> time

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
we've gone in and out of years where

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.979 
we've gone in and out of years where
kids<00:03:00.850> have<00:03:00.970> been<00:03:01.090> doing<00:03:01.209> kinds<00:03:01.600> of<00:03:01.720> things
