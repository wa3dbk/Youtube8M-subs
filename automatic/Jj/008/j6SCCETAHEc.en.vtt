00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 We quickly headed to Mars though 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.170
 it was Wednesday xd to be able to how is that 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.179
 that they went to Mars 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.969
 if they do not interrupt me I could count the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.420
 details - we have the school with the story 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.970
 chapter 38 the trip to space as 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.970
 I once said on Mars I had a strange 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.189
 hey hey ask for a pizza that I have 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.109
 hungry now I call the pizzeria and as 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.840
 they could have a signal to call from 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.840
 another planet stop me from interrupting 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.470
 sons of bitches and there we were waiting 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.470
 for the pizza 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.470
 pizzeria be there we deliver the pizza no 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.930
 it matters on which side of the galaxy the 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.660
 life they say it like in the commercial x of 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.850
 Gutierrez pay our friend and 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.890
 after that Gutierrez will pay you we had 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:54.570
 to run away you 'll see why 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.570
 this ticket is fake 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 we have to write this in our 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.570
 report is true friend we also have 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.790

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.580
 still martian green or even telesur and del 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.530
 space after exploring and reaching the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.960
 conclusion that there was nothing said 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.840
 here there's nothing better let's go to another 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.210
 planet and so we turn to mercury 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.040
 moment this story is going to the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.830
 shit how is it that they went to mercury if 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.479
 they had no ship or anything to go there 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.940
 Professor Stryder is interrupting me 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.789
 let him finish telling the story and 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.580
 finally we get mercury hey does 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.009

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.350
 I'm cooking, then I took out 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.630
 my notebook to write on 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.390

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.039
 we go near jupiter to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.560
 decide which planet we would launch 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.119
 a coin if it falls face we go to Saturn and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.119
 if it falls cross we go to neptune 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.840
 I think it will not come back better let's 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.970
 neptune and so we go to neptune 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.400
 we went from charging heat to 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.590
 get cold today there is a lake 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.180

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.170
 cold and finally we headed to pluton 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.069
 where we found an abandoned taxi 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.019

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.549

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.950
 that they signed up to tell

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.220

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.540
