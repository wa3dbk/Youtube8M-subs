 I give 30 grams to god and to directly 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.830
 just on it 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:27.610
 and lukewarm of half a liter 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:30.030
 water still so easy in the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.030
 center in 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.960
 any yeast simply 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.979
 Mix a little bit more nice 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.979
 you can only do that 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.530
 Now we just think it all off 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.530
 and let us stand for five minutes 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.770
 you need the help a bit 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.980
 be received and if we here 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.440
 Yes, the yeast looks good 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.210
 you can already received and now 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.110
 Let's take care of the rest 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.110
 Add the ingredients 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.970
 for the taste give it now 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:35.100
 30 grams of melted butter here 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:38.370
 we still have 1 followed by something 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.000
 Oil even 30 milliliters just once 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.550
 purely 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:54.840
 so and now two eggs are added 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:58.050
 first a whole and a protein still 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.810
 to the egg yolk we can therefore out there 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.810
 is only two family yet 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:15.270
 and money then put a little bit 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.220
 water from our old liter and then 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.110
 let's start with mixing dough 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.110
 as swirl the monstrum 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.209
 he had 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.960
 and 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:56.660
 and at night we continue our water 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:58.099
 to see our day is done now 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.319
 you have to be much further here 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.920
 can here a slight uncertainty 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.800
 to press 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.670
 in general, that is different 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.489
 amount of water so a bit 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.470
 Water hardness but about must 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.830
 look out the dough and now we leave 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.830
 rest the dough for an hour and the harbors 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.829
 at one hour they go to me so long 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.590
 went down and there was exactly like that 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.389
 as it should be and now take me 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.760
 a proven worksheets 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.760
 just a little micro hinsteuern 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.320
 and the dough iwf from Wertheim now and 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:47.270
 always make 600 grams portions 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.080
 our pond as well as in parts work 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.080
 something is happening now too 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:12.930
 have developed and we take him 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.930
 Just love him on a baking paper 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.900
 and now we can use the tank again 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.900
 Covered for 30 minutes 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.909
 after our part, there are the 30th 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.680
 has already rested minutes 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.830
 already preparing to winter 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.229
 for baking and the mensa visually 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.020
 appealing out looks with the yolk 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.360
 that we have left with brushing 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.219
 now our part to a small one 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.259
 brush and then that really nice 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:48.550
 Apply over a large area 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.750
 you can not do that yolk either 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.159
 previously with a bit of milk 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.659
 stir then also strokes 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.250
 much lighter than me on my lap 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.169
 milk with rich 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.099
 and now it is just beautiful 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.099
 daubs 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.129
 is 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.780
 Euro 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.710
 then we are already done with 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.060
 brush and now we'll do it 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.800
 few holes in I just take me 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.020
 three fingers and pushes the beautiful 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.610
 purely so that we even after so this 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.040
 typical patterns for the turkish 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.370
 Flags just get like body parts 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.020
 press and a few Löchle a 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.090
 lack of caution not quite press through 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.090
 but just stop the dough 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.150
 Now there is a little more sesame 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.950
 over it one can the normal sesame and 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.720
 black sesame seeds take black sesame 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.820
 Unfortunately, I do not recommend that 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.030
 but in any case just like that 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.710
 sprinkle a bit over it and that results 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.330
 then also this good known 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.830
 taste yes and so look at my 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.010
 bread and now you can from as early as 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.010
 the oven
