00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.639
 Today I'll show you a very easy way. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.769
 to cut a glass bottle 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.809
 besides the bottle you will need a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.910
 little alcohol or any other type 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.490
 of course you have to do 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.619
 out of the house and with the help of a 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.800
 adult and will need a bit of 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.099
 water and a cotton string and is 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.970
 clear a pair of goggles and a 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.260
 gloves 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.560
 the first thing to do is put 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.480
 water to the point where you want to cut 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.340
 now I'll give you five turns of string 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.200
 around the bottle and these routes have to 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.610
 be made well above the water level 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.440
 and the string has to be fine 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.120
 ajeitadinha is now necessary to look good 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.920
 this string with alcohol and not 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.789
 leaving a mess of alcohol can be 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:57.420
 dangerous 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:59.640
 I'll use an eyedropper like now. 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.039
 I'm going to use fire. I'll keep the alcohol there. 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.039
 inside to stay safe experience 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.590
 now time to cut the bottle 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:35.460
 let's take a look at how it got 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:38.399
 this cut before finishing it 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.560
 our newest glass pot made with 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.990
 a bottle does not understand why the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.179
 bottle broke exactly in the circle of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.179
 all this happened because of a 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.729
 physical phenomenon calls for lactation when 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.970
 we heat the glass it increases or 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.740
 whether it dilates and this dilation 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.079
 happens only from the fire up because of the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.479
 fire down is full of water to water 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.229
 absorbs heat and does not leave the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.849
 natalie 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.970
 then it means that this part of the glass 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:08.789
 can not increase and the bottom part can not 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.340
 and this difference means that the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.970
 glass to break exactly in the circle of 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.030
 the boundary between the water and the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.220
 empty bottle and now let's 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.139
 This is where we can get 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.139
 use our coutinho without wearing gloves 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.889
 but experiences with this one you 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.920
 finds next Tuesday in the blog 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:42.109
 dumb this video here was the first one 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.340
 We recorded outside the house here in the 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.469
 world manual 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.200
 This is the front garage of our 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:51.530
 studio we put a mattress 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.799
 gazebo up here to avoid the sun and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.810
 also got rain started go some 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.319
 The sun's rays on the side 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.000
 cloth and a flower of the background to give 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.400
 a rest because this mayor was 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.870
 boring and confused with the table but 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.430
 I think it's cool from now on. 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.699
 can do things that can be 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.510
 made outside the home and not only in 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:12.980
 from the studio 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.989
 however leaving below two 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.480
 very cool videos that were recorded 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.340
 outside the studio here in sao paulo this 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.620
 side here the cinema in the box that is one of the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.889
 best videos of the world and of you 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.889
 other side here the soap bubbles 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.889
 giant 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.959
 doubt
