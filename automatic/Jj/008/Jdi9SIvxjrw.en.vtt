00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.110
 the category that sells the most cars in the 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.779
 Brazil, the use of compact vehicles was 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.900
 bombarded by several launches in 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.099
 2012 and who takes advantage of this of course 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.099
 is the consumer 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.470
 chevrolet unix and hyundai hb 20 mal 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.540
 reached the market but have already shown that 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.570
 have great chances to fight equally 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.579
 with consolidated leaders such as 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.579
 the volkswagen gol and fiat palio 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.329
 in their most expensive versions but these 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.329
 may exceed 40 thousand reais 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.220
 what compact cars offer 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.320
 for this price 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.270
 in both cases the list of equipment 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.850
 serial is complete 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.520
 The hb 20 also offers 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.500
 back parking while the nicks 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.080
 has a touch screen for 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.890
 the radio and other functions of the 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.200
 car 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.799
 despite offering a similar package 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.320
 of motorized equipment is 1.4 in the 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.659
 unix and 1.6 on hb 20 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.259
 In both cases, the exchange rate is 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.259
 five speeds 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.410
 this power difference can be 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.870
 perceived when addressing the two 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.760
 cars but there are other features that 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.760
 make them even more different 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.920
 unix is ​​a bit slower in 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.909
 accelerations and also in the resumption of 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.400
 velocity 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.530
 the suspension is also softer than you play 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.140
 well 2011 which makes him miss a 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.269
 little stability on the road 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.939
 with the firmer suspension and an engine 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.400
 more onyx spectrum the hd 20 one 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.280
 driving smoothly since the driver 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.810
 reduces gears and steering is also 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.060
 more direct than the rival 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.110
 aesthetically the two models are 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.569
 attractive 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.090
 the bus seems to be bigger 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.299
 because of its front 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.090
 the hb 20 is modern without being overdone 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.890
 in the cabin the finish is satisfactory 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.769
 not impressive but have good parts 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.569
 well-located controls 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.609
 two models do not disturb the 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.040
 competition the bus has a good 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.349
 position to drive modern solutions 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.810
 in the booth as the touchscreen of the 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.750
 radio and good performance for the city 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.000
 the hb 20 however is better finished and 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.310
 performs better than the bus and 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.510
 therefore it should continue to be the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.510
 wanted in stores
