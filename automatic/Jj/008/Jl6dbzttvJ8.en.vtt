00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
one of the key features about this all

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.330 
one of the key features about this all
of<00:00:32.640> our<00:00:32.759> pads<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.360> looks<00:00:34.260> really<00:00:34.800> basic<00:00:35.190> but

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
of our pads have looks really basic but

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.010 
of our pads have looks really basic but
there's<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.550> hole<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> middle<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.270> what

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
there's a hole in the middle and what

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.139 
there's a hole in the middle and what
that<00:00:37.140> means<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:38.040> using<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.910> time<00:00:39.059> have

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
that means is that using the time have

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.610 
that means is that using the time have
you<00:00:39.210> got<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> centering<00:00:39.690> tool<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
you got the centering tool so the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.049 
you got the centering tool so the
backing<00:00:40.920> plate<00:00:41.070> comes<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.579> centering

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
backing plate comes with a centering

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.590 
backing plate comes with a centering
tool<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:43.379> basically<00:00:43.710> means<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:45.120> pad<00:00:45.300> will<00:00:45.510> be

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
tool and basically means the pad will be

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.279 
tool and basically means the pad will be
dead<00:00:45.809> center<00:00:46.789> which<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.600> quite<00:00:49.110> difficult

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
dead center which can be quite difficult

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.639 
dead center which can be quite difficult
thing<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.870> pads<00:00:51.870> without<00:00:52.020> centering

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
thing to do on pads without centering

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.830 
thing to do on pads without centering
centering<00:00:53.399> hole<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.329> know<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.629> dead

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
centering hole so we know that's dead

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.389 
centering hole so we know that's dead
center<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.530> no<00:00:55.649> vibration<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
center so you get no vibration with the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.880 
center so you get no vibration with the
pad<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.050> you<00:00:58.050> generally<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.770> better

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
pad and you generally get a better

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.860 
pad and you generally get a better
finish<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.760> that's<00:00:59.850> now<00:01:00.090> dead<00:01:00.480> center

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
finish of that so that's now dead center

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.039 
finish of that so that's now dead center
we've<00:01:01.649> got<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.640> p1<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.780> very

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
we've got that and the p1 and one very

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.350 
we've got that and the p1 and one very
scratched<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.619> Ferrari<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.119> we're<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
scratched up Ferrari so we're going to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
do the right side so what we generally

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.310

those<00:02:30.840> those<00:02:31.560> swirls<00:02:31.830> out<00:02:32.780> okay<00:02:33.780> you've<00:02:34.440> got

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
those those swirls out okay you've got

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.840 
those those swirls out okay you've got
the<00:02:34.650> cloth<00:02:36.560> cloth<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.800> get<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.670> off<00:02:42.050> yep<00:02:43.080> what

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
the cloth cloth to get that off yep what

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
the cloth cloth to get that off yep what
little<00:02:44.850> divert<00:02:45.030> water<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.570> it's

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
little divert water to this it's

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.180 
little divert water to this it's
water-soluble<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.710> show<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:47.010> these

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
water-soluble this show all these

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.570 
water-soluble this show all these
spatter<00:02:47.970> marks<00:02:48.300> here<00:02:48.510> whereas<00:02:48.840> with<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.580> normal

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
spatter marks here whereas with a normal

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.010 
spatter marks here whereas with a normal
cutting<00:02:50.760> compound<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.360> would<00:02:51.480> be<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.780> bit<00:02:51.990> of

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
cutting compound that would be a bit of

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.780 
cutting compound that would be a bit of
a<00:02:52.110> nightmare<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.590> remove<00:02:52.830> those<00:02:53.040> with<00:02:53.310> p1

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
a nightmare to remove those with p1

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.820 
a nightmare to remove those with p1
water-based<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.050> can<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.740> just

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
water-based so you can just you can just

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.150 
water-based so you can just you can just
wipe<00:02:56.070> those<00:02:56.250> off<00:02:56.400> with<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.640> water<00:02:56.820> spray<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:58.160> as

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
wipe those off with a water spray and as

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.810 
wipe those off with a water spray and as
much

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
much

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.910 
much
yeah<00:03:00.360> as<00:03:00.510> we<00:03:00.660> pointed<00:03:00.959> out<00:03:01.080> before<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.530> this

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
yeah as we pointed out before this this

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.220 
yeah as we pointed out before this this
is<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.070> water-based<00:03:03.200> polish<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:06.020> if<00:03:07.020> you've

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
is a water-based polish so if you've

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.440 
is a water-based polish so if you've
done<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.470> with<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.800> normal<00:03:08.450> mainstream

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
done that with a normal mainstream

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.410 
done that with a normal mainstream
cutting<00:03:10.140> compound<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:11.489> may<00:03:11.670> achieve<00:03:12.090> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
cutting compound you may achieve the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.780 
cutting compound you may achieve the
same<00:03:12.600> result<00:03:13.070> what<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.100> wouldn't<00:03:14.370> even<00:03:14.430> say<00:03:14.550> as

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
same result what I wouldn't even say as

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.090 
same result what I wouldn't even say as
quick<00:03:15.060> but<00:03:15.300> what<00:03:16.200> what<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.650> will<00:03:16.770> have<00:03:16.860> got

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
quick but what what you will have got

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.130 
quick but what what you will have got
there<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:17.550> a<00:03:17.610> normal<00:03:18.209> cutting<00:03:18.570> compound<00:03:18.750> is

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
there on a normal cutting compound is

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.940 
there on a normal cutting compound is
that<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.500> you've<00:03:19.680> got<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.830> lot<00:03:19.920> of

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
that you like you've got a lot of

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.699 
that you like you've got a lot of
masking<00:03:20.760> oils<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.180> there<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:22.020> that<00:03:22.050> would<00:03:22.500> drop

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
masking oils in there so that would drop

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.630 
masking oils in there so that would drop
out<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.280> let's<00:03:24.090> remove<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.570> movie<00:03:24.989> tape<00:03:28.640> you

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
out so let's remove the movie tape you

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.690 
out so let's remove the movie tape you
can't<00:03:29.880> touch<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.150> big<00:03:30.660> halogen<00:03:31.350> in<00:03:31.470> there<00:03:31.700> so

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
can't touch that big halogen in there so

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.400 
can't touch that big halogen in there so
you<00:03:32.760> can<00:03:32.940> see<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.420> know<00:03:33.540> that's<00:03:33.660> taken<00:03:34.110> it's

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
you can see you know that's taken it's

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.050 
you can see you know that's taken it's
taken<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.709> minute<00:03:35.570> okay<00:03:37.070> you<00:03:38.070> can<00:03:38.250> see<00:03:38.489> that's

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
taken a minute okay you can see that's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.140 
taken a minute okay you can see that's
really<00:03:40.340> okay<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.549> there's<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:41.970> bit<00:03:42.120> of

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
really okay this there's a bit of

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.310 
really okay this there's a bit of
marring<00:03:42.570> in<00:03:42.690> there<00:03:42.840> which<00:03:42.989> we're<00:03:43.110> going<00:03:43.260> to

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
marring in there which we're going to

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.680 
marring in there which we're going to
remove<00:03:43.560> now<00:03:43.799> with<00:03:44.010> we've<00:03:44.700> got<00:03:44.820> basic<00:03:45.209> two<00:03:45.390> foam

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
remove now with we've got basic two foam

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.289 
remove now with we've got basic two foam
pads<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:47.310> will<00:03:47.430> remove<00:03:47.670> all<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.940> marring

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
pads that will remove all the marring

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.030 
pads that will remove all the marring
but<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.900> know<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.110> terms<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.470> speed<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:52.650> really

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
but you know in terms of speed it really

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.670 
but you know in terms of speed it really
does<00:03:53.760> make<00:03:54.090> correction<00:03:54.900> times<00:03:55.170> come<00:03:55.470> down

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
does make correction times come down

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.920 
does make correction times come down
dramatically<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:56.760> it's<00:03:57.450> correct<00:03:57.630> this<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.900> a

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
dramatically so it's correct this is a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.460 
dramatically so it's correct this is a
big<00:03:58.140> old<00:03:58.290> car<00:03:59.239> this<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.420> like<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.930> best<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.320> its

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
big old car this is like the best of its

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.190 
big old car this is like the best of its
type<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:01.860> is<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.209> fryer<00:04:03.209> for<00:04:03.480> 12<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.959> believe

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
type this is a fryer for 12 I believe

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.250 
type this is a fryer for 12 I believe
it's<00:04:04.350> one<00:04:04.500> those<00:04:04.799> concourses

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
it's one those concourses

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.720 
it's one those concourses
and<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.320> will<00:04:07.500> be<00:04:07.860> correcting<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.280> whole<00:04:08.489> car

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
and I will be correcting this whole car

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.440 
and I will be correcting this whole car
and<00:04:08.970> what<00:04:09.299> I'm<00:04:09.600> he<00:04:09.750> asked<00:04:09.900> me<00:04:11.030> how<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.060> was<00:04:12.330> doing
