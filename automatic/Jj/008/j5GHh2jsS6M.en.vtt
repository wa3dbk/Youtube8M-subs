00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello all welcome to an oriental 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.170
 cook today we are going to use a sweet liqueur 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.309
 of milk if it's something very easy we're going to 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.270
 start let's place 600 grams of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.320
 sugar 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.320
 to a pan 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.530
 until we are going to cover it with water 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.210
 and we're going to take it to the goal 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.320
 Leave it for approximately 5 minutes 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.830
 maximum until the sugar goes well and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.830
 withdraws 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.820
 good when we have it ready 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.300
 we removed and what we are going to do is 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.079
 add selo here we have 250 grams of 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.079
 dulce de leche 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.780
 I want so we are mixing 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.430
 they make sure that they are not left 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.820
 a lot of milk and now we leave this 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.820
 cool 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.020
 miniatures that got cold and this is very 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.390
 important to treat it has to be cold 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.659
 but well never alcohol is a 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.750
 hot preparation on this in this 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.160
 especially liquor will not be cloudy 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.590
 liquor, so to speak, type 4 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.660
 well the liquor that are transparent well 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.100
 they add it 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.020
 the preparation this warm tone what 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.970
 that they are going to achieve is indeed murky in 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.100
 the crystalline preparation 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.520
 good 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:32.330
 now we add 250 centimeters 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.330
 cubic of alcohol came 95 degrees 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.510
 it was enough to acquire them with assumptions 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.440
 now we filter them 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.820
 i 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.450
 and I in this case I'm going to spend a 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.120
 container a bottle 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.569
 that we use here in a letter to place the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.569
 homemade liquors 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.830
 and very well this before consuming it 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.560
 let's rest at least a week 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.490
 because if you are not going to feel the taste 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.720
 very strong alcohol and then to 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.250
 us because it lasts all the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.590
 winter lasts 34 months 5 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.540
 months if I really do not think it lasts them 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.160
 so much 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.190
 good 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.240
 I hope you enjoy it further 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.240
 easy is very rich
