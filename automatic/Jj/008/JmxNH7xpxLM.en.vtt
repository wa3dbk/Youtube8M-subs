place their ear in and pinch down and it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:03.730 
place their ear in and pinch down and it
would<00:01:53.760> make<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.210> cutout

three-day profit mark it's really simple

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.059 
three-day profit mark it's really simple
most<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.319> them<00:02:19.440> pick<00:02:19.680> them<00:02:19.830> up<00:02:19.950> like<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.459> and

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
most of them pick them up like so and

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.160 
most of them pick them up like so and
push<00:02:23.069> their<00:02:23.310> bottom<00:02:23.640> out<00:02:23.790> like<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.810> then

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
push their bottom out like that and then

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.680 
push their bottom out like that and then
you<00:02:25.380> as<00:02:25.530> make<00:02:25.739> small<00:02:26.519> incisions<00:02:27.209> with<00:02:27.510> this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
you as make small incisions with this

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.259 
you as make small incisions with this
scaffold<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.500> they're<00:02:28.709> really<00:02:28.970> it's<00:02:29.970> really

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
scaffold and they're really it's really

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.210 
scaffold and they're really it's really
fairly<00:02:30.540> simple<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.680> make<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.069> little

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
fairly simple and you make the little

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.250 
fairly simple and you make the little
incisions<00:02:32.849> back<00:02:33.060> here<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.720> pull<00:02:34.170> the

incisions back here and pull the
testicles<00:02:34.890> out<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.400> then<00:02:35.519> spray<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:35.910> with

is also done during the process and it's

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.970 
is also done during the process and it's
to<00:02:47.280> prevent<00:02:47.519> tail<00:02:47.880> biting<00:02:48.060> later<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.720> life

fit and then you spray to ended it with

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.270 
fit and then you spray to ended it with
iodine<00:02:58.799> it's<00:02:59.670> quick<00:02:59.909> and<00:02:59.939> easy<00:03:00.709> all<00:03:01.709> piglets

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
iodine it's quick and easy all piglets

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.369 
iodine it's quick and easy all piglets
are<00:03:02.489> supplemented<00:03:03.180> with<00:03:03.209> 100<00:03:03.720> milligrams<00:03:04.200> of

are supplemented with 100 milligrams of
iron<00:03:04.590> during<00:03:05.519> their<00:03:05.760> processing<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.720> also

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
iron during their processing and also

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.630 
iron during their processing and also
can<00:03:07.799> be<00:03:07.890> administrated<00:03:08.640> other<00:03:08.849> vaccines<00:03:10.640> and
