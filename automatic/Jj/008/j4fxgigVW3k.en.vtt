00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
actual Nvidia package this is done to

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.210 
actual Nvidia package this is done to
their<00:02:05.490> spec<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.030> know<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> fact<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.950> on

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
their spec I know for a fact that on on

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.279 
their spec I know for a fact that on on
a<00:02:08.280> properly<00:02:09.090> calibrated<00:02:09.330> monitor<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.140> should

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
a properly calibrated monitor it should

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.700 
a properly calibrated monitor it should
be<00:02:10.410> exactly<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.920> this

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
be exactly like this

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.200 
be exactly like this
I<00:02:11.770> mean<00:02:12.250> give<00:02:12.400> or<00:02:12.550> take<00:02:12.700> because<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:12.970> have<00:02:13.180> a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
I mean give or take because you have a

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.260 
I mean give or take because you have a
backlight<00:02:13.660> but<00:02:14.340> from<00:02:15.340> our<00:02:15.550> observation<00:02:16.180> I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
backlight but from our observation I

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.220 
backlight but from our observation I
really<00:02:16.510> don't<00:02:16.660> know<00:02:16.720> if<00:02:16.810> you'll<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:17.020> able<00:02:17.080> to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
really don't know if you'll be able to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.110 
really don't know if you'll be able to
see<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.410> in<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> camera<00:02:17.800> it's<00:02:18.130> much<00:02:18.370> closer<00:02:18.730> on

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
see it in the camera it's much closer on

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.480 
see it in the camera it's much closer on
the<00:02:19.630> BlackBerry<00:02:20.080> device<00:02:20.380> versus<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.980> iPad<00:02:21.310> 2

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
the BlackBerry device versus the iPad 2

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.490 
the BlackBerry device versus the iPad 2
so<00:02:21.670> I'm<00:02:21.730> really<00:02:22.030> impressed<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:23.020> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
so I'm really impressed that and the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.380 
so I'm really impressed that and the
additional<00:02:23.920> pixel<00:02:24.280> density<00:02:24.700> gives<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.090> kind

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
additional pixel density gives you kind

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.750 
additional pixel density gives you kind
of<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.600> similar<00:02:25.960> effect<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.830> what<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.190> phone<00:02:27.430> four

and<00:04:31.310> then<00:04:31.460> Android<00:04:31.970> has<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.690> little<00:04:33.080> bit<00:04:33.169> of

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
and then Android has a little bit of

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.110 
and then Android has a little bit of
chop<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.889> I<00:04:34.070> don't<00:04:34.490> think<00:04:34.580> that's<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:35.000> do

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
chop to it I don't think that's to do

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.430 
chop to it I don't think that's to do
with<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.270> processor<00:04:35.840> so<00:04:35.990> hopefully<00:04:36.320> it's

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
with the processor so hopefully it's

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.740 
with the processor so hopefully it's
something<00:04:36.710> they<00:04:36.800> can<00:04:37.010> address<00:04:37.540> update<00:04:38.540> wise

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
something they can address update wise

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.840 
something they can address update wise
but<00:04:39.139> I<00:04:39.440> think<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.800> guys<00:04:39.919> will<00:04:40.220> open<00:04:40.610> something

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850
