think<00:02:12.829> about<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.189> so<00:02:13.730> Microsoft<00:02:14.349> instead<00:02:15.349> of

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
I think you should chase customers and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.440 
I think you should chase customers and
creating<00:02:18.590> customer<00:02:19.010> value<00:02:19.310> which<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.270> so

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
creating customer value which is so

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.470 
creating customer value which is so

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
out your Kinect and lower the price by a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.590
