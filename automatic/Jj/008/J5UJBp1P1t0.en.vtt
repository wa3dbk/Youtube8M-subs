00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.389
 and I think the Mascherano case is a case 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.039
 a case that will change a bit the paradigm within the 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.059
 of the way of advertising 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.949
 per cent especially for the automotive industry I think that 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.749
 that in a way 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.789
 blotz manages to show what we are looking for as an agency and the 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.329
 client is looking for how as a company 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.089
 why they cross 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.460
 the two visions and in a way it seems to me that a lot of success is 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.729
 given because that I see a communication style a way of communicating a 

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:37.460
 engine 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.700
 from where a broad in a completely different way to how it came 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.190
 thinking percent traditionally is not 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.480
 where you started with a television commercial and then it was about 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.210
 implement is in graphics 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.040
 on public roads but on the contrary it was first thought a 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.289
 idea giving a communication solution 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.160
 and then he understood 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.010
 or it was about that they try to find what the means 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.110
 in more efficient 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.780
 what was best for the campaign in this case 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.280
 this is not that it's a digital campaign it's not that it's a campaign this 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.859
 I would believe public is not everything at the same time it seems good 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:18.570
 the first was his colleague from 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.820
 of Mascherano that has an engine inside and as I told them, because it was 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.740
 to implement in the best possible way 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.539
 On the other hand I also think that 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.130
 changes the discourse changes in the way that investment because no 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.399
 he was not used alone 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.600
 10% as civilized 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.260
 usually that of what is invested in means in production but that is 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.340
 they use 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.090
 almost 50% that allowed us to produce with a level of excellence 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.550
 very high and has also allowed to hire a company born as 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.660
 Mascherano I think it is understood by the client also by the way 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.830
 so I believe and the case whatever it is 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.820
 in this different way to communicate h 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.980
 the consumer cdc involve them in a dialogue be 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.320
 in or in omnipotent advertising that was a speech through the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.820
 television univisiÃ³n to the fate here what is proposed is the impression of 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.840
 consumer certainly that the fact does commenting the campaign more towards 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.310
 on the internet little with friends but no doubt that it feeds a little bit of what 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.479
 that people think and 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:31.759
 many of the actions that were entering the internet also had 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:32.989
 what to see a little with 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.429
 with what people thought in fact one of the comments at the beginning was 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:40.759
 percent for hair league because it's not so simple that it always deals with 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:45.730
 these things and once a week the chiche program then died percent 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.049
 I think it's a pity 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.959
 a communication style a type of communication that treats the consumer 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.259
 with intelligence that makes the people themselves get longer 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:59.469
 what ends up being these a fiat ccoo campaign is for an engine 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.169
 multijet is not 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.169
 the company is imposed and it seems to me that 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.040
 success also comes out there
