00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
and I thought we'd take a look here one

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.330 
and I thought we'd take a look here one
of<00:00:40.699> them<00:00:40.790> is<00:00:40.970> a<00:00:41.000> 283<00:00:41.720> that<00:00:42.110> he's<00:00:42.290> had<00:00:42.500> for<00:00:42.530> about

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
of them is a 283 that he's had for about

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.040 
of them is a 283 that he's had for about
20<00:00:43.670> years<00:00:43.730> he<00:00:44.890> starts<00:00:45.890> it<00:00:46.010> up<00:00:46.129> periodically

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
20 years he starts it up periodically

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.160 
20 years he starts it up periodically
it's<00:00:48.050> on<00:00:48.650> an<00:00:48.770> engine<00:00:49.129> stand<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.840> other<00:00:50.960> one

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
it's on an engine stand so the other one

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.900 
it's on an engine stand so the other one
