00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
pretty much most of our engineering

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.700 
pretty much most of our engineering
talent<00:00:45.660> has<00:00:46.170> all<00:00:46.320> been<00:00:46.469> concentrating<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:48.210> the

that<00:00:53.309> aircraft<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:54.090> had<00:00:54.780> hoped<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.199> would

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
that aircraft I had hoped that we would

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
that aircraft I had hoped that we would
have<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> done<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.190> now<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.789> haven't<00:00:57.180> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
have that done by now but we haven't and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.510 
have that done by now but we haven't and
it's<00:00:58.109> still<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> take<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> better<00:00:59.250> part

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it's still going to take a better part

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.779 
it's still going to take a better part
of<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.699> year<00:00:59.730> before<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:01.129> on<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> other<00:01:02.430> hand

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
our ship won a prototype which gosh I

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.330 
our ship won a prototype which gosh I
threw<00:01:12.299> myself<00:01:12.500> it's<00:01:13.500> been<00:01:13.560> over<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> year<00:01:14.250> ago

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.880 
and it's got about a hundred hours on
now<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.210> slowed<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:19.080> well<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
be at least as fast as they are for you

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.850 
be at least as fast as they are for you
for<00:03:09.650> hopefully<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.700> little<00:03:10.850> bit<00:03:11.060> faster

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
for hopefully a little bit faster

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.880

although<00:03:12.860> it<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.340> r44<00:03:13.820> pretty<00:03:14.150> fast<00:03:14.890> that

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
although it the r44 pretty fast that

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.890 
although it the r44 pretty fast that
wouldn't<00:03:16.190> be<00:03:16.280> too<00:03:16.430> bad<00:03:16.610> either<00:03:16.820> ready<00:03:17.810> to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
wouldn't be too bad either ready to

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.449 
wouldn't be too bad either ready to
climb<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:18.320> course<00:03:18.500> they<00:03:18.620> will<00:03:18.739> be<00:03:18.890> very<00:03:19.220> very

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
climb of course they will be very very

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.670 
climb of course they will be very very
good<00:03:19.700> because<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.209> has<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.480> surplus<00:03:21.049> power<00:03:21.350> and

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
good because it has a surplus power and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.729 
good because it has a surplus power and
the<00:03:21.830> turbine<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:23.750> service<00:03:24.230> ceiling<00:03:24.410> will

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
the turbine and the service ceiling will

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.070 
the turbine and the service ceiling will
still<00:03:24.950> be<00:03:25.070> 14,000<00:03:26.030> feet<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.980> art<00:03:28.190> 66<00:03:29.080> is

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
still be 14,000 feet the art 66 is

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.520 
still be 14,000 feet the art 66 is
actually<00:03:30.590> eight<00:03:30.769> inches<00:03:31.190> wider<00:03:31.580> than<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.930> 44

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
actually eight inches wider than the 44

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.780 
actually eight inches wider than the 44
and<00:03:33.950> it's<00:03:34.700> eight<00:03:35.450> inches<00:03:35.930> tall<00:03:36.459> that's<00:03:37.459> at<00:03:37.670> the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
and it's eight inches tall that's at the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.170 
and it's eight inches tall that's at the
rotor<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:39.350> if<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.250> look<00:03:40.519> at<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.820> two<00:03:40.970> aircraft

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
rotor so if you look at the two aircraft

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.840 
rotor so if you look at the two aircraft
and<00:03:41.600> on<00:03:41.720> Tuesday<00:03:42.340> we're<00:03:43.340> having<00:03:43.640> that<00:03:43.820> open

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
and on Tuesday we're having that open

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.190 
and on Tuesday we're having that open

that we give at the open house there

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.970 
that we give at the open house there

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
head-on and it it looks fatter so looks

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.180

customer base for a helicopter like this

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.490 
customer base for a helicopter like this
it's<00:05:58.440> going<00:05:58.620> to<00:05:58.680> be<00:05:58.770> all<00:05:58.889> of<00:05:59.070> those<00:05:59.220> yes<00:06:00.500> it'll

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
it's going to be all of those yes it'll

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.280 
it's going to be all of those yes it'll
be<00:06:01.650> as<00:06:02.060> versatile<00:06:03.060> or<00:06:03.270> perhaps<00:06:03.720> even<00:06:04.020> more

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
be as versatile or perhaps even more

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.900 
be as versatile or perhaps even more
versatile<00:06:04.770> than<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.190> jet<00:06:05.400> Ranger<00:06:05.729> and<00:06:05.880> the

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
Jet Ranger made by Bell helicopter has

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.550 
Jet Ranger made by Bell helicopter has
been<00:06:08.729> around<00:06:09.150> for<00:06:09.389> quite<00:06:09.660> a<00:06:09.930> number<00:06:10.139> of<00:06:10.320> years

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
been around for quite a number of years

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.790 
been around for quite a number of years
now<00:06:10.650> and<00:06:10.830> has<00:06:11.340> done<00:06:11.639> a<00:06:11.669> very<00:06:11.940> very<00:06:12.150> good<00:06:12.389> job

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
now and has done a very very good job

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.740 
now and has done a very very good job
but<00:06:13.800> they<00:06:14.010> are<00:06:14.250> of<00:06:14.550> course<00:06:14.820> getting<00:06:15.150> quite<00:06:15.450> a

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
but they are of course getting quite a

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.510 
but they are of course getting quite a
lot<00:06:16.650> older<00:06:17.070> now<00:06:17.250> and<00:06:18.860> this<00:06:19.860> one<00:06:20.070> I<00:06:20.160> think<00:06:20.190> will

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
lot older now and this one I think will

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.210 
lot older now and this one I think will
compete<00:06:20.790> very<00:06:21.120> very<00:06:21.330> well<00:06:21.570> with<00:06:21.919> the<00:06:22.919> older

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
compete very very well with the older

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.610 
compete very very well with the older
generators<00:06:23.970> and<00:06:24.270> also<00:06:24.750> it<00:06:25.260> would<00:06:25.410> actually

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
generators and also it would actually

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.650 
generators and also it would actually
could<00:06:25.950> be<00:06:25.979> very<00:06:26.310> well<00:06:26.490> with<00:06:26.760> a<00:06:26.790> new<00:06:27.240> it<00:06:27.389> if<00:06:27.540> they

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
could be very well with a new it if they

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.680 
could be very well with a new it if they
