ornaments turn up the round ones and I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.670 
ornaments turn up the round ones and I
thought<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.809> image<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
thought that this little image of the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.549 
thought that this little image of the
mistletoe<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.690> boy<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.110> girl<00:00:55.140> would

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
mistletoe and the boy and the girl would

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.910 
mistletoe and the boy and the girl would
be<00:00:55.649> perfect<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.340> an<00:00:56.460> ornament<00:00:57.050> I<00:00:58.050> also<00:00:58.620> used

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
be perfect in an ornament I also used

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.060 
be perfect in an ornament I also used
diamond<00:00:59.340> dust<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.829> really

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
diamond dust and you have to be really

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.770 
diamond dust and you have to be really
careful<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> use<00:01:02.820> diamond<00:01:03.180> dust<00:01:03.359> because

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
careful if you use diamond dust because

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.100 
careful if you use diamond dust because
it<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.049> real<00:01:04.650> glass<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> all<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> did<00:01:06.810> was<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it is real glass so all I did was I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.350 
it is real glass so all I did was I
poured<00:01:07.439> hot<00:01:07.650> glue<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.220> around<00:01:08.400> inside<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
poured hot glue all around inside the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.570 
poured hot glue all around inside the
ball<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.400> let

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
ball I don't know if you can see it let

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.910 
ball I don't know if you can see it let
me<00:01:11.700> change<00:01:12.000> my<00:01:12.270> light<00:01:12.540> angle<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.680> if<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
me change my light angle and see if it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.249 
me change my light angle and see if it
will<00:01:14.070> show<00:01:19.850> put<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.119> down<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> little<00:01:21.630> bit<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
will show put it down a little bit and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.140 
will show put it down a little bit and
hopefully<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.009> see<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
hopefully you can see I have it on the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.780 
hopefully you can see I have it on the
inside<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.900> outside<00:01:26.600> let's<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.790> don't

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
inside and the outside let's see I don't

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.060 
inside and the outside let's see I don't
know<00:01:29.850> how<00:01:30.000> well<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.509> gonna<00:01:30.689> show<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.229> um

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
know how well this is gonna show up um

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.640 
know how well this is gonna show up um
so<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.579> drizzled<00:01:33.270> hot<00:01:33.479> glue<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:34.200> around

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
so I just drizzled hot glue all around

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.420 
so I just drizzled hot glue all around
in<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:36.110> did<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.409> know<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> couple<00:01:38.189> of

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
in there and did you know a couple of

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.010 
in there and did you know a couple of
sections<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> time<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:41.689> would<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.840> keep

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
sections at a time and I would just keep

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.420 
sections at a time and I would just keep
putting<00:01:43.259> glue<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.740> glue<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.009> glue<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.310> then

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
putting glue and glue and glue and then

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.010 
putting glue and glue and glue and then
when<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> wanted<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> put<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> diamond<00:01:45.509> dust<00:01:45.810> in

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
when I wanted to put the diamond dust in

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.690 
when I wanted to put the diamond dust in
I<00:01:46.200> would<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.649> warm<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> off<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.369> my<00:01:47.520> heat

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
I would just warm it off with my heat

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.450 
I would just warm it off with my heat
gun<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.740> stuck<00:01:49.979> really<00:01:50.159> good

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
gun and then it just stuck really good

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.240 
gun and then it just stuck really good
and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> did<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:52.079> diamond<00:01:52.710> dust<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and then I did the diamond dust on the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.080 
and then I did the diamond dust on the
outside<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:58.340> same<00:01:59.340> thing<00:01:59.610> hot<00:01:59.880> glue

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
outside you can see same thing hot glue

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.630 
outside you can see same thing hot glue
and<00:02:00.240> then<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.360> took<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.630> brush<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.950> around<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and then I took a brush all around the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.270 
and then I took a brush all around the
outside<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.509> really<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.409> little<00:02:04.950> paintbrush

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
outside and really a little paintbrush
