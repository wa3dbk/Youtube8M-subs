so I'm at the 50-yard line there's the
camera<00:01:50.700> there<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> distance<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.680> I'm

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
camera there in the distance and I'm

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.880 
camera there in the distance and I'm
starting<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.000> run<00:01:54.180> into<00:01:54.510> a<00:01:54.540> little<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.860> of

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
starting to run into a little bit of

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.870 
starting to run into a little bit of
issue<00:01:56.190> with<00:01:57.590> maintaining<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.880> clear

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
issue with maintaining a clear

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.420 
issue with maintaining a clear
connection<00:02:00.530> with<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> camera<00:02:02.010> it<00:02:02.130> seems

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
connection with the camera it seems

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.520 
connection with the camera it seems
sometimes<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:03.060> will<00:02:03.210> slow<00:02:03.630> down<00:02:03.660> and<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.229> do<00:02:04.290> an

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
sometimes it will slow down and I do an

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.520 
sometimes it will slow down and I do an
image<00:02:04.770> capture<00:02:05.930> for<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.080> social<00:02:07.410> see

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
image capture for in the social see

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.160 
image capture for in the social see
physical<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.220> repeat<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:08.820> but<00:02:09.170> here

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
physical I can repeat it here but here

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.990 
physical I can repeat it here but here
it<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.649> screen<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:12.989> kind<00:02:13.140> of

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
it is on the screen so it's kind of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.910 
it is on the screen so it's kind of
getting<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.120> lot<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.270> glare<00:02:15.540> here<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.620> there

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
getting a lot of glare here so there

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.500 
getting a lot of glare here so there
there<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.340> are<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.670> live<00:02:17.880> shot<00:02:20.420> going<00:02:21.420> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
there we are on the live shot going to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.750 
there we are on the live shot going to
see<00:02:21.630> its<00:02:21.750> processing<00:02:22.380> up<00:02:22.860> there<00:02:23.310> was<00:02:23.700> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
see its processing up there was a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.090 
see its processing up there was a
connection<00:02:24.030> error<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:28.019> my<00:02:28.260> nuts<00:02:28.890> of

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
connection error so in my nuts of

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.600 
connection error so in my nuts of
scientific<00:02:29.670> tests<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.630> was<00:02:31.080> able<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.410> get

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
scientific tests I was able to get

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.190 
scientific tests I was able to get
roughly<00:02:32.610> about<00:02:32.760> 50<00:02:33.180> yards<00:02:33.330> or<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.810> start

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
roughly about 50 yards or so I start

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.140 
roughly about 50 yards or so I start
having<00:02:34.320> some<00:02:34.620> issues<00:02:34.980> with<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.280> dropping

having some issues with the dropping

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.330 
having some issues with the dropping
connection<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:37.260> sometimes<00:02:38.070> there<00:02:38.220> would<00:02:38.280> be

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
connection and sometimes there would be

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.699 
connection and sometimes there would be
an<00:02:38.489> error<00:02:38.760> downloading<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.989> file<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.470> two

mega megabyte file onto the tablet and a
little<00:02:45.390> closer<00:02:45.690> distances<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:47.250> know

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
little closer distances like you know

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.640 
little closer distances like you know
anything<00:02:47.550> before<00:02:48.180> 50<00:02:48.570> yards<00:02:48.900> or<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.200> didn't

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
anything before 50 yards or so I didn't

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.940 
anything before 50 yards or so I didn't
really<00:02:49.769> have<00:02:49.890> any<00:02:50.130> problems<00:02:51.079> so<00:02:52.079> it's

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
really have any problems so it's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.229 
really have any problems so it's
actually<00:02:53.280> quite<00:02:53.400> good<00:02:53.489> if<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.090> get

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
actually quite good if you can get

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.380 
actually quite good if you can get
nearly<00:02:54.630> 50<00:02:55.110> yards<00:02:55.440> or<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:56.670> distance<00:02:57.150> with

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
nearly 50 yards or so of distance with

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.100 
nearly 50 yards or so of distance with
that<00:02:58.100> plus<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.820> know<00:02:59.940> being<00:03:00.420> able<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.870> see

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
that plus you know being able to see

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.350 
that plus you know being able to see
what's<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:01.769> frame<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.130> think<00:03:02.549> that's<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.820> pretty

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
what's in frame I think that's a pretty

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.860 
what's in frame I think that's a pretty
cool<00:03:03.630> feature<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.380> camera<00:03:05.360> but<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.420> plan

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
cool feature for this camera but I plan

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.720 
cool feature for this camera but I plan
on<00:03:06.989> trying<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.560> different<00:03:07.769> situations<00:03:08.040> and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
on trying it in different situations and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.460 
on trying it in different situations and
see<00:03:08.850> how<00:03:08.970> well<00:03:09.150> performs<00:03:09.690> but<00:03:10.170> there's<00:03:10.320> one

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
see how well performs but there's one

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.170 
see how well performs but there's one
thing<00:03:10.530> yeah<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:10.920> think<00:03:11.370> there<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.880> quite<00:03:12.150> a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
thing yeah I think there is a quite a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.240 
thing yeah I think there is a quite a
little<00:03:12.600> bit<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.840> shutter<00:03:13.140> lag<00:03:13.410> obviously

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
little bit of a shutter lag obviously

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.039 
little bit of a shutter lag obviously
since<00:03:14.400> there's<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.730> Wi-Fi<00:03:15.090> connection<00:03:15.360> and

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
since there's a Wi-Fi connection and

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.710 
since there's a Wi-Fi connection and
then<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.739> delay<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.430> see<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.940> live<00:03:18.120> preview

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
then the delay to see the live preview

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.440 
then the delay to see the live preview
if<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.709> want<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.040> minimize<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.940> time<00:03:24.239> it

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
if you want to minimize the the time it

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.690 
if you want to minimize the the time it
takes<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.900> review<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.709> get<00:03:25.829> back<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.160> live

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
takes to review and get back the live

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.360 
takes to review and get back the live
preview<00:03:27.299> I<00:03:27.360> probably<00:03:27.690> suggest<00:03:28.170> turning<00:03:28.920> off

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
preview I probably suggest turning off

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.199 
preview I probably suggest turning off
the<00:03:30.650> save<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.950> tablet<00:03:32.489> mode<00:03:32.760> unless<00:03:32.970> you

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
the save to tablet mode unless you

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.880 
the save to tablet mode unless you
really<00:03:33.450> need<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.930> there's<00:03:34.230> for<00:03:34.650> me<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.769> really

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
really need to there's for me I really

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.580 
really need to there's for me I really
don't<00:03:35.340> need<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.670> save<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:36.410> images<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.560> a

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
don't need to save this images to a

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.250 
don't need to save this images to a
tablet<00:03:38.070> it's<00:03:39.030> okay<00:03:39.329> with<00:03:39.570> just<00:03:39.690> leaving<00:03:40.110> them

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
tablet it's okay with just leaving them

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.890 
tablet it's okay with just leaving them
on<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.470> camera<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:42.090> that's<00:03:42.480> sort<00:03:42.870> of

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
on the camera and that that's sort of

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.080 
on the camera and that that's sort of
time<00:03:43.140> if<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.769> turn<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.340> off<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.820> really

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
time if you turn that off that really

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.349 
time if you turn that off that really
cuts<00:03:45.299> down<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.600> time<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.530> takes<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.950> go<00:03:47.190> from

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
cuts down the time it takes to go from

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.640 
cuts down the time it takes to go from
snapping<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.450> shutter<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.989> then<00:03:49.109> going<00:03:49.380> back

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
snapping the shutter and then going back

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.729 
snapping the shutter and then going back
to<00:03:49.950> review<00:03:50.280> mode<00:03:50.810> there's<00:03:51.810> also<00:03:52.019> one<00:03:52.440> other

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
to review mode there's also one other

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.729 
to review mode there's also one other
mode<00:03:53.190> where<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.400> can<00:03:53.489> just<00:03:53.820> have<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.470> fire<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
mode where you can just have it fire the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.840 
mode where you can just have it fire the
shutter<00:03:56.060> but<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.209> don't<00:03:57.390> get<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.629> preview

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
shutter but you don't get a preview

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.780 
shutter but you don't get a preview
what<00:03:59.270> you<00:03:59.390> just<00:03:59.570> shot<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.350> I<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:01.400> could<00:04:01.640> be

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
what you just shot so I that could be

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.300 
what you just shot so I that could be
something<00:04:01.970> if<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.450> just<00:04:02.690> if<00:04:02.930> you're<00:04:03.440> taking

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
something if you just if you're taking

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.950 
something if you just if you're taking
pictures<00:04:04.820> of<00:04:04.850> something<00:04:05.240> let's<00:04:05.390> say<00:04:05.510> has<00:04:05.720> some

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
pictures of something let's say has some

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.440 
pictures of something let's say has some
sort<00:04:06.170> of<00:04:06.200> critical<00:04:07.130> timing<00:04:07.880> issue<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.360> you

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
sort of critical timing issue and you

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.730 
sort of critical timing issue and you
want<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.690> see<00:04:08.870> right<00:04:09.140> away<00:04:09.260> what<00:04:09.590> you're

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
want to see right away what you're

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.890 
want to see right away what you're
shooting<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:11.210> don't<00:04:11.360> really<00:04:11.510> need<00:04:11.780> to

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
shooting and you don't really need to

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.050 
shooting and you don't really need to
review<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:12.650> probably<00:04:13.430> select<00:04:13.880> that<00:04:14.030> option

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
review it I probably select that option

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.380 
review it I probably select that option
too<00:04:14.690> long<00:04:15.620> as<00:04:15.740> you're<00:04:15.890> within<00:04:16.130> distance<00:04:16.520> the

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
too long as you're within distance the

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.910 
too long as you're within distance the
thing<00:04:17.570> is<00:04:17.600> you'll<00:04:17.989> know<00:04:18.230> if<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.530> things<00:04:18.770> not

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
thing is you'll know if the things not

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.770 
thing is you'll know if the things not
firing<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.820> shutter<00:04:20.090> off<00:04:20.360> at<00:04:20.540> a<00:04:20.570> distance

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
firing the shutter off at a distance

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.500 
firing the shutter off at a distance
because<00:04:21.490> you'll<00:04:22.490> get<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.670> clear<00:04:22.940> error<00:04:23.210> on<00:04:23.390> the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
because you'll get a clear error on the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.120 
because you'll get a clear error on the
screen<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.050> camera<00:04:24.380> or<00:04:24.530> camera<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.010> a

lost<00:04:28.130> connection<00:04:28.670> so<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.350> don't<00:04:30.350> think<00:04:30.500> you're

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
lost connection so I don't think you're

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.710 
lost connection so I don't think you're
going<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:30.770> miss<00:04:30.980> that<00:04:31.250> sort<00:04:31.670> of<00:04:31.790> feedback

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
going to miss that sort of feedback

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.760 
going to miss that sort of feedback
because<00:04:33.170> when<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.380> press<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.740> shutter

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
because when you press the shutter

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.320 
because when you press the shutter
you'll<00:04:34.310> Stefan<00:04:34.640> Utley<00:04:34.790> see<00:04:34.940> something<00:04:35.240> that

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
you'll Stefan Utley see something that

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.260 
you'll Stefan Utley see something that
says<00:04:35.510> it's<00:04:35.690> processing<00:04:36.430> before<00:04:37.430> it<00:04:37.760> goes<00:04:37.910> back

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
says it's processing before it goes back

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.670 
says it's processing before it goes back
to<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:39.020> live<00:04:39.320> preview<00:04:40.420> hopefully<00:04:41.500> I'm<00:04:42.500> going<00:04:42.620> to

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
to a live preview hopefully I'm going to

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.320 
to a live preview hopefully I'm going to
give<00:04:42.800> this<00:04:42.830> a<00:04:42.950> shot<00:04:43.040> in<00:04:43.340> other<00:04:43.460> situations<00:04:43.670> and

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
give this a shot in other situations and

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.110 
give this a shot in other situations and
I'm<00:04:44.480> losing<00:04:44.810> light<00:04:44.990> here<00:04:45.200> so<00:04:45.760> we'll<00:04:46.760> see<00:04:46.940> you

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
I'm losing light here so we'll see you

00:04:47.120 --> 00:05:20.500 
I'm losing light here so we'll see you
on<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.390> next<00:04:47.600> day's<00:04:48.560> review
