00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:12.380
 work modem 3g 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.799
 together with the tablet depends on 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.250
 adapter 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.250
 which is used when connecting 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:28.010
 so we see here three kinds 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:32.130
 adapters with cad wire 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:36.800
 black 5bites 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.800
 and white rexant 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:44.789
 feature of these front lesson 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.719
 is that here are 4 pins 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:54.770
 A small connector 5 pins 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:01:01.430
 and different manufacturers in different ways 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.430
 connect 4 or 5 contact so for example 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:11.490
 5bites adapter compatibility 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:14.509
 and cad here these two with a tablet and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.380
 communicators and smartphones 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:26.150
 the manufacturer is not guaranteed 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:29.820
 in all cases, if the host device 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.180
 protective using 5 contact train to 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.180
 connector 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:44.570
 then removable drives and including 3g 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.570
 modem will not be detected 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:54.149
 we see that now the modem has no 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.340
 blinking does not feel that there is not 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:08.569
 5 volts in the same way it is not defined 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:10.489
 as an external device for an example we will connect 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.269
 little white 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.269
 rexant adapter 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:49.700
 we see that the modem immediately started them 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:56.359
 Granin Red defines it tablet 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:03:00.109
 like an external device right now 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:04.540
 the blue-blue outs are already starting at the limit 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:07.540
 setting as a 3g modem look for a network connection 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.540
 here 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.180
 here 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:28.910
 on permanent display in the glow 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.910
 modem and here appeared 3g 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:42.290
 icon for example we can go to 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.290
 the opera
