else<00:02:53.400> but<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.700> always<00:02:53.850> do<00:02:54.060> them<00:02:54.180> before<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.600> I

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
else but I always do them before is I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.820 
else but I always do them before is I
find<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:55.020> be<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.200> best<00:02:55.320> even<00:02:55.620> though<00:02:55.710> it's

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
find it to be the best even though it's

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.980 
find it to be the best even though it's
a<00:02:55.860> bigger<00:02:56.040> file<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:57.360> takes<00:02:57.570> longer<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.900> upload

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
a bigger file it takes longer to upload

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.830 
a bigger file it takes longer to upload

60 59 so you do that

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.150 
60 59 so you do that
um<00:03:47.000> pic<00:03:48.000> slack<00:03:48.240> so<00:03:48.450> pixel<00:03:49.080> aspect<00:03:49.320> ratio<00:03:49.770> keep

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
um pic slack so pixel aspect ratio keep

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.920
