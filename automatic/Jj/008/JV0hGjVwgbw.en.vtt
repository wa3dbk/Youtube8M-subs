00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 yes hello and welcome white 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.540
 vector people in the last days 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.809
 roll over so the 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.130
 new ideas of new high end 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.519
 smartphones formally last week that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.710
 note 2 and today just now has nokia 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.380
 his new home flagship with windows 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.180
 phone 8 presented namely the nokia 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.480
 lumia 920 next to the tvs of samsung so 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.849
 the first smartphone with windows phone 8 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.669
 that finally has high end hardware 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.880
 we are talking about a 4 5 inch tall one 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.399
 hd display with a resolution of 1280 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.730
 x 768 pixels 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.980
 we have a dual core cpu but the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.550
 snapdragon s4 in my opinion the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.530
 best cpu together with the ex 144 12 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.480
 currently in the market although they only 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.120
 a dual-core cpu is we have 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.000
 Of course, the processor clocked 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.010
 By the way, with 1 5 gigahertz here 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.070
 besides, we have a gigabyte 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.409
 Memory 32 GB internal memory 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.500
 and that is finally like already at 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.810
 efes expandable with micro sd 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.549
 a clear step into the future 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.439
 from windows phone 8 and also from nokia 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.560
 We also have an 8 megapixel 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.140
 camera and more 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.869
 also the display technology has nokia 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.810
 So its got clear black technology 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.840
 nokia once again revised called 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.020
 now promotion age the place should 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.950
 react much faster than others 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.320
 lc-displays so we have no here 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.920
 amoled display but a lcd display 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.070
 and a real innovation is mine 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.470
 opinion this this new touch 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.030
 technology that allows it 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.740
 smartphone for example with gloves 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.810
 to use so that was with before 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.180
 capacitive touchscreens not 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.119
 problem-free but it is possible with the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.469
 lumia 920 finally my opinion 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.549
 after finally a useful one 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.280
 innovation 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.049
 In addition, the clear black 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.479
 technology is finally on the 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.250
 adjust lighting conditions well 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.720
 and therefore always a good one 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.370
 ensure readability of the display 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.320
 sounds good in theory now 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.510
 I'm curious how to do that in the 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.820
 practice has implemented another 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.790
 Highlight will be shown below 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.530
 the camera is the whole certified 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.560
 one again with this preview 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.050
 technology you already know from nokia 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.400
 but android preview knows that 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.740
 not that that still lumia 920 a 41 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.590
 megapixel camera has no it has an 8 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.990
 7 megapixel camera and nokia has today 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.720
 once again clarified that preview im 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.570
 not for this 41 megapixel camera 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.000
 but stands for the whole 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.459
 innovative camera software and all 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.380
 innovations nokia in the camera sector 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.050
 but one promises that this camera 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.020
 should take much better pictures 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.000
 such as a samsung galaxy s3 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.810
 I'm curious 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.500
 So synonymous with a lot of new cameras 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.030
 software 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.560
 I can not now you all this 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.690
 tell otherwise the video takes one 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.700
 half an hour but she has in theory 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.739
 quite well heard I'm curious 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.400
 if that works so well in practice as well 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.959
 looks 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.510
 here below you can see this again 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.330
 tweet the nokia confirms that 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.750
 sensor of the camera everything newly developed 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.450
 has been 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.190
 also on the led lightning one worked 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.410
 many have a xenon flash 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.989
 is hoped but is again an led 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.810
 but it is supposed to have a flash as well 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.790
 significantly improved and yes it will 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.860
 even in darker areas 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.980
 excellent results then 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.650
 guarantee 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.610
 also nokia maps have been revised with 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.100
 Arguments have been incorporated into reality 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.630
 I'm curious to call her now 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.150
 nokia city dance and yes sounds very much too 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.590
 interesting i already have nokia maps 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.110
 always found well 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.690
 but I can now me much about 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.850
 we have to wait and see how 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.519
 that will look like this in practice 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.910
 Another highlight is wireless charging 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.799
 One has already speculated about it 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.410
 So finally a device with wireless 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.299
 charging you have the battery cover there 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.220
 do not exchange such as with 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.020
 a palm pre is not possible 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.450
 because we have of course again 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.139
 Polycarbonate unibody design for 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.020
 design 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.439
 But I'll be right and yes nokia has 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.840
 With it a big cafe chain in the USA 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:33.879
 already concluded a contract 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.539
 that is then in all coffee houses 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:39.819
 give this chain such wireless corners 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.360
 where to charge your smartphone directly 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.340
 can 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.590
 sounds really cool I'm curious 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.080
 Of course we also have nfc on board 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.770
 also a 2000 milliamp hours 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.569
 strong battery does not sound like now 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.990
 little but not too special 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.810
 a lot of 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.939
 We remember that note 2 has 3100 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.099
 milliHours I'm curious if 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:02.349
 2000 milliamp hours for all these 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.800
 services and these hardware are enough 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.050
 become 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.270
 as I said of course with windows phone 8 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.090
 and another highlight is of course 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.729
 the design people look at this 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.279
 Ingenious design of the thing will be in the 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.629
 yellow as we already have here 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:22.180
 So see quite a name design of the lumia 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:24.969
 900 but oriented up with clearly 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.650
 finer edge finally got me there 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:28.449
 he's listening 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.259
 In addition, the device is still in the 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.879
 give red colors and here in silver in 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.819
 black and in white 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:39.250
 So you see the picture here , of course 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.680
 Again unibody made of polycarbonate looks 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.960
 but in my opinion quite absolutely 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.839
 awesome as a beautiful smartphone 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.870
 joshua topolsky the editor of 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:51.819
 the verge has already praised and has 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.099
 said that this is one of the most beautiful 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.379
 smartphones is the one in the hand had 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.509
 So you may already be listening to me 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.759
 really impressed by what he has there 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.740
 just showed both from the 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.939
 software age of the hardware that are 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.819
 in my opinion, really a few 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:08.349
 useful innovations here 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:11.199
 Now let's wait until the whole 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.879
 I'll test, of course 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.620
 and yes , just wanted to talk about it 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.659
 inform what nokia is there right now 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.659
 I have hopefully presented the video 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.009
 you like and now have the nokia 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.050
 livestream on 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:26.699
 thank you for watching i say how 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.699
 always until next time
