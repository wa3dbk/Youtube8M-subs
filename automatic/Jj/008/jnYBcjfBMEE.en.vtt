water<00:00:16.680> went<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> bottom<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.760> I've<00:00:17.910> now

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
water went to the bottom and so I've now

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.500 
water went to the bottom and so I've now
separated<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.050> fat<00:00:19.289> from<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> water<00:00:19.920> now<00:00:20.880> how

much this is well it should be just

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.370 
much this is well it should be just
right<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:32.290> that<00:04:33.300> hey<00:04:34.300> two<00:04:34.360> cups<00:04:34.810> of<00:04:34.960> water<00:04:35.170> in

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
right so that hey two cups of water in

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.760 
right so that hey two cups of water in
here<00:04:35.530> 16<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.570> we'll<00:04:37.570> see<00:04:37.750> how<00:04:37.900> far<00:04:38.140> it<00:04:38.320> feels

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
here 16 and we'll see how far it feels

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.570 
here 16 and we'll see how far it feels
to<00:04:39.130> go<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.520> right<00:04:39.730> to<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.060> top<00:04:44.010> ok<00:04:45.010> so<00:04:45.400> that

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
to go to the right to the top ok so that

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.230 
to go to the right to the top ok so that
was<00:04:45.610> 18<00:04:46.330> cups<00:04:47.550> ok<00:04:48.550> so<00:04:48.610> what<00:04:48.940> does<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.090> tell

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
was 18 cups ok so what does that tell

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.940 
was 18 cups ok so what does that tell
you<00:04:49.830> 18<00:04:50.830> cups<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.340> water<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.670> fill<00:04:52.090> this<00:04:52.950> but

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
you 18 cups of water to fill this but

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.830 
you 18 cups of water to fill this but
remember<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:55.120> only<00:04:55.240> took<00:04:55.480> 13<00:04:56.080> cups<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:57.840> so

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
remember it only took 13 cups and so

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:07.980 
remember it only took 13 cups and so
that<00:04:59.290> meant<00:05:02.400> five<00:05:03.400> cups<00:05:03.910> of<00:05:05.280> tallow<00:05:06.280> are<00:05:06.990> in

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
that meant five cups of tallow are in

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.450 
that meant five cups of tallow are in
here<00:05:09.870> that's<00:05:10.870> my<00:05:11.110> displacement<00:05:11.650> figuring

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
here that's my displacement figuring

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.000 
here that's my displacement figuring
outs<00:05:12.640> I<00:05:13.000> hope<00:05:13.630> I<00:05:13.750> did<00:05:13.930> it<00:05:13.960> right<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.620> have<00:05:14.980> a

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
outs I hope I did it right I have a

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.970 
outs I hope I did it right I have a
problem<00:05:15.490> with<00:05:15.670> all<00:05:15.790> these<00:05:15.940> numbers<00:05:16.420> sometimes

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
problem with all these numbers sometimes

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.030 
problem with all these numbers sometimes
but<00:05:17.980> I<00:05:18.160> believe<00:05:18.490> that<00:05:18.880> this<00:05:19.360> is<00:05:19.630> now<00:05:19.919> I'll<00:05:20.919> have

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
but I believe that this is now I'll have

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.560 
but I believe that this is now I'll have
to<00:05:21.070> measure<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.520> again<00:05:21.820> because<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:22.210> got<00:05:22.390> kind

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
to measure it again because I got kind

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.970 
to measure it again because I got kind
of<00:05:22.660> distracted<00:05:22.780> because<00:05:23.350> I<00:05:23.440> had<00:05:23.680> to<00:05:23.800> have

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
of distracted because I had to have

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.460 
of distracted because I had to have
people<00:05:24.970> there<00:05:25.150> looking<00:05:25.690> at<00:05:25.810> me<00:05:25.870> doing<00:05:26.200> this<00:05:26.320> so

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
people there looking at me doing this so

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.659 
people there looking at me doing this so
i<00:05:26.530> might<00:05:26.740> have<00:05:26.830> measured<00:05:27.160> wrong<00:05:27.340> but<00:05:27.550> i'm

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
i might have measured wrong but i'm

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.400 
i might have measured wrong but i'm
going<00:05:27.790> to<00:05:27.880> do<00:05:27.970> it<00:05:28.060> again<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:28.930> i'll<00:05:29.260> be

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410

should<00:05:38.320> hold<00:05:39.390> have<00:05:40.390> to<00:05:40.570> get<00:05:40.720> my<00:05:40.840> little<00:05:41.020> cup

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
should hold have to get my little cup

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:49.620 
should hold have to get my little cup
out<00:05:41.530> so<00:05:41.740> i<00:05:41.800> don't<00:05:43.440> splice<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.940> war

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:58.980 

so<00:05:50.630> that<00:05:50.840> held<00:05:51.140> 18<00:05:51.860> cups<00:05:52.130> right<00:05:56.320> oops<00:05:57.320> OH<00:05:57.560> 18

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
so that held 18 cups right oops OH 18

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.440 
so that held 18 cups right oops OH 18
this<00:05:59.990> is<00:06:00.170> 518<00:06:01.100> take<00:06:01.280> away<00:06:01.460> five<00:06:01.670> should<00:06:01.880> be<00:06:01.910> 13

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
it will told this which is 13 cups that

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:59.440 
it will told this which is 13 cups that
holds<00:06:51.170> all<00:06:51.260> of<00:06:51.320> this<00:06:51.680> then<00:06:52.070> I<00:06:52.190> know<00:06:56.050> yep<00:06:58.420> so<00:06:59.420> I

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
know that there is five cups of tallow

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.820 
know that there is five cups of tallow
in<00:07:02.480> here<00:07:03.550> okay<00:07:04.750> so<00:07:05.750> that's<00:07:05.960> how<00:07:06.170> I<00:07:06.200> measured<00:07:06.740> it
