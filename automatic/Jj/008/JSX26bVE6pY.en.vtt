00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
ESC from staying on there and as anyone

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.090 
ESC from staying on there and as anyone
knows<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.000> VXL<00:01:09.600> system<00:01:09.990> they<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.830> two

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
knows the VXL system they have two

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.960 
knows the VXL system they have two
little<00:01:11.369> tabs<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.880> hold<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:13.100> this<00:01:14.100> ESC<00:01:14.700> dama

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
little tabs that hold this this ESC dama

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.260 
little tabs that hold this this ESC dama
a<00:01:15.299> lot<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.960> times<00:01:16.170> those<00:01:16.470> tabs<00:01:16.830> break<00:01:17.369> once

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
a lot of times those tabs break once

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
a lot of times those tabs break once
they<00:01:18.450> break<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.140> solution<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.770> has<00:01:19.890> been

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
they break the solution that has been

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.490 
they break the solution that has been
out<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.610> RC<00:01:20.909> community<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.630> either

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
out there for the RC community is either

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.060 
out there for the RC community is either
throwing<00:01:22.890> zip<00:01:23.220> ties<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:24.470> once<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> zip<00:01:25.830> ties

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
throwing zip ties or once the zip ties

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.859 
throwing zip ties or once the zip ties
look<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.790> hideous<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.479> think<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.810> do

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
look as hideous as I think they do

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.080 
look as hideous as I think they do
they'll<00:01:28.830> do<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> double-sided<00:01:29.520> tape<00:01:29.640> which

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
they'll do the double-sided tape which

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.010 
they'll do the double-sided tape which
is<00:01:30.119> cool<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.630> well<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:31.979> RPM<00:01:32.490> did<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:33.020> try

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
is cool as well so what RPM did was try

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.109 
is cool as well so what RPM did was try
to<00:01:34.080> make<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> solution<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.460> just

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
to make a solution for that and just

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
to make a solution for that and just
making<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.619> little<00:01:37.619> cage<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.340> which<00:01:38.520> i

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
making a little cage for it which i

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.520 
making a little cage for it which i
think<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.909> pretty<00:01:39.060> cool<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> awesome

and the Bandit now the cool part of this

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.160 
and the Bandit now the cool part of this
which<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.070> thought<00:01:59.520> was<00:01:59.670> amazing<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:01.020> know

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
which I thought was amazing is you know

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.630 
which I thought was amazing is you know
what<00:02:01.350> you're<00:02:01.590> able<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.460> all

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
what you're able to do it on all

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.080 
what you're able to do it on all
applications<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.049> same<00:02:04.729> cage<00:02:05.729> for

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
applications and it's the same cage for

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.380 
applications and it's the same cage for
it<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.590> problem<00:02:08.070> was<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.850> didn't<00:02:09.119> read

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
it so the problem was that I didn't read

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.410 
it so the problem was that I didn't read
that<00:02:09.420> fine<00:02:09.869> print<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.400> would<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:12.150> would

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
that fine print and I would have I would

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.569 
that fine print and I would have I would
have<00:02:12.600> acquired<00:02:12.989> more<00:02:13.410> but<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> wanted<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.400> just

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
have acquired more but I wanted to just

was able to contact RC screws and I

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.750 
was able to contact RC screws and I
ended<00:03:55.590> up<00:03:55.650> getting<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.980> response<00:03:56.190> back<00:03:56.430> from

you a little bit more depth to this RC
unit<00:05:45.680> my<00:05:46.680> recommendation<00:05:47.430> is<00:05:47.580> if<00:05:47.610> you<00:05:48.060> do

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
unit my recommendation is if you do

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.540 
unit my recommendation is if you do
acquire<00:05:48.690> this<00:05:48.960> make<00:05:49.740> sure<00:05:49.770> you<00:05:50.009> have<00:05:50.219> a<00:05:50.250> fan

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
acquire this make sure you have a fan

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.029 
acquire this make sure you have a fan
available<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.479> you<00:05:51.650> available<00:05:52.650> to<00:05:52.889> you

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
available to you available to you

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.300 
available to you available to you
because<00:05:53.699> it<00:05:54.029> isn't<00:05:54.210> closed<00:05:54.889> there<00:05:55.889> is<00:05:56.069> still

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
because it isn't closed there is still

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.140 
because it isn't closed there is still
breathable<00:05:57.409> vents<00:05:58.409> all<00:05:58.740> around<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.490> RC<00:05:59.879> as

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
breathable vents all around the RC as

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.180 
breathable vents all around the RC as
you<00:06:00.750> can<00:06:00.900> see<00:06:01.020> it<00:06:01.110> doesn't<00:06:01.259> totally<00:06:01.770> totally

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
you can see it doesn't totally totally

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.839 
you can see it doesn't totally totally
seal<00:06:02.400> it<00:06:02.550> up<00:06:02.669> you<00:06:03.270> know<00:06:03.419> with<00:06:04.110> that<00:06:04.349> but<00:06:05.159> what

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
seal it up you know with that but what

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
you can do is make sure you have a fan

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.300 
you can do is make sure you have a fan
of<00:06:09.389> ailable<00:06:09.629> it's<00:06:09.900> very<00:06:10.050> inexpensive<00:06:10.289> I<00:06:10.889> mean

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
of ailable it's very inexpensive I mean

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.659 
of ailable it's very inexpensive I mean
I've<00:06:11.430> seen<00:06:11.580> them<00:06:11.729> go<00:06:11.879> as<00:06:11.909> low<00:06:12.210> as<00:06:12.240> $15<00:06:13.580> for<00:06:14.580> you

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
I've seen them go as low as $15 for you

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.760 
I've seen them go as low as $15 for you
to<00:06:14.759> get<00:06:14.909> a<00:06:14.940> fan<00:06:15.180> so<00:06:15.419> just<00:06:16.050> quiet<00:06:16.319> stuff<00:06:16.589> one

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
to get a fan so just quiet stuff one

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.079 
to get a fan so just quiet stuff one
there's<00:06:17.009> not<00:06:17.099> too<00:06:17.219> much<00:06:17.310> power<00:06:17.580> drawing<00:06:17.969> and

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.089 
there's not too much power drawing and

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:20.390 
there's not too much power drawing and
ESC<00:06:18.389> so<00:06:18.839> that's<00:06:19.680> something<00:06:19.889> good<00:06:20.099> for<00:06:20.219> you<00:06:20.310> to
