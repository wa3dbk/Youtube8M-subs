we<00:00:46.620> launched<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.070> art<00:00:47.370> system<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.660> AR<00:00:48.960> T

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
we launched the art system the AR T

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.279 
we launched the art system the AR T
system<00:00:49.530> five<00:00:50.100> years<00:00:50.399> ago<00:00:50.700> at<00:00:51.300> summer<00:00:51.750> namm<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
system five years ago at summer namm and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.880 
system five years ago at summer namm and
it<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.820> always<00:00:54.270> somehow<00:00:54.629> choose<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> apx<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
it we always somehow choose the apx and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.069 
it we always somehow choose the apx and
CPX<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> launch<00:00:56.789> pad<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.059> new<00:00:57.420> technology

CPX as a launch pad for new technology
and<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.100> there's<00:00:59.879> no<00:01:00.030> exception<00:01:00.510> this

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and and and there's no exception this

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.479 
and and and there's no exception this
time<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:01.020> decided<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.309> these

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
time we decided to do it with with these

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.719 
time we decided to do it with with these
guitars<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.870> thing<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.830> SRT<00:01:05.309> system

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
guitars the thing about the SRT system

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.830 
guitars the thing about the SRT system
is<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.650> utilizes<00:01:08.090> Mike<00:01:09.090> modeling<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
is that it utilizes Mike modeling and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.130 
is that it utilizes Mike modeling and
room<00:01:10.020> modeling<00:01:10.530> which<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.280> not<00:01:11.460> 100%<00:01:12.240> new<00:01:12.479> but

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
room modeling which is not 100% new but

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.570 
room modeling which is not 100% new but
were<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> first<00:01:13.619> company<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.490> has

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
were the first company I think that has

now<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.870> pickup<00:01:42.380> as<00:01:42.560> before<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.550> pickup

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
now the pickup as before the pickup

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.700 
now the pickup as before the pickup
would<00:01:44.060> be<00:01:44.150> underneath<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.660> saddle<00:01:45.050> now<00:01:45.530> we've

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
would be underneath the saddle now we've

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.440 
would be underneath the saddle now we've
developed<00:01:46.010> an<00:01:46.250> entire<00:01:46.580> saddle<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.420> a

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
developed an entire saddle that is a

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.120 
developed an entire saddle that is a
pickup<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.020> there's<00:01:48.200> no<00:01:48.470> nothing<00:01:48.890> in<00:01:49.040> between

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
pickup so there's no nothing in between
