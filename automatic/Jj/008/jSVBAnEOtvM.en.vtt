00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
in a cool carry case I like that the 35

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.090 
in a cool carry case I like that the 35
did<00:02:53.550> not<00:02:53.700> come<00:02:53.940> with<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.269> but<00:02:55.019> that's<00:02:55.890> very

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
did not come with that but that's very

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.580 
did not come with that but that's very
cool<00:02:57.680> got<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.769> figure<00:02:58.920> out<00:02:59.040> how<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.250> opens<00:02:59.430> up

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
cool got to figure out how this opens up

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.520 
cool got to figure out how this opens up
okay<00:03:01.590> here<00:03:01.769> we<00:03:01.830> go

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.270 

and<00:03:08.880> there<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.390> TK<00:03:10.750> 41<00:03:11.350> now<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.160> is

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
and there it is the TK 41 now that is

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.680 
and there it is the TK 41 now that is
actually<00:03:12.730> quite<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.030> bit<00:03:13.209> bigger<00:03:13.390> than<00:03:13.569> I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
actually quite a bit bigger than I

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.270 
actually quite a bit bigger than I
thought<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:14.020> was<00:03:14.170> comes<00:03:14.709> with<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:15.040> lanyard

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
thought it was comes with that lanyard

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
thought it was comes with that lanyard
just<00:03:15.640> like<00:03:15.790> my<00:03:15.940> 35<00:03:17.400> show<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:18.490> the<00:03:18.610> size<00:03:18.850> their

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
just like my 35 show you the size their

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.830 
just like my 35 show you the size their
comparison<00:03:21.090> it's<00:03:22.090> actually<00:03:22.450> quite<00:03:22.569> a<00:03:22.690> lot

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
comparison it's actually quite a lot

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.150 
comparison it's actually quite a lot
bigger<00:03:23.020> I<00:03:23.110> actually<00:03:23.410> thought<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.709> was<00:03:23.890> smaller

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
bigger I actually thought it was smaller

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.430 
bigger I actually thought it was smaller
than<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.459> TK<00:03:24.820> 35<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.570> didn't<00:03:26.050> do<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.170> whole<00:03:26.260> lot

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
than the TK 35 I didn't do a whole lot

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.300 
than the TK 35 I didn't do a whole lot
of<00:03:26.709> research<00:03:27.040> on<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.370> though<00:03:29.010> didn't<00:03:30.010> look<00:03:30.100> at

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
of research on it though didn't look at

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.910 
of research on it though didn't look at
the<00:03:30.520> size<00:03:31.030> really<00:03:31.390> but<00:03:32.230> just<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.620> picture

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
the size really but just in the picture

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.260 
the size really but just in the picture
it<00:03:33.010> looked<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.220> little<00:03:33.370> bit<00:03:33.550> smaller<00:03:33.760> but<00:03:34.060> this

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
it looked a little bit smaller but this

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.860 
it looked a little bit smaller but this
does<00:03:34.510> take<00:03:34.780> those<00:03:35.940> those<00:03:36.940> double<00:03:37.300> a<00:03:37.420> batteries

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
does take those those double a batteries

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.220 
does take those those double a batteries
batteries<00:03:38.590> which<00:03:38.830> is<00:03:39.100> nice<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.640> mean<00:03:40.230> there's

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
batteries which is nice I mean there's

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.550 
batteries which is nice I mean there's
definitely<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:42.010> whole<00:03:42.660> huge<00:03:43.660> conversation<00:03:44.110> you

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
definitely a whole huge conversation you

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.380 
definitely a whole huge conversation you
could<00:03:44.709> get<00:03:44.860> into<00:03:45.220> with<00:03:45.489> what<00:03:45.730> batteries<00:03:46.180> work

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
could get into with what batteries work

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.900 
could get into with what batteries work
best<00:03:46.690> with<00:03:46.870> what<00:03:46.930> flashlights<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.980> again<00:03:48.880> I

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
best with what flashlights and again I

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.080 
best with what flashlights and again I
don't<00:03:49.209> know<00:03:49.330> anything<00:03:49.570> about<00:03:50.140> that<00:03:50.170> but<00:03:51.090> you

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
pretty soon maybe do a comparison with

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.350 
pretty soon maybe do a comparison with
between<00:04:04.300> both<00:04:05.100> maybe<00:04:06.100> go<00:04:06.280> out<00:04:06.310> for<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.760> night
