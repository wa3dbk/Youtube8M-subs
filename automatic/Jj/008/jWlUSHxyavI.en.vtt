00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
group with Italy you require friends but

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.660 
group with Italy you require friends but
it<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> very<00:00:12.840> heavy<00:00:13.139> group<00:00:13.530> but<00:00:14.460> also

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
it is a very heavy group but also

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.939 
it is a very heavy group but also
because<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:18.449> second<00:00:18.840> stage<00:00:19.109> when<00:00:19.770> we

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
because of the the second stage when we

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.570 
because of the the second stage when we
are<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.550> through<00:00:20.789> then<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.990> possible<00:00:22.439> to

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
are going through then it is possible to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.179 
are going through then it is possible to
to<00:00:23.580> play<00:00:23.970> against<00:00:24.390> Brussels<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.529> that's<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
to play against Brussels so that's the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.720 
to play against Brussels so that's the
favorite<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.300> tournament<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:29.160> don't
