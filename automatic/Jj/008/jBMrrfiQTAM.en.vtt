00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.230
 the leg we are attacking 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:12.420
 in the pedagogical university I have more 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.950
 of 40 young people who are after we are going to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.010
 do a job are doing a 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.720
 work after working the part of 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.880
 the resistance eight minutes we're 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.310
 doing speed work in the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.519
 which divides the group into five each group 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.080
 has between eight and nine players I made 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.609
 five stations for the work of the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.780
 speed and in some other conventions 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.590
 elements I only do because the speed 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.150
 particularly my way of thinking 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.320
 it always develops or must 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.560
 develop at the beginning of 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.900
 training the first pique station 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.790
 speed 12 meters do the job 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.790
 of speed when one finishes the 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.530
 another and they come back jogging second 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.960
 speed work station but 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.790
 We went up 15 meters 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.370
 we will be passing the others so that the 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.550
 look and observe the work of doing 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.080
 station passed to 20 meters but before 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.589
 go to the 20 meters there is a job of 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:08.240
 agility or long zig-zag to finish 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.240
 in a pique towards the corner 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.580
 station number 4 from the cone is 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.920
 located 20 meters away but in the middle 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.380
 the cones located to work the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.119
 scroll to the front back a bit 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.740
 of agility and mobility that is 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.710
 important also to work in the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.450
 players and not forget it then 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.399
 in this fourth station he works in the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.170
 speed combining with movements of 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.840
 agility and the last station 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.520
 We are incorporating biometric work 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.149
 a little bit of saltability knees to 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.640
 five jumps chest make five 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.440
 repetitions and the next one comes out 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.210
 do as we have five stations 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.330
 We're doing a minute and a half 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.880
 each station and then they rotate 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.370
 it's worth mentioning that we're going to do two 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.890
 times this speed circuit between 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.990
 each repetition as there are 30 seconds of 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.660
 rest and after achieving the first 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.760
 series of the 5 exercises makes a 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.740
 Stretching and recovery work 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.960
 in motion of about 3 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.510
 3 to 5 minutes minutes to spend 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.070
 again to the second station after 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.990
 that we do the second repetition of the 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.670
 five exercises we are going to do one 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.310
 abdominal strength station effort 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.140
 arms to later reach the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.780
 technical work that we have planned 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.730
 for today I hope you like it I hope 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.170
 incorporate this type of work and I 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.700
 I'm doing because we're in a 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.340
 preseason period discovering 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.440
 players and you may always not know 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.060
 observe talents like 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.550
 they unfold how it moves in what 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.180
 physical capacity they bring before they 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.049
 evaluate you in the technical part 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.079
 great pleasure here I leave you and see you the 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.079
 next
