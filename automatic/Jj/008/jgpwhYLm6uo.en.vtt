00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.460 

the<00:00:05.940> blocks<00:00:06.180> I'm<00:00:06.390> going<00:00:06.630> to<00:00:06.780> use<00:00:06.990> now<00:00:07.230> are

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
the blocks I'm going to use now are

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.730 
the blocks I'm going to use now are
quite<00:00:07.680> special<00:00:08.540> each<00:00:09.540> edge<00:00:10.020> is<00:00:10.380> one

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
quite special each edge is one

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.810 
quite special each edge is one
centimeter<00:00:11.370> long<00:00:12.740> so<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.890> means<00:00:14.220> each<00:00:14.460> block

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
centimeter long so this means each block

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.600 
centimeter long so this means each block
is<00:00:15.030> one<00:00:15.420> cubic<00:00:16.080> centimeter<00:00:16.430> which<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
is one cubic centimeter which is a

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.000 
is one cubic centimeter which is a
standard<00:00:18.210> unit<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:18.900> use<00:00:19.200> to<00:00:19.410> measure<00:00:19.590> how

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
standard unit that we use to measure how

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.330 
standard unit that we use to measure how
much<00:00:20.279> space<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.000> object<00:00:21.539> occupies<00:00:21.930> or<00:00:22.530> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
much space and object occupies or the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.990 
much space and object occupies or the
volume<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.029> an<00:00:24.270> object<00:00:25.100> we<00:00:26.100> need<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> standard

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
volume of an object we need a standard

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.950 
volume of an object we need a standard
unit<00:00:28.160> because<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.190> standard<00:00:29.789> unit<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.270> one<00:00:30.570> size

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
unit because a standard unit is one size

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.460 
unit because a standard unit is one size
and<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:32.340> enables<00:00:32.850> us<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> accurately<00:00:33.780> find<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
and it enables us to accurately find the

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.250 
and it enables us to accurately find the
volume<00:00:34.830> of<00:00:34.920> objects<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.790> construct<00:00:36.720> objects

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
volume of objects and construct objects

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.120 
volume of objects and construct objects
that<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.829> same<00:00:38.190> volume<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:38.940> each<00:00:39.149> other

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
that have the same volume as each other

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.280 
that have the same volume as each other
now<00:00:41.130> I'll<00:00:41.370> build<00:00:41.670> two<00:00:42.030> towers<00:00:42.660> using<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
now I'll build two towers using the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.120 
now I'll build two towers using the
cubic<00:00:43.739> centimeter<00:00:44.399> blocks<00:00:44.960> each<00:00:45.960> tower<00:00:46.739> will

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
cubic centimeter blocks each tower will

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.780 
cubic centimeter blocks each tower will
have<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> base<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> four<00:00:48.390> blocks<00:00:49.460> now<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.520> can

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
have a base of four blocks now we can

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.740 
have a base of four blocks now we can
put<00:00:50.969> another<00:00:51.239> layer<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.750> top<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.140> each<00:00:52.410> tower

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
put another layer on top of each tower

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.729 
put another layer on top of each tower
for<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.230> tower<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.860> four<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.000> one

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
for for this tower and four for that one

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.799 
for for this tower and four for that one
there<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:58.860> still<00:00:59.039> some<00:00:59.280> blocks<00:00:59.550> left<00:01:00.000> so

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
there are still some blocks left so

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.130 
there are still some blocks left so
we'll<00:01:00.930> put<00:01:01.079> another<00:01:01.379> layer<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.920> each<00:01:02.160> tower

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
we'll put another layer on each tower

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.950 
we'll put another layer on each tower
look<00:01:04.140> at<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> towers<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:06.420> they<00:01:06.539> look<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> same

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
look at the towers do they look the same

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.389 
look at the towers do they look the same
to<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:08.030> they<00:01:09.030> look<00:01:09.209> the<00:01:09.390> same<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.899> me<00:01:10.399> let's

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
to you they look the same to me let's

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.169 
to you they look the same to me let's
check<00:01:12.619> there<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.649> four<00:01:14.100> blocks<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
check there are four blocks on the

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.130 
check there are four blocks on the
bottom<00:01:15.539> layer<00:01:16.069> four<00:01:17.069> on<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.580> next<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.179> four

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
bottom layer four on the next and four

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.040 
bottom layer four on the next and four
on<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.619> top<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.250> tower

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
on the top of this tower

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.630 
on the top of this tower
so<00:01:22.050> this<00:01:22.229> first<00:01:22.530> tower<00:01:22.860> has<00:01:23.369> 12<00:01:24.000> blocks<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
so this first tower has 12 blocks and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.150 
so this first tower has 12 blocks and
the<00:01:26.640> second<00:01:27.030> tower<00:01:27.270> also<00:01:27.929> has<00:01:28.200> four<00:01:28.560> blocks<00:01:28.920> on

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
the second tower also has four blocks on

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.960 
the second tower also has four blocks on
each<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.550> its<00:01:29.610> layers<00:01:30.800> so<00:01:31.800> we've<00:01:32.009> used<00:01:32.220> 12<00:01:32.700> in

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
each of its layers so we've used 12 in

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.520 
each of its layers so we've used 12 in
this<00:01:33.209> tower<00:01:33.569> also<00:01:35.149> we've<00:01:36.149> used<00:01:36.420> 12<00:01:36.599> cubes<00:01:37.289> to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
this tower also we've used 12 cubes to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.609 
this tower also we've used 12 cubes to
build<00:01:37.740> each<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.340> our<00:01:38.459> towers<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.410> because<00:01:40.410> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
build each of our towers and because the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.639 
build each of our towers and because the
cubes<00:01:41.069> are<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.340> standard<00:01:41.729> size<00:01:42.259> we<00:01:43.259> know<00:01:43.440> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
cubes are a standard size we know that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.070 
cubes are a standard size we know that
both<00:01:43.860> towers<00:01:44.250> take<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> same<00:01:45.450> amount<00:01:45.929> of

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
both towers take up the same amount of

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.609 
both towers take up the same amount of
space<00:01:47.390> can<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.509> remember<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:49.110> was<00:01:49.259> special

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
space can you remember what was special

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.449 
space can you remember what was special
about<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.280> blocks<00:01:50.550> I<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.910> just<00:01:51.149> used<00:01:52.459> yes

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
about the blocks I have just used yes

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.059 
about the blocks I have just used yes
each<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.720> their<00:01:54.869> sides<00:01:55.200> measures<00:01:55.800> one

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
each of their sides measures one

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.400 
each of their sides measures one
centimeter<00:01:56.789> and<00:01:57.030> their<00:01:57.509> volume<00:01:57.929> is<00:01:58.110> one

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
centimeter and their volume is one

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.580 
centimeter and their volume is one
centimeter<00:01:58.950> cubed<00:01:59.550> if<00:02:00.539> we<00:02:00.720> know<00:02:00.899> each<00:02:01.140> block

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
centimeter cubed if we know each block

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.639 
centimeter cubed if we know each block
is<00:02:01.800> one<00:02:02.190> cubic<00:02:02.880> centimeter<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.869> each<00:02:04.289> tower

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
is one cubic centimeter and each tower

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.729 
is one cubic centimeter and each tower
has<00:02:05.069> 12<00:02:05.459> blocks<00:02:06.140> what<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.289> you<00:02:07.349> think<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 
has 12 blocks what do you think the

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.870 
has 12 blocks what do you think the
volume<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.250> each<00:02:08.340> tower<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:10.190> we<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.370> say<00:02:11.640> that

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
volume of each tower is we can say that

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.509 
volume of each tower is we can say that
each<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.120> our<00:02:12.420> towers<00:02:12.989> has<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> volume<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.890> 12

each of our towers has a volume of 12

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.020 
each of our towers has a volume of 12
cubic<00:02:15.390> centimeters<00:02:16.230> because<00:02:16.980> each<00:02:17.400> block<00:02:17.819> in

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
cubic centimeters because each block in

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.580 
cubic centimeters because each block in
the<00:02:18.180> tower

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
the tower
