00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.960
 email 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:14.069
 but 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.100
 Hi guys 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.840
 Good morning, you can quickly get a really effective application that 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.920
 serves for 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.030
 to cut out figures within an image to conquer another 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.530
 counts on another 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.149
 another image 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.769
 common of one hundred and praise 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.280
 belardi a persono of an object 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.970
 the application is called the composer costs 23 euros 99 I also found on mac 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.040
 app store 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.079
 from today you tell me why it is very interesting to see what effect 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.210
 that is after the subscription discount 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.130
 here it opens the very very simple interface application a lot 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.200
 Immediate flat on the left all our panel in the section 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.330
 available 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.700
 and it is practically ready for use so once the program is opened 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.160
 we open the photo that interests us you will be my image 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.420
 I'm on a wall in copenhagen 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.350
 what i want to do is dismantle my figure i'm all here on this 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.080
 wall as to defeat it 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.960
 from the world of ends where I can see 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.799
 remove 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.780
 pandemic this wall fit into another woonko born mindy panorama behind 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.340
 my shoulders 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.620
 we go to do it so I am ready appropriation I open the photo and go to 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.220
 contour 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.860
 tracing all the pace for the moment of my bike 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.150
 my figure 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.240
 as precisely as possible therefore more precise siae 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.110
 do this more 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.599
 the figure will extrapolate perfect way - globetrotting smudges 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.870
 parts of the body 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.870
 the gods of patty d image that are behind my back 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 but I'm pretty fast because otherwise 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.709
 100 too long 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.350
 the interesting thing is that 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.820
 the photo, saved will obviously be alone 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.349
 the one that I move back to then returning the rest of the background 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.609
 hailed 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.169
 and I can then glue 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.919
 what remains of another image is really the result 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.089
 effect you will see it 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:34.509
 that's almost finished 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:38.319
 all for actions that can also be done with photoshop but have 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.679
 many of you with trees are modernly this software is 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:43.020
 pretty hard 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.500
 so he was doing me a little delicate operation as I am 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.289
 back in this case 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.289
 here I have finished I just have to select the 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.509
 the bucket here at the top you see 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:03:00.219
 then series to select the part of you bullous it seems in this way then 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.519
 inside 18 cut out 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.519
 and if with a click with the left button and then 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:11.139
 the part of mario cat eyes becomes clearer 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.899
 at this point where to buy on 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:17.899
 top left on this 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:20.309
 here it is 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.939
 as you see age I was left alone sitting on the screen 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.059
 you turn out to be quite like you and especially here around the 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:33.780
 at least my head 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.540
 they have been seen by our photo tree masterclasses 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.240
 previous but obviously then I said the more you do it the more precisely this 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.759
 don't have 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.429
 this point I'll put on farmville 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:51.349
 select save result for example Italian test 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:54.549
 subscription discount 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.469
 laid on the desk 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.849
 having done this I can close my competition application 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.969
 and go in April 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.939
 another countess, for example, look 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.849
 I'm going to open a photo of 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.849
 red square fly with photoshop 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.329
 elba what i would like to do is insert header 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.510
 cut contour stone best sitting on a wall 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.409
 in this case 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.409
 I want to sit in front of the stock exchange square 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.939
 at the bottom you see 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.669
 the kremlin 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.389
 I have to do you other than 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.499
 take my photo 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.210
 Saturday 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.210
 they had in photoshop 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:43.180
 here it is 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.180
 go to select 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.689
 photo on the right 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:51.830
 copy it 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.219
 and stick it 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.219
 in this new contest 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.050
 at this point 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.259
 if there were no traces of the photo 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.360
 previous you will look like me 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.879
 dagospia sitting in this house even though I've never been 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.370
 still better course 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.629
 do the same thing with the photo 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:15.569
 a little more 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.400
 adapts to the sea an example of a lawn 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.319
 look 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.569
 in this case 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.569
 much more effective result 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.490
 same thing i go up 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.080
 copy and paste 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.629
 he eats too much 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:34.759
 in this word too big 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.270
 so it will be enough 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.740
 make the picture smaller here 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.740
 to the left 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.860
 hey with care 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.639
 to the right 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.860
 I love the operation you do with photoshop you need to have a certain 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.800
 the minimum practice of 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.530
 of using photoshop but still they are really simple people 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.659
 news is actually a lawn kindergarten on a wall so if I had been a lot 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:15.360
 precise the painter sculptor meaning I have more time 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:18.569
 lose undermine the 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.110
 the contours of my image here would have been ahahah would be a good one 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.069
 result much wider spectrum as see 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.940
 I can still limit it does not always want only those people here 

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:33.249
 sessions I could insert myself 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:38.429
 easily within the image and interview times can be created 

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:43.680
 the old contacts imagine you caress a friend reinserting it to the ma 

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:45.740
 only with the actors of 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.080
 really many many solutions 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.439
 de compostela therefore allows you to do this quickly and easily 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:57.680
 are found on mac app store at the price of 23 euros 99 here it is 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.850
