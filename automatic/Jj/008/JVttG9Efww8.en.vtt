all that this is is just that repeated
and<00:01:54.279> you're<00:01:54.369> going<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.549> alternate<00:01:54.999> so<00:01:55.859> left

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
and you're going to alternate so left

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:03.740 
and you're going to alternate so left
over<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:58.529> pull<00:01:59.529> through<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.829> loop

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.900 

and<00:02:04.750> right<00:02:05.080> over<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.490> pull<00:02:06.790> through<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.030> loop

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.380 

and<00:02:13.140> as<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.380> work<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:14.830> going<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.370> kind<00:02:16.210> of

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
and as you work it's going to kind of

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.320 
and as you work it's going to kind of
come<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:16.990> together<00:02:17.290> after<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.820> do<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.060> little

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
come up together after you do a little

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.000 
come up together after you do a little
bit<00:02:19.540> once<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.840> starts<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.290> be<00:02:20.410> too<00:02:20.560> far<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
bit once it starts to be too far in the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.270 
bit once it starts to be too far in the
front<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:22.630> can<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:25.560> grab<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.740> ends<00:02:27.130> and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
front you can just grab the ends and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.640 
front you can just grab the ends and
pull<00:02:28.030> them<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.360> back<00:02:28.450> until<00:02:29.170> they're<00:02:29.560> at

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
pull them to the back until they're at

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.180 
pull them to the back until they're at
the<00:02:29.770> sides<00:02:29.980> again<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.590> kind<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.860> gives<00:02:35.980> you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
the sides again so it kind of gives you

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.940 
the sides again so it kind of gives you
an<00:02:36.340> alternative<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:38.100> plain<00:02:39.100> square<00:02:39.459> knots

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
an alternative to the plain square knots

an alternative to the plain square knots
for<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.070> sides<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.670> bracelet<00:02:43.240> or<00:02:43.800> any<00:02:44.800> kind

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
for the sides of a bracelet or any kind

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.270 
for the sides of a bracelet or any kind
of<00:02:45.100> piece<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.400> macrame<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.120> want<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.390> do
