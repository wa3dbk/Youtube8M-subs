she basically documented her progress

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.539 
she basically documented her progress
wearing<00:00:11.849> jeans<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.660> different<00:00:13.019> sizes<00:00:13.549> so

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
wearing jeans of different sizes so

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.400 
wearing jeans of different sizes so
she'd<00:00:15.030> pictured<00:00:15.570> by<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> jean<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.109> was

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
she'd pictured by a jean that was

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.439 
she'd pictured by a jean that was
obviously<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.070> smaller<00:00:17.430> size<00:00:17.699> than<00:00:18.029> her<00:00:18.240> and

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
obviously a smaller size than her and

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.220 
obviously a smaller size than her and
then<00:00:19.050> she<00:00:19.230> tried<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:20.930> just<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.020> measure

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
then she tried on and just to measure

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.929 
then she tried on and just to measure
how<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.769> progress<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.550> thought<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.850> was

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
how in progress and I thought that was

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.880 
how in progress and I thought that was
really<00:00:24.090> really<00:00:24.269> great<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.199> made<00:00:25.350> me<00:00:25.529> think

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
really really great and it made me think
