00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.069
 in nineteen 95 against a Dutch first a trauma helicopter and that did not last 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.819
 long or we had four 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:13.189
 but those helis did not fly there at the time that in Volendam a fateful one 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.689
 cafe fire broke out 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.150
 it was new year night 2010 ambulances police cars were on fire 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:24.349
 hopelessly in the way here on this dyke 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.910
 180 people were injured and fourteen young people died 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.160
 In the past ten years there has been a lot of hard work with at night 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.930
 trauma helicopter and that succeeded 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.289
 in groningen rotterdam amsterdam and no megen 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:39.260
 but from April 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
 They are flown 24 hours a day 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.840
 The station became a total of seventeen kilos TNT became a nurse two 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840
 months to learn how to fly at night 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 but what adjustments are actually needed 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.930
 the difference with the day operation is that clear use of it is quick 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.020
 star gender 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.430
 which is also going to come from a unique code at the helmond part time work and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.340
 certainly not according to the source 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.770
 when i don't just look down tim tim chick for the oven 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.360
 What you do see is that he looks through those tubes, our reservations 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.540
 perquy van nv look that you how much more than the 40-year-old cup 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.330
 during the day 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
 you also need to move to see the environment 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.369
 that is a dark cold evening, 3 February 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.610
 seeing again with good enough to fly 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.080
 the listening post also for training flights 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.479
 nurses petra and pilot geert we are in the middle of a training course 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.500
 we have to pull out 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.500
 for the fictional report 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.660
 but we can also return players ourselves if possible 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.900
 the hospital in the background 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 siem the young and old one of the scientists a wonderful to go 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.150
 at the country level 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.990
 and if you happened to you the accident looked into it 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.050
 then you see that these days his country is in the beginning of four of an exam and 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.119
 doctors 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.379
 about the learned 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.869
 wageningen and surroundings look like you recognize them obstacles to tensions 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.719
 the windmills high mast why 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.829
 now i'm much more searching the city council has that in a tuesday 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.579
 seen on a map 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.669
 But what are they with when the pager comes to their joint responsibility 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.009
 the navigation for the integration computer 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.249
 We go on the perpetrators who for them that distance 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.519
 on the radio with the text 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.179
 navigate fly 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.619
 and if there is no more room at the incident like this most needed 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.379
 have their head in the sand 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.699
 maybe i'm a quarter of the netherlands again 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.709
 You have to imagine he gave Rotterdam 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.669
 tilburg utrecht go as far as the german border 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.159
 Algeria that has not been achieved 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.419
 stassen euro countries 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.629
 then the robbers a why beware why it is important that we 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.519
 find that we are leaving now that reports it has the reason why according to that 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.069
 the police a stop sign 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.859
 that day was called 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.529
 will be whole 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:19.349
 consequences the market gardeners now with animal viewers 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.279
 you must have safety instructions 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:22.369
 adjust with you 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.659
 for my feeling 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.419
 people fall 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.399
 that during the day 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:29.369
 of you 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:33.259
 with the nos mobile medical team with a plan to offer the extra help 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.930
 that's a dark one at night that may not have happened that often anymore 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.149
 that is exactly the problem 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.719
 a group of people
