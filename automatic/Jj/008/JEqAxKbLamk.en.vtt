00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.950
 can do technically and compact to that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.049
 is suitable for 2 adults 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.590
 maybe 3 or 2 adults with two 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.590
 small kia 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.510
 what of intention caught of course quite a lot 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.280
 good are his sticks and do I do something 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.940
 ordinary sox you just lean in color 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.940
 chosen match 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.550
 sat like pile or socks and like this 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.870
 path is pushing a block up 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.730
 well then you don't lick it on your own 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.160
 nice of shocks hybrid tent is the so 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.930
 ill all corners are stretched 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.040
 with the sticks without the herring necessary 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.040
 and so I'm not going to do you 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.420
 handy also handy 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.080
 one of the things i do at eureka 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.000
 need it we can be yellow 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.220
 plastic herring 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.470
 you see them very clearly and they work 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.420
 quite good practice breaks in itself 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.470
 also quite fast and hey come once 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.470
 given the good sore spot 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.570
 it is of course a tent and you 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.640
 hopelessly bad weather but if you do 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.100
 poor learning is a thing of the past 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.490
 sit inside from 30 to on 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.619
 meets it then you can see what is there 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.509
 comes from the left and yes and what comes of it 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.909
 right 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.200
 reka naturally has an outsite in response 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.970
 and then learn here 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.649
 exit or entrance and then you can 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.550
 of course winning again 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:57.289
 yes and then on the other side again 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.289
 an exit that has to go here 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.610
 and here of course 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.300
 yes and then we here so if it's hot 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.820
 again a shit is scandinavia 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.710
 no air copy space in the inner tent 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.570
 is there for three large people in addition 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.690
 wash each other 3 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.010
 two children father mother alone 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.470
 their mother should not be too slow 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.350
 I am already a meter 70 unknown 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.920
 nice about the tent cloth here and what 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.810
 weather is good that you are in the inner tent 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.510
 Here too gazet shoot from you 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.160
 head zippers then you can go outside 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.470
 look who's the weather for 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.900
 but then you must open the zippers 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.239
 Do you have a big view box and also regahs 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.680
 before you went to kill are many 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.010
 different materials and tent from te 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.200
 to make 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.520
 This is made from technical when in 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.459
 technical tool is a mixture of 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.530
 polyester and cotton 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.550
 The advantage is that it and usually 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.930
 much tighter 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.780
 oddly enough, you also help him 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.060
 lifelong technically natural and 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.680
 actually that the dough is what every 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.780
 there is waterproof mark on the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.090
 just a baby layer inside and 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.950
 polyurethane coating that meets him 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.140
 and not by some form 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.600
 hybrid form and they tick sticks 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.600
 this firmness is absolutely right
