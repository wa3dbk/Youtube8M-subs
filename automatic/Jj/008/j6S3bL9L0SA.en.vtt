this as those two but definitely a great

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.240 
this as those two but definitely a great
choice<00:06:01.580> if<00:06:01.639> you<00:06:01.880> go<00:06:02.060> to<00:06:02.120> filter<00:06:02.449> water<00:06:03.190> it's<00:06:04.190> a

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
choice if you go to filter water it's a

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.840 
choice if you go to filter water it's a
little<00:06:04.520> less<00:06:04.930> expensive<00:06:05.930> but<00:06:06.850> those

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
little less expensive but those

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.129 
little less expensive but those
definitely<00:06:08.300> taste<00:06:08.509> better<00:06:08.720> i<00:06:08.810> don't<00:06:08.990> know<00:06:09.080> if

it's<00:06:09.259> the<00:06:09.350> filter<00:06:09.710> elements<00:06:10.370> or<00:06:10.870> or<00:06:11.870> what<00:06:12.080> but

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
it's the filter elements or or what but

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:13.840 
it's the filter elements or or what but
this<00:06:12.470> works<00:06:12.740> you<00:06:12.949> can<00:06:13.070> still<00:06:13.280> taste<00:06:13.460> a<00:06:13.699> little

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850
