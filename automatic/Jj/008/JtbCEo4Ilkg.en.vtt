00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
does the icing smoother work it is a

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.389 
does the icing smoother work it is a
double-sided<00:00:55.030> blade<00:00:55.870> with<00:00:56.769> a<00:00:56.799> comfort<00:00:57.370> grip

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.819 
double-sided blade with a comfort grip
handle<00:00:57.940> in<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.179> center<00:00:58.510> and<00:00:58.780> it<00:00:59.530> is<00:00:59.620> nine

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
handle in the center and it is nine

handle in the center and it is nine
inches<00:01:00.129> tall<00:01:00.399> so<00:01:00.429> it's<00:01:00.789> great<00:01:01.030> because<00:01:01.210> even

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
inches tall so it's great because even

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.299 
inches tall so it's great because even
if<00:01:02.139> you're<00:01:02.260> doing<00:01:02.379> a<00:01:02.589> really<00:01:02.829> really<00:01:02.920> tall

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309

entire side of that cake in one in one

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.240 
entire side of that cake in one in one
swing<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.360> I'm<00:01:08.259> going<00:01:08.469> to<00:01:08.530> demonstrate<00:01:08.770> how

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
swing and I'm going to demonstrate how

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.060 
swing and I'm going to demonstrate how
easy<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.640> is<00:01:09.729> to<00:01:09.939> use<00:01:10.090> this<00:01:10.240> as<00:01:10.299> well<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:11.710> it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
easy it is to use this as well now it's

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.499 
easy it is to use this as well now it's
really<00:01:12.250> important<00:01:12.729> when<00:01:12.880> you're<00:01:12.969> icing<00:01:13.420> your

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
really important when you're icing your

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.980 
really important when you're icing your
cakes<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:14.320> use<00:01:15.280> icing<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:15.880> is<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.689> correct

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
cakes to use icing that is the correct

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.630 
cakes to use icing that is the correct
consistency<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:18.549> it's<00:01:18.700> not<00:01:18.909> too<00:01:19.359> stiff<00:01:19.840> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
consistency that it's not too stiff to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.340 
consistency that it's not too stiff to
spread<00:01:21.640> okay<00:01:22.299> so<00:01:22.359> it's<00:01:22.719> it's<00:01:22.930> going<00:01:23.109> to<00:01:23.170> be<00:01:23.229> a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
spread okay so it's it's going to be a

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.709 
spread okay so it's it's going to be a
little<00:01:23.680> bit<00:01:23.859> a<00:01:24.100> little<00:01:24.549> bit<00:01:24.700> looser<00:01:24.939> than<00:01:25.450> if

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
little bit a little bit looser than if

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.840 
little bit a little bit looser than if
you<00:01:25.899> were<00:01:26.020> say<00:01:26.229> doing<00:01:26.500> roses<00:01:26.920> or<00:01:27.130> borders<00:01:27.579> or

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
you were say doing roses or borders or

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.459 
you were say doing roses or borders or
something<00:01:28.180> like<00:01:28.329> that<00:01:28.509> really<00:01:28.930> important<00:01:29.380> to

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
something like that really important to

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.319 
something like that really important to
start<00:01:29.680> with<00:01:29.799> that<00:01:30.100> because<00:01:30.460> if<00:01:30.700> your<00:01:30.820> icing<00:01:31.180> is

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
start with that because if your icing is

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.569 
start with that because if your icing is
too<00:01:31.659> stiff<00:01:32.109> to<00:01:32.439> start<00:01:32.710> with<00:01:32.859> it's<00:01:33.310> going<00:01:33.520> to

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
too stiff to start with it's going to

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.389 
too stiff to start with it's going to
give<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.850> lot<00:01:34.090> more<00:01:34.210> problems<00:01:35.159> okay

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
give you a lot more problems okay

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.249 
give you a lot more problems okay
so<00:01:36.700> I've<00:01:36.850> made<00:01:37.060> sure<00:01:37.119> my<00:01:37.420> icing<00:01:37.840> is<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:37.990> really

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
so I've made sure my icing is a really

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.499 
so I've made sure my icing is a really
nice<00:01:38.409> consistency<00:01:38.789> and<00:01:39.789> you're<00:01:40.149> just<00:01:40.299> going

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
nice consistency and you're just going

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.450 
nice consistency and you're just going
to<00:01:40.539> start<00:01:40.780> by<00:01:40.899> icing<00:01:41.469> the<00:01:41.590> cake<00:01:41.619> as<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.009> would

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
to start by icing the cake as you would

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.300 
to start by icing the cake as you would
regularly<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.210> top<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.929> sides<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.679> as

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
regularly the top and the sides and as

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.550 
regularly the top and the sides and as
you<00:01:45.549> can<00:01:45.729> see<00:01:45.939> I'm<00:01:46.179> not<00:01:46.450> icing<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.079> perfectly

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
you can see I'm not icing it perfectly

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.899 
you can see I'm not icing it perfectly
by<00:01:47.859> any<00:01:48.100> means<00:01:48.460> but<00:01:49.359> it<00:01:49.479> is<00:01:49.600> also<00:01:49.869> not

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
by any means but it is also not

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.849 
by any means but it is also not
SuperDuper<00:01:51.929> wavy<00:01:52.929> or<00:01:53.140> anything<00:01:53.560> like<00:01:53.799> that

SuperDuper wavy or anything like that

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.380 
SuperDuper wavy or anything like that

because the more wavy it is to start

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.550

tool you will be able to be a little bit

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.090 
tool you will be able to be a little bit
faster<00:03:06.250> with<00:03:06.430> this<00:03:06.550> as<00:03:06.790> well<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:11.620> just<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.950> few

faster with this as well and just a few

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.860 
faster with this as well and just a few
rotations<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.880> get<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> very<00:03:13.360> nice<00:03:13.540> very

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
rotations and you get a very nice very

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.740 
rotations and you get a very nice very
flat<00:03:14.260> finish<00:03:14.650> now<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.280> can<00:03:15.670> use<00:03:15.910> this<00:03:16.239> part<00:03:16.570> of

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
flat finish now you can use this part of

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.440 
flat finish now you can use this part of
the<00:03:17.080> tool<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.590> grip<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.250> just<00:03:19.060> scrape<00:03:19.420> the

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
sides and this is a ninety degree angle

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.160 
sides and this is a ninety degree angle
here<00:03:27.489> which<00:03:27.880> is<00:03:28.060> good<00:03:28.269> because<00:03:28.480> we<00:03:28.690> are<00:03:28.900> going
