00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.410
 Hi, I'm going to present you with a dish 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.080
 unique that is very comfortable that you can 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.450
 prepare the day before and bring it up to date 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.700
 next to work for example in this 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.460
 case I will prepare a sirloin with 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.289
 a sauce of mushrooms and pasta 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.050
 cappelletti all vuitton and 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.119
 we will start browning the sirloin in a 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.279
 pan with a little bit of oil I already have 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.279
 of hot oil and add the sirloin 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.810
 make a garlic clove and a sprig of 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.810
 laurel 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.420
 I check if it 's degrees and give it the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.420
 return 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.040
 I leave you 25 minutes plus 10 minutes until 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.110
 that is ready 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.970
 to make pork is preferable that it does not give you 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.330
 credit I've put the water to boil 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.630
 to cook the pasta I will add the 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.630
 cognac 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.550
 when I have the meat ready I'm going to 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.600
 remove and let cool before 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.130
 cut it 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.130
 while I'm heating the sauce 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.049
 called a little 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.900
 now I will cut the meat in this tray 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.680
 which is special and collects juice then 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.680
 I cut it in medallions 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.220
 and I add the meat to the mushroom sauce 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.900
 opened the juice and withdrew it in the last 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.870
 moment heats it a little bit now 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.660
 I'll take the pasta and I have the law of water 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.800
 boiling and I'll cook the pasta like 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.250
 always in abundant water with saber and the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.250
 pasta 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.100
 we do the pasta for 4 minutes 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.470
 this way it will remain al dente the stuffed pasta no 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.850
 it is convenient to know work buttons there 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.320
 to lower the fire a little bit because if 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.630
 it does not break and sometimes you can follow the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.510
 stuffing I think it's ready I'm going to 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.880
 drain and if you are preparing to 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.710
 tomorrow you have to go through cold water 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.540
 to cut the cooking and put a 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.540
 trickle of olive oil oil 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.330
