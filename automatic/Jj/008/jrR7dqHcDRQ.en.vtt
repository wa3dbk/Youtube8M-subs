so<00:00:16.820> that's<00:00:16.970> when<00:00:17.180> it<00:00:17.300> really<00:00:17.330> is<00:00:17.780> a<00:00:17.810> dangerous

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
so that's when it really is a dangerous

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.590 
so that's when it really is a dangerous
weapon<00:00:18.680> in<00:00:19.070> its<00:00:19.369> own<00:00:19.550> right<00:00:19.730> listing<00:00:20.180> can<00:00:20.390> they

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
weapon in its own right listing can they

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.900 
weapon in its own right listing can they
moves<00:00:22.300> and<00:00:25.840> it<00:00:27.009> tizzle<00:00:28.009> basically<00:00:28.670> says

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
moves and it tizzle basically says

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.330 
moves and it tizzle basically says
there's<00:00:29.750> there's<00:00:30.110> one<00:00:30.590> other<00:00:30.739> time<00:00:31.040> it<00:00:31.189> can<00:00:31.279> be

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
there's there's one other time it can be

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.490 
there's there's one other time it can be
rewarding<00:00:31.520> to<00:00:32.180> have<00:00:32.300> careful<00:00:32.750> scanning<00:00:33.050> when

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
rewarding to have careful scanning when

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.069 
rewarding to have careful scanning when
you<00:00:33.590> decide<00:00:33.890> on<00:00:33.920> a<00:00:34.070> course<00:00:34.250> of<00:00:34.399> action<00:00:34.790> it<00:00:35.660> can

you decide on a course of action it can

you decide on a course of action it can
have<00:00:36.260> it<00:00:36.950> being<00:00:37.100> worthwhile<00:00:37.399> to<00:00:37.670> have<00:00:37.760> at

have it being worthwhile to have at

have it being worthwhile to have at

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
board this can be impractical if it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.529 
board this can be impractical if it
plunges<00:00:45.559> into<00:00:45.739> new<00:00:46.429> faults<00:00:46.879> but<00:00:47.300> it<00:00:47.420> often

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
plunges into new faults but it often

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.810 
plunges into new faults but it often
turns<00:00:47.899> up<00:00:48.140> something<00:00:48.379> important<00:00:51.519> so<00:00:52.519> there

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
turns up something important so there

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.979 
turns up something important so there
can<00:00:52.940> be<00:00:52.969> a<00:00:53.059> potential<00:00:53.420> blunder<00:00:53.719> which<00:00:53.839> was

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
can be a potential blunder which was

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.930 
can be a potential blunder which was
overlooked<00:00:56.829> so<00:00:57.829> it's<00:00:58.010> often<00:00:58.429> very<00:00:58.460> useful<00:00:58.879> in

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
overlooked so it's often very useful in

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.549 
overlooked so it's often very useful in

one<00:01:02.239> tis<00:01:02.600> not<00:01:02.809> tizzle<00:01:03.199> rights<00:01:03.910> but<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.720> last

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
one tis not tizzle rights but the last

one tis not tizzle rights but the last
two<00:01:06.320> points<00:01:06.650> having<00:01:06.830> faith<00:01:07.159> in<00:01:07.190> your

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
two points having faith in your

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.320 
two points having faith in your
calculations<00:01:09.610> so<00:01:10.610> sometimes<00:01:11.000> you've<00:01:11.150> got<00:01:11.300> to

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
calculations so sometimes you've got to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.490 
calculations so sometimes you've got to
trust<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:11.720> I<00:01:11.810> think<00:01:11.870> that's<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.200> good<00:01:12.350> way<00:01:12.470> of

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
trust it I think that's a good way of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.030 
trust it I think that's a good way of
avoiding<00:01:12.770> losing<00:01:13.310> time<00:01:13.520> on<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.760> clock<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:15.040> in

avoiding losing time on the clock and in

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
tizzle you know basically why it's the

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:22.810 
tizzle you know basically why it's the
calculation<00:01:21.950> will<00:01:22.100> be<00:01:22.189> less<00:01:22.369> important<00:01:22.790> than

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
calculation will be less important than

calculation will be less important than

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.319 
force method is no good we also know
that<00:01:36.860> there's<00:01:37.280> this<00:01:37.579> weakness<00:01:37.880> of<00:01:38.149> the

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
that there's this weakness of the

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.990 
that there's this weakness of the
horizon<00:01:38.840> effect<00:01:39.350> where<00:01:39.680> if<00:01:40.399> you<00:01:40.579> don't<00:01:40.790> put

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
horizon effect where if you don't put

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.399 
horizon effect where if you don't put
the<00:01:41.090> computer<00:01:41.240> on<00:01:41.479> for<00:01:41.689> long<00:01:41.840> enough<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:42.290> it's

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
the computer on for long enough and it's

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.100 
the computer on for long enough and it's
got<00:01:42.649> a<00:01:42.680> certain<00:01:42.860> depth<00:01:43.280> then<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.840> know<00:01:44.930> after

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
got a certain depth then you know after

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.779 
got a certain depth then you know after
that<00:01:45.380> depth<00:01:45.619> fits<00:01:45.829> missed<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:46.280> thing<00:01:46.579> in<00:01:46.700> the

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729 
weapons in the right context I think

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.939

tactical<00:03:38.459> positions<00:03:38.849> especially<00:03:39.239> ones<00:03:39.900> like
