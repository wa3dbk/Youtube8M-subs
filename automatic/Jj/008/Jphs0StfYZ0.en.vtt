and<00:01:57.329> then<00:01:57.719> storm<00:01:58.380> bolter<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> bottom<00:01:59.130> for

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and then storm bolter on the bottom for

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.830 
and then storm bolter on the bottom for
the<00:01:59.579> librarian<00:02:00.090> that's<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> only<00:02:00.479> option<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the librarian that's the only option you

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.319 
the librarian that's the only option you
have<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.619> see<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> little<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.250> why<00:02:03.210> they

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
have you see a little bit of why they

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.219 
have you see a little bit of why they
chose<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:04.130> cartography<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.689> here's<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.869> force

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
chose a cartography and here's the force

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.770 
chose a cartography and here's the force
weapon<00:02:07.560> hand<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.670> similar<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.750> of

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
weapon hand so it's similar to one of

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.850 
weapon hand so it's similar to one of
the<00:02:11.660> one<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.780> island<00:02:13.080> cloud<00:02:13.260> arms<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.770> I

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the one of the island cloud arms that I

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.100 
the one of the island cloud arms that I
remember<00:02:14.580> if<00:02:14.640> I'm<00:02:14.790> gonna<00:02:14.879> speed<00:02:15.180> yeah<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.629> ran

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
remember if I'm gonna speed yeah I ran

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.650 
remember if I'm gonna speed yeah I ran
or<00:02:16.440> something<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:18.239> years<00:02:18.450> basically

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
or something the years basically

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.690 
or something the years basically
assemble<00:02:19.230> very<00:02:19.560> fast<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> legs

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
assemble very fast so the legs

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.729 
assemble very fast so the legs
pop<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.629> then<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> arms<00:02:22.170> obviously<00:02:22.650> don't

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
pop and then the arms obviously don't

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.860 
pop and then the arms obviously don't
glue<00:02:22.950> those<00:02:23.099> on<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.720> interchangeable<00:02:24.720> or

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
glue those on to the interchangeable or

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.900 
glue those on to the interchangeable or
you<00:02:25.680> take<00:02:25.830> them<00:02:25.980> off<00:02:26.099> for<00:02:26.430> weapons<00:02:26.730> get

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
you take them off for weapons get

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.180 
you take them off for weapons get

the way down and then I cut the other
way<00:03:30.890> here<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.900> get<00:03:33.019> even<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.350> there<00:03:33.470> ended

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
way here you get even that there ended

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.470 
way here you get even that there ended
up<00:03:33.680> being<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:33.950> bit<00:03:34.070> of<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.220> gap<00:03:34.430> here<00:03:34.459> so<00:03:34.910> if<00:03:35.300> I<00:03:35.420> do

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
up being a bit of a gap here so if I do

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.830 
up being a bit of a gap here so if I do
this<00:03:35.660> again<00:03:35.810> which<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.410> will<00:03:36.590> for<00:03:37.370> another

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
this again which I will for another

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.690 
this again which I will for another
assault<00:03:38.840> on<00:03:38.959> black<00:03:39.140> retread<00:03:39.590> not<00:03:39.769> I<00:03:40.040> would<00:03:40.580> be

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
assault on black retread not I would be

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
assault on black retread not I would be
a<00:03:40.730> bit<00:03:40.850> more<00:03:40.940> careful<00:03:41.120> but<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.450> figure<00:03:41.690> you

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
a bit more careful but I figure you

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.699 
a bit more careful but I figure you
won't<00:03:41.930> see<00:03:42.140> that<00:03:42.170> when<00:03:42.470> it's<00:03:42.590> all<00:03:42.650> put

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
won't see that when it's all put

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.259 
won't see that when it's all put
together<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:43.790> had<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:43.970> cut<00:03:44.150> around

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
together and so I had to cut around

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.300 
together and so I had to cut around
these<00:03:44.690> guys<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:45.230> little<00:03:45.470> bit<00:03:45.680> difficult<00:03:45.950> you

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
these guys a little bit difficult you

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.680 
these guys a little bit difficult you
see<00:03:46.370> piece<00:03:46.730> there<00:03:46.910> still<00:03:47.209> Bluff<00:03:47.390> I'm<00:03:47.540> gonna

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
see piece there still Bluff I'm gonna

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.949 
see piece there still Bluff I'm gonna
cut<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.019> off<00:03:48.170> with<00:03:48.350> a<00:03:49.390> Zack<00:03:50.390> tonight<00:03:50.660> and

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
cut that off with a Zack tonight and

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.870 
cut that off with a Zack tonight and
there's<00:03:51.290> that<00:03:51.530> piece<00:03:51.890> that<00:03:51.920> goes<00:03:52.220> up<00:03:52.670> at<00:03:52.820> the

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
there's that piece that goes up at the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.180 
there's that piece that goes up at the
top<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.329> I<00:03:53.360> need<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.630> save<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:54.620> piece<00:03:54.890> was

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
top and I need to save that piece was

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.039 
top and I need to save that piece was
going<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.400> go<00:03:55.489> in<00:03:55.670> there<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.690> whole<00:03:56.840> death

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
going to go in there and the whole death

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.199 
going to go in there and the whole death
company<00:03:57.440> drive<00:03:57.920> will<00:03:58.280> be<00:03:58.400> right<00:03:58.850> here's<00:03:59.090> the

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
company drive will be right here's the

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.860 
company drive will be right here's the
head

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
head

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.179 
head
so<00:04:02.870> that's<00:04:03.319> how<00:04:03.469> it's<00:04:03.590> gonna<00:04:03.680> fit<00:04:03.920> together

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189 
so that's how it's gonna fit together

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.220 
so that's how it's gonna fit together
