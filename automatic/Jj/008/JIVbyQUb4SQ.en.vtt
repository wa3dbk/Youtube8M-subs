that<00:02:59.060> this<00:02:59.180> is<00:02:59.329> actually<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.690> try<00:02:59.930> tune

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
that this is actually a try tune

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.949 
that this is actually a try tune
actually<00:03:01.129> another<00:03:01.370> real<00:03:01.640> Triton<00:03:02.360> it's<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.690> two

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
actually another real Triton it's a two

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.449 
actually another real Triton it's a two
and<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.170> half<00:03:03.379> we<00:03:03.650> call<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.069> Sport

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
and a half we call that the Sport

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.640 
and a half we call that the Sport
Package<00:03:04.879> so<00:03:05.569> it's<00:03:05.750> not<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:06.019> third<00:03:06.349> log

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
Package so it's not a third log

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.069 
Package so it's not a third log
completely<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:08.000> N<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:08.299> probably<00:03:08.629> around<00:03:08.930> your

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
completely the N is probably around your

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.380 
completely the N is probably around your
feet<00:03:09.459> it's<00:03:10.459> called<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.790> Sport<00:03:11.030> Package

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390

giving<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:11.989> more<00:03:12.380> speed<00:03:12.799> actually<00:03:13.069> but<00:03:13.639> it's

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
giving you more speed actually but it's

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.729 
giving you more speed actually but it's
not<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.269> full<00:03:14.540> performance<00:03:15.170> package<00:03:15.500> with<00:03:15.620> the

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
not a full performance package with the

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.979 
not a full performance package with the
third<00:03:15.920> lock<00:03:16.130> interesting<00:03:16.940> so<00:03:17.630> what<00:03:17.810> are<00:03:17.900> the

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
third lock interesting so what are the

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.379 
third lock interesting so what are the
downsides<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:19.010> using<00:03:19.040> just<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.730> portion<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.239> the

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
downsides to using just a portion of the

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.360 
downsides to using just a portion of the
tube<00:03:20.569> like<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:20.810> it's<00:03:21.260> not<00:03:21.410> a<00:03:21.440> big<00:03:21.650> down<00:03:21.980> but

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
tube like that it's not a big down but

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.920 
tube like that it's not a big down but
it's<00:03:22.519> actually<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.180> cannot<00:03:23.480> have<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.750> same

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
it's actually you cannot have the same

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.559 
it's actually you cannot have the same
horsepower<00:03:24.230> at<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.680> back<00:03:24.920> so<00:03:25.220> 150<00:03:26.030> on<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.209> 23

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
horsepower at the back so 150 on a 23

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.990 
horsepower at the back so 150 on a 23
footer<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.170> maximum<00:03:27.620> horsepower<00:03:28.000> but

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
footer is the maximum horsepower but

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.629 
footer is the maximum horsepower but
reducing<00:03:29.840> your<00:03:29.959> costs<00:03:30.349> now<00:03:31.160> is<00:03:31.459> there

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
reducing your costs now is there

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.129 
reducing your costs now is there
anything<00:03:31.910> else<00:03:32.239> that<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.510> all<00:03:32.599> did<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:32.930> try

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
anything else that you all did to try

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.720 
anything else that you all did to try
and<00:03:33.290> boost<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.680> speed<00:03:33.980> or<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.250> performance

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
and boost the speed or the performance

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.699 
and boost the speed or the performance
of<00:03:34.819> this<00:03:34.880> boat<00:03:35.120> as<00:03:35.480> we<00:03:35.720> spoke<00:03:35.959> earlier<00:03:36.230> about

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
of this boat as we spoke earlier about

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.710 
of this boat as we spoke earlier about
the<00:03:36.980> Sport<00:03:37.370> Package<00:03:37.760> actually<00:03:38.239> you<00:03:38.510> got

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
the Sport Package actually you got

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.870 
the Sport Package actually you got
lifting<00:03:39.079> strakes<00:03:39.380> on<00:03:39.680> each<00:03:39.980> tube<00:03:40.310> in<00:03:40.639> the

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
lifting strakes on each tube in the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.699 
lifting strakes on each tube in the
middle<00:03:40.910> there<00:03:41.389> are<00:03:41.419> full<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.019> but<00:03:42.470> on<00:03:42.620> the

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
middle there are full and but on the

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.610 
middle there are full and but on the
side<00:03:42.919> they're<00:03:43.340> cut<00:03:43.760> maybe<00:03:44.030> halfway<00:03:44.510> of<00:03:45.230> the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
side they're cut maybe halfway of the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.530 
side they're cut maybe halfway of the
two<00:03:45.799> but<00:03:46.069> there's<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.340> reason<00:03:46.700> our<00:03:46.910> R&amp;D

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
two but there's a reason our R&amp;D

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.349 
two but there's a reason our R&amp;D
department<00:03:48.200> did<00:03:48.799> some<00:03:49.040> tests<00:03:49.310> by<00:03:49.730> cutting<00:03:50.120> two

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
department did some tests by cutting two

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.539 
department did some tests by cutting two
inches<00:03:50.780> at<00:03:51.169> a<00:03:51.260> time<00:03:51.590> until<00:03:51.889> they<00:03:52.220> find<00:03:52.430> the

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
inches at a time until they find the

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.120 
inches at a time until they find the
maximum<00:03:53.090> I'll<00:03:53.599> see<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.109> optimal<00:03:54.560> speed<00:03:54.889> for

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
maximum I'll see the optimal speed for

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.400 
maximum I'll see the optimal speed for
that<00:03:55.250> package<00:03:55.630> when<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:56.720> cut<00:03:56.989> through<00:03:57.230> all

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
that package when you cut through all

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.440 
that package when you cut through all
the<00:03:57.530> marketing<00:03:57.980> gobbledygook<00:03:58.700> what<00:03:59.299> do<00:03:59.359> you
