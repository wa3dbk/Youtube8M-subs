let me put it this way there's a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.260 
let me put it this way there's a
compartment<00:01:46.799> where<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> hard<00:01:47.970> drive

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
compartment where the hard drive

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.560 
compartment where the hard drive
actually<00:01:48.540> goes<00:01:48.990> okay<00:01:49.950> beyond<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
actually goes okay beyond that is a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.410 
actually goes okay beyond that is a
space<00:01:52.049> now<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.310> don't<00:01:53.490> want<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.909> let

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
space now what you don't want to do let

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.539 
space now what you don't want to do let
me<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.720> do<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.500> first<00:01:55.740> here's<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:56.219> hard

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
me just do this first here's my hard

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730 
me just do this first here's my hard
drive<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.810> course<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.200> missing<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> tab

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
drive and of course it's missing the tab

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.160 
drive and of course it's missing the tab
I'm<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.969> drop<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> compartment

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
I'm going to drop it in the compartment

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.700 
I'm going to drop it in the compartment
where<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.070> supposed<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.520> go<00:02:03.439> okay<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.590> then

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
where it's supposed to go okay and then

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.749 
where it's supposed to go okay and then
you<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:04.829> heard<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> click

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
you just heard the click

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.330 
you just heard the click
that's<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> locking<00:02:06.719> mechanism<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:08.069> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that's the locking mechanism and that is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040 
that's the locking mechanism and that is
what's<00:02:08.759> going<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.030> give<00:02:09.209> everybody<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.899> most

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
what's going to give everybody the most

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.660 
what's going to give everybody the most
trouble<00:02:10.500> trying<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> get<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.250> thing<00:02:11.310> out<00:02:11.640> of

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
trouble trying to get this thing out of

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.370 
trouble trying to get this thing out of
here

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
here

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.950 
here
so<00:02:12.560> if<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.640> look<00:02:13.790> at<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> normal<00:02:14.120> hard<00:02:14.690> drive

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
so if you look at a normal hard drive

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.950 
so if you look at a normal hard drive
I've<00:02:15.290> got<00:02:15.470> another<00:02:15.710> one<00:02:15.890> here<00:02:16.070> at<00:02:16.190> 320<00:02:16.960> but

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
I've got another one here at 320 but

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.570 
I've got another one here at 320 but
anyway<00:02:18.230> if<00:02:18.320> you<00:02:18.380> look<00:02:18.530> at<00:02:18.710> it<00:02:18.860> you'll<00:02:19.370> notice

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
anyway if you look at it you'll notice

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.670 
anyway if you look at it you'll notice
you'll<00:02:19.940> see<00:02:20.120> where<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.420> locking<00:02:20.810> mechanism

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
you'll see where the locking mechanism

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.010 
you'll see where the locking mechanism
is<00:02:21.830> when<00:02:22.820> isolated<00:02:23.270> in<00:02:23.390> there<00:02:23.570> that's<00:02:23.810> where

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
is when isolated in there that's where

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.290 
is when isolated in there that's where
it<00:02:24.110> locks<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.680> now<00:02:25.340> that's<00:02:25.790> what<00:02:26.060> gives

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
it locks and now that's what gives

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.270 
it locks and now that's what gives
everybody<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.780> most<00:02:27.020> problem<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:28.010> course

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
everybody the most problem and of course

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.630 
everybody the most problem and of course
that's<00:02:28.940> what<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.330> tab<00:02:29.570> is<00:02:29.840> used<00:02:30.080> for<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.770> to

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
that's what the tab is used for is to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.740 
that's what the tab is used for is to
get<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:33.190> locking<00:02:34.190> mechanism<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.880> release<00:02:35.360> and

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
get the locking mechanism to release and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.410 
get the locking mechanism to release and
of<00:02:36.530> course<00:02:36.770> if<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.100> don't<00:02:37.340> have<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:38.120> tab

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
of course if you don't have that tab

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.900 
of course if you don't have that tab
then<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.590> what<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:39.860> looks<00:02:40.070> like<00:02:40.280> inside

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
then this is what it looks like inside

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.810 
then this is what it looks like inside
your<00:02:41.180> xbox<00:02:41.660> 360<00:02:41.990> slim<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.890> that's<00:02:43.400> why<00:02:43.640> it's

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
your xbox 360 slim and that's why it's

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.640 
your xbox 360 slim and that's why it's
not<00:02:43.940> coming<00:02:44.150> out<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:44.900> that's<00:02:45.140> what<00:02:45.290> we<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.530> to

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
not coming out so that's what we have to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.460 
not coming out so that's what we have to
get<00:02:45.770> past<00:02:46.040> now<00:02:46.970> again<00:02:47.570> this<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.260> where<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
get past now again this is where the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.140 
get past now again this is where the
butter<00:02:48.650> knife<00:02:48.830> comes<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.280> you'll<00:02:49.880> want<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.090> use

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
butter knife comes in you'll want to use

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.790 
butter knife comes in you'll want to use
this<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.780> I'm<00:02:50.840> going<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.110> use<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.620> edge

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
this and I'm going to use the edge

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.500 
this and I'm going to use the edge
without<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.520> blades<00:02:52.790> on<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.090> because

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
without the blades on it because

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.870 
without the blades on it because
obviously<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:54.440> don't<00:02:55.040> want<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.460> you<00:02:55.610> don't<00:02:55.700> want

hard drive or the Xbox itself as long as
you're<00:03:04.970> pretty<00:03:05.180> gentle<00:03:05.420> with<00:03:05.660> everything<00:03:06.110> and

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
is the way I'm going to be so it might

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.630 
is the way I'm going to be so it might
take<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.690> video<00:03:11.900> slightly<00:03:12.380> longer<00:03:12.770> but

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
take the video slightly longer but

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.060 
take the video slightly longer but
nothing<00:03:14.390> should<00:03:14.540> be<00:03:14.600> damaged<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:15.350> is<00:03:15.410> you

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070

nothing should be damaged this is you
know<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:16.310> should<00:03:16.430> be<00:03:16.550> a<00:03:16.580> very<00:03:16.880> easy<00:03:17.150> process

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
know this should be a very easy process

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.660 
know this should be a very easy process
if<00:03:18.140> you're<00:03:18.620> pretty<00:03:18.830> gentle<00:03:19.100> with<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.340> now<00:03:19.520> what

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.480 
there so I can use both hands and just
show<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.170> exactly<00:03:24.470> what<00:03:24.740> I<00:03:24.770> do<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.280> might

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
show you exactly what I do and it might

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.880 
show you exactly what I do and it might
take<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.730> few<00:03:25.820> tries<00:03:26.150> but<00:03:26.410> it<00:03:27.410> should<00:03:27.590> be<00:03:27.710> pretty

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
take a few tries but it should be pretty

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.640 
take a few tries but it should be pretty
simple<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.960> hopefully<00:03:29.960> it'll<00:03:30.140> be<00:03:30.500> able<00:03:30.560> to

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
simple and hopefully it'll be able to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.260 
simple and hopefully it'll be able to
give<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:30.950> little<00:03:31.070> success<00:03:31.280> getting<00:03:32.120> your

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
give you a little success getting your

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.720 
give you a little success getting your
hard<00:03:32.420> drive<00:03:32.660> out<00:03:32.870> if<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.410> need<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:33.860> or<00:03:34.220> if<00:03:34.250> it's

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
hard drive out if you need to or if it's

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.190 
hard drive out if you need to or if it's
stuck<00:03:34.940> in<00:03:35.090> there<00:03:35.240> and<00:03:35.270> you<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.810> need<00:03:35.960> some

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
stuck in there and you you need some

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.250 
stuck in there and you you need some
some<00:03:36.590> way<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.740> get<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:36.980> back<00:03:37.100> out<00:03:38.170> let<00:03:39.170> me<00:03:39.200> put

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
some way to get it back out let me put

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.070 
some way to get it back out let me put
my<00:03:39.440> camera<00:03:39.710> back<00:03:40.570> all<00:03:41.570> right<00:03:43.720> we're<00:03:44.720> gonna<00:03:44.840> do

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
my camera back all right we're gonna do

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.890 
my camera back all right we're gonna do
again<00:03:45.590> we<00:03:46.190> need<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.610> get<00:03:46.820> to<00:03:47.209> where<00:03:47.420> the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
again we need to get to where the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.970 
again we need to get to where the
locking<00:03:48.459> mechanism<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.730> inside<00:03:50.540> here<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.620> I

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
locking mechanism is inside here so I

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.860 
locking mechanism is inside here so I
was<00:03:52.400> telling<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:52.760> earlier<00:03:52.820> that<00:03:53.360> you'll<00:03:53.690> see

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
was telling you earlier that you'll see

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.920 
was telling you earlier that you'll see
two<00:03:54.590> two<00:03:55.280> open<00:03:55.640> spots<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:56.270> you're<00:03:56.450> gonna<00:03:56.630> want

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
two two open spots but you're gonna want

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.590 
two two open spots but you're gonna want
to<00:03:57.020> get<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.530> one<00:03:57.650> that's<00:03:57.950> closest<00:03:58.610> to<00:03:58.640> the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
to get to the one that's closest to the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.720 
to get to the one that's closest to the
hard<00:03:59.870> drive<00:04:00.050> okay<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.130> what<00:04:01.430> we're<00:04:01.550> going<00:04:01.700> to

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
hard drive okay so what we're going to

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.350 
hard drive okay so what we're going to
do<00:04:01.910> is<00:04:02.209> take<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.600> butter<00:04:02.810> knife<00:04:03.050> and<00:04:03.290> slide<00:04:04.130> it

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
do is take the butter knife and slide it

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.980 
do is take the butter knife and slide it
right<00:04:05.360> there

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
right there

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.830 
right there
now<00:04:06.950> obviously<00:04:07.550> again<00:04:08.300> just<00:04:08.570> to<00:04:08.690> re-emphasize

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
now obviously again just to re-emphasize

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.160 
now obviously again just to re-emphasize
the<00:04:09.680> locking<00:04:10.010> mechanism<00:04:10.610> if<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:11.180> push<00:04:11.420> the

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
the locking mechanism if I push the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.470 
the locking mechanism if I push the
knife<00:04:12.320> further<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.310> left<00:04:13.520> which<00:04:14.180> is<00:04:14.360> the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
knife further to the left which is the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.970 
knife further to the left which is the
direction<00:04:14.660> I've<00:04:14.959> chosen<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:15.440> go<00:04:15.560> you<00:04:15.740> can<00:04:15.890> do

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
direction I've chosen to go you can do

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.920 
direction I've chosen to go you can do
this<00:04:16.130> from<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.340> from<00:04:17.150> left<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:17.450> right<00:04:17.690> or

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
this from the from left to right or

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.000 
this from the from left to right or
right<00:04:18.170> to<00:04:18.200> left<00:04:18.350> it<00:04:18.590> doesn't<00:04:18.770> make<00:04:18.859> any

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
right to left it doesn't make any

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.449 
right to left it doesn't make any
difference<00:04:19.100> but

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
difference but

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.710 
difference but
obviously<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.120> won't<00:04:21.299> go<00:04:21.449> any<00:04:21.630> further

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
obviously it won't go any further

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.390 
obviously it won't go any further
because<00:04:22.139> that's<00:04:22.770> where<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.070> locking

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
because that's where the locking

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.060 
because that's where the locking
mechanism<00:04:23.940> is<00:04:24.090> so<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.290> idea<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.800> what<00:04:25.949> we're

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
mechanism is so the idea of what we're

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.150 
mechanism is so the idea of what we're
trying<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.400> do<00:04:26.580> here<00:04:26.940> is<00:04:27.800> get<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.830> butter

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
trying to do here is get the butter

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.260 
trying to do here is get the butter
knife<00:04:29.400> right<00:04:30.090> there<00:04:30.120> close<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.229> a<00:04:31.259> plumber<00:04:31.590> and

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
knife right there close to a plumber and

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.170 
knife right there close to a plumber and
then<00:04:33.270> we're<00:04:33.449> able<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.960> slide<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.830> up<00:04:35.039> or<00:04:35.729> it'll

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
then we're able to slide it up or it'll

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.850 
then we're able to slide it up or it'll
look<00:04:36.210> more<00:04:36.449> I<00:04:36.780> guess<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.110> can<00:04:37.229> go<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.440> angle

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
look more I guess you can go to angle

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.310 
look more I guess you can go to angle
the<00:04:37.979> better<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.430> angle<00:04:38.789> or<00:04:39.419> angle<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:40.110> use

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
the better the angle or angle you use

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.400 
the better the angle or angle you use
probably<00:04:40.650> better<00:04:40.919> but<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.090> idea<00:04:42.449> is<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:43.020> be

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
probably better but the idea is to be

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.050 
probably better but the idea is to be
able<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.740> get<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.039> close<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.580> bottom<00:04:44.910> so

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
able to get it close to the bottom so

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.580 
able to get it close to the bottom so
that<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.479> can<00:04:45.630> then<00:04:45.810> get<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.139> knife<00:04:46.320> in<00:04:46.560> the

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
that you can then get the knife in the

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.360 
that you can then get the knife in the
middle<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.630> hence<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.930> knife<00:04:49.380> is<00:04:49.590> acting<00:04:50.100> as

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
middle and hence the knife is acting as

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.219 
middle and hence the knife is acting as
the<00:04:50.610> tab<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.240> then<00:04:51.750> you're<00:04:51.870> just<00:04:52.020> going<00:04:52.199> to

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
the tab and then you're just going to

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.600 
the tab and then you're just going to
leave<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.560> there<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:52.919> then<00:04:53.130> that's<00:04:53.310> when

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
leave it there and then that's when

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.650 
leave it there and then that's when
you're<00:04:53.729> going<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.880> pull<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.120> hard<00:04:54.419> drive<00:04:54.630> out

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
you're going to pull the hard drive out

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.760 
you're going to pull the hard drive out
so<00:04:55.500> again<00:04:55.800> when<00:04:56.699> you<00:04:56.789> go<00:04:56.940> in<00:04:57.120> to<00:04:57.539> the<00:04:57.690> Xbox<00:04:57.930> the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
so again when you go in to the Xbox the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.340 
so again when you go in to the Xbox the
idea<00:04:59.220> is<00:04:59.669> to<00:04:59.820> get<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.090> butter<00:05:00.300> knife<00:05:00.510> close<00:05:01.080> to

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
idea is to get the butter knife close to

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.590 
idea is to get the butter knife close to
the<00:05:01.470> minotaur<00:05:01.830> close<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.370> edge<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:02.970> that

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
the minotaur close to the edge so that

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.590 
the minotaur close to the edge so that
you<00:05:04.560> can<00:05:04.740> then<00:05:04.889> slide<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.520> knife<00:05:05.669> up<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.479> know

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
you can then slide the knife up you know

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.750 
you can then slide the knife up you know
the<00:05:06.810> hard<00:05:06.990> drive<00:05:07.260> looking<00:05:07.560> at<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:07.889> the<00:05:08.340> locking

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
the hard drive looking at it the locking

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.240 
the hard drive looking at it the locking
mechanism<00:05:09.330> goes<00:05:09.510> from<00:05:09.780> you<00:05:10.440> know<00:05:10.530> far<00:05:10.830> out<00:05:11.039> and

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
mechanism goes from you know far out and

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.779 
mechanism goes from you know far out and
then<00:05:11.880> slants<00:05:12.479> as<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.289> goes<00:05:13.440> down<00:05:13.770> further<00:05:14.070> so

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
then slants as it goes down further so

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.129 
then slants as it goes down further so
that's<00:05:15.060> why<00:05:15.240> we<00:05:15.389> want<00:05:15.570> to<00:05:15.660> get<00:05:15.780> it<00:05:15.870> right<00:05:16.020> at

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
that's why we want to get it right at

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.499 
that's why we want to get it right at
that<00:05:16.229> age<00:05:16.380> so<00:05:16.560> let's<00:05:16.830> try<00:05:17.010> that<00:05:17.039> again<00:05:17.520> make

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
that age so let's try that again make

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.550 
that age so let's try that again make
sure<00:05:18.539> you<00:05:18.810> have<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.229> in<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.560> right<00:05:21.470> you<00:05:22.470> know

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
sure you have it in the right you know

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.050 
sure you have it in the right you know
there's<00:05:22.800> two<00:05:22.949> spaces<00:05:23.250> so<00:05:23.610> make<00:05:23.789> sure<00:05:23.820> you

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
there's two spaces so make sure you

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.879 
there's two spaces so make sure you
happen<00:05:24.330> in<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:24.510> right<00:05:24.660> space<00:05:24.930> again<00:05:25.710> it's

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
happen in the right space again it's

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.170 
happen in the right space again it's
obviously<00:05:26.340> going<00:05:26.580> to<00:05:26.669> be<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:26.880> one<00:05:27.060> that's

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
obviously going to be the one that's

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.750 
obviously going to be the one that's
closest<00:05:27.780> to<00:05:27.900> that<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.470> hard<00:05:28.680> drive<00:05:28.979> so

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
closest to that to the hard drive so

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.969 
closest to that to the hard drive so
once<00:05:30.300> you<00:05:30.449> have<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.750> have<00:05:31.380> your<00:05:31.530> knife<00:05:31.680> there

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
once you have to have your knife there

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.520 
once you have to have your knife there
then<00:05:32.789> just<00:05:33.000> look<00:05:33.150> for<00:05:33.270> that<00:05:33.300> corner<00:05:33.750> you<00:05:34.410> might

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
then just look for that corner you might

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.930 
then just look for that corner you might
have<00:05:34.680> to<00:05:34.800> get<00:05:34.889> your<00:05:35.039> knife<00:05:35.190> down<00:05:35.430> pretty<00:05:35.699> far

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
have to get your knife down pretty far

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.110 
have to get your knife down pretty far
like<00:05:36.659> I<00:05:36.750> said<00:05:36.930> going<00:05:37.169> is<00:05:37.409> as<00:05:37.740> much<00:05:38.010> of<00:05:38.490> an<00:05:38.699> angle

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
like I said going is as much of an angle

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.390 
like I said going is as much of an angle
as<00:05:39.510> possible<00:05:40.139> would<00:05:40.409> be<00:05:40.500> good<00:05:40.710> now<00:05:41.130> see<00:05:41.310> I've

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
as possible would be good now see I've

okay I've just made it now you can see
it's<00:06:11.940> right<00:06:12.120> in<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.330> center<00:06:12.360> there<00:06:12.630> that's

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
it's right in the center there that's

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.260 
it's right in the center there that's
exactly<00:06:13.169> where<00:06:13.650> I<00:06:13.680> need<00:06:13.889> it<00:06:13.919> to<00:06:14.010> be<00:06:14.250> and<00:06:14.550> then

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
exactly where I need it to be and then

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.800 
exactly where I need it to be and then
I'm<00:06:15.360> gonna<00:06:15.630> use<00:06:15.810> the<00:06:16.080> hook<00:06:16.460> here<00:06:17.659> to<00:06:18.659> damn

I'm gonna use the hook here to damn
place<00:06:19.110> where<00:06:19.440> the<00:06:19.530> tap<00:06:19.770> would<00:06:20.039> normally<00:06:20.460> be

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
place where the tap would normally be

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.270 
place where the tap would normally be
all<00:06:21.690> you<00:06:21.780> have<00:06:21.900> to<00:06:21.990> do<00:06:22.110> is<00:06:22.229> you<00:06:22.530> know<00:06:22.650> hook<00:06:22.860> get

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
all you have to do is you know hook get

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.529 
all you have to do is you know hook get
it<00:06:23.370> somewhere<00:06:23.699> good<00:06:24.110> and<00:06:25.110> pull<00:06:25.409> up<00:06:26.360> and<00:06:27.360> that's

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
it somewhere good and pull up and that's

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.680 
it somewhere good and pull up and that's
it<00:06:28.370> and<00:06:29.370> this<00:06:29.550> is<00:06:29.760> essentially<00:06:30.270> what<00:06:30.389> it<00:06:30.510> looks

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
it and this is essentially what it looks

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.130 
it and this is essentially what it looks
like<00:06:31.039> right<00:06:32.039> here

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
like right here

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.780 
like right here
and<00:06:33.230> you<00:06:33.530> should<00:06:33.710> better<00:06:33.890> remove<00:06:34.220> your<00:06:34.400> drive
