I mean we can they be giving away about

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.200 
I mean we can they be giving away about
a<00:03:31.830> stone<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> half<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:33.540> pull<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.650> weight

but at the end of the day it's all about

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.130 
but at the end of the day it's all about
having<00:03:38.370> her<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.000> that's<00:03:39.210> one<00:03:39.390> thing<00:03:39.570> I'm<00:03:39.720> not
