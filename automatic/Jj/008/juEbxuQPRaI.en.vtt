00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.240
 values ​​that if we go with the video but 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.650
 first of all let's make a small 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.029
 introduction of what will be the 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.500
 responsible for the map because at last and 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.059
 out is going to be around which is going to 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.769
 rotate the whole theme of the video worth 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.299
 let's live the map first in 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.590
 two teams the blue team that we see 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.970
 that has a backing in the area of 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.470
 our house in the area where we would have 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.000
 the flag and other support in the area 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.740
 Bunkers is worth where you see on the map and 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.240
 look then the red team will have the 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.130
 backup in the area called loading and 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.570
 another secondary response in the area 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.730
 left of what would be the dome 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.230
 let's play with a tactical creatine 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.090
 in the case of both teams both in 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.320
 the blue team as in the red team 2 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.270
 2 2 sms and 2 a are smg objective in the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.820
 case of blue team and lmg support go to 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.379
 attack together always recommendation by 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.360
 the loading area in it 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.710
 direction and the defensive area of 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.180
 while if it is going to be behind 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.710
 defending the area of ​​our base 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.899
 especially the area on the left in the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.309
 If our mjes fall, the 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.960
 slider is going to stay in this area 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.340
 because we see that it has many areas that 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.899
 cover on this map is a very position 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.200
 difficult and victory or defeat 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.790
 It depends a lot on this player's worth 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.050
 in the cheese the red team are going to do 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.730
 exactly the same in the direction 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.290
 contrary to the smg object and the support 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.760
 they are going to attack through the hallway area 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.130
 always together is a recommendation that 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.900
 I give the defensive air will defend with 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.610
 difficulties and with great skill of the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.530
 Loading area and air slayer 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.210
 let's put here for let's say 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.210
 control the area of responds bunkers 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.510
 good good after this concept and 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.340
 brutal and so immense of information that 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.380
 surely very few will have 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.810
 got assimilated to the full let's 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.340
 realize that information so in 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.840
 first person let's say so it turns out 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.670
 a little more lucrative and understandable 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.680
 let's look with the middle and active pse 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.450
 than to realize this movement thanks to 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.460
 the action of each screen terna what 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.259
 we are going to get is to surround and end 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.030
 Enemies ride more easily 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.530
 because now you're going to see it in a 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.290
 screen from the center of view more 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.790
 target you will see because grenade 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.730
 smoke it is highly recommended to use the grenade 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.590
 one just because 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.120
 I explain myself throwing the smoke grenade what 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.370
 what we get in the first place is to create 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.810
 a smoke screen evidently what 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.030
 what he's going to do is make the vision difficult 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.770
 nothing to our enemy not to fail always 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.940
 it is placed there is a defensive one and in addition 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.190
 creating that grenade what we're going to 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.740
 to get is to blow up the barrels 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.970
 that is behind and harm the enemy that is 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.640
 has been left behind lying down behind 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.350
 a table behind the barrels what 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.000
 it's worth we 'll be able to finish it 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.280
 let's see the support I usually do 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.690
 accompanied by the jeeps and you remember going 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.340
 to perform exactly the same 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.380
 movement pulling the shocked the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.880
 ideas on dex on the same side so it will be 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.220
 enemy is a bit touched we're going 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.230
 to finish safely and the two between the two 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.760
 We will announce the maximally 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.310
 that are here in liabilities that are here 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.600
 in the opposite base and we will help the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.860
 target in the event they kill him 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.990
 we will take the flag 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.700
 we will take back the defensive what 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.320
 going to do is first had essential and 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.520
 long players two shocked hours 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.980
 sorry that the creators are not 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.330
 allowed inside the tom because what 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.650
 is going to allow that is to blow us up 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.960
 the barrels in there that we do not 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.060
 It is convenient to have them there because they can 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.020
 they can determine a game I say 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.400
 because it has happened to me and late or 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.050
 early with those shocked to 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.410
 to exploit we are going to do them as you are 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.780
 watching on the screen is 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.630
 there are two ways to do it with 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.890
 movements or two more remain static 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.780
 It depends on your style of play as 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.740
 you feel more comfortable there are many people who 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.360
 what it does is stay up there 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.290
 Walkways I do not recommend it at all 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.970
 because you are very vulnerable here 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.910
 using the nooks and crannies that they offer you 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.420
 these boxes that's why it's called loading 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.470
 these cargoes that slayer here 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.390
 what he's going to do is come here like 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.370
 you see there is no grill thanks to the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.990
 defense and we have exploited them all and what 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.940
 what he's going to do is come here 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.970
 let's wait here a little 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.220
 let's stay a bit let's say 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.810
 waiting for them to come if nobody comes 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.990
 and if we see someone go through what we're going 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.400
 to do is run out and look 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.840
 by corridor always places 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.000
 someone if I say that right by principal 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.560
 will be down the hall and we should do them 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.210
 is to stay here the rest of the game 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.650
 because because here we are going to be able to 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.120
 control several zones first 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.770
 we will be able to control control the 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.020
 main door and support our 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.300
 team we will be able to 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.530
 control aisle as you have seen and in 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.360
 the case that we have the flag 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.340
 immediately the opposite team bars 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.840
 faune ar inside those bunkers like 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.280
 you have seen at the beginning of the video that 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.440
 we can do is prevent them from being made 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.880
 just answer us we charge ourselves 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.549
 escapes some no problem that we saw 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.020
 over there and we can also finish this 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.700
 player I would put your player with 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.870
 more skill here because really 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.700
 it's a position that requires a lot 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.410
 skill and it's essential to victory or 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.940
 the defeat depends a lot on this player 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.550
 It obviously depends on everyone but 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.560
 especially this is the projectile what 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.190
 what he's going to do is attack in this area 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.080
 of hallway and let's throw sentence 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.940
 excited now I know that I do for this 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.800
 What we are going to do is create a 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.540
 blinding smoke screen to 11 sorry the 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.130
 objective always recommendation to carry 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.900
 smoke and what we are going to do is create a 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.610
 smoke screen that will serve us 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.680
 for two things two options we have a 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.430
 and is the one that I made to protect ourselves thanks 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.590
 to the smoke 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.569
 points that is to use it as a decoy for 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.089
 that the enemies somehow 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.409
 are somehow attentive to that 

00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:00.689
 part of the smoke go to the right and 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.610
 pianos surprise foolish enemies and 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.809
 not so stupid enemies so I 'm preening 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.069
 a little bit of luck and skill 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:07.199
 of the enemies depends how you see that 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.520
 situation or you come inside the screen 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.990
 of smoke or we simply go for the 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.669
 right or whatever you want or come to 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.219
 support here and 8 x on the other 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.360
 side is worth a bit trying 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:17.219
 coordinate a bit between you 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.719
 we just come here if we 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:20.159
 we continue charging the enemies what 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.529
 what we are going to do is go back exactly 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.270
 same side looking forward never towards 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.589
 back and coming here you see what 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.999
 important that is the smoke grenade in 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:28.979
 the objective I recommend a button 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.209
 it really works a lot what we're going to 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.039
 to do is to come so that we take the 

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:34.139
 flag 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.939
 private seems very easy not for the 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.139
 software I love you what will you do going to 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.939
 coming here is going to perform exactly 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.430
 the same movement is worth the function of 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:43.740
 Support is very key is very essential and 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.479
 very simple let's do let's come 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.769
 here accompanied by the objective and 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.539
 remember that we will have the screen of 

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:50.309
 very out there on the other side and what 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.289
 we will do is to come by this side and finish 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:53.819
 of trying to surprise the enemies and 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.519
 we try to charge the enemies that 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:58.379
 we have here trying to load us 

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:59.520
 the us before before they kill 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.349
 our goal 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.849
 and well, if you kill them, you take the 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.530
 flag and you take it sofía del campo 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.120
 see is stand function better in 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.470
 the case that the target catches it 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.599
 what you are going to have to do is come by 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.830
 this area and cover directly 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.599
 you count towards there towards highway 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.000
 because whenever you take them by 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.740
 here usually come from that side it's worth 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.569
 because they support the other side as 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.129
 you have seen defensive art what is going 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.270
 to do is a saying at the beginning of 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.830
 video stay that behind these 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.150
 barrels behind this table behind 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.060
 this desk 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.379
 it is a position that requires little 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.699
 movement but as you wish you can 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:31.190
 go moving so they spy with less 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.140
 ease 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.250
 Stay tuned because they can exploit the 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.300
 barrels as you have seen at the beginning 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.470
 of the video 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.030
 and now I'm going to explain what is 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.440
 this blinding and you feel that it seems 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.270
 useless but actually it is not 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.830
 you can not give us a bit of advance 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.320
 as you want it is worth that depends on 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.910
 yourselves of your style of faith 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.250
 let's see why did these 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.630
 stuck as you see here if I am a 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.280
 enemy that comes to Russia and comes by 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.900
 here you see it's very hard to see me 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.310
 forget the imaginary letters that do not 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.990
 are the letters because it would be very very 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.340
 difficult to see me and more me because now 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.690
 himself was not very lying on the floor 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.310
 but we imagine that I'm lying there 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.450
 with that you see my head is very 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.640
 difficult to really end the 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.830
 enemies the shocked fabrics and 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.390
 centex were essential we see these 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.280
 researchers and you are in dex because they are 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.360
 very important there are times that the area of 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.950
 putty from the front that is placed behind 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.180
 of this wall covering the area of passion 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.010
 and thanks to these in tics that will go 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.230
 directly to that area we will be able to 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.430
 finish the enemy the air slayer goes 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.340
 to do exactly the same as the other 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.920
 that in the other team but in this area 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.210
 ok we will be able to control the rest 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.100
 that is there the first thing we're going to 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.780
 to just go out is to throw the sinners 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.920
 just over the change and we're going to 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.050
 blow up the barrels there 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.640
 inside in case some defensive within 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.320
 the dome pointing there we're going to 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.260
 control the rest in the event that 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.210
 answer and a very useful trick is that 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.520
 your team to take the next flag 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.200
 the flag on the charge side mind you 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.420
 usually do respond to enemies 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.490
 on this side and the slayer air that 

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.950
 charge to control the respado so 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.690
 that will continue 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.160
 just take one more easily 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.930
 and so we will have several areas that 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.910
 had the monier zones in case 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:03.080
 they count the areas of putty and good 

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.080
 partner all but that you like the video
