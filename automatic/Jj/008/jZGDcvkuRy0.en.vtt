00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
we touch this is it's going to load a

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.509 
we touch this is it's going to load a
pop-up<00:00:52.910> class<00:00:53.800> which<00:00:54.800> will<00:00:55.070> stay<00:00:55.280> on<00:00:55.309> the

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
pop-up class which will stay on the

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.930 
pop-up class which will stay on the
screen<00:00:55.820> during<00:00:56.629> a<00:00:56.929> loading<00:00:57.469> function<00:00:57.940> when

screen during a loading function when

screen during a loading function when
the<00:00:59.120> function<00:00:59.510> has<00:00:59.690> completed<00:01:00.079> then<00:01:00.769> it<00:01:01.129> will

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
the function has completed then it will

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.939 
the function has completed then it will
automatically<00:01:01.789> call<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:03.379> exit<00:01:03.739> for<00:01:03.859> the

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
automatically call the exit for the

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.920 
automatically call the exit for the
pop-up<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:04.400> dismiss<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:06.050> if<00:01:06.620> I<00:01:06.830> touch<00:01:07.070> here

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
pop-up and dismiss it so if I touch here

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.720 
pop-up and dismiss it so if I touch here
you'll<00:01:08.930> notice<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.230> pop-up<00:01:09.560> has<00:01:09.770> come<00:01:09.950> up<00:01:10.100> and

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
you'll notice the pop-up has come up and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.330 
you'll notice the pop-up has come up and
when<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.390> loading<00:01:11.840> is<00:01:11.930> completed<00:01:12.290> then<00:01:12.650> it

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
when the loading is completed then it

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.100 
when the loading is completed then it
dismisses<00:01:13.700> itself<00:01:14.150> now<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:14.900> particular

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
dismisses itself now in this particular

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.350 
dismisses itself now in this particular
case<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.920> loading<00:01:16.340> is<00:01:16.400> just<00:01:16.610> a<00:01:16.700> stub<00:01:16.910> function

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
case the loading is just a stub function

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.870 
case the loading is just a stub function
because<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.050> scene<00:01:19.040> actually<00:01:19.370> loads<00:01:19.700> very

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
because the scene actually loads very

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.760 
because the scene actually loads very
quickly<00:01:20.150> but<00:01:20.690> you<00:01:20.810> could<00:01:20.960> let<00:01:21.170> use<00:01:21.410> this<00:01:21.590> to

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
quickly but you could let use this to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.000 
quickly but you could let use this to
load<00:01:21.980> other<00:01:22.970> resources<00:01:23.480> while<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.680> loading

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
load other resources while the loading

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.230 
load other resources while the loading
screen<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.430> displayed<00:01:26.020> now<00:01:27.020> in<00:01:27.350> this<00:01:27.890> scene<00:01:28.700> we

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
screen is displayed now in this scene we

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.600 
screen is displayed now in this scene we
have<00:01:29.480> several<00:01:30.380> objects<00:01:30.860> we<00:01:30.980> have<00:01:31.160> a<00:01:33.610> three

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
have several objects we have a three

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.680 
have several objects we have a three
animals<00:01:34.910> and<00:01:35.530> each<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.800> them<00:01:37.010> can<00:01:37.940> our<00:01:38.270> buttons

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
animals and each of them can our buttons

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.410 
animals and each of them can our buttons
which<00:01:39.350> can<00:01:39.590> be<00:01:39.710> used<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.040> bring<00:01:40.220> up<00:01:40.430> another

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
which can be used to bring up another

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.050 
which can be used to bring up another
pop-up<00:01:41.840> describing<00:01:42.560> what<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.830> object<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.310> so

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
pop-up describing what the object is so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.670 
pop-up describing what the object is so
in<00:01:44.690> this<00:01:44.780> particular<00:01:44.930> case<00:01:45.350> we<00:01:45.560> don't

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
in this particular case we don't

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.190 
in this particular case we don't
automatically<00:01:46.520> execute<00:01:46.940> a<00:01:47.030> function<00:01:47.420> but<00:01:48.020> we

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
automatically execute a function but we

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.690 
automatically execute a function but we
call<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.950> particular<00:01:49.340> pop-up<00:01:50.000> class<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.170> if<00:01:52.160> I

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
call a particular pop-up class and if I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.290 
call a particular pop-up class and if I
click<00:01:52.760> on<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.600> bear<00:01:53.780> here<00:01:55.180> you'll<00:01:56.180> notice

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
click on the bear here you'll notice

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.770 
click on the bear here you'll notice
that<00:01:56.510> a<00:01:56.990> pop-up<00:01:57.890> class<00:01:58.220> called<00:01:58.760> animal<00:01:59.450> pop-up

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
that a pop-up class called animal pop-up

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.700 
that a pop-up class called animal pop-up
will<00:02:00.050> appear<00:02:00.220> with<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.250> description<00:02:01.550> of<00:02:01.970> the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
will appear with a description of the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.690 
will appear with a description of the
particular<00:02:03.710> animal<00:02:04.010> now<00:02:04.220> we've<00:02:04.370> written<00:02:04.520> this

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
particular animal now we've written this

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.109 
particular animal now we've written this
class<00:02:05.000> as<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.330> subclass<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.140> bh<00:02:06.890> pop<00:02:07.160> up<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.000> we

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
class as a subclass of bh pop up so we

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.089 
class as a subclass of bh pop up so we
can<00:02:08.209> do<00:02:08.330> whatever<00:02:08.509> we<00:02:08.690> like<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.200> but<00:02:09.920> you'll

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
can do whatever we like in it but you'll

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.940 
can do whatever we like in it but you'll
notice<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.959> pop-up<00:02:12.290> acts<00:02:12.470> as<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> shield

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
notice that the pop-up acts as a shield

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.590 
notice that the pop-up acts as a shield
so<00:02:13.460> all<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:15.470> background<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.600> not

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
so all the the background is not

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.230 
so all the the background is not
touchable

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
touchable

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.160 
touchable
and<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:20.340> only<00:02:20.550> when<00:02:20.700> we<00:02:20.880> choose<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.690> dismiss

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
and it's only when we choose to dismiss

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.500 
and it's only when we choose to dismiss
the<00:02:22.320> pop-up<00:02:22.650> does<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.460> background<00:02:24.300> seen

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
the pop-up does the background seen

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.580 
the pop-up does the background seen
become<00:02:24.900> reenabled<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:27.390> there<00:02:28.230> you'll<00:02:28.380> see

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
become reenabled and there you'll see

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.870 
become reenabled and there you'll see
that

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
that

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.350 
that
we<00:02:30.390> touch<00:02:30.600> here

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.050 

and<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.410> that's<00:02:36.560> basically<00:02:36.710> it<00:02:37.010> that's<00:02:37.310> that's

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
and so that's basically it that's that's

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.300 
and so that's basically it that's that's
how<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.300> use<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.900> transitions<00:02:39.440> on<00:02:40.040> and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
how you use it the transitions on and

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.860 
how you use it the transitions on and
off<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.610> screen<00:02:40.700> are<00:02:41.120> very<00:02:41.420> similar<00:02:41.840> to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
off of the screen are very similar to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.620 
off of the screen are very similar to
the<00:02:42.050> way<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.530> scene<00:02:42.770> manager<00:02:43.220> works<00:02:43.630> you

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
the way the scene manager works you

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.180 
the way the scene manager works you
basically<00:02:44.960> provide<00:02:45.320> a<00:02:45.350> named<00:02:45.680> function

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
basically provide a named function

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.450 
basically provide a named function
inside<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.090> bh<00:02:47.750> pop-up<00:02:48.110> class<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:49.100> describe

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
inside the bh pop-up class to describe

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.490 
inside the bh pop-up class to describe
the<00:02:49.610> transition<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.720> does<00:02:50.900> try<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.140> make<00:02:51.380> an

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
the transition it does try to make an

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.310 
the transition it does try to make an
intelligent<00:02:51.770> choice<00:02:52.340> about<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.170> entry<00:02:54.170> and

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
intelligent choice about the entry and

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.500 
intelligent choice about the entry and
exit<00:02:54.590> transitions<00:02:55.130> if<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.790> only<00:02:55.940> supply<00:02:56.300> an

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
exit transitions if you only supply an

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.540 
exit transitions if you only supply an
entry<00:02:56.840> transition<00:02:57.380> then<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.340> will

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
entry transition then it will

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.980 
entry transition then it will
automatically<00:02:59.150> try<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.600> supply<00:02:59.930> the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
automatically try and supply the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.710 
automatically try and supply the
opposite<00:03:00.560> transition<00:03:01.100> for<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.310> exit<00:03:01.640> so<00:03:02.240> for

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
opposite transition for the exit so for

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.860 
opposite transition for the exit so for
example<00:03:03.160> you'll<00:03:04.160> see<00:03:04.370> here<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.450> entry

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
example you'll see here that the entry

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.870 
example you'll see here that the entry

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.750 
you should do is you'll also need to
take<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:59.660> get<00:04:00.230> arose<00:04:00.519> library<00:04:01.519> which

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
take the get arose library which

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.080 
take the get arose library which
contains<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:02.510> scene<00:04:03.410> manager<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:04.090> you'll

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
contains the scene manager and you'll

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.009 
contains the scene manager and you'll
also<00:04:05.299> need<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.810> take<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:08.019> miscellaneous

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
also need to take the miscellaneous

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.670 
also need to take the miscellaneous
