00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:03.200
 unharmed then 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.320
 million tons 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 and I want to write you this Egypt 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.039
 group functions bought buy something 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.849
 about 200 rubles completely stop 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.550
 building 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.539
 although improving UAH 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.470
 done by just one person need 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.470
 except for 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.060
 Well, let's start of course with the name 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.100
 not effective enough 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.600
 original 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.370
 beauty can be called but 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.200
 such an approach dollars 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.710
 here it is even 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.530
 Screen size 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.870
 in the sound volume settings 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.210
 go out and play when already 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.310
 trying to play your timo 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.770
 is cat services 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.770
 well as still holding 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.810
 full production 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.220
 I consider impressions 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.220
 and see 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.910
 very nice 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.050
 what is your style though 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.090
 something like a turmoil 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.090
 this is another 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.510
 in the first data of such games often 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.010
 tips 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.740
 in that what to move from these cubes 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.630
 portal 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.630
 let's start with the evaluation of the day 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.760
 often 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.370
 everything is so original 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.370
 amidst all this 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 pretty nice such a picture 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.349
 nothing special 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.419
 for india uah 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:12.279
 all this 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.819
 with variations of kamaz grow 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.819
 present 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.189
 at first, of course 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.679
 It's very difficult for me 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.679
 so in all investment projects 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.829
 subject can be broken 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.029
 glowing 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.879
 bad son 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.099
 so someone can say what is ahead 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.099
 clean ponds from home 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:58.319
 Victoria Dementieva APA 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.319
 expect some orange 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.539
 unique 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.539
 why father 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.259
 other cubes to be safe 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.329
 novelty will be sold 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.929
 but what can I say 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:46.539
 sokina this style 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:49.179
 we flew down the silhouette 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.179
 remind very much 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.669
 small just a little bit 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:04.159
 powerful pressure 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.480
 we can say that you came to Moscow but 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.669
 it seems 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.429
 along the way how many times 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.429
 very much 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.669
 it's pretty nice in this game 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.669
 sound accompaniment 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.689
 in the background edge 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:27.689
 music 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.379
 the key fails 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.120
 still for the whole game very 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.330
 many varied help in creating 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.409
 always remember 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.870
 all this 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.900
 for example they 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.900
 but these bright color schemes 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.759
 all is not so gloomy 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.669
 in the column is enough 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.569
 helmet graphics 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.319
 Firstly 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.319
 tips 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:15.849
 although tips 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.389
 per day from cuba 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.389
 with cells to distinguish 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.620
 even with 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.379
 mh the fact that iran 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:34.979
 that is, and 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.129
 roughly estimates since china is india gra 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.089
 I will schedule 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.800
 how do you rate this peculiar 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.279
 in system 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.379
 what else 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.379
 let's start collecting 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.439
 we are very project books 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.529
 wrong 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:04.740
 supposedly 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.740
 presence 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.129
 such things 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.129
 move to rush 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:18.389
 that most need six years 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.050
 although repeated many times in the case 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.839
 swift 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.610
 reached all the same and luxury 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.610
 after which you need to start again 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.889
 generally not worth it 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.219
 for graphics with an arsenal booth 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:35.770
 wall ceiling 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.770
 Dvorkovich card on a five-point scale 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:42.819
 music is pretty nice festival in 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.819
 wife report 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.309
 a couple of sound effects 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.300
 shut down 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.539
 cubes collide and then yes tons 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:55.710
 down below 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.619
 but the money is spent on ordinary 

00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:01.619
 so im 

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:03.940
 and I'm four points 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.180
 was only due to the fact that 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.439
 very little 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:10.379
 sound effects 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:13.580
 basically only one to court 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.539
 but demi your master plan and pretty 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:18.289
 anyway vary fund change 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:20.470
 sunshine they are all complicated 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.570
 new ones are added 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.130
 new items have already been installed 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.439
 investigators believe that he is in this 

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:26.779
 at first 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.449
 just in the cockpit later 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.449
 cups differing 

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.909
 turn on 

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:38.729
 bombs cubes journalistic and 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:39.869
 etc 

00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:41.990
 I want it nicely 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.750
 we will then I will put in the ring projects with 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.029
 repeat chavez 

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:49.899
 but true Pyaterochka 

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.249
 You can of course five with the plus of a new all 

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:54.210
 nothing 

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.590
 musaev thank you sign out 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.610
 locksmiths liked 

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.960
 of course 

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.669
 thank
