naturally going to get forward anyways

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.140

because<00:03:11.200> they're<00:03:11.440> attacking<00:03:11.830> players<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.700> I

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
because they're attacking players and I

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.060 
because they're attacking players and I
felt<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.480> Gerard<00:03:14.019> plus<00:03:14.350> our<00:03:14.560> back<00:03:14.769> four

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
felt that Gerard plus our back four

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.590 
felt that Gerard plus our back four
would<00:03:15.190> be<00:03:15.220> able<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.459> hold<00:03:15.670> down<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.150> defense

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
would be able to hold down the defense

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.770 
would be able to hold down the defense
without<00:03:16.810> too<00:03:17.530> much<00:03:17.739> trouble<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.880> then<00:03:19.420> I

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
without too much trouble and then I

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.650 
without too much trouble and then I
wanted<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.440> try<00:03:20.650> cane<00:03:20.950> as<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.280> center<00:03:22.239> attacking

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
wanted to try cane as a center attacking

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.210 
wanted to try cane as a center attacking
mid<00:03:22.840> because<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.200> knew<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.530> could<00:03:23.799> not<00:03:23.920> play<00:03:24.130> him

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220

for<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.460> I<00:04:43.270> thought<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.050> defense<00:04:44.470> was<00:04:44.980> as

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
for it and I thought the defense was as

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.190 
for it and I thought the defense was as
consistent<00:04:46.150> as<00:04:46.240> ever<00:04:46.420> you<00:04:46.630> could<00:04:46.780> never<00:04:46.900> get<00:04:47.170> a

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
consistent as ever you could never get a

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.260 
consistent as ever you could never get a
better<00:04:47.410> defense<00:04:48.370> in<00:04:48.550> terms<00:04:48.730> of<00:04:48.850> consistency

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
better defense in terms of consistency

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.720 
better defense in terms of consistency
and<00:04:50.050> maybe<00:04:50.470> that<00:04:50.710> was<00:04:50.830> because<00:04:50.860> of<00:04:51.160> Joe<00:04:51.430> Hart

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
and maybe that was because of Joe Hart

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.890 
and maybe that was because of Joe Hart
and<00:04:51.940> just<00:04:52.060> having<00:04:52.270> a<00:04:52.480> lot<00:04:52.630> of<00:04:52.660> players

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
and just having a lot of players

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.870 
and just having a lot of players
uncomfortable<00:04:53.590> with<00:04:53.740> you<00:04:53.950> got<00:04:54.400> good<00:04:54.580> size

going<00:04:55.360> forward<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:57.000> think<00:04:58.000> anyone<00:04:58.330> can

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
going forward and I think anyone can

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.570 
going forward and I think anyone can

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
cons you're having a lack of creativity

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.380 
cons you're having a lack of creativity
