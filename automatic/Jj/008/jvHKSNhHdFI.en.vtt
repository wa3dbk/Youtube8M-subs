00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
that's one downside to 2.0 so we'll try

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.200 
that's one downside to 2.0 so we'll try
out<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> cup<00:00:56.989> now<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.050> see<00:00:58.850> you<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.000> few

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
out the cup now you see you have a few

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.200 
out the cup now you see you have a few
different<00:01:00.300> things<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.820> unlock

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
different things here you can unlock

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.040 
different things here you can unlock
more<00:01:03.440> but<00:01:04.440> let's<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.339> nitrous<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.840> him

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
more but let's do nitrous I like him

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.040 
more but let's do nitrous I like him
he's<00:01:07.860> pretty<00:01:08.040> good<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.540> frame<00:01:09.750> rates<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
he's pretty good but the frame rates a

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.580 
he's pretty good but the frame rates a
little<00:01:10.140> slow<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.960> accelerates<00:01:13.619> by<00:01:13.830> itself<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
little slow it accelerates by itself and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.950 
little slow it accelerates by itself and
basically<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.890> turn<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.220> left<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.550> right<00:01:17.960> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
basically just turn it left and right to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.280 
basically just turn it left and right to
steer

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.040 

and<00:01:23.620> then<00:01:23.980> you<00:01:24.100> can<00:01:24.250> jump<00:01:24.610> by<00:01:25.000> hitting<00:01:25.240> the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
and then you can jump by hitting the

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.070 
and then you can jump by hitting the
just<00:01:26.830> tapping<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.580> right<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.570> left<00:01:28.750> side<00:01:29.050> of

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
just tapping the right and left side of

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.710 
just tapping the right and left side of
the<00:01:29.470> screen<00:01:30.370> and<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.790> can<00:01:30.970> actually<00:01:31.270> if<00:01:31.510> you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
the screen and you can actually if you

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.220 
the screen and you can actually if you
turn<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.260> jump<00:01:32.500> you<00:01:32.650> can<00:01:32.680> drift<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.180> then<00:01:34.930> to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
turn and jump you can drift and then to

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.710 
turn and jump you can drift and then to
stop<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:36.130> go<00:01:36.310> reverse<00:01:36.760> hit<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.390> middle<00:01:37.630> of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
stop and go reverse hit the middle of

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.350 
stop and go reverse hit the middle of
the<00:01:37.810> screen<00:01:38.050> like<00:01:38.200> this

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the screen like this

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.880 
the screen like this
most<00:01:40.360> people<00:01:40.660> don't<00:01:40.810> know<00:01:41.050> that<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.410> I<00:01:41.830> just

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
most people don't know that and I just

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.850 
most people don't know that and I just
figure<00:01:42.370> that<00:01:42.400> out<00:01:42.730> so<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:46.630> does<00:01:47.200> help<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.620> lot

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
figure that out so that does help a lot

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.670 
figure that out so that does help a lot
Aitken<00:01:48.640> could<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.330> can<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:50.020> can<00:01:50.170> unlock<00:01:50.620> a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
Aitken could you can you can unlock a

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.200 
Aitken could you can you can unlock a
lot<00:01:50.800> of<00:01:50.920> things<00:01:51.220> by<00:01:51.400> collecting<00:01:51.880> crash
