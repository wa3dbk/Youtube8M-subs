which is from nigahiga by the way when
you<00:02:07.050> do<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.319> do<00:02:07.920> not<00:02:08.130> repost<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.819> video<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you do this do not repost the video and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.300 
you do this do not repost the video and
it<00:02:10.289> should<00:02:10.560> say<00:02:10.769> in<00:02:10.950> progress<00:02:11.310> zero<00:02:11.700> percent

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
it should say in progress zero percent

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.830 
it should say in progress zero percent
yeah<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.670> i<00:02:14.700> will<00:02:14.910> be<00:02:15.000> back<00:02:15.209> once<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.630> done

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
yeah so i will be back once it's done

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.509 
yeah so i will be back once it's done
and<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.560> should<00:02:16.709> show<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> green<00:02:17.100> bar<00:02:17.310> down

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
and you should show the green bar down

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.090 
and you should show the green bar down
here<00:02:17.720> installing<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.380> i'll<00:02:19.500> be<00:02:19.590> back<00:02:19.739> once

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
here installing so i'll be back once

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.840 
here installing so i'll be back once
this<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.640> done<00:02:21.079> well<00:02:22.079> it's<00:02:22.320> almost<00:02:22.500> done

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
this is done well it's almost done

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.100 
this is done well it's almost done
ninety-seven<00:02:23.850> percent<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.780> guess<00:02:24.959> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
ninety-seven percent and I guess the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.289 
ninety-seven percent and I guess the
current<00:02:25.380> time<00:02:25.500> about<00:02:25.799> is<00:02:25.920> about<00:02:26.100> 30<00:02:26.370> mega<00:02:26.880> it's

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
current time about is about 30 mega it's

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.090 
current time about is about 30 mega it's
under<00:02:27.600> five<00:02:27.840> minutes<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> kind<00:02:28.799> of<00:02:28.829> takes<00:02:28.980> a

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
under five minutes so it kind of takes a

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.090 
under five minutes so it kind of takes a
while<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.459> convert<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.350> on<00:02:31.350> once<00:02:31.799> it<00:02:31.920> had

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
while to convert it so on once it had

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.599 
while to convert it so on once it had
one<00:02:32.280> hundred<00:02:32.310> percent<00:02:32.549> in<00:02:33.150> about<00:02:33.420> one<00:02:33.810> second

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
one hundred percent in about one second

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.730 
one hundred percent in about one second
so<00:02:35.609> I'm<00:02:35.700> waiting<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.180> waiting

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
so I'm waiting and waiting

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.650 
so I'm waiting and waiting
it<00:02:38.460> should<00:02:38.850> say<00:02:38.970> video<00:02:39.210> conversion
