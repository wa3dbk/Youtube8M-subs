brighter<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.150> whites<00:02:48.360> know<00:02:48.569> you're

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
brighter in the whites know you're

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.000 
brighter in the whites know you're
spreading<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.260> contrast<00:02:49.709> here<00:02:49.830> especially

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
spreading the contrast here especially

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.280 
spreading the contrast here especially
if<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.310> look<00:02:50.489> around<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.269> boot<00:02:51.540> area<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.260> a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
if you look around the boot area it's a

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.390 
if you look around the boot area it's a
bit<00:02:52.440> kind<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:53.000> greyish<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.989> here<00:02:55.890> i<00:02:56.040> think

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
bit kind of greyish and here i think

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.240 
bit kind of greyish and here i think
because<00:02:57.180> she's<00:02:57.659> so<00:02:57.900> hardcore<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.769> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
because she's so hardcore and the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.070 
because she's so hardcore and the
locations<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.970> hardcore<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.420> think<00:03:00.750> maybe<00:03:00.840> just

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
locations to hardcore I think maybe just

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.960 
locations to hardcore I think maybe just
having<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.319> little<00:03:01.500> bit<00:03:01.739> stronger<00:03:02.099> blacks<00:03:02.640> in

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
having a little bit stronger blacks in

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.960 
having a little bit stronger blacks in
