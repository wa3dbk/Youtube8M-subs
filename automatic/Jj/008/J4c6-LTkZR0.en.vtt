00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.480
 This is the Miele TMG 440 WP heat pump 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.349
 dryer and incredibly robust and economical 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.030
 Dryer 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.009
 this dryer also ensures if you 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.109
 remove clothing that smells nice 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.400
 and so it has a steam function as 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.140
 nice and easy again he is out of that 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.760
 beyond ironing and is a dryer 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.840
 that they also have a nice design 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:30.660
 given the specifications of this miele 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.340
 heat pump dryer from energy label a plus 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.920
 that means 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.989
 10% more economical after that he has one 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.950
 drying capacity from one to 8 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.980
 kilos 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.460
 further he has fragrance box and he 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.120
 has a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.120
 softcare drum 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.160
 why then a heat pump dryer came 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.780
 inside and heat pump dryers actually 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.140
 a normal dryer but then a bit 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.940
 smarter 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.190
 the hot air becomes optimal 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.239
 use and this saves you extreme 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.489
 on the energy bill 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.900
 but now how much you save it 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.229
 we just calculated based on 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.750
 dry five times in the neighborhood the normal 7 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.040
 kilos dry compared to this miele 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.780
 Dryer 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.720
 the normal standard dryer that 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.729
 consumes 4.14 per drying cycle 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.770
 kilowatt times 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.160
 22 euro cents namely what takes ine 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.850
 what energy is 91 cents times 5 hours in 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.780
 the week 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.649
 times 52 weeks, that is 236 per year 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.899
 euro 60 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.050
 After this heat pump Miele dryer 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.630
 consumed 1.65 kilos per drying cycle 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.720
 times the 22 euro cent what the kilo what 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.649
 so that costs 36 euro cents that times 5 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.030
 hours a week 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.740
 times 52 weeks so that is only 94 euros and 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.149
 38 cents 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.759
 after this calculation 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.580
 this means a saving per 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.220
 year of yes 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.280
 142 euro bill 22 on the energy at 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.289
 compared to a normal condenser dryer 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.000
 this miele is therefore extremely economical and 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.000
 therefore pays for itself 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.860
 it is the miele softcare drum for the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.440
 dryers 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.790
 a special honeycomb structure 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.050
 making it as little wear as possible 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.670
 you have to dress and another 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.670
 once discord ASAP 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.610
 Miele's tumble dryer was good 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.769
 and lifters 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.150
 as you can see here the two of 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.760
 in this is metal 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.560
 because there are all sensors in it 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.299
 who can measure exactly what for 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.790
 humidity that he has 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.700
 never runs for too long so at the moment you 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.530
 say ironically also exact 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.629
 They cast iron dry sense you 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.879
 exact cussler 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.680
 and by that the perfect turning system 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.150
 then never runs between the dryer 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.069
 long and of course it saves again 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.180
 in a wear on your clothes and 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.180
 naturally in energy consumption 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.070
 of course we all want you if you 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.660
 you have finished washing and drying 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.920
 clothes smell nice 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.690
 and this is often the reason that we 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.550
 add fabric softener to the wash 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.530
 only that nice scent that goes the way 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.690
 the animal was good in the dryer 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.290
 stopped and miele f 1000 good again 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.850
 thought 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.250
 because they then have the solution 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.660
 namely the frequency box and this one 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.910
 capsule can give you different odors 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.710
 get a total of five 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.230
 that capsule that place here in it 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.090
 filter do the tab will 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.640
 capsule in it and then you can do it too 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.380
 adjust how much you want it 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.760
 smell gives to the right you see it here 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.220
 also can tab above it 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.820
 then it is a bit stronger and you want to 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.590
 cut down on 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.080
 by doing this and getting there 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.360
 and 50 dryings and so if you do 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.520
 dry well out of the dryer shell takes over 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.700
 hits it missed nice and fresh under 3 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.700
 weeks 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.370
 this dryer is operated through this 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.300
 One-button operation is only required 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.100
 to give what for 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.290
 dry well and put it in for the rest 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.940
 everything of this machine comes naturally 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.440
 if you want the degree of drought yourself 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.540
 then of course you can, because you 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.610
 can handle cabinet dry extra 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.510
 dry mangle dry iron dry and name 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.910
 it on 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.190
 do you use delicate clothing then 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.090
 extra careful that you do something 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.549
 longer left 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.350
 with the dry with that lower temperature 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.450
 namely, but then he does extra 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.700
 be careful if you want to know 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.550
 when this is dry there is use 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.930
 then this button because then via a buzzer 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.930
 is told that it is ready 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.320
 and all miele dryer that have one 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.700
 light bulb in it so you get that one 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.450
 get lost so can easily 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.070
 recover 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.620
 the beauty of a miele is that she is dry 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.940
 all have a load condensate but 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.280
 that of course you also just on the 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.220
 drain can connect so you don't 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.960
 need more like you are using 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.880
 take account of the steam finish 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.560
 note that there is a layer of water in the 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.870
