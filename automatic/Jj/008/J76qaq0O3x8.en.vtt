00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.590
 let's talk a little about this fish tank 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.809
 is the person who has it inside 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.260
 the house where there is air conditioning in 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.390
 all these fish are that esteban 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.310
 amazonians look like food 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.369
 they can be food with also from 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.019
 ortega had sweet 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.860
 and I also take the spectrum here 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.620
 we can see a makeup that is here 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.530
 how well are we calm as 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.600
 that indicated a disk that are fish 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.150
 also there as well as living that 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.460
 writes is outgoing that creates disk there 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.160
 people who create cyclicals there were people who 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.680
 create everything as in the case of the friend 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.989
 meat base the disc besides not 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.809
 problematic of casting that is 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.330
 pending with the ph with him with the 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:59.000
 one's instinct gives you a lot of food 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:00.650
 to the era controls monkey body I see 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.600
 that trunk is like that 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.400
 there are people who instead of using or 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.830
 almond when they are large pond or 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.860
 fish tanks use those triumphs of 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.930
 mangrove something like that I do not remember the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:21.380
 name of some but good I do not know what 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:23.950
 type living natural natural notice 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.229
 that does not open like a very nice pine 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.240
 what other advice can you get once 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.490
 in this way to keep a person has been 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.670
 good to have lÃ³pez that put it then 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.409
 can be with amazon with the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.929
 ornamental with cooking with the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.729
 Amazonian to control ph can be 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.340
 the trunks that is what went into the ph 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.380
 better than the plants the stones 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.380
 yellow that makes a color more d 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.620
 more natural for them the cold I see that 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.400
 it affects us this does not control the 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.400
 temperature here 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.020
 It also has a bulb that 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.920
 It keeps it hot because it is not 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.149
 cold the water really be good this 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.149
 kind of weights are these 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.730
 school children 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.730
 to her and to the good this was another 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.909
 advice for the friends of the group and 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.129
 we are almost reaching 3000 Creoles and 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.159
