00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.670 
is lagging correct me if I'm wrong jack
but<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.780> believe<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.350> highest

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
but I believe this is the highest

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.680 
but I believe this is the highest
sunspot<00:03:23.340> number<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:23.940> cycle<00:03:24.209> but<00:03:24.600> of

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
sunspot number of this cycle but of

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.540 
sunspot number of this cycle but of
course<00:03:24.930> we<00:03:25.230> still<00:03:25.290> don't<00:03:25.680> have<00:03:25.739> large<00:03:26.130> flares

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
course we still don't have large flares

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.490 
course we still don't have large flares
looking<00:03:27.360> at<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.570> sun<00:03:27.750> spots<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.260> visible

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
looking at the sun spots in the visible

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.259 
looking at the sun spots in the visible
spectrum<00:03:28.709> we<00:03:29.130> have<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:29.610> much<00:03:29.820> decaying

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
spectrum we have so much decaying

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.520 
spectrum we have so much decaying
especially<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.019> center<00:03:31.260> where<00:03:31.410> that

especially in the center where that

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.020 
especially in the center where that

looking<00:03:35.459> pitiful<00:03:35.850> I'm<00:03:36.120> in<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.239> tough<00:03:36.480> spot

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
looking pitiful I'm in a tough spot

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.750 
looking pitiful I'm in a tough spot

because this set up here looks like they

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.460 
because this set up here looks like they
