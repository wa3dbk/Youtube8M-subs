you have to live and learn with this you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.569 
you have to live and learn with this you
can't<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:48.110> start<00:01:49.110> doing<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> pro

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
can't just start doing it and be a pro

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.810 
can't just start doing it and be a pro
at<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.820> already<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:52.500> auto<00:01:52.979> drop<00:01:53.310> back<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> what

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
at it already the auto drop back is what

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.280 
at it already the auto drop back is what
they<00:01:53.939> call<00:01:54.090> cutting<00:01:54.420> off<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> auto<00:01:54.810> drop<00:01:55.110> back

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
they call cutting off the auto drop back

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.050 
they call cutting off the auto drop back
is<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:55.619> I'm<00:01:55.740> doing<00:01:55.979> right<00:01:56.100> there<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.969> way

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
is what I'm doing right there that way

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.819 
is what I'm doing right there that way
like<00:01:57.299> i<00:01:57.450> said<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> edge<00:01:57.899> he<00:01:58.170> doesn't<00:01:58.530> come<00:01:58.649> in

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
like i said the edge he doesn't come in

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.609 
like i said the edge he doesn't come in
now<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.340> gaps<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.240> stuff<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:01.049> still<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.469> you

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
now a gaps and stuff can still get you

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.840 
now a gaps and stuff can still get you
but<00:02:01.799> then<00:02:01.950> that's<00:02:02.100> up<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.549> make<00:02:02.579> an

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
but then that's up to you to make an

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.359 
but then that's up to you to make an
adjustment<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.570> whether<00:02:04.409> he<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.950> gap<00:02:05.219> and

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
adjustment on whether he is a gap and

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.160 
adjustment on whether he is a gap and
you<00:02:05.430> are<00:02:05.579> not<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.030> get<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.329> gaff<00:02:06.570> once<00:02:06.899> or

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
you are not if you get a gaff once or

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.790 
you are not if you get a gaff once or
even<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.979> gaps<00:02:08.599> just<00:02:09.599> uh<00:02:09.690> i<00:02:10.200> don't<00:02:10.500> know<00:02:10.619> what

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
even be gaps just uh i don't know what

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.110 
even be gaps just uh i don't know what
you<00:02:10.920> guys<00:02:11.039> are<00:02:11.190> running<00:02:11.280> whatever<00:02:11.700> emotions

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
tutorials maybe some people were asking

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.260 
tutorials maybe some people were asking
about<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.560> other<00:02:58.710> pass<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.340> do<00:02:59.430> it's

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
about that other pass that I do it's

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.430 
about that other pass that I do it's
here<00:03:00.510> in<00:03:00.600> Madden<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:03.440> different

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
here in Madden it's that different

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.540 
here in Madden it's that different
trajectory<00:03:04.920> past<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.280> guess<00:03:05.400> they're<00:03:05.520> putting

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
trajectory past I guess they're putting

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.130 
trajectory past I guess they're putting
on<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.910> new<00:03:05.940> game<00:03:06.240> but<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.630> in<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:06.900> game

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
on the new game but it is in this game

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.270 
on the new game but it is in this game
it's<00:03:07.320> just<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.500> little<00:03:07.680> hard<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:07.920> do<00:03:08.040> right<00:03:08.250> here

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
it's just a little hard to do right here

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.670 
it's just a little hard to do right here
i'm<00:03:08.520> just<00:03:08.730> showing<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.090> versus<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.230> be<00:03:10.470> like

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
i'm just showing it versus a be like

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.170 
i'm just showing it versus a be like
how<00:03:10.860> long<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.160> can<00:03:11.310> stay<00:03:11.490> in<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.640> pocket<00:03:11.880> and
