pull these screws loose and your shutter

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.800 
pull these screws loose and your shutter
becomes<00:02:30.020> open<00:02:30.440> that's<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.130> real<00:02:31.340> problem

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810

another<00:02:32.810> thing<00:02:33.140> is<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.890> five-point<00:02:34.730> locking

another thing is the five-point locking
system<00:02:35.540> we<00:02:35.630> have<00:02:35.780> locking<00:02:36.230> rods<00:02:36.440> top<00:02:36.830> and

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
system we have locking rods top and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.490 
system we have locking rods top and
bottom<00:02:37.459> on<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.730> maximum<00:02:38.239> impact<00:02:38.600> shutter<00:02:38.959> no

they're not required by code we have

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.320 
they're not required by code we have
them<00:02:42.050> anyway<00:02:42.290> because<00:02:42.769> we<00:02:43.010> know<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.550> if

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
them anyway because we know that if

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.390 
them anyway because we know that if
something<00:02:44.930> were<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.110> hit<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.680> lock<00:02:46.010> and

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
something were to hit that lock and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.820 
something were to hit that lock and
break<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.239> off<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.930> shutter<00:02:48.200> would<00:02:48.470> become

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
break it off the shutter would become

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.710 
break it off the shutter would become
opening<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:49.430> we<00:02:49.580> took<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.000> weaker<00:02:50.360> part<00:02:50.600> of

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
opening so we took the weaker part of

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.050 
opening so we took the weaker part of
the<00:02:50.810> shutter<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.440> center<00:02:51.799> mate<00:02:52.010> we<00:02:52.549> added<00:02:52.940> the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
the shutter the center mate we added the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.060 
the shutter the center mate we added the
locking<00:02:53.480> rods<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.989> made<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.709> stronger

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
locking rods and made it the stronger

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.789 
locking rods and made it the stronger
part<00:02:55.459> of<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> shutter<00:02:55.970> whereas<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:57.769> know
