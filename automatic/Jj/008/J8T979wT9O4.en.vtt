00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:23.119
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.849
 So you saw at the beginning that this 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.480
 Mission A lot of people do not know how to do 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.000
 I did not know then, just josÃ©lia 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.840
 usually you have you do more 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.149
 things 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.010
 Do you remember but this one will appear? 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.850
 number on your cell phone 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.850
 you call 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.800
 Are you going to send you instead? 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.320
 pink car that your management remembered just me 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.820
 I think it will improve a little bit there. 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.809
 the image 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.580
 The graph because I paid for everything is 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.410
 I also have some sun in the afternoon. 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.080
 window but I think it's going to be all right 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.770
 It will be good 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.770
 so folks 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:21.140
 this mission is a little bit in a bit 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.360
 great a tricky little that 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.729
 car hit 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.910
 She talks about him asking for a test drive from her. 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:37.640
 Speak that goes together. 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:43.250
 then go to a little place 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:47.000
 a little bit not too big a lot 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.490
 far a long way 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.330
 but it should only be a little time 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.530
 this personal mission so I did not know 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.350
 do 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.259
 suddenly like this when I was generating 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.920
 be in code to see if we can 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.340
 I can do that, I do not know. 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.150
 discovering how it is done 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.590
 so I'm doubtful of a lot of it 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.640
 people 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:22.120
 A lot of people do not know I also knew 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.510
 But now I know why I've had so much 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.930
 open 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.720
 I know why every person on the walk 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:36.280
 For you to understand it is better nakagawa 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:40.340
 This is my second video. 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:45.110
 You guys are giving me tips. 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.030
 hence I am improving each video more myself 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.970
 I did it here for the channel. 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.520
 you ask ask the staff is 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.140
 the truth has a channel like that for you 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.350
 post your videos for you take questions 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.100
 of others is something you know the 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.650
 others do not fight personal you help 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.090
 people to be able to do things that 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.320
 they think they can not 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.460
 go out now 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.630
 I played with her then the police there. 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.630
 People are hitting the man. 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.020
 hence you can see 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.510
 What she does the car has lost control 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.830
 you see 10 is an hour that the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.370
 who punches her in the face of her 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:58.349
 lose consciousness then you go in place 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:04:04.019
 I think now I think it's now 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:05.400
 now the person is not doing this 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.440
 Because I want 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:13.530
 I'm doing it because she's taking it. 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:18.410
 single to direct 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.410
 she is deconcentrated he is seeing 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.250
 I want I want now reached what 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.289
 gives a punch in her face she loses 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:32.660
 consciousness I do not know but kaka wants 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.660
 leave now she's unconscious 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:41.039
 You drive there for potec though it's temporary. 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:46.250

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.250

 It's personal, it's cool, yes, I do. 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:12.740
 which is a lot of doubt but it needs to be 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:17.220
 you will be a game you will not do it 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:21.360
 You did not attack nitro and you do not kill. 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.960
 Pegorini 0 game I will already be without code 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.960
 as well as past video 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.980
 I used this code and we're taking there 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:35.580
 the guys there have gay 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.480
 gay tony is part of this game you have 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.930
 an option 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.170
 After this time and then the next 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:48.000

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:27.230
 minutes per person 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:31.310

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:35.540
