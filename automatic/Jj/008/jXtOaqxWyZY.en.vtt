00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.380
 finger hurts everything and I do not see anyone to you 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.380
 and I see you 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.390
 then advanced to level 1 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.110

 kids 1 of this study I say he does not 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.340

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.180
 good this with annuals 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.180
 I said to myself 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.730
 the volumes of moriscos 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.629
 current ones that deserve to die on their own 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.629
 to see me 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.950
 notice 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.650
 to you 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.440
 Y 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.030
 hello uncle what you are telling me has 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.180
 given a shot I hit him with the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.180
 pipe 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.780
 and it does not fall 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.329
 from the same I wind is the only one kills me 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.320
 well there we go team that comes from 4200 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.400
 no no no 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.880
 that is turning around 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.050
 with the 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.050
 I think it has been already 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:18.889
 there it is going to go 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.889
 the submachine gun does not make a life 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.300
 if the submachine gun the sucker any 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.300
 give him the head in the head 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.669
 over here 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.419
 we go 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.389
 this inside so they come 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.360
 when I'm going to leave here fast is that 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.410
 if we do not reach the point limit and 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.410
 did not finish almost anyone 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.719
 for them 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.490
 without new commendable 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.760
 so 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.860
 you do not have more than the submachine gun 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.160
 that is to say the payment this if it is called above 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.160
 payment 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.520
 we go heavy 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.760
 good 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.350
 OK 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.639
 good 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.860
 I like it 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.880
 7 - short game everything you do 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.880
 now 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:30.280
 one of the points then they have arrived 34 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.280
 low pretty good 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.169
 let's see how this goes 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:52.220
 it's a very good episode we have the melee 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:55.070

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.520
