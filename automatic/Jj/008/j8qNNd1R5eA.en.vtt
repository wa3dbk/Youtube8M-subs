00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.269
 hello and welcome on how 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.410
 photograph points like today 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.910
 we will see together how to make 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.040
 photos the winter then the winter what is it 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
 that it brings as characteristic one 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.400
 has areas where we will have a little 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.010
 less light the sun is a lot 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.539
 lower in the forest as here there is more 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.920
 from leaves to trees so the advantage 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.720
 when we are in the middle of the day 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.800
 this is where the sun is higher this 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.119
 that they show not very high in the winter 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.789
 we will still see light in 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.289
 forest it will be interesting that we can 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.090
 see the streams in the summer there is nothing 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.190
 who polishes if the streams are 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.239
 inflated so we can play we can do 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.700
 the exercises on speed 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.800
 shutter by working on 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.620
 stream of small back waterfalls 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.140
 that's what we'll be able to play on 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.129
 in the undergrowth they are full of 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.200
 dead leaves 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.789
 so there are pretty brown colors to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.039
 his offers pretty cool things 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.110
 mixing between the glass the light a 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.360
 people apart from the universe look y'a 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.820
 a lot of things to do we can play 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.430
 also at the level of both for example of 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.500
 water we can play on the reflections of the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.730
 sun on the river level 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.400
 so benefited at the winter level 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.510
 of all those things yves laforest 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.010
 everything that happens is going to be a little 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.140
 sad but you see in the forest we have 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.680
 a lot of tree moss that goes 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.510
 stand out 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 so we can try to play with that 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.730
 it is true that after there are more 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.010
 leaves to the trees so that's a little 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.860
 sad it's a little dead otherwise we 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.720
 can go to the beach there the beach 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.830
 direct oxidation of the sun whatever it is 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.420
 summer or winter outside our 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.790
 holding we will not make the difference 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.400
 between summer or winter and that remains the 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.820
 beach but we can search outside of 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.460
 enjoy all the places like this 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.530
 like the forest if you have for 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.930
 to be able to enjoy the winter photos and 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.130
 play with 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.750
 with all its differences from 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.100
 in the summer that summer there are flaws in 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.600
 trees and we will not see the light 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.390
 would have plenty of time in the shade in the forest 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.860
 that is the problem 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.150
 so in those environments that's fine 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.730
 to be systematically two priorities 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.470
 large diaphragm of the landscape we are going to have 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.210
 need to manage a bit everything that is 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.800
 depth of field if we have fronts 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.720
 plan pretty close enough backgrounds 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.730
 far so a priori that there are thirty that will be 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.310
 very suitable if we want to play with 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.320
 take photographs of this little 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.940
 torrent of this small river 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.459
 we will use the priority mode speed 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.380
 so and after we will play either we will freeze 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.900
 the movement with a fast speed or 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.480
 either we'll leave the river net with 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.660
 a fight is him here it was on 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.160
 the little pictures that we can 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.830
 to do in winter despite everything though 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.500
 is cold and that's not a reason 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.670
 a season our favorite season but we 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.980
 can always do things on 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.270
