00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello dear friends in this video 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.660
 I want to tell the shades that to me 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.769
 very much and he allows 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.130
 such an interesting thing how to change your 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.130
 lock screen 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.910
 now it looks like this 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.789
 so that it is locked up 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.130
 and do it quickly as you see here 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.910
 wallpaper changes slowly in animation when 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.010
 transition 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.140
 it looks very beautiful but I am very 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.240
 I like it here on video 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.820
 pass as a little slow down 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.250
 but in general it is also beautiful 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.410
 swipe left we get access here 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.879
 quick settings I chose three more 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.079
 all others can turn on the flashlight and 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.390
 enable or disable it generally vayfay 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.149
 something like a contra center here 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.039
 also quickly go to the camera and also 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.289
 quickly get out of it as it could 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.410
 would the family immediately to lockscreen 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.610
 that is, it can also be pulled 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.649
 top will see something 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.600
 news there what's planned for this 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.250
 day on this day in the weather calendar 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.119
 still here is this thing honestly do not know what it is 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.030
 in the end 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.560
 general here it looks like this now 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.600
 unlock and have this tights of course 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.380
 have your own settings there you can customize 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.720
 enough 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.720
 fun things usually 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.790
 first we can do change the subject 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.380
 that is, and make our more transparent 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.630
 lock screen that is like this now 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.980
 Looks like here in the style and sim here 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.110
 such a thing is not convex like this 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.820
 unlock I prefer 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.680
 default and we can also change the view 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.050
 That is, if this one is not needed 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.560
 which i have is that we can it 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.540
 remove can also change the tables here 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.979
 here they are he added here added 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.160
 auto rotate respring 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.640
 and lantern can still add here 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.190
 settings that is and remove from here what 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.900
 we do not need that is for example if not 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.590
 we need these services 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.080
 Generally Terek very interesting to all of him 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.060
 I advise you can also show the percentage 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.239
 battery battery percentage 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.550
 so on the lock screen she 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.040
 flashed very relevant it will be 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.760
 on iPhones since on and then the percentage 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.560
 batteries on not poor in general on this 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.350
 all I was very afraid of this kind of fact that if 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.940
 There are already tweaks exactly on the changes here 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.489
 these are the icons that is the stylist 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.890
 dimorphism may be his soon 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.360
 review that is also as I understand it 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.110
 maybe there is something maybe soon 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.380
 will appear 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.620
 tweak on changing lockscreen and in style 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.590
 of 6 that is for especially nostalgic 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.540
 it will be possible to return the old and 6 point in 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.650
 such a world in which she was practically 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.780
 besides, there was already a review on tweak 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:05.850
 which does multitasking or six 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.830
 but the truth is there it is of course transparent 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.580
 also it just the same kind just 6 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.140
 nose Yusi style like this example I 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.850
 I think that it will be possible to just 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.549
 redraw and it will be like 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.080
 completely what 6, that is, such 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.000
 things can be done for those who 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.400
 nostalgic about the skin in arkhyz my 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.250
 can be cranked with less 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.690
 jailbreak on this all the books you can 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.139

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.079
