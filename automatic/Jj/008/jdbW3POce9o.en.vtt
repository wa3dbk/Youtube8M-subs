pocket<00:02:23.790> which<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.720> awesome<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.140> think<00:02:25.170> it's

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
pocket which is awesome I think it's

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.520 
pocket which is awesome I think it's
very<00:02:25.530> well<00:02:26.010> divided<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:27.450> nicely<00:02:28.020> lined

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.870 
very well divided and it's nicely lined
and<00:02:29.300> then<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.420> believe<00:02:30.750> like<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.590> luggage<00:02:31.980> this

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
and then I believe like the luggage this

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.420 
and then I believe like the luggage this
willing<00:02:33.150> luggage<00:02:33.510> bag<00:02:33.830> has<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.190> little

willing luggage bag has like the little

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.860 
willing luggage bag has like the little
wings<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.820> outside<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.620> if<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:37.890> punch<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
wings on the outside so if you punch the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.770 
wings on the outside so if you punch the
