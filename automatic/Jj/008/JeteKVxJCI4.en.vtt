ladder I've had some success with out on
the<00:00:19.350> ladder<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.039> thought<00:00:20.310> I'd<00:00:20.490> share<00:00:20.760> it

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
the ladder so I thought I'd share it

the ladder so I thought I'd share it
here<00:00:21.380> while<00:00:22.380> my<00:00:22.410> timings<00:00:22.980> aren't<00:00:23.430> as<00:00:23.670> crisp<00:00:24.600> as

I<00:00:27.480> thought<00:00:27.689> I'd<00:00:27.810> share<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.199> game<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
I thought I'd share this game is it's a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.919 
I thought I'd share this game is it's a
decent<00:00:29.189> example<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.609> how<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.760> transition<00:00:30.630> if

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
decent example of how to transition if

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.170 
decent example of how to transition if
you<00:00:31.019> don't<00:00:31.199> win<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.619> initial<00:00:32.189> push<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
you don't win with that initial push so

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.720 
you don't win with that initial push so

about 16 to 20 drones
in<00:02:13.450> each<00:02:13.569> mineral<00:02:13.930> line<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.350> then<00:02:15.190> build<00:02:15.850> a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
in each mineral line and then build a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.280 
in each mineral line and then build a
bunch<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.210> overloads<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.780> go<00:02:16.870> straight<00:02:17.080> into

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
bunch of overloads and go straight into

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.720 
bunch of overloads and go straight into
road<00:02:17.470> production<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.490> right

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
road production and that that right

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.370 
road production and that that right
there<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.150> basic<00:02:19.480> build<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:20.680> i<00:02:22.080> think<00:02:23.080> i

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
there is the basic build so i think i

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.410 
there is the basic build so i think i
think<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:25.170> DM<00:02:26.170> Zerg<00:02:26.910> pushes<00:02:27.910> out<00:02:28.090> with<00:02:28.270> about

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
think the DM Zerg pushes out with about

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.350 
think the DM Zerg pushes out with about
twenty<00:02:29.080> two<00:02:29.350> roaches<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.850> eight<00:02:31.030> on<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.240> way

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
twenty two roaches and eight on the way

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.199 
twenty two roaches and eight on the way
so<00:02:31.420> he's<00:02:31.780> got<00:02:31.930> about<00:02:32.110> 30<00:02:32.530> roaches<00:02:33.070> in<00:02:33.820> this

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
so he's got about 30 roaches in this

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.170 
so he's got about 30 roaches in this

be up you know three bays going into
four<00:04:17.680> base<00:04:17.859> i<00:04:18.070> think<00:04:18.130> around<00:04:18.970> 70<00:04:19.630> drones<00:04:19.930> is

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
four base i think around 70 drones is

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.020

where ideally I'd like to be I think I

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.290 
where ideally I'd like to be I think I
hover<00:04:22.300> around<00:04:22.539> 60<00:04:23.169> something<00:04:23.620> but<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:25.000> basic

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
hover around 60 something but the basic

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.530 
hover around 60 something but the basic
idea<00:04:25.419> here<00:04:25.720> is

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
idea here is

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.710 
idea here is
it<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:27.230> can<00:04:27.410> transition<00:04:27.800> out<00:04:28.190> if<00:04:28.730> this<00:04:29.420> first

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
it you can transition out if this first

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
he sees me going up but at this point my

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.490 
he sees me going up but at this point my
my<00:06:00.200> army<00:06:00.590> is<00:06:00.620> pretty<00:06:01.580> superior<00:06:02.030> it's<00:06:02.350> 198<00:06:03.350> to

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
my army is pretty superior it's 198 to

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.910 
my army is pretty superior it's 198 to
130<00:06:04.100> supply<00:06:05.020> so<00:06:06.020> I<00:06:06.050> actually<00:06:06.350> don't<00:06:06.590> think<00:06:06.710> I

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
130 supply so I actually don't think I

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.280 
130 supply so I actually don't think I
attack<00:06:07.220> with<00:06:07.250> 33<00:06:07.880> even<00:06:08.810> though<00:06:08.870> it's<00:06:09.050> on<00:06:09.170> the

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
attack with 33 even though it's on the

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.520 
attack with 33 even though it's on the
way<00:06:10.240> but<00:06:11.240> when<00:06:11.450> you<00:06:11.540> when<00:06:11.930> you<00:06:11.960> go<00:06:12.140> in<00:06:12.290> for<00:06:12.500> the

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
way but when you when you go in for the

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.800 
way but when you when you go in for the
attack<00:06:12.680> look<00:06:13.190> for<00:06:13.370> his<00:06:13.460> seeds<00:06:13.730> line<00:06:13.940> if<00:06:14.120> I<00:06:14.630> mean

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
attack look for his seeds line if I mean

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.350 
attack look for his seeds line if I mean
assuming<00:06:15.470> he's<00:06:15.770> going<00:06:16.040> back<00:06:16.190> look<00:06:17.150> for<00:06:17.300> a

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
assuming he's going back look for a

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.880 
assuming he's going back look for a
siege<00:06:17.570> line<00:06:17.780> get<00:06:17.990> a<00:06:18.020> blinding<00:06:18.380> cloud<00:06:18.590> all<00:06:18.770> the

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
siege line get a blinding cloud all the

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.070 
siege line get a blinding cloud all the
tanks<00:06:19.250> and<00:06:20.060> that<00:06:20.180> will<00:06:20.300> pretty<00:06:20.420> much<00:06:20.540> negate

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
tanks and that will pretty much negate

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:29.060 
tanks and that will pretty much negate
all<00:06:21.230> the<00:06:21.320> damage<00:06:22.270> so<00:06:23.270> play

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.650 

hydros<00:06:30.070> are<00:06:30.100> just<00:06:30.370> outputting<00:06:31.030> tons<00:06:31.420> of

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
hydros are just outputting tons of

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.060 
hydros are just outputting tons of
damage<00:06:31.810> you<00:06:32.050> see<00:06:32.230> there<00:06:32.410> the<00:06:32.560> blinding<00:06:32.890> cloud

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
damage you see there the blinding cloud

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.340 
damage you see there the blinding cloud
goes<00:06:33.310> down<00:06:33.520> and<00:06:33.880> all<00:06:34.360> these<00:06:34.600> tanks<00:06:34.960> are<00:06:35.050> doing

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
goes down and all these tanks are doing

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.320 
goes down and all these tanks are doing
pretty<00:06:35.740> much<00:06:35.830> nothing<00:06:35.980> a<00:06:36.460> couple<00:06:36.490> straggler

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330
