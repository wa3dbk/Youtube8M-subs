00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:10.269
 matata freeline clean at ease and soisy 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.320
 light aircraft 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:17.980
 the wii rubs the budget flight one of 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.020
 felt hurry ya what faty francs to 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.850
 charge 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.450
 and the first of the afternoon jets 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.260
 it's the yak 130 that comes from 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.900
 design office 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.600
 pierrick in the educated final 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.240
 and irkut corpo 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.480
 young people in russia so here is the there 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.220
 130 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.550
 serious cases 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.640
 ten years and glitter 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.070
 yakov loft design by europe redemption n 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.070
 isbn and body irkut 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.560
 the yak 130 and a tandem 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.570
 very advanced training at the limit 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.880
 the so advanced we could say 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.490
 that he died almost in the field of 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.350
 flying on them the weapon planes he 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.240
 could very easily become a plane 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.100
 of arms and indeed idea but at 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.900
 departure is still coaching it's 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.530
 when a training plane is a 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.390
 jet that makes empty it does not weigh 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.929
 altogether six tons it's 5 tons 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:35.390
 8 empty and so it has two motors 2 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:37.640
 tax the most insane but total one 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.229
 since david that report to you 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.140
 thrusts that is not far from 1 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.580
 it makes us a plane that enter 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.790
 easily in the generations 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.840
 current plans for aircraft of the 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.049
 meat counts 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.109
 bi portrait very hot we dissect raft 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:05.819
 is very interesting dates yes in 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:08.489
 othe looking at a self-portrait of all 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.150
 and jen are de yak exit av 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:16.310
 this trust company trust of nearly five 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.260
 thirty kraft beers will a little 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.720
 Slightly about five time was on to 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.720
 simple investigations and onenote exactions of 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:34.489
 initial militia of features of 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.489
 body and soul released 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.700
 giannini platform is really the taste 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.250
 of things to come on 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.010
 the yak 130 so thanks in particular to 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.110
 what report what to push but also to 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.700
 his flight controls and the fact that 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.160
 Moreover, his flight orders can 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.470
 be adapted to ensure that 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.900
 the airplane evokes in its behavior 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.910
 an airplane such or such type of plane 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.069
 contemporary and well made of this plane 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.440
 it makes him finally the treiner 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.569
 perhaps the most advanced available 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.099
 currently 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.680
 it's at the same time a plane watching this 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.620
 moment of suspension the plane stopped in 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.620
 this lockett sky has twist of the sky in 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.340
 wine and dine the jeans still speeding to 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.239
 hondo and dawn after we do d'estelle 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.120
 slight our problems bosinger justin lin 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.870
 rain dike 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.269
 pushing days after this bell we see 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.650
 that the motors remains powered continuously 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.810
 to push that 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.340
 it was not a problem to 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.610
 find in reverse during 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.180
 few moments and so to the Serbs 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.540
 were between cosne to make a plane that 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.090
 is no discussion possible the plane 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.599
 current advanced training the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.599
 more beautiful air 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.670
 who makes us fly this plane and well 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.450
 they are two who came with the yak 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.950
 130 there are they are in turn that 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.560
 one or the other there were six beds 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.560
 sevastianov and angry world paris who 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.110
 so have come to present this plane 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.060
 when we look at the yak 130 years we can 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.100
 notice in his architecture a 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.260
 a number of interesting things 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.360
 first a wing of vast dimensions 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.870
 these tunnels with a big enough 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.780
 surface but also we see it well of 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.120
 profiles the water if it governs vertical 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.520
 a vertical drift of very large 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.440
 dimensions also what makes that 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.540
 the plane has not only they stability of 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.639
 road a significant stability in laces 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.240
 but on top of that the pilot has a 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.250
 authority entwined up there rudder he has 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.340
 an important authority that can him 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.310
 to go to explore positions 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.260
 of the plane in the sky in matters of 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.930
 aerial combat that little and it has to be 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.350
 important all this allows to have a 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.720
 plane that is extremely it is no 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.000
 only to gillet maneuvering but he 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.820
 is more than that the plane must be able 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.580
 allow these 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:23.520
 taking his student pilots to go 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:26.190
 explore these species of field of 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.990
 flight a bit extraordinary we'll see 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.070
 just now by the way in a way 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.210
 very graphic we will see expressed us 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.710
 because a nice home is better 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.630
 that a long speech fabulously 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:44.100
 expressed by the Sukhoi converted 35b 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:50.130
 because of the wing design beatles all 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:53.220
 because it has various a number 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.850
 of recent combat aircraft including 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.130
 the fifth generation t-50 and that's 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.590
 sergei who is in charge of the 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.910
 extraordinary presentation you go 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.910
 see now no
