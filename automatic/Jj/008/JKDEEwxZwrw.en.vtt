00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.690 
what would it be now I've talked about
this<00:02:42.620> feature<00:02:42.799> in<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.099> beta<00:02:43.280> I've<00:02:43.459> talked

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
this feature in the beta I've talked

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.789 
this feature in the beta I've talked
about<00:02:43.849> this<00:02:44.060> feature<00:02:44.269> for<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.780> long<00:02:45.169> time<00:02:45.530> so

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
about this feature for a long time so

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.250 
about this feature for a long time so
here<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.069> is<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.700> know<00:02:46.730> when<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.150> spray<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
here it is you know when you spray the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.080 
here it is you know when you spray the
weapon<00:02:48.590> goes<00:02:48.739> up<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.159> up<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.400> up<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:49.669> gets<00:02:49.970> to

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
weapon goes up and up and up and gets to

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.520 
weapon goes up and up and up and gets to
a<00:02:50.120> certain<00:02:50.180> point<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.780> then<00:02:50.870> goes<00:02:51.079> back<00:02:51.109> and

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
a certain point and then goes back and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.009 
a certain point and then goes back and
forth<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.340> say<00:02:53.060> we<00:02:53.480> get<00:02:53.629> rid<00:02:53.689> of<00:02:53.930> the

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
forth like that I say we get rid of the

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.750 
forth like that I say we get rid of the
top<00:02:54.230> elevation<00:02:54.889> because<00:02:55.040> noobs<00:02:55.370> like<00:02:55.609> to

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
top elevation because noobs like to

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.399 
top elevation because noobs like to
spray<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> lot<00:02:56.209> right<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.019> here's<00:02:57.200> how<00:02:57.349> we

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
spray a lot right so here's how we

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.649 
spray a lot right so here's how we
balance<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.980> out<00:02:58.069> as<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.879> weapon<00:02:59.180> sprays<00:02:59.419> up

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
balance it out as the weapon sprays up

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.149 
balance it out as the weapon sprays up
and<00:02:59.840> up<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.079> up<00:03:00.139> it<00:03:00.290> keeps<00:03:00.500> going<00:03:00.650> up<00:03:00.919> it

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
and up and up it keeps going up it

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.830 
and up and up it keeps going up it
doesn't<00:03:01.549> stop<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:02.000> doesn't<00:03:02.299> stop<00:03:02.659> until

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
doesn't stop it doesn't stop until

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.720 
doesn't stop it doesn't stop until
finally<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.620> gets<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:03.980> certain<00:03:04.040> point<00:03:04.310> and

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
finally it gets to a certain point and

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.849 
finally it gets to a certain point and
boom<00:03:05.450> flips<00:03:06.049> out<00:03:06.169> of<00:03:06.290> your<00:03:06.379> hand<00:03:06.590> backwards

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
boom flips out of your hand backwards

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.470 
boom flips out of your hand backwards
you<00:03:07.250> lose<00:03:07.400> complete<00:03:07.760> control<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.239> weapon

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
you lose complete control of the weapon

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.879 
you lose complete control of the weapon
if<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.870> can't<00:03:09.079> control<00:03:09.319> your<00:03:09.439> spray<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:09.769> pull

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
if you can't control your spray and pull

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.140 
if you can't control your spray and pull
it<00:03:09.980> down<00:03:10.099> enough<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.430> flies<00:03:10.730> out<00:03:10.969> of<00:03:11.000> your

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
hands that is a feature that I would add

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.509 
hands that is a feature that I would add
to<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:14.060> game<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.480> that's<00:03:15.319> why<00:03:15.620> I'm<00:03:15.949> not<00:03:16.459> a

some<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:39.859> time<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.189> the<00:03:40.280> train<00:03:40.459> was

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
some of the time that the train was

traveling at the time the train was

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.390 
traveling at the time the train was
stopped<00:03:42.019> we<00:03:42.439> can<00:03:42.620> calculate<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.129> time<00:03:43.280> the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400

the<00:03:44.930> total<00:03:45.109> distance<00:03:45.500> traveled<00:03:45.889> by<00:03:45.919> the<00:03:46.009> speed

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
the total distance traveled by the speed

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.670 
the total distance traveled by the speed
which<00:03:46.849> is<00:03:47.000> 600<00:03:47.269> kilometers<00:03:47.840> divided<00:03:48.139> by<00:03:48.199> 100

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
which is 600 kilometers divided by 100

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.589 
which is 600 kilometers divided by 100
kilometers<00:03:49.069> per<00:03:49.129> hour<00:03:49.220> giving<00:03:49.819> us<00:03:49.909> 6<00:03:50.180> hours

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599

next<00:03:51.169> we<00:03:51.349> have<00:03:51.439> to<00:03:51.530> determine<00:03:51.859> how<00:03:51.979> many<00:03:52.040> stops

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
next we have to determine how many stops

the train made simply 600 kilometers of
time<00:03:55.040> travel<00:03:55.400> divided<00:03:55.759> by<00:03:55.849> 75<00:03:56.299> which<00:03:56.930> gives<00:03:57.169> us

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
time travel divided by 75 which gives us

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.679 
time travel divided by 75 which gives us

eight stops however the last stop did
not<00:03:59.900> count<00:04:00.259> because<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.949> train<00:04:01.129> had<00:04:01.250> already
