out with the keyboard in general the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.360 
out with the keyboard in general the
camera<00:03:26.510> itself<00:03:26.810> it's<00:03:27.170> 8<00:03:27.799> megapixel<00:03:28.340> camera

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.650 
camera itself it's 8 megapixel camera
it's<00:03:28.700> pretty<00:03:28.850> much<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.060> same<00:03:29.090> camera<00:03:29.569> you

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
it's pretty much the same camera you

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.289 
it's pretty much the same camera you
find<00:03:29.900> in<00:03:29.989> any<00:03:30.109> galaxy<00:03:30.350> s<00:03:30.680> device<00:03:31.010> I<00:03:31.250> don't<00:03:32.090> know

why<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.480> requested<00:03:32.750> 720<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:34.190> guess<00:03:34.700> that's<00:03:35.000> just

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
why I requested 720 I guess that's just

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.140 
why I requested 720 I guess that's just
the<00:03:36.260> way<00:03:36.380> it<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:37.010> can<00:03:37.160> see<00:03:37.430> resolution

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
the way it is you can see resolution

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.620 
the way it is you can see resolution
maximum<00:03:39.220> 720p<00:03:40.220> but<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:41.180> does<00:03:41.359> a<00:03:41.389> good<00:03:41.569> job

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
maximum 720p but it does a good job

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.830 
maximum 720p but it does a good job

probably concerned because this is a how
to<00:05:02.360> slide<00:05:02.630> out<00:05:02.780> keyboard<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:03.440> this<00:05:03.500> is<00:05:03.650> heavy

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
to slide out keyboard and this is heavy

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
to slide out keyboard and this is heavy
it's<00:05:04.130> actually<00:05:04.520> very<00:05:04.820> light<00:05:05.300> device<00:05:05.780> overall

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
it's actually very light device overall

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.150 
it's actually very light device overall
in<00:05:07.940> here<00:05:08.390> it's<00:05:09.290> so<00:05:09.440> heavy<00:05:09.650> that<00:05:09.740> actually

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
in here it's so heavy that actually

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.950 
in here it's so heavy that actually
feels<00:05:10.310> very<00:05:10.460> comfortable<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:11.540> slide

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
feels very comfortable the slide

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.460 
feels very comfortable the slide
mechanism<00:05:12.650> is<00:05:13.190> solid<00:05:13.700> so<00:05:14.060> you<00:05:14.750> see<00:05:15.020> that<00:05:15.169> there

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
mechanism is solid so you see that there

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.120 
mechanism is solid so you see that there
it's<00:05:16.270> feels<00:05:17.270> very<00:05:17.480> rigid<00:05:17.900> it's<00:05:18.290> not<00:05:18.440> flimsy<00:05:18.770> or

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
it's feels very rigid it's not flimsy or

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.960 
it's feels very rigid it's not flimsy or
anything<00:05:19.430> like<00:05:19.700> that

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
anything like that

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.450 
anything like that
like<00:05:20.270> down<00:05:20.450> setup<00:05:20.900> say<00:05:21.140> it's<00:05:21.290> the<00:05:21.460> the

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
like down setup say it's the the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.330 
like down setup say it's the the
resolution<00:05:23.060> of<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.450> of<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:24.080> screen<00:05:24.650> is<00:05:25.010> not

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
resolution of the of the screen is not

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.330 
resolution of the of the screen is not
as<00:05:25.580> sharp<00:05:26.060> as<00:05:26.300> what<00:05:26.450> you<00:05:26.540> expect<00:05:27.020> with<00:05:27.340> most

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
as sharp as what you expect with most

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.730 
as sharp as what you expect with most
farmland<00:05:29.000> plus<00:05:29.510> displays<00:05:29.930> cuz<00:05:30.470> it<00:05:30.560> has<00:05:30.590> the

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
farmland plus displays cuz it has the

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.540 
farmland plus displays cuz it has the
lowest<00:05:30.860> resolution

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
lowest resolution

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.390 
lowest resolution
I<00:05:31.760> believe<00:05:32.360> so<00:05:32.600> that's<00:05:32.810> probably<00:05:33.290> why<00:05:33.710> you<00:05:34.250> can

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
I believe so that's probably why you can

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.830 
I believe so that's probably why you can
see<00:05:34.580> just<00:05:34.700> looking<00:05:34.970> at<00:05:35.090> this<00:05:35.240> festival<00:05:35.660> to

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
here but the keyboard also keyboard does

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.870 
here but the keyboard also keyboard does
light<00:05:38.270> up<00:05:38.300> so<00:05:38.600> this<00:05:38.840> worked<00:05:39.140> well<00:05:39.380> at<00:05:39.590> night
