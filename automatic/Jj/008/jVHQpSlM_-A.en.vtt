bites throughout the day one of the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.920 
bites throughout the day one of the
other<00:01:13.500> things<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:15.000> design

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
other things that I like is the design

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.440 
other things that I like is the design
of<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.470> bait<00:01:16.650> itself<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.340> has<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> taper<00:01:17.880> along

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
of the bait itself it has a taper along

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.749 
of the bait itself it has a taper along
the<00:01:18.600> side<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.860> taper<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:20.460> will

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the side here and that taper there will

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.240 
the side here and that taper there will
actually<00:01:21.049> allow<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> fish<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.560> come<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:23.070> when

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
actually allow the fish to come up when

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.890 
actually allow the fish to come up when
it<00:01:23.369> comes<00:01:23.520> up<00:01:23.670> from<00:01:23.759> behind<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.330> engulf<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it comes up from behind to engulf the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.539 
it comes up from behind to engulf the
bait<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.259> little<00:01:25.530> better<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> increase<00:01:26.340> your

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
bait a little better and increase your

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.300 
bait a little better and increase your
hook<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.000> ratio<00:01:27.380> one<00:01:28.380> other<00:01:28.530> thing<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.009> like

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
hook up ratio one other thing I like

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.510 
hook up ratio one other thing I like
also<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.290> noise<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
also is the noise this is this is the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.390 
also is the noise this is this is the
key<00:01:32.990> key<00:01:33.990> factor<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.530> noise<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.130> that's<00:01:35.189> why

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
key key factor this noise and that's why

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.640 
key key factor this noise and that's why
it's<00:01:35.729> called<00:01:35.820> boring<00:01:36.329> lures<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> has

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
it's called boring lures because it has

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.160 
it's called boring lures because it has
that<00:01:37.890> high<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.430> low<00:01:39.090> pitch<00:01:39.329> frequency<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that high and low pitch frequency at the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.499 
that high and low pitch frequency at the
same<00:01:40.439> time<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.700> hear<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
same time if you can hear that do that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.810 
same time if you can hear that do that
noise<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.140> nothing<00:01:43.979> any<00:01:44.310> other<00:01:44.490> top

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
noise it's like nothing any other top
