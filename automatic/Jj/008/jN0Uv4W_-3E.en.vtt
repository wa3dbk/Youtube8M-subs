00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
far right now at the XP SC water black

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.480 
far right now at the XP SC water black
couple<00:00:21.480> coolants<00:00:22.760> swivel<00:00:23.760> fittings<00:00:23.880> and

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
couple coolants swivel fittings and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.779 
couple coolants swivel fittings and
there's<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> Nautilus<00:00:27.090> 500<00:00:27.779> right<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.789> have

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
there's the Nautilus 500 right here have

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.569 
there's the Nautilus 500 right here have
it<00:00:29.970> currently<00:00:30.330> all<00:00:31.019> wired<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.590> 12-volt<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.489> it

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
it currently all wired up 12-volt so it

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.630 
it currently all wired up 12-volt so it
runs<00:00:32.730> straight<00:00:32.969> off<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.540> xbox<00:00:34.380> power<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.520> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
runs straight off the xbox power so it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.330 
runs straight off the xbox power so it
runs<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.660> pump<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:38.190> fan<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:39.090> that

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
runs the pump and the the fan for that

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
runs the pump and the the fan for that
currently<00:00:41.340> problem<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:42.000> running<00:00:42.300> into<00:00:42.600> right

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
currently problem I'm running into right

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.869 
currently problem I'm running into right
now<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.020> trying<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.829> hard<00:00:44.250> drive<00:00:44.520> tray

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
now is trying to get the hard drive tray

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.190 
now is trying to get the hard drive tray
back<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.969> space<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
back in to the space here because the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.110 
back in to the space here because the
hose<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.559> actually<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.129> little<00:00:50.670> bit<00:00:50.760> higher

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
hose is actually a little bit higher

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.319 
hose is actually a little bit higher
than<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.469> had<00:00:52.680> anticipated<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> might

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
than what I had anticipated so I might

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
than what I had anticipated so I might
have<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> remove<00:00:54.719> some<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> these<00:00:55.460> capacitors

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
have to remove some of these capacitors

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.760 
have to remove some of these capacitors
down<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.329> relocate<00:00:58.050> them<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.620> this

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
down here and relocate them to get this

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.010 
down here and relocate them to get this
to<00:00:59.250> go<00:00:59.430> down<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> little<00:00:59.850> bit<00:01:00.090> lower<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.780> could

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
to go down a little bit lower so I could

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.110 
to go down a little bit lower so I could
get<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.320> hard<00:01:02.039> drive<00:01:02.280> tray<00:01:02.579> back<00:01:02.820> where<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
get the hard drive tray back where it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.100 
get the hard drive tray back where it
belongs

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
belongs

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440 
belongs
but<00:01:04.890> I'll<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.460> probably<00:01:05.640> reroute<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
but I'll have to probably reroute the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.350 
but I'll have to probably reroute the
the<00:01:06.869> hoses<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:08.250> crisscross<00:01:08.790> up<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the hoses and a crisscross up in the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.570 
the hoses and a crisscross up in the
front<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.650> them<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.100> low<00:01:11.460> as

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
front here to get them as low as

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.539 
front here to get them as low as
possible<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.140> fit<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.530> all<00:01:13.799> into

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
possible as I can to fit them all into

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.359 
possible as I can to fit them all into
the<00:01:14.700> case<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.470> but<00:01:16.470> other<00:01:17.100> than<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.250> I

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the case here but other than that I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.260 
the case here but other than that I
played<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.000> last<00:01:18.180> night<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:19.880> two<00:01:20.880> hours

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
did decide about halfway through the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.809 
did decide about halfway through the
week<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:06.710> what's<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> point<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.160> having<00:02:08.489> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
week that what's the point in having it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.150 
week that what's the point in having it
look<00:02:09.300> cool<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.840> can't<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.619> I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
look cool if you can't see it so I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.830 
look cool if you can't see it so I
decided

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
decided

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.199 
decided
to<00:02:12.470> order<00:02:13.280> an<00:02:13.519> axiom<00:02:14.650> clear<00:02:15.650> case<00:02:16.280> for<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.000> that

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
to order an axiom clear case for so that

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.720 
to order an axiom clear case for so that
came<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:17.830> yesterday<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.930> got<00:02:21.349> that<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.010> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
came in yesterday so I got that and the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.890 
came in yesterday so I got that and the
rest<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> pieces<00:02:23.390> laying<00:02:23.569> there<00:02:23.780> on<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
rest of the pieces laying there on the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.199 
rest of the pieces laying there on the
ground<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.980> DVD<00:02:25.340> tray<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.760> came<00:02:25.970> with

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
ground and the DVD tray that came with

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.410 
ground and the DVD tray that came with
it

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
it

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.259 
it
so<00:02:26.660> hopefully<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:28.310> UV<00:02:28.640> lights<00:02:28.879> will<00:02:29.120> look

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
so hopefully the UV lights will look

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.180 
so hopefully the UV lights will look
pretty<00:02:29.510> cool<00:02:29.720> with<00:02:30.049> that<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.620> have<00:02:31.069> the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
pretty cool with that and have the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.190 
pretty cool with that and have the
coolant<00:02:31.580> glowing<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.269> haven't<00:02:32.959> decided

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
coolant glowing in it haven't decided

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.460 
coolant glowing in it haven't decided
what<00:02:33.470> color<00:02:33.650> yet<00:02:34.629> as<00:02:35.629> far<00:02:35.900> as<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.110> coolant

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
what color yet as far as the coolant

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.740 
what color yet as far as the coolant
goes<00:02:36.650> why's<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.250> UV<00:02:37.700> lights<00:02:37.970> are<00:02:38.209> just<00:02:38.510> black

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
goes why's the UV lights are just black

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.509 
goes why's the UV lights are just black
lights<00:02:39.049> that<00:02:39.379> all<00:02:39.530> I'll<00:02:39.830> put<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.160> here

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
lights that all I'll put in here

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.089 
lights that all I'll put in here
but<00:02:41.239> it<00:02:42.140> works<00:02:42.290> pretty<00:02:42.470> well<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.950> I'm<00:02:43.040> just

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.790 

even<00:03:13.819> after<00:03:14.120> running<00:03:14.900> it<00:03:15.110> yesterday<00:03:15.560> for

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
even after running it yesterday for

about two hours last night the water
block<00:03:19.340> itself<00:03:19.850> when<00:03:20.209> you<00:03:20.330> touched<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.620> was

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
block itself when you touched it it was

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.400 
block itself when you touched it it was
actually<00:03:21.890> still<00:03:22.520> cold<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:22.910> touch<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.510> mean

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
actually still cold to the touch I mean

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.580 
actually still cold to the touch I mean
it<00:03:24.500> wasn't<00:03:24.800> very<00:03:24.890> very<00:03:25.730> warm<00:03:26.000> at<00:03:26.209> all<00:03:26.590> compared

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
it wasn't very very warm at all compared

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.010 
it wasn't very very warm at all compared
to<00:03:27.770> after<00:03:28.520> two<00:03:28.670> hours<00:03:28.819> of<00:03:29.000> playing<00:03:29.330> with<00:03:29.630> the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020

regular<00:03:30.920> heatsink<00:03:31.520> and<00:03:31.670> fan<00:03:32.230> assembly<00:03:33.520> that

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
regular heatsink and fan assembly that

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.760 
regular heatsink and fan assembly that
was<00:03:34.670> still<00:03:34.880> quite<00:03:35.060> warm<00:03:35.420> after<00:03:36.380> playing<00:03:36.590> it

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
was still quite warm after playing it

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.280 
was still quite warm after playing it
for<00:03:36.890> several<00:03:37.250> hours<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:39.550> still<00:03:40.550> have<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:41.290> but

I<00:03:42.590> have<00:03:43.430> no<00:03:43.580> idea<00:03:43.880> what<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.120> temps<00:03:44.450> are<00:03:44.569> at

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
I have no idea what the temps are at

right now I know more but I'm gonna
basically<00:03:48.650> be<00:03:48.920> focusing<00:03:49.489> on<00:03:49.640> trying<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:50.120> get

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
this set up in the hard drive tray to

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.830 
this set up in the hard drive tray to
get<00:03:55.970> back<00:03:56.209> in<00:03:56.420> here

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
get back in here

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.710 
get back in here
because<00:03:57.380> I<00:03:57.590> also<00:03:57.950> have<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.430> have<00:03:58.580> you<00:03:59.480> can't
