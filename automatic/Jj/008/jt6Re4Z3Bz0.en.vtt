something kind of randomly and I liked

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.160 
something kind of randomly and I liked
the<00:01:00.030> way<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.210> sounded

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
freely even if it means recycling licks

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
freely even if it means recycling licks
that<00:01:18.030> feel<00:01:18.390> safe<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.990> familiar<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.920> play

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
was that I kind of like that well stop

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.499 
was that I kind of like that well stop
for<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.100> second<00:01:35.520> figure<00:01:36.060> out<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.390> you

ways or get comfortable with it
assimilated<00:02:08.710> then<00:02:08.979> stop<00:02:09.580> for<00:02:09.820> another<00:02:10.000> second

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
assimilated then stop for another second

assimilated then stop for another second
and<00:02:10.600> figure<00:02:10.720> out<00:02:10.899> what<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.110> hell<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.380> did<00:02:11.590> you

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
and figure out what the hell you did you

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.980 
and figure out what the hell you did you
don't<00:02:12.730> need<00:02:12.880> much<00:02:13.090> theory<00:02:13.390> knowledge<00:02:13.810> to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
don't need much theory knowledge to

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.470 
don't need much theory knowledge to
figure<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.350> out<00:02:14.410> either<00:02:14.620> let's<00:02:15.010> see<00:02:15.250> here<00:02:15.820> I'm

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
figure it out either let's see here I'm

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:25.400 
figure it out either let's see here I'm
in<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:18.820> played<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.240> five<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:21.490> nine

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.840 

and<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.530> went<00:02:26.860> from<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:29.080> 5<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.650> 9<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.820> a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
and I went from the 5 and the 9 of the a

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.080 
and I went from the 5 and the 9 of the a
to<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.300> 5<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.810> 9<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.320> C<00:02:32.820> okay

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
to the 5 and the 9 of the C okay

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.120 
to the 5 and the 9 of the C okay
I<00:02:34.120> could<00:02:34.630> dissect<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.620> think<00:02:35.890> about

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
I could dissect that and think about

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.220 
I could dissect that and think about
that<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.550> terms<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.940> theory<00:02:37.270> I'm<00:02:37.750> not<00:02:37.900> gonna<00:02:38.020> do

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
that in terms of theory I'm not gonna do

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.840 
that in terms of theory I'm not gonna do
it<00:02:38.320> right<00:02:38.470> now<00:02:38.709> because<00:02:38.950> what<00:02:39.160> I<00:02:39.220> really<00:02:39.670> want

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
it right now because what I really want

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.940 
it right now because what I really want
to<00:02:39.940> do<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.420> just<00:02:40.930> know<00:02:41.140> enough<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.470> maybe<00:02:41.800> I

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
to do is just know enough that maybe I

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.920 
to do is just know enough that maybe I
can<00:02:42.220> try<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.580> somewhere<00:02:43.060> else<00:02:43.120> where<00:02:43.630> could<00:02:43.840> I

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
can try it somewhere else where could I

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.710 
can try it somewhere else where could I
find<00:02:43.959> let's<00:02:44.740> say<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:44.950> was<00:02:45.220> playing<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:46.510> hay<00:02:46.690> up

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
find let's say I was playing the hay up

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.930 
find let's say I was playing the hay up
here<00:02:47.200> well<00:02:47.410> where<00:02:47.740> can<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:47.980> find<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.400> 5<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.880> the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
here well where can I find the 5 and the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:58.170 
here well where can I find the 5 and the
9<00:02:49.120> here<00:02:52.230> there's<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.470> 5<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:57.519> where's<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.910> 9

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
9 here there's the 5 and where's the 9

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:11.100 
9 here there's the 5 and where's the 9
mmm<00:02:59.260> there<00:03:00.130> it<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:04.360> could<00:03:04.540> go<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:10.110> just

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
mmm there it is so I could go so I just

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.650 
mmm there it is so I could go so I just
dissected<00:03:11.950> or<00:03:12.070> analyzed<00:03:12.519> what<00:03:12.850> I<00:03:12.880> did<00:03:13.209> enough

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
dissected or analyzed what I did enough

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.509 
dissected or analyzed what I did enough
that<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:13.930> could<00:03:14.050> translate<00:03:14.769> it<00:03:15.040> maybe<00:03:15.280> to

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
that I could translate it maybe to

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.880 
that I could translate it maybe to
another<00:03:15.850> position<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.720> hear<00:03:17.440> how<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.739> might

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
another position and hear how it might

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.800 
another position and hear how it might
sound<00:03:18.280> different<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:18.970> could<00:03:19.180> do<00:03:19.360> that<00:03:19.540> in

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
sound different and I could do that in

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.410 
sound different and I could do that in
several<00:03:20.290> positions<00:03:20.440> on<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.100> neck<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.610> begin

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
several positions on the neck and begin

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.270 
several positions on the neck and begin
to<00:03:22.540> try<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.900> incorporate<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.739> in<00:03:23.890> different

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
to try and incorporate it in different

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.960 
to try and incorporate it in different
ways<00:03:24.459> in<00:03:24.790> my<00:03:25.120> playing<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.750> just<00:03:26.440> developed

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
ways in my playing I just developed

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.850 
ways in my playing I just developed
something<00:03:27.970> that<00:03:28.290> sounds<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.320> little<00:03:29.440> like<00:03:29.650> me

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
something that sounds a little like me

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.259 
something that sounds a little like me
now<00:03:30.040> maybe<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.459> sounds<00:03:30.700> like<00:03:30.790> other<00:03:30.970> people

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
now maybe it sounds like other people

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.390 
now maybe it sounds like other people
too<00:03:31.420> that's<00:03:31.630> okay<00:03:31.900> it's<00:03:32.019> not<00:03:32.110> all<00:03:32.350> about<00:03:32.560> you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
too that's okay it's not all about you

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.070 
too that's okay it's not all about you
inventing<00:03:34.000> something<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.570> nobody<00:03:34.840> else<00:03:34.900> has

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
inventing something that nobody else has

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.870 
inventing something that nobody else has
ever<00:03:35.230> done<00:03:35.380> but<00:03:36.160> you're<00:03:36.340> gonna<00:03:36.489> play<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.820> a

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
ever done but you're gonna play it a

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.400 
ever done but you're gonna play it a
little<00:03:36.970> bit<00:03:37.180> different<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:37.630> if<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.110> appeals

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
little bit different and if it appeals

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.890 
little bit different and if it appeals
to<00:03:38.709> your<00:03:38.890> ear<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.610> it's<00:03:40.330> something<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.690> you

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
to your ear and it's something that you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.990 
to your ear and it's something that you
allow<00:03:41.200> yourself<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.830> assimilate<00:03:42.459> enough<00:03:42.820> that

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
allow yourself to assimilate enough that

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.850 
allow yourself to assimilate enough that
you<00:03:43.090> can<00:03:43.239> apply<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.630> freely<00:03:44.110> without<00:03:44.530> thinking

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
you can apply it freely without thinking

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.530 
you can apply it freely without thinking
about<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.250> that<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.489> doesn't<00:03:46.390> sound

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
about it that it doesn't sound

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.009 
about it that it doesn't sound
mechanical<00:03:46.780> or<00:03:47.769> contrived<00:03:48.390> we've<00:03:49.390> taken<00:03:49.630> one

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
mechanical or contrived we've taken one

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.289 
mechanical or contrived we've taken one
small<00:03:50.470> but<00:03:50.709> important<00:03:51.160> step<00:03:51.370> closer<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:52.060> you

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
small but important step closer to you

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.559 
small but important step closer to you
sounding<00:03:53.110> like<00:03:53.140> you<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:54.209> that's<00:03:55.209> what<00:03:55.420> we
