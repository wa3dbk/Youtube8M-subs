about<00:00:06.540> upgrading<00:00:06.990> your<00:00:07.080> system<00:00:07.799> memory<00:00:08.250> now

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
about upgrading your system memory now

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.089 
about upgrading your system memory now
let<00:00:09.480> me<00:00:09.510> point<00:00:09.780> out<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.110> your<00:00:10.260> memory<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.830> not

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
let me point out that your memory is not

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.480 
let me point out that your memory is not
the<00:00:11.370> same<00:00:11.580> thing<00:00:11.639> as<00:00:12.000> your<00:00:12.240> hard<00:00:12.570> drive<00:00:12.990> space

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
the same thing as your hard drive space

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.919 
the same thing as your hard drive space
hard<00:00:14.490> drive<00:00:14.700> space<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> amount<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.660> space

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
hard drive space is the amount of space

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.420 
hard drive space is the amount of space
on<00:00:16.139> your<00:00:16.230> hard<00:00:16.440> drive<00:00:16.770> where<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.190> store

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
on your hard drive where you can store

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.970 
on your hard drive where you can store
information<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.330> data<00:00:18.600> if<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.590> double-click

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
information and data if you double-click

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.710 
information and data if you double-click
on<00:00:20.160> your<00:00:20.310> computer<00:00:20.730> like<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.000> just<00:00:21.060> did<00:00:21.359> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
on your computer like I just did and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.450 
on your computer like I just did and
then<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.080> see<00:00:22.260> hard<00:00:22.500> drive<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:22.890> says<00:00:23.130> total

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
then you see hard drive here says total

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.990 
then you see hard drive here says total
size<00:00:23.640> 74.5<00:00:24.630> gigabytes<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.410> free<00:00:25.830> space<00:00:26.099> 31.3

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
size 74.5 gigabytes in free space 31.3

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.849 
size 74.5 gigabytes in free space 31.3
if<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.750> doesn't<00:00:27.960> show<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.349> yours<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.710> can

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
if it doesn't show that on yours you can

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.859 
if it doesn't show that on yours you can
right-click<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.429> click<00:00:29.519> properties<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.300> see

right-click and click properties and see

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.569 
right-click and click properties and see
a<00:00:30.900> more<00:00:31.140> detailed<00:00:31.560> perspective<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> graph

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
a more detailed perspective with a graph

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.700 
a more detailed perspective with a graph
now<00:00:33.360> that's<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:34.079> hard<00:00:34.320> drive<00:00:34.590> space

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
now that's actually hard drive space

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.959 
now that's actually hard drive space
that's<00:00:35.010> not<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.309> we're<00:00:35.430> talking<00:00:35.460> about<00:00:35.760> when

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
that's not what we're talking about when

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.119 
that's not what we're talking about when
I<00:00:36.030> say<00:00:36.090> memory<00:00:36.570> upgrades<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.800> right<00:00:38.100> click

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
properties then you're going to see

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.910 
properties then you're going to see
something<00:00:41.640> called<00:00:42.379> computer<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.559> onto<00:00:43.890> the

ninety-nine gigabytes of ram now this is

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.869 
ninety-nine gigabytes of ram now this is
your<00:00:58.050> memory<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:58.530> random<00:00:59.129> access<00:00:59.460> memory

stores data while your processor is
processing<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.439> information<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> it's

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
processing that information so it's

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.950 
processing that information so it's
important<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.299> good<00:01:06.479> amount<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.810> that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
important to have a good amount of that

important to have a good amount of that
windows<00:01:07.590> XP<00:01:08.010> recommends<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.850> minimum<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:10.049> 256

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
windows XP recommends a minimum of 256

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.570 
windows XP recommends a minimum of 256
which<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.979> almost<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.340> joke<00:01:12.229> 256<00:01:13.229> megabytes<00:01:13.580> on

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
which is almost a joke 256 megabytes on

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.160 
which is almost a joke 256 megabytes on
my<00:01:14.909> honest<00:01:15.240> opinion<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:16.049> you're

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
my honest opinion is that if you're

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.490 
my honest opinion is that if you're
running<00:01:16.290> windows<00:01:16.680> XP<00:01:16.770> XP<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.880> want<00:01:18.060> at<00:01:18.180> least

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
running windows XP XP you want at least

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.929 
running windows XP XP you want at least
512<00:01:19.500> megabytes<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.549> you're<00:01:20.700> seeing

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
512 megabytes so if you're seeing

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.609 
512 megabytes so if you're seeing
yourself<00:01:21.000> less<00:01:21.390> than<00:01:21.540> 512<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.500> you're

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
yourself less than 512 and you're
