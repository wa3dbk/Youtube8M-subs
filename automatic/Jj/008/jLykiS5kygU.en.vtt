00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.339
 hey how about how are you 9 this is a 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.800
 very fast video to teach the 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.640
 last complete that I did yesterday and nothing 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.640
 I hope you like them 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.780
 Y 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.570
 Well I've picked up four little things that you 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.320
 I'm going to teach now the first one is 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.270
 root fault and it's this little sponge that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.740
 I had my doubts because I know there are people 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.510
 which has gone wrong but good 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.910
 let's try to see if it comes to me 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.850
 all right 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.100
 I have never bought a beauty blender 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.380
 because the truth is that it makes me 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.480
 heavy sometimes to put on makeup with a brush 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.059
 Well, I do not love you so much, it's like 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.340
 must be heavy for me it has to be already 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.699
 we will see it but I imagine that still 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.900
 heavier with the sponge then I 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.670
 I am very practical and for the price that 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.610
 you have this little sponge I really want 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.090
 try it but we'll see how we 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.670
 We are responsible for another young lady in 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.790
 metro curiosity about this brand and 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:06.110
 so I wanted to try the serum that 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.210
 they have the mark is to cure or here is 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.610
 a brand that has products 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.270
 Special for sensitive skin and in 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.399
 concrete this serum is made for 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.080
 unify the tone of the skin as you know 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.899
 I'm having a little bit lately 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.780
 of acne rosacea and then then the 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.210
 Marquitas take a long time to leave and 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.360
 nothing, I'm going to try the serum to see how 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.540
 goes 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.790
 and I'll tell you to see if I like it is very 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.520
 good to support this type of cosmetics 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.430
 Naturally, a friend told me that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.260
 japan also lately a lot 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.880
 girls are worried about using each 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.950
 more natural products then 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.940
 Well, I think it's a good 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.030
 trend and I've also wanted to catch 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 another serum to test the good because 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.790
 not two in two this is vitamin c 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.530
 I had already tried another vitamin c no 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.780
 I know if you remember that he has much more 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.780
 fame and I will put the photo 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.600
 but this one I loved, well, look at that 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.020
 base to more cookie 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:19.160
 is that it's super cute and nothing says 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.820
 that is everything that stretches you smooth 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.280
 skin is antioxidant gives you more 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.640
 luminosity for vitamin c also 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.090
 I suppose you have eight assets you have root of 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.860
 with jacques has hyaluronic acid not 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.750
 I know it seems a very interesting product 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.940
 and I hope that soon I can give you my 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.710
 opinion about him I bought this 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.800
 cleaner that has peach and 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.890
 avocado 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.020
 and there you can see 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:56.760
 the brand is science and says it's a 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.160
 gentle cleanser made of oils 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.280
 natural to clean the skin and remove 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.830
 the makeup without drying your skin with 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.840
 soaps 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.910
 Leaves skin soft but not oily 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.769
 I'll tell you how it will dance that all 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.349
 these products from yesterday seem very 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.540
 interesting and very good to go 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.420
 testing and giving the opinion that we have of 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.129
 they and those are the four little things that 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.780
 I fucked myself I hope you liked the 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.780
 video a kiss and until the next
