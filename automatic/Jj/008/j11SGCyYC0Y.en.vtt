00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.930
 if I do not think I will be a leader a leader 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:09.350
 important I think it helped me a lot 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.630
 the field I have talked a lot 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.240
 a lot of experience and I think what 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.420
 take advantage of it, take advantage of it in the last 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.550
 I played it was important for me to be the 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.810
 most matches on par with him 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.530
 an excellent player and good person for 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.830
 more than people talk 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.710
 is an excellent partner and I think that 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.540
 deserves all the recognition a good 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.360
 career 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.730
 since he made that decision we do not know why 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.530
 what is it but I think it is very important 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.980
 for that hurry and both for the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.980
 assists 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.500
 yes I am not contention he is creative 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.810
 he told me to give him a lot 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.720
 as I gave it to him he could give it to me 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.560
 me to open up space and I think that 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.080
 as quick as I think lords 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.730
 that we associate well I think we did 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.450
 a good job although we do not achieve what 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.000
 what we did but 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.539
 in the end I think it was a good companion 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.119
 he told me a lot he told me that in the 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.830
 selection I have to grab a goal and it 's 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.740
 what I try to do now 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.890
 to put on the field what he has 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.890
 taught 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.369
 to be chosen as every month 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.560
 we do not know what 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.200
 it's important was important we know that 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.790
 take the role will be our capital but 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.100
 we know that players also come 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.210
 super important as it is manfred 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.780
 as it is golobio magician I think there 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.520
 good players as the quality said 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.429
 it's nothing more 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.549
 climb twice the prominence he 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:02.109
 had and that 's with the matches when 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.109
 the whole tournament begins this preseason
