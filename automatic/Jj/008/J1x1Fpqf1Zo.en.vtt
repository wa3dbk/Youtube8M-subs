as<00:00:00.089> we<00:00:00.299> start<00:00:00.570> to<00:00:00.659> break<00:00:01.020> down<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.709> chalk<00:00:02.429> into

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
as we start to break down the chalk into

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.590 
as we start to break down the chalk into
various<00:00:04.020> sub<00:00:04.350> primals<00:00:04.980> from<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.430> chuck<00:00:05.730> one

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
various sub primals from the chuck one

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.210 
various sub primals from the chuck one
of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.930> major<00:00:07.170> ones<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.770> would<00:00:07.890> come<00:00:08.069> off

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
of the major ones that would come off

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.000 
of the major ones that would come off
the<00:00:08.370> outside<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.210> shoulder<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.019> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
the outside of the shoulder is the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.850 
the outside of the shoulder is the
shoulder<00:00:11.580> clod<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:13.049> that's<00:00:13.230> what<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:13.590> have

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
shoulder clod and so that's what we have

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.279 
shoulder clod and so that's what we have
here<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.910> shoulder<00:00:15.420> Claude<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.929> from<00:00:16.109> this

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
here is a shoulder Claude it from this

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.769 
here is a shoulder Claude it from this
side<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.619> can't<00:00:17.100> see<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.520> lot<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.880> differences

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
side you can't see a lot of differences

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.840 
side you can't see a lot of differences
but<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.740> understand<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
but just so you understand this is the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.820 
but just so you understand this is the
outside<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> animal<00:00:22.170> kind<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
outside of the animal kind of the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.220 
outside of the animal kind of the
outside<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.430> shoulder<00:00:24.000> portion<00:00:24.330> I'll

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
outside of the shoulder portion I'll

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.550 
outside of the shoulder portion I'll
turn<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.769> over<00:00:26.720> we<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.869> look<00:00:28.050> at<00:00:28.199> several

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
turn it over we can look at several

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.800 
turn it over we can look at several
muscles<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> interesting<00:00:30.269> things

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
muscles one of the interesting things

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.290 
muscles one of the interesting things
about<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.170> shoulder<00:00:31.769> clod<00:00:32.059> we've<00:00:33.059> always

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
about a shoulder clod we've always

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.410 
about a shoulder clod we've always
talked<00:00:33.719> more<00:00:34.380> about<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.980> muscles<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:36.270> are

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
talked more about the muscles that are

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.229 
talked more about the muscles that are
involved<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.960> locomotion<00:00:38.120> movement<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
involved in locomotion movement of the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.350 
involved in locomotion movement of the
animal<00:00:39.870> actually<00:00:40.530> being<00:00:41.160> somewhat<00:00:41.730> tougher

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
animal actually being somewhat tougher

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.680 
animal actually being somewhat tougher
that<00:00:43.230> still<00:00:43.950> holds<00:00:44.340> true<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> point<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.450> we

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
that still holds true to a point but we

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.590 
that still holds true to a point but we
found<00:00:45.930> some<00:00:46.230> muscles<00:00:46.680> within<00:00:47.309> some<00:00:47.850> cuts<00:00:48.210> some

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
found some muscles within some cuts some

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.619 
found some muscles within some cuts some
sub<00:00:48.930> primals<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.829> shoulder<00:00:50.129> clod

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
sub primals like this shoulder clod

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.290 
sub primals like this shoulder clod
we're<00:00:51.629> actually<00:00:52.140> there's<00:00:53.129> some<00:00:53.399> very<00:00:53.670> tender

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
we're actually there's some very tender

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.200 
we're actually there's some very tender
portions<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:56.399> could<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.730> used<00:00:56.940> for

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
portions of this that could be used for

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.110 
portions of this that could be used for
a<00:00:57.239> lot<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> different<00:00:57.690> applications<00:00:58.940> one<00:00:59.940> of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
a lot of different applications one of

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
a lot of different applications one of
the<00:01:00.239> ones<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.629> used<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.530> cut<00:01:01.800> in

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the ones that used to just be cut in

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.119 
the ones that used to just be cut in
half<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.640> never<00:01:02.879> really<00:01:03.359> utilize<00:01:03.870> much<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
half and never really utilize much is a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.460 
half and never really utilize much is a
little<00:01:05.549> muscle<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.119> runs<00:01:06.330> right<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.750> but

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
little muscle that runs right here but

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.910 
little muscle that runs right here but
it<00:01:08.130> actually<00:01:08.369> would<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:09.090> set<00:01:09.450> close<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
it actually would have set close to the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.450 
it actually would have set close to the
the<00:01:11.310> blade<00:01:11.640> bone<00:01:11.970> or<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> shoulder<00:01:12.720> blade

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
the blade bone or the shoulder blade

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.600 
the blade bone or the shoulder blade
it's<00:01:14.460> called<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> teres<00:01:15.240> major<00:01:16.040> it's<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.280> very

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it's called the teres major it's a very

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.749 
it's called the teres major it's a very
tender<00:01:18.030> muscle<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.979> shaped<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.580> lot

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
tender muscle and that is shaped a lot

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.950 
tender muscle and that is shaped a lot
like<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> small<00:01:21.600> kinder<00:01:22.080> loin<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:23.100> shape<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
like a small kinder loin in in shape and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.130 
like a small kinder loin in in shape and
can<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.110> used<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.880> some<00:01:26.880> kebabs<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.840> could<00:01:28.020> be

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
can be used for some kebabs it could be

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.819 
can be used for some kebabs it could be
used<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:29.009> braised<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.880> our<00:01:30.720> grilled<00:01:31.320> alone

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
used in braised and our grilled alone

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
used in braised and our grilled alone
and<00:01:32.189> use<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.790> lot<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.299> different<00:01:33.630> applications

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
and use a lot of different applications

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.260 
and use a lot of different applications
for<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> muscle<00:01:35.189> fibers<00:01:35.220> all<00:01:35.759> run<00:01:36.000> one

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
for that the muscle fibers all run one

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.080 
for that the muscle fibers all run one
way<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.799> turn<00:01:38.100> around<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> look<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
way if we turn around and look at the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.569 
way if we turn around and look at the
muscle<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.570> was<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.110> top<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.070> shoulder

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
muscle that was on top of the shoulder

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.770 
muscle that was on top of the shoulder
blade<00:01:43.340> which<00:01:44.340> happens<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.210> muscle

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
blade which happens to be this muscle

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.420 
blade which happens to be this muscle
right<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:47.270> is<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> infraspinatus<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
right here is the infraspinatus or the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.139 
right here is the infraspinatus or the
top<00:01:50.700> blade<00:01:51.180> muscle<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> kind<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.060> an

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
top blade muscle and it is a kind of an

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.639 
top blade muscle and it is a kind of an
interesting<00:01:54.450> muscle<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:55.259> down<00:01:55.500> through

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
interesting muscle right down through

the center of it is a heavy layer of
connective<00:01:58.320> tissue<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.030> cut<00:02:00.299> across

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
connective tissue that if you cut across

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.289 
connective tissue that if you cut across
and<00:02:01.140> makes<00:02:01.290> takes<00:02:01.740> stays<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
the center we can cut steaks across this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.350 
the center we can cut steaks across this
that<00:02:24.080> we'd<00:02:24.290> use<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.310> most<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.880> time<00:02:26.120> those

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
that we'd use and most of the time those

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.030 
that we'd use and most of the time those
referred<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.080> as<00:02:27.260> flat<00:02:27.680> iron<00:02:28.220> steaks<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.680> flat

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
referred to as flat iron steaks so flat

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.030 
referred to as flat iron steaks so flat

iron if we take out the the filets of
that<00:02:34.600> top<00:02:35.600> blade<00:02:35.930> if<00:02:36.170> we<00:02:36.350> cut<00:02:36.590> across<00:02:36.790> so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
that top blade if we cut across so

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.400 
that top blade if we cut across so
that's<00:02:38.239> just<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.660> little<00:02:38.930> difference<00:02:39.290> in

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
that's just a little difference in

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.190 
that's just a little difference in
terminology<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.730> remaining<00:02:41.360> portion<00:02:42.020> of

this shoulder clod can be used for

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.949 
this shoulder clod can be used for
several<00:02:45.380> things<00:02:45.680> some<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.940> would<00:02:47.720> just

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
several things some of it would just

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.229 
several things some of it would just
come<00:02:48.140> out<00:02:48.320> as<00:02:48.709> either<00:02:49.160> stew<00:02:49.640> meat<00:02:49.850> or

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
come out as either stew meat or

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.509 
come out as either stew meat or
something<00:02:50.570> like<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.680> major<00:02:52.010> portion

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
something like that the major portion

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.600 
something like that the major portion
the<00:02:53.000> triceps<00:02:53.660> brachii<00:02:53.930> which<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.100> muscle

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
the triceps brachii which is this muscle

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.840 
the triceps brachii which is this muscle
right<00:02:55.790> here<00:02:56.769> would<00:02:57.769> could<00:02:58.130> be<00:02:58.310> used<00:02:58.580> for<00:02:58.700> a

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
right here would could be used for a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.020 
right here would could be used for a
roasting<00:02:59.420> application<00:03:00.310> could<00:03:01.310> actually<00:03:01.550> be

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
roasting application could actually be

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.030 
roasting application could actually be
staked<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:02.900> they're<00:03:03.110> not<00:03:03.319> going<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.739> be<00:03:03.830> as

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
staked but they're not going to be as

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.210 
staked but they're not going to be as
tender<00:03:04.400> as<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:05.660> top<00:03:05.900> blade<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.530> did<00:03:06.950> mention

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
tender as the top blade I did mention

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.570 
tender as the top blade I did mention
but<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.700> top<00:03:07.940> blade<00:03:08.239> actually<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.890> muscle

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
but the top blade actually and muscle

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.270 
but the top blade actually and muscle
tissue<00:03:10.910> tenderness<00:03:11.600> is<00:03:11.989> second<00:03:12.980> only<00:03:13.069> to

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
tissue tenderness is second only to

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.580 
tissue tenderness is second only to
tenderloin<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.090> muscle<00:03:14.720> tissue<00:03:14.989> tenderness

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
tenderloin and muscle tissue tenderness

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.280 
tenderloin and muscle tissue tenderness
so<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.100> is<00:03:16.130> extremely<00:03:16.850> tender<00:03:17.360> where<00:03:18.140> these

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
so it is extremely tender where these

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.199 
so it is extremely tender where these
others<00:03:18.739> would<00:03:18.980> be<00:03:19.130> kind<00:03:19.400> of<00:03:19.459> medium<00:03:19.970> in

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
others would be kind of medium in

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.930 
others would be kind of medium in
tenderness<00:03:20.829> some<00:03:21.829> of<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.010> other<00:03:22.190> muscles<00:03:22.790> or

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
tenderness some of the other muscles or

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.870 
tenderness some of the other muscles or
other<00:03:23.120> sub<00:03:23.510> primals<00:03:24.049> out<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.769> Chuck<00:03:25.130> one

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
other sub primals out of the Chuck one

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.970 
other sub primals out of the Chuck one
of<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.060> other<00:03:26.209> major<00:03:26.540> ones<00:03:26.989> would<00:03:27.230> be<00:03:27.470> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
of the other major ones would be the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.770 
of the other major ones would be the
Chuck<00:03:28.310> role<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.810> really<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:30.739> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
Chuck role and that really is the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.370 
Chuck role and that really is the
extension<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.590> rib<00:03:33.860> eye<00:03:35.019> remember<00:03:36.019> we<00:03:36.170> cut

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
extension of the rib eye remember we cut

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.160 
extension of the rib eye remember we cut
between<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.860> fifth<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.280> sixth<00:03:37.700> rib<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:39.079> you

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
between the fifth and sixth rib so you

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.599 
between the fifth and sixth rib so you
can<00:03:39.380> see<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:40.549> mirror<00:03:41.060> image<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:42.620> Chuck

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
can see the mirror image of the Chuck

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.140 
can see the mirror image of the Chuck
end<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:44.480> rib<00:03:44.720> eye<00:03:44.900> right<00:03:45.290> here<00:03:45.980> still<00:03:46.970> has

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
end of the rib eye right here still has

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.910 
end of the rib eye right here still has
the<00:03:47.329> same<00:03:47.540> muscles<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.290> lot<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.530> times<00:03:48.739> this

the same muscles and a lot of times this

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.690 
the same muscles and a lot of times this

would be referred to as it Chuck I okay

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.020

as we look a lot of times this cut and

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.970 
as we look a lot of times this cut and

our a flat portion of this that would be
utilized<00:04:27.560> either<00:04:28.340> for<00:04:28.640> like<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.180> brisket<00:04:29.780> could

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
utilized either for like a brisket could

utilized either for like a brisket could
be<00:04:30.650> used<00:04:30.980> to<00:04:31.250> cut<00:04:31.490> across<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:32.120> grain<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.720> make

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
applications like that so this is going
