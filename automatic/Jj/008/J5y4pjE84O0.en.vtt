an<00:02:34.650> earlier<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.340> other<00:02:35.460> poster<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:35.910> mean<00:02:36.150> not

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
an earlier the other poster I mean not

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.030 
an earlier the other poster I mean not
breakfast<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.050> go<00:02:37.200> with<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.800> sort<00:02:38.010> of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
breakfast so I go with that that sort of

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.280 
breakfast so I go with that that sort of
aspect<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.640> know<00:02:38.760> good<00:02:39.630> science<00:02:39.900> behind<00:02:40.020> that

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
aspect you know good science behind that

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.110 
aspect you know good science behind that
so<00:02:40.530> it's<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:40.920> type<00:02:41.160> 1<00:02:41.490> low<00:02:41.640> change<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.030> will

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
so it's like type 1 low change it will

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.450 
so it's like type 1 low change it will
incorporate<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.860> then<00:02:43.860> three<00:02:44.100> or<00:02:44.190> four<00:02:44.370> days

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
incorporate that then three or four days

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.070 
incorporate that then three or four days
later<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.330> know<00:02:45.420> if<00:02:45.570> everything's<00:02:45.930> going
