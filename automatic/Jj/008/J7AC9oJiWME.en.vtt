cut<00:01:50.939> along<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.270> way<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.750> certain<00:01:52.200> ideas<00:01:52.680> were

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
cut along the way and certain ideas were

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
pushed to the background this is because

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.149 
pushed to the background this is because
they<00:01:55.079> were<00:01:55.200> actually<00:01:55.350> getting<00:01:55.680> closer<00:01:56.040> to

they were actually getting closer to

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.160 
they were actually getting closer to
release<00:01:56.610> date<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.360> was<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.570> too<00:01:57.780> much<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
release date and it was just too much to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.319 
release date and it was just too much to
add<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.860> little<00:01:59.219> amount<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.610> time<00:01:59.670> which

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
add in in a little amount of time which

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.420 
add in in a little amount of time which
does<00:02:00.570> pretty<00:02:00.869> much<00:02:00.960> make<00:02:01.320> sense<00:02:01.619> anyway<00:02:02.040> so

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
does pretty much make sense anyway so

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.969

path<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.340> think<00:02:47.489> this<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.819> actually

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
path so I think this is actually

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.120 
path so I think this is actually
generally<00:02:48.840> pretty<00:02:49.079> awesome<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.769> rocks<00:02:49.980> that

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
generally pretty awesome that rocks that

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.100

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
magazine Aaron Garber explained that

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.030 
magazine Aaron Garber explained that
while<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.669> idea<00:03:54.120> was<00:03:54.329> fair<00:03:54.599> from<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.349> GTA<00:03:55.709> 5's

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
while the idea was fair from the GTA 5's

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.979 
while the idea was fair from the GTA 5's
conception<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.940> was<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> massive<00:03:57.540> change<00:03:57.810> to

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
conception it was a massive change to

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.839 
conception it was a massive change to
the<00:03:58.109> core<00:03:58.319> of<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.560> series<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.220> therefore<00:03:59.730> a

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
the core of the series and therefore a

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.750 
the core of the series and therefore a
big<00:04:00.150> risk<00:04:00.540> for<00:04:00.780> rockstar<00:04:01.380> so<00:04:01.739> Garbutt<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.430> say

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
big risk for rockstar so Garbutt the say

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.270 
big risk for rockstar so Garbutt the say
multiple<00:04:03.569> characters<00:04:03.840> was<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.319> leap<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:04.739> faith

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
multiple characters was a leap of faith

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280 
multiple characters was a leap of faith
it<00:04:05.519> was<00:04:05.700> an<00:04:05.819> interesting<00:04:06.150> idea<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.079> felt

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
it was an interesting idea and it felt

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.990 
it was an interesting idea and it felt
like<00:04:07.470> we<00:04:07.650> could<00:04:07.799> do<00:04:07.950> interesting<00:04:08.400> things<00:04:08.639> with

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
like we could do interesting things with

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.330 
like we could do interesting things with
it<00:04:09.299> but<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.900> also<00:04:10.139> felt<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.709> change<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.220> the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
it but I also felt like a change to the

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.909 
it but I also felt like a change to the
core<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:12.030> game<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.870> might<00:04:13.079> backfire<00:04:13.349> I

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
core of the game that might backfire I

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.219 
core of the game that might backfire I
think<00:04:14.549> it<00:04:14.700> really<00:04:14.880> worked<00:04:15.180> out<00:04:15.450> it's<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.019> hard

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
think it really worked out it's so hard

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.599 
think it really worked out it's so hard
during<00:04:16.410> development<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:17.160> get<00:04:17.310> perspective

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
during development to get perspective

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.640 
during development to get perspective
you<00:04:18.389> get<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:18.750> used<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:19.109> looking<00:04:19.289> for<00:04:19.590> the

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
you get so used to looking for the

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.990 
you get so used to looking for the
problems<00:04:20.099> that<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.400> becomes<00:04:20.700> almost

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
problems that it becomes almost

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.940 
problems that it becomes almost
impossible<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.870> step<00:04:22.140> back<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.530> see<00:04:22.800> the

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
impossible to step back and see the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.879 
impossible to step back and see the
positives

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
positives

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.409

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
experience of GTA 5 further so yeah

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.809 
experience of GTA 5 further so yeah
there<00:04:46.840> is<00:04:47.050> garba<00:04:47.379> is<00:04:47.680> saying<00:04:48.009> that<00:04:48.310> overall

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:48.819 
there is garba is saying that overall

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.149 
there is garba is saying that overall
having<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.300> free<00:04:49.509> characters<00:04:50.020> in<00:04:50.169> GTA<00:04:50.590> 5<00:04:50.889> was

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
having the free characters in GTA 5 was

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.980 
having the free characters in GTA 5 was
a<00:04:51.189> leap<00:04:51.639> of<00:04:51.849> faith<00:04:52.180> it<00:04:52.360> was<00:04:52.509> a<00:04:52.539> really<00:04:52.749> good

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
a leap of faith it was a really good

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.629 
a leap of faith it was a really good
thing<00:04:53.020> as<00:04:53.379> it<00:04:53.469> did<00:04:53.710> turn<00:04:53.889> out<00:04:53.949> well<00:04:54.279> for<00:04:54.490> them

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
thing as it did turn out well for them

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.550 
thing as it did turn out well for them
and<00:04:54.759> in<00:04:55.120> my<00:04:55.300> opinion<00:04:55.419> I<00:04:55.840> think<00:04:55.870> having<00:04:56.259> free

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
and in my opinion I think having free

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.869 
and in my opinion I think having free
players<00:04:56.830> in<00:04:57.009> the<00:04:57.099> game<00:04:57.129> was<00:04:57.460> pretty<00:04:57.639> awesome

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:57.879 
players in the game was pretty awesome

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:59.850 
players in the game was pretty awesome
but<00:04:58.449> yeah<00:04:58.569> he's<00:04:58.779> saying<00:04:59.020> that<00:04:59.199> he<00:04:59.289> wanted<00:04:59.800> to

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
but yeah he's saying that he wanted to

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.709 
but yeah he's saying that he wanted to
add<00:05:00.069> more<00:05:00.400> things<00:05:00.430> into<00:05:01.029> the<00:05:01.120> game<00:05:01.389> like<00:05:01.689> the

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:01.719 
add more things into the game like the

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:03.540 
add more things into the game like the
rest<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.229> crew<00:05:02.469> did<00:05:02.740> but<00:05:02.979> there<00:05:03.159> wasn't<00:05:03.370> enough

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
rest of crew did but there wasn't enough

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.240 
rest of crew did but there wasn't enough
time<00:05:04.060> but<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.750> good<00:05:04.990> news<00:05:05.020> on<00:05:05.439> this<00:05:05.650> is<00:05:05.919> about
