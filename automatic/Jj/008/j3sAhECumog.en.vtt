00:01:43.350 --> 00:02:23.850 

and<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.360> way<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:46.630> killed<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.380> enemy

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.890 

there's<00:02:24.860> one<00:02:25.159> final<00:02:25.370> step<00:02:25.610> now<00:02:26.360> we<00:02:26.420> must<00:02:26.720> do<00:02:26.870> a

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
there's one final step now we must do a

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
there's one final step now we must do a
final<00:02:27.700> computation<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:31.129> result<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.640> all<00:02:31.760> this

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
final computation the result of all this

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.470 
final computation the result of all this
operations<00:02:33.920> must<00:02:34.159> be<00:02:34.250> multiplied<00:02:34.849> by<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
operations must be multiplied by the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:55.170 
operations must be multiplied by the
multiplier

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.910 

the<00:02:56.180> multiplier<00:02:56.750> will<00:02:57.050> increase<00:02:57.410> two<00:02:57.590> times

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
the multiplier will increase two times

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.160 
the multiplier will increase two times
three<00:02:58.370> if<00:02:58.550> you<00:02:58.730> kill<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.090> enemy<00:02:59.420> more<00:02:59.990> than

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
complicated so we should simply keep in

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.370 
complicated so we should simply keep in
