 abandonment that counts including and its abundant suites in the usa and foremost 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.590
 an actor that developers to offer surveillance devices 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.509
 look good in 1990 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.209
 Greece has managed to impress more than one player through 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.339
 graphics that were literally full the tuque 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.099
 and it's not so much part of these plants used so 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.599
 very smart in the first half 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.509
 the goal of the game was to empty a snake through water prepayments in 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.349
 which had to show a maximum of small colored balls in order to 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.599
 move on to the next stage 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.610
 I could play two very rhythmic music games give a charm 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:34.920
 incontestable 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.510
 foucher had promised a lot as his mechanical originality of some 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.570
 costs race today still it's not super current 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.210
 the names of the piles of bonuses to pick up as sales extension the criticism 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.440
 was going faster clock that adds time or the classic of 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.530
 additional 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.790
 he negotiates the trapped options 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.840
 because this time 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.690
 at the end of each level a constant effort was needed to balance 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.690
 signatories is enough little balls 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.930
 I won the right to move to the next stage 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.910
 the world is actually a kind of turn that was the youngest son had arrived 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.880
 at some levels nowadays most of them know lower levels 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.570
 already explored 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.930
 the incredible difficulty of the game was related to the presence of a stress in the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.070
 Limited time and playability is often imprecise 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.870
 some passages were particularly striking there is 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.150
 more than the players all that dementia crisis especially in front of 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.720
 ice levels with their room completely on me 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.300
 but with a little practice we learn to control his snake 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.300
 and passing for me 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.800
 with its three-quarter line and its well-known playing music by young people 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.109
 and good cards in hand 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.099
 when we start playing we do not leave thirty years of goodwill there is 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.140
 for example no bar of life but as soon as a snake has been touched 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:48.550
 loses part of his body 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.810
 it's a race the club celebrates 40 years 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.810
 a single solution it takes a lot of the little ball 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.640
 there is a competitive spirit between the two players to know which one will have 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.590
 the best scorer of the group I favor cooperation 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.120
 on the other hand as the difficult passages arrive more virtuosity of the 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.960
 handle a good spirit brawler day is not necessarily easier this 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.960
 second round of a question of his calculated to the nearest millimeter 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.099
 to each type of laval and his own sister is 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.099
 these inflatable structures 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:27.480
 as the first level is nice all full so it gets banged badly 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:31.049
 in the second he did not want any more blaise while finding the day are becoming 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.559
 more vivacious and acts 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:35.589
 the monsters are more numerous and fast the delicate passages for 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.589
 celebrate the number of victims of this type 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.149
 for that all the other customers the torch of his predecessor 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.919
 downright annoying 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:49.629
 after losing a girl your factor will reappear more beautiful life 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:50.759
 will be beautiful until the 20th 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:55.069
 sometimes it blows in a statement hello galley to get out of 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.449
 some situations sometimes one wonders if one prefers to be at 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.819
 restart all levels directly rather than having to rebuild your life 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.819
 totally finished 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.140
 because of his great difficulty he did not win the big success 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.380
 that's a shame because there was a potential for madness there is a 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.279
 concept that could have pleased 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.329
 in any case even if it must remain only in the memories of what the 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.349
 love coast drums very colorful writing very funny piles of 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.819
 little things that wants to make interesting like the enemies that 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.409
 evolves goulard and alba was in order 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.549
 and then there are lots of secret passages of the bonus level 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.549
 in fact the first level is excellent but after that becomes too difficult 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.159
 I still think I might like the players who knew at the time 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.110
 on the a9 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.759
 but the others will go their way 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.239
 more serious to catch up
