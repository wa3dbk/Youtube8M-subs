you my three t22 it doesn't look much
like<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.340> real<00:01:56.630> 3022<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:57.899> studs<00:01:58.229> solenoid

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
like a real 3022 but studs solenoid

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.580 
like a real 3022 but studs solenoid
boxes<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.759> can<00:01:59.909> tell

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
so the no ones aren't all perfect

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.900 
so the no ones aren't all perfect
I've<00:02:06.420> had<00:02:06.780> any<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.350> don't<00:02:07.590> want<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.459> perfect

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
them but the only way you can see the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.610 
them but the only way you can see the
solenoid

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
solenoid

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.280 
solenoid
so<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.340> 3t<00:02:14.940> 22<00:02:16.459> sake<00:02:17.459> 3<00:02:17.760> 2<00:02:17.879> 3<00:02:17.909> 2<00:02:18.360> 22<00:02:18.930> whatever
