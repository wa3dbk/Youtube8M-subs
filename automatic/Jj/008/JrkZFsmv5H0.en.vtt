here<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> animation<00:02:03.810> does<00:02:04.079> look<00:02:04.320> fluid

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
here but the animation does look fluid

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.410 
here but the animation does look fluid
and<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.860> love<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.369> way<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.670> backgrounds<00:02:06.240> look

flying<00:02:26.689> penguin<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.500> guess<00:02:28.040> that's<00:02:28.250> kind<00:02:28.310> of

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
flying penguin I guess that's kind of

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.890 
flying penguin I guess that's kind of
true<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:28.760> didn't<00:02:29.120> really<00:02:29.299> think<00:02:29.480> about<00:02:29.629> that

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
true I didn't really think about that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.559 
true I didn't really think about that
until<00:02:30.079> this<00:02:30.379> episode<00:02:30.439> this<00:02:31.430> flying

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
until this episode this flying

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.440 
until this episode this flying
penguin<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.439> flying<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.670> it's<00:02:34.790> called<00:02:34.970> Peggy

penguin is flying and it's called Peggy

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.899 
penguin is flying and it's called Peggy
I<00:02:35.480> just<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:36.170> thought<00:02:36.859> penguins<00:02:37.099> could<00:02:37.400> fly

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
I just I thought penguins could fly

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.879 
I just I thought penguins could fly
is<00:02:38.599> there<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> breed<00:02:39.139> of<00:02:39.260> penguins<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.739> could

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:39.889 
is there a breed of penguins that could

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.589 
is there a breed of penguins that could
fly<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:40.310> could<00:02:40.909> have<00:02:41.000> swore<00:02:41.180> they<00:02:41.329> were<00:02:41.420> just

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
fly I could have swore they were just

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.390 
fly I could have swore they were just
flightless<00:02:42.049> creatures<00:02:42.439> and<00:02:42.680> Antarctica<00:02:43.220> I

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
flightless creatures and Antarctica I

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.910 
flightless creatures and Antarctica I
honestly<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.150> did<00:02:44.389> if<00:02:44.540> I'm<00:02:44.689> incorrect<00:02:44.870> let<00:02:45.799> me

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
honestly I did if I'm incorrect let me

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.500 
honestly I did if I'm incorrect let me
know<00:02:46.069> I<00:02:46.250> could<00:02:46.519> be<00:02:46.700> wrong<00:02:46.879> but<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.180> could<00:02:47.420> have

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
know I could be wrong but I could have

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.659 
know I could be wrong but I could have
swore<00:02:47.750> penguins<00:02:48.260> couldn't<00:02:48.500> fly<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.220> this<00:02:49.430> is

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:49.669

I'm gonna laugh my ass off but either
way<00:02:53.569> I<00:02:53.870> like<00:02:54.409> this<00:02:54.650> episode<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.310> was<00:02:55.370> mainly

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
way I like this episode it was mainly

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.599 
way I like this episode it was mainly
meant<00:02:56.120> there<00:02:56.359> to<00:02:56.599> show<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.230> danger<00:02:57.799> of<00:02:58.010> espers

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
meant there to show the danger of espers

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.069 
meant there to show the danger of espers
that's<00:02:58.819> exactly<00:02:59.269> what<00:02:59.359> I<00:02:59.419> think<00:02:59.599> this<00:02:59.720> episode

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
that's exactly what I think this episode

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.809 
that's exactly what I think this episode

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
obvious and at the same time it looks

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.140 
obvious and at the same time it looks
like<00:04:06.979> they<00:04:07.159> could<00:04:07.340> give<00:04:07.459> different<00:04:08.000> type<00:04:08.120> of

powers you can't really choose what

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.080 
powers you can't really choose what
power<00:04:09.560> it<00:04:09.769> gives<00:04:09.889> you<00:04:10.129> it<00:04:10.430> seems<00:04:10.729> like<00:04:10.790> it's

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
power it gives you it seems like it's

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.089 
power it gives you it seems like it's
random<00:04:11.569> which<00:04:11.720> is<00:04:11.989> cool<00:04:12.290> but<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.889> big<00:04:13.069> thing

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
season in my opinion but it is a very

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.930 
season in my opinion but it is a very
good<00:05:30.900> series<00:05:31.199> and<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.650> know<00:05:31.710> it<00:05:32.099> has<00:05:32.280> some<00:05:32.669> form

watching anime but it doesn't have a lot
this<00:05:36.750> is<00:05:36.930> definitely<00:05:37.289> an<00:05:37.470> interesting<00:05:37.680> series

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
this is definitely an interesting series

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.490 
this is definitely an interesting series
and<00:05:38.580> we<00:05:38.639> don't<00:05:38.880> normally<00:05:39.150> get<00:05:39.599> anime<00:05:40.169> like

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
and we don't normally get anime like

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.710 
and we don't normally get anime like
