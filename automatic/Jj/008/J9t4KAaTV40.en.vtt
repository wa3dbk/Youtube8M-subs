00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.510

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.610

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.000
 to see all the things that I have in the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 bag usually the bags that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.559
 I use are in this style shopping bag 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.940
 which are bags between large medium 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.559
 because good you are going to see that I take a 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.840
 lots of things but really all 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.430
 which I carry are because I need them and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.469
 me unless I carry a little bag like that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.020
 little boy although I propose to put 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.930
 less things in the end I fill them and weigh 4 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.480
 tons 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.980
 where is it that I look at it from h &amp; m yes but 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.050
 have a lot of time to this bag 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.060
 You will have 45 years at least you already 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.220
 I have destroyed by the way but I 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.670
 love because it is very big very comfortable 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.170
 and the handle cortita month easier 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.060
 to take and put it here then 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.950
 well this bag I use it a lot 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.320
 although it is super crushed you are going to see 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.050
 I like to carry bags that do not have 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.580
 many compartments are you see then 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.479
 the bag is divided as in two 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.860
 parts everything that I carry within this 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.740
 organizer that this is great this is 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.540
 of frame art and it's great because you 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.100
 allows you to change your bag with lots of 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.190
 ease because you have everything here 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.320
 it's just putting and putting this in your bag and 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.149
 then the other part that are of the things 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.479

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.149

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.880

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.790
