00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello friends welcome once more to 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.980
 our channel life art 20 today 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.139
 we will make a monster decoration 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.180
 comegalletas I have seen many ideas about 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.060
 but decides to adopt and make a 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.490
 little more original and different about the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.380
 I think it's very nice I hope you like it and 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.569
 let's see what we're going to need and how 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:40.380
 we're going to make a blue color glaze 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:43.590
 aquarium I must enamel black glaze like 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.750
 skin color for glaze cookies 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.890
 white voice for the eyes 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:56.790
 it was going to be a tough hard to start 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.790
 to apply a base on all your nails 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.630
 good already having you placed on this nail 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.500
 the color black 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.759
 the others with two layers of blue 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.159
 I took advantage of let dry about five minutes 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.240
 and meanwhile clean the excesses and 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.240
 that's how we do well 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.380
 let's start making the monster and 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.590
 make the cookies then for the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.890
 monster use a blue that is a bit 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.010
 clearer to highlight more with the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.620
 color of nails 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.680
 Let's start by making toquecitos 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.060
 all the center of the nail 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.700
 from this we will apply two layers 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.950
 so that the color is much stronger 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.840
 and more alive 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.840
 and so we are seen unweathered 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.590
 our team 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.610
 and leave it 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:08.050
 while letting it dry you take a color 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.050
 skin or see how you have it and also 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.580
 and we are going to learn how to make cookies 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.420
 in this nail of the center we are going to make a 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.740
 I dot the whole corner of the nail like that and 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.270
 the same thing on this finger we're going to do 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.690
 a 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.560
 two 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.870
 3 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.870
 and 4 to resemble cookies 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.540
 and let it dry 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.150
 well while it dries we will do the same 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.150
 with a white enamel 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.269
 for the eyes then we will place two 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.269
 dots 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.720
 well I've let it dry let's make it 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.840
 the chips to our cookie with this 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.210
 enamel digits or golden dots and so on 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.800
 it's going to look like they 're the chips of the 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.800
 streets are going to place a dot 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.790
 and with a stick 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.790
 it does distribute 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.709
 so that it is also the light color 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.709
 mixed with golden glitters 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.060
 well and there is our first cookie 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.640
 ok so are all our cookies and 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.640
 let's continue with the dots 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.040
 black eyes that are the ones that do 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:54.010
 the little mouth will only fuck 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.010
 a pincelito and I will start to mark 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.400
 so with dots 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.630
 doing it with dots this will allow 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.350
 that looks like a bit of a mess and a little 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.350
 messy 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.329
 well and that's how you see us in our 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.070
 monster biscuits the last thing 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.540
 let's do when I'm a little 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.730
 dry is to apply the drying blotting that 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.780
 will cover it will protect it and it will make this 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.780
 last much longer 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.639
 good guys this has been all for today 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.590
 I hope you liked it good and 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.659
 I also take this opportunity to 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.659
 send greetings to the happy life channel
