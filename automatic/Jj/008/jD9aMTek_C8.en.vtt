students<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.859> think<00:00:17.160> when<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.880> have<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.090> look

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
students I think when you have to look

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.150 
students I think when you have to look
at<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.660> message<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.439> sends<00:00:19.650> when<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.949> don't

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
at the message it sends when you don't

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.920 
at the message it sends when you don't
ask<00:00:20.460> those<00:00:20.640> questions<00:00:21.090> which<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.600> think<00:00:21.810> it

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
ask those questions which I think it

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.269 
ask those questions which I think it
kind<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.170> conveys<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.470> message<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:23.070> number

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
kind of conveys the message that number

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.310 
kind of conveys the message that number
one<00:00:23.490> either<00:00:24.090> nothing<00:00:24.689> outside<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.199> those

around we're going at we're attending

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.750 
around we're going at we're attending
classes<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.420> we<00:02:17.510> should<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:17.810> the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
classes and we should have the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.339 
classes and we should have the
opportunities<00:02:19.760> as<00:02:19.880> other<00:02:20.170> students<00:02:21.170> on

campus<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.310> know<00:02:22.430> why<00:02:22.670> would<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.330> not<00:02:23.510> want

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
campus you know why would you not want

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.140 
campus you know why would you not want
to<00:02:23.930> have<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.349> available<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:25.250> think<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.880> if

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
to have that available I think that if

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.680 
to have that available I think that if
we<00:02:26.180> ask<00:02:26.720> students<00:02:27.620> these<00:02:27.860> questions<00:02:28.610> then<00:02:28.940> we

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
we ask students these questions then we

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.630 
we ask students these questions then we
can<00:02:30.230> see<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.580> know<00:02:31.700> data<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.660> shows<00:02:32.989> on<00:02:33.640> that

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
can see you know data that shows on that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.759 
can see you know data that shows on that
we<00:02:34.910> have<00:02:35.120> maybe<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.750> higher<00:02:37.180> population<00:02:38.180> of

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
we have maybe a higher population of

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.640 
we have maybe a higher population of
LGBT<00:02:39.769> students<00:02:40.430> than<00:02:40.610> we<00:02:40.640> originally<00:02:40.849> thought

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
LGBT students than we originally thought

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.680

and<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:43.519> you<00:02:43.700> know<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:43.849> don't<00:02:44.120> realize<00:02:44.660> that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
and you you know you don't realize that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.720 
and you you know you don't realize that
you<00:02:44.900> even<00:02:45.079> have<00:02:45.349> a<00:02:45.380> guard<00:02:45.680> up<00:02:45.890> until<00:02:46.459> you're<00:02:46.610> in

down<00:02:48.110> it's<00:02:49.069> a<00:02:49.160> building<00:02:49.519> block<00:02:49.640> for<00:02:49.760> where<00:02:50.120> we

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
down it's a building block for where we

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.440 
down it's a building block for where we
want<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.569> get<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.549> so<00:02:52.549> this<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:52.819> absolutely

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450
