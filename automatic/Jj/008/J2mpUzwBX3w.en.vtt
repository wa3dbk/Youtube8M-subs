00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.270
 They are the first further sales force station wagon with thrifty 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.669
 Diesel engines torque rich and naturally storage space without etc 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.800
 none of the wish lists at the top of the list is the Audi rs6 Award 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.170
 with him the Ilberstedter fight took place against market leader Mercedes 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.409
 Benz team hotel 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.349
 These let these are not just practical values ​​of the driver 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.349
 their high village on 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.550
 that also fits the new BMW 5 Series Touring just introduced 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.730
 be valid 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.910
 Downside of the top dog is the price 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.610
 under 34 thousand euros is nothing 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.030
 The resourceful boss of the company welcomes the question at the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
 Field service tourist and still well to the destination 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.620
 7 a possibility of Opel Signum the classless Rüsselsheimer has the genes 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.020
 to filter in the now unusual for Opel re4 the upper class with good 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.710
 200 kmh top and a competitive price 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.960
 from 25 thousand euros 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.030
 the overpowering opponent Augie or 6 even with the smallest engine 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.360
 he offers in almost all features of the problem if 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.300
 just barely 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.110
 In addition, more and more did not work 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.770
 however, the a6 Avant and also a third more expensive than the Rüsselsheimer 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.740
 becomes 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.220
 8600 Euro price advantage 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.150
 one to zero for Opel 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.770
 in maintenance, however, the Rüsselsheimer is then on the pilgrimage site 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.750
 Newcomer 6 liters more consumes higher tax because of the larger displacement 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.530
 and a three-fold higher the Kasko class qualify the price advantage 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.530
 something here 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.050
 different ways to be Bondi 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.360
 the sweeping rounded shapes of the a6 stands to defeat the massive look 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.360
 to counter 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:37.759
 under the hood a 2 2 times 2 liter turbo diesel with 125 HP 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.009
 and so there is good progress ahead NFL 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.169
 however, the throttle response could be a little more spontaneous 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.169
 and even a quick problem is not his thing 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.659
 Another shortcoming is the callous and quite indirect steering 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.689
 especially in fast corners, Braum's driving fun comes from the head 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.689
 The circuit, on the other hand, offers no cause for complaint 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:16.949
 less displacement and more power there is the audit 130 hp worry here wrong 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.449
 although the objective differences are to benefit the spontaneous 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:31.349
 Throttle response and the revving the eyes Subjectively simply agile reimbursed 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.879
 the steering six pleases directly around and winding country roads provide for 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.229
 Driving pleasure is 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.229
 for the circuit is really only a word 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:47.339
 Opel Opel against Audi one on one 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:55.089
 in the open interior expects the driver for a good 2300 euros extra songs 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:58.599
 styled can be adjusted electrically to any body size 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.159
 The memory function even remembers the position of the inside mirror 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.249
 in height and length adjustable the handy steering wheel 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.639
 although the front seats are at the very back, the fund offers the rest 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.949
 Space that smells like s-class &amp; Ko the singer Marc can the 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.949
 Move back seat 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.980
 The Audi ten seats each can be electrically adjusted in height 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.140
 Persons over 1 90 find however only after a longer search a suitable 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.249
 seating position 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:37.249
 Standard also here the completely adjustable steering wheel 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.040
 in the second row the a6 offers much less space than the victory now 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.039
 promptly for Opel 2 to 1 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:52.270
 in the Audi buttons and switches would be high quality and the surcharge 

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:55.309
 Cruise control is easy to operate on the stable turn signal lever 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.040
 Unlike when they are taken here, the cruise control is fumbling at the turn signal lever 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.069
 Nevertheless, it can make a very stable impression 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.279
 The flashing itself is very hard to get used to 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:13.269
 all too easy to set when trying the turn signal to make them the same 

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:16.809
 again on the other side because the switch lacks impression scores 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:19.809
 Mid position indicates two by two 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.400
 Between 365 and 1000 410 liters of storage space can be found in the rear of the Opel 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.870
 thanks to the well thought-out construction, a level is created well 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.870
 usable pike square area 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.949
 up to 1000 590 liters fit in the a6 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.089
 however, it is less usable by the city halls narrowed storage space 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:44.089
 if he goes in the lead 2 to 3 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.529
 favorable pragmatist or first English master 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.529
 for which of the two should one wish 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.990
 For the Audi speak clearly the state and still economical engine 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.889
 paired with the direct steering and the customer chassis 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.120
 You should not forget the good image, but you also have to 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.120
 paid dearly 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.740
 he looks convinced now by his form searched and the cheap 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.639
 base Price 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.009
 which are partly weaknesses 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.790
 Indirect steering and its spontaneous engine initially throw you can 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.219
 but get used to it quickly 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:24.679
 in the question in which of the two is the right for field workers as 

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:26.689
 the answer is therefore fast 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:28.270
 he is cheaper and more practical 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.700
 Buying a private car, on the other hand, could be more likely on the 6th 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.790
 of course, provided the necessary change
