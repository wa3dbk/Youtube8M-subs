00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.680
 eye of it all mythology I think it says 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.220

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.220
 Internet 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.360
 enabled mythological ayo how would his 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.560
 translation in Spanish that I think would be 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.830
 the era the era of mythology the game 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.340
 It is in its gold version and the lake 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.930

 with its expansions which is that of the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.380
 titans and not the two seasons that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.980

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.300
 [Music] 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.180

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.250
 I will leave two files one that weighs 700 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.720

 they took him means they give him download 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.020
 they wait and they keep it in their pressure 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.530
 aspect after he left it 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.580
 unzip we are truly going to extract 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.880
 here the folder will not create a folder 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.460
 contains two images did the crack and the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.649
 serial recommending opening the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.440
 instructions that would be this or already 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.039
 achieve these are the the serial for the 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.039
 game game 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.650
 let's ride it let's ride it myself 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.900
 my case I will use the ultra iso 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.200
 there are videos of the ultraism of how 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.330
 use the one of the future 120% and in my case 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.670
 the ultra did if they have ultraism and 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.840
 Well then I'll leave it the same I'll leave the 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.030

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.030
 departmental in the ok they give him to ride 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.850
 in units 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.970
 if you do not get the auto reproduction 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.659
 they will have to go to the pc 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:07.240
 we run through here is the exxon sector 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.240
 because we execute it at lecce 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.430
 installation by starting the button 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.359

 it would be this we copy it 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.200
 and we paste it you have to pay it step by 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.440
 step I'm going to write it to not 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.830
 efe ks rs 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.880

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.160
 the installation the mental action program 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.450
 can not interrogate had a 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.650
 shared file update that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.110
 seagate 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.110
 calculating hard disk space 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.690
 and the installation will begin during 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.790
 installation process will ask us for the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.670
 cid and the cd-2 true 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.420
 and pause the video until you ask 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.350
 the finger c 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.400
 to show them what they should do 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:45.570
 ok here is already asking me is the yield

 the loan of the game true to press 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.760
 in accepting what now ultraiso without 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.460
 close the rest we just do the step 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.280
 1 to disassemble the unit 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.580
 to mount it in the virtual drive here 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.910
 is zero and we will accept and as 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.910
 they will see 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.820
 the installation but will continue what am I going to 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.550
 pass again so as not to do so long 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.640
 the video and so boring 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.090
 and we'll see each other when they're so good here 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:24.330
 It is already 100% and being installed , and 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.330
 creating the icons on the desktop 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.969
 we can close this here is already 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.949
 installed true now let's copy 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:38.439
 in the instructions copied the 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.749
 files these files and paste it into the 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:43.439
 installation path must be replaced 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:43.439
 for the originals 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.759
 this and this 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.870
 let's go to the installation path 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.510
 for the options of microsoft 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.660
 I the microsoft games program because 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.480
 here is the era of mythology that 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.740
 now talk here are the two file 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.289
 that we should simply replace what 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.169
 we paste here in the folder 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:19.149
 we give you copy and replace copy and 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:22.159
 replace ready we have the game 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:25.759
 created and ready to play with all the 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:27.229
 expansions pause the video and I have to 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.479
 use another program to record inside 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:34.479
 of the game so we'll see each other there to 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.479
 show it since it works 100% 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:54.070
 [Music] 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.220
