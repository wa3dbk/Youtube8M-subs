00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.070
 Moin Moin together and welcome so a minimum drop Hamburg 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.680
 are in a direct shoots UKE 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.239
 So today I have this around 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.190
 Chocolate milk bars in shock for shock 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.219
 for you 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.669
 something had already happened to them 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.509
 and percents he says if I'm one of these I'm this chicken 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.480
 Facts really nice presentation 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.080
 to have in Borken 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.929
 unless 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.960
 this one I'll be right on boxing and then cool Ebun if you can 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.119
 may say so 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.750
 I will now put away this pack 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.140
 and then we're just starting to break in, because I'm for it 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.710
 this about 30 inches long 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.340
 Join the chef 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.290
 then we start with this answer c you have to be very careful about Dante 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.350
 because you can easily injure the product or the packaging is not seer 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.650
 is thick 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.380
 I will head to the page here 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.660
 And that is very careful so I do not break anything 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.750
 we cautiously eat up their side 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.750
 in the oven body way of course 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.480
 where we are here 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.240
 now we see that dissolves 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.800
 Bezina is easy to pull out with an elegant on 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.090
 ahead 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.720
 and Dortmund 1 4 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.110
 this flap 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.640
 up 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.530
 and percent if we have something else because we just do it 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.650
 it works great 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.620
 so "Now that's up to me and down 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.420
 This allows the product without problems 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.170
 where excuse me 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.390
 Remove from the pure packaging 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.930
 so 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.030
 If we look the game loose the remaining packaging traded 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.070
 so the white cross get away again 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.770
 Now we see here the product of this SchÃ¶neck Schuch org hedgehog 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.960
 Big is then Kolat like me 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.680
 until now can see with one 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.210
 should be a park relief the OMV out looks very nice 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.230
 First of all, if we check the consistency of this chocolate bar 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.930
 the me now to the video in the again this 30 centimeters long kitchen knife 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.490
 and if it is about vocational schools 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.490
 Price yourself here this chocolate chips 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.849
 but now it's running smoothly "thank you for being mine 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:15.969
 by 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.109
 for the first time way again 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.539
 and around 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.729
 look up here 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:24.869
 "It's easy to play, but that does not matter now 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.499
 we see in the middle of this beautiful I suppose it is a corner Meisch 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.019
 Marcel 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.499
 she conjures up the art as well as hard 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.499
 and I would try my chocolate first 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:42.859
 very nice 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.859
 that is also very appealing the chocolate has a very good quality 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.499
 and the future menu would be completely hers 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.989
 If I just go ahead with the product a bit 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.989
 I apologize for any noise 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.169
 Now do not plan with her 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.809
 Really great 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.979
 in the entrance with the chocolate 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.979
 No Yes 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.539
 was great 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:16.520
 really a Zuber printed product Super taste b 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.650
 not rare 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.659
 zty chocolate harmonize well with each other 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.389
 I really could not imagine it better 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:24.689
 so 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.069
 because you feel like giving the website of you in the self 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.789
 I do not have them ready 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:33.129
 and maybe soon something 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.909
 With the Contador was short I can do the job 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.190
 capitalized 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.930
 also a bit weird because I also do not know why the data is -4% 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.289
 Percent discount on the various products 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:49.279
 she just stops by and looks like this and all this boxing 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:53.460
 and Milupa and I look forward to this issue 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.030
 Precision goodbye
