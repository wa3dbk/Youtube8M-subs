00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
know that that we're all equal and then

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.510 
know that that we're all equal and then
the<00:02:55.900> dogs<00:02:56.230> matter<00:02:56.620> to

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.020 

I

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:14.270
