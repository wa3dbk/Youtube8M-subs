the<00:03:37.480> pain<00:03:37.770> it's<00:03:38.770> a<00:03:38.890> much<00:03:39.040> better<00:03:39.280> feel<00:03:39.580> than

the previous model it actually drives

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.990 
the previous model it actually drives
better<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.920> can<00:03:42.190> say<00:03:42.370> that<00:03:42.400> because<00:03:42.640> I've<00:03:42.850> had

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
better I can say that because I've had

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.060 
better I can say that because I've had
two<00:03:43.240> of<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.510> previous<00:03:43.870> ones<00:03:44.080> now<00:03:44.680> my<00:03:44.860> average
