this<00:00:51.600> place<00:00:51.840> actually<00:00:52.050> closed<00:00:52.410> down<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
this place actually closed down for a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.479 
this place actually closed down for a
few<00:00:52.980> years<00:00:53.430> because<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:54.180> lack<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.690> manpower

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
few years because they lack of manpower

few years because they lack of manpower
reason<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.610> stuff<00:00:56.879> survived<00:00:57.329> was<00:00:57.629> because

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
reason this stuff survived was because

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.410 
reason this stuff survived was because
somebody<00:00:59.010> bought<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.460> machinery<00:00:59.879> generally

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
somebody bought this machinery generally

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.299 
somebody bought this machinery generally
they<00:01:00.570> rent<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.050> machinery<00:01:01.440> out<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.129> is

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
they rent this machinery out but this is

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.219 
they rent this machinery out but this is
very<00:01:02.609> unique<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.600> only<00:01:03.660> machine<00:01:03.899> which

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
very unique it's the only machine which

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.719 
very unique it's the only machine which
is<00:01:04.350> five<00:01:04.619> back<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.010> everything<00:01:05.339> else<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
is five back to everything else if I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
is five back to everything else if I
melted<00:01:06.030> down<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.240> scrap<00:01:06.420> iron<00:01:06.840> they'd<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
melted down for scrap iron they'd have a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.649 
melted down for scrap iron they'd have a
couple<00:01:08.250> people<00:01:08.430> per<00:01:08.729> machine<00:01:08.939> they'd<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.630> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
couple people per machine they'd have a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.539 
couple people per machine they'd have a
machinist<00:01:10.200> walking<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> line<00:01:10.890> constantly<00:01:11.490> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
machinist walking the line constantly a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.010 
machinist walking the line constantly a
couple<00:01:11.760> engineers<00:01:12.150> those<00:01:12.330> machine<00:01:12.659> goes<00:01:12.810> down

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
couple engineers those machine goes down

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
couple engineers those machine goes down
they<00:01:13.260> got<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.590> back<00:01:13.830> online<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.939> all

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
they got to go back online because all

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060 
they got to go back online because all
these<00:01:15.210> machines<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.840> were<00:01:15.900> synced<00:01:16.320> up<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.680> we

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
these machines they were synced up so we

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.890 
these machines they were synced up so we
got<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.310> machine<00:01:17.580> doing<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:18.000> thing<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.750> has

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
got one machine doing one thing it has

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.240 
got one machine doing one thing it has
to<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.049> ready<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> next<00:01:19.740> machine<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.220> the
