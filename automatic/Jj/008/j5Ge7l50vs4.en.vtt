00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.610
 hello hello today we are going to see how it is mounted 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.289
 a cable for a television antenna 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.730
 it's as simple as here we have a 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.339
 coaxial cable that is where you are going to 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.619
 travel the signal that is composed of in 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.940
 the center of everything has a nucleus of 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.550
 copper that is where the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.350
 television that is the television signal 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.930
 then outside it has a cover 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.060
 plastic that protects you so that you do not 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.670
 comes in contact with an outer mesh 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.399
 of metal that then has what it does 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.409
 that mesh is to protect the signal so that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.909
 there is no interference and then comes 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.219
 the plastic shell that we see by 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:40.140
 well that 's the first part of the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.179
 cable then we have the connectors in 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.739
 this case is a male then there is also 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.659
 the same in female or at best 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.499
 we need two males that already depends on 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.499
 how is our installation 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.680
 how is this connector if we 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.220
 we remove 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.860
 and we open it we see that it has inside 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.380
 a screw that this the only thing there 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.330
 what to do is cut the cable from the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.030
 way we 're going to see now we put the 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.910
 wire the core in this hole with the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.409
 screw we tighten the housing 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.259
 of the connector we tighten 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.569
 the closure so that this is fixed and so 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.329
 simple like that materials that we're going to 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.969
 need scissors to cut the cable and 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.069
 the plastic housing is what 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.299
 the core covers a screwdriver for 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.819
 tighten the screw that fits 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.490
 fixed and if we have spare the core there 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:34.099
 that cut pliers seen 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.490
 materials and what we're going to do hands 

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:36.490
 to the work 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.690
 the first step we need to cut the 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.310
 casing with scissors 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.770
 it must be said of these cables that how much 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.900
 shorter the better because the more 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.870
 cable beech more resistance will offer 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.670
 to the signal and will lose quality 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.590
 we will start to see more the thermal the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.950
 tele and we'll say what happens because it looks so 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.969
 wrong 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.969
 because of this 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.450
 we're fine this is the mesh that said 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.780
 with a braided copper mesh that 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.650
 protects the core that is inside this 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.650
 we pull it back 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.590
 well as we group it here 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.500
 and that's it, now what you have to do is 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.200
 proceed to cut the metal part without 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.270
 get to cut the nucleus with some 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.770
 scissors good if you want let's go 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.770
 opening the collector 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.200
 to go calculating where we have to 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.200
 cut 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.660
 it could be right here 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.860
 we cut around here more or less we leave 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.140
 this distance you do not learn much because 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.660
 remember the core of the cable is 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.250
 in 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.620
 this is the kernel core beige 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.210
 important in the metal fence thrown 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.800
 backwards well that there is no 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.000
 loose thread that I came in contact with the 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.330
 core because if you can not create 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.920
 interference and it's going to be a cable 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.930
 frightful horrible 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.069
 so what you have to do is the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.069
 core gets into the little hole 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.190
 we loose the screw so that it does not remain 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.630
 loose before anything you have to see if 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.069
 we need to cut the nucleus here in 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.850
 this case I have spent in the lowered 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.430
 too much because we can to make it 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.110
 Safer we can make the housing 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.110
 from this plastic reach the 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.410
 edge to the top because in this case 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.360
 like the past 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.830
 it's better to go than to stay short like that 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.090
 that short with a plier 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.790
 I check again 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.569
 and this is another thing how could 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.569
 cut a little more 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.630
 A) Yes 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.099
 and now it hurts and I see that perfect 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.230
 then first step that we always get 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.060
 forget when we do some of this stuff 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.560
 the bottom part of the connector because yes 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.450
 we put the connector and then we can not 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.240
 screw we have to remove it again 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.560
 and it is a nuisance 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.470
 now what you have to do is what 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.810
 next we take the mesh we squeeze 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.820
 right there that stays hidden in the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.650
 cable this does not happen as long as 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.000
 do not come into contact with the nucleus 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.930
 nothing happens 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.930
 we put it 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.430
 in the collector hole 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.820
 now with the screwdriver we tighten the 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.820
 screw 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.400
 very strong that does not move 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.900
 we put the rear part of the connector 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.580
 we climb 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.580
 what will be the connector closure 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.569
 and as simple as that we already have the 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.749
 prepared connector 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.749
 with this we could already watch television 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:59.749
 perfectly
