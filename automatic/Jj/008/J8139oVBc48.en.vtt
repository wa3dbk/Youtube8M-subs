00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
well the first math sure was fun but I

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.030 
well the first math sure was fun but I
want<00:00:04.710> something<00:00:04.920> with<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.190> little<00:00:05.339> more<00:00:05.490> in

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
want something with a little more in

what's this
the<00:00:08.760> second<00:00:09.179> glitch<00:00:09.360> we're<00:00:09.570> testing<00:00:09.900> has<00:00:10.110> to

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
the second glitch we're testing has to

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.589 
the second glitch we're testing has to
do<00:00:10.380> with<00:00:10.500> flinging<00:00:10.950> Mario<00:00:11.340> insane<00:00:11.940> distances

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
do with flinging Mario insane distances

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.450 
do with flinging Mario insane distances
using<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.110> momentum<00:00:13.380> from<00:00:13.710> flip-flopping

actually is also in the first world I
didn't<00:00:25.350> even<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.949> purpose<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.400> was

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
didn't even do this on purpose I was

expecting to have to beat far more of
the<00:00:28.920> game<00:00:29.099> but<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.760> fact<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.779> first

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
home feed me and then you feed him a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.270 
home feed me and then you feed him a
bunch<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.490> then<00:01:09.320> he<00:01:10.320> decides<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
a planet for you our galaxy actually now

a planet for you our galaxy actually now
the<00:01:22.049> whole<00:01:22.290> premise<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.430> glitch<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
the whole premise of this glitch is that

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.120 
the whole premise of this glitch is that
you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.479> use<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.990> flipping<00:01:25.439> platforms<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you can use the flipping platforms to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.310 
you can use the flipping platforms to
actually<00:01:26.460> launch<00:01:26.729> yourself<00:01:27.320> incredible

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
actually launch yourself incredible

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.249 
actually launch yourself incredible
distances<00:01:28.950> what<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.570> run

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
distances what you have to do is run

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.380 
distances what you have to do is run
towards<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.890> hole<00:01:32.070> here<00:01:32.369> or<00:01:32.520> any<00:01:32.850> hole<00:01:33.150> for

that matter as long as it starts on a
non<00:01:35.070> flipping<00:01:35.460> platform<00:01:35.880> run<00:01:36.600> towards<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
non flipping platform run towards it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.710 
non flipping platform run towards it
right<00:01:37.619> before<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.009> fall<00:01:38.280> off<00:01:38.570> flip<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
right before you fall off flip the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.359 
right before you fall off flip the
platforms<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:43.369> immediately

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
platforms like that and then immediately

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.550 
platforms like that and then immediately
you'll<00:01:45.060> sort<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.360> get<00:01:45.540> caught<00:01:45.810> underneath<00:01:46.229> it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
you'll sort of get caught underneath it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.100 
you'll sort of get caught underneath it
right<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:48.060> coming<00:01:48.149> up<00:01:48.540> right<00:01:48.840> before

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
right and as it's coming up right before

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.730 
right and as it's coming up right before
it<00:01:49.890> finishes<00:01:50.850> its<00:01:51.240> ascent<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.710> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it finishes its ascent you have to do a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.130 
it finishes its ascent you have to do a
long<00:01:53.040> jump<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.030> problem<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.930> this

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
long jump so the problem with this

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.069 
long jump so the problem with this
particular<00:01:56.329> glitch<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.659> problem<00:01:57.960> with

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
particular glitch the problem with

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.260 
particular glitch the problem with
testing<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.219> fail<00:01:59.520> obviously

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.719 

you<00:02:03.270> die<00:02:03.509> because<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:05.040> over<00:02:05.399> at

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
you die because as you can see over at

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.530 
you die because as you can see over at
the<00:02:05.880> edge<00:02:06.000> here

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the edge here

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.080 
the edge here
there<00:02:07.469> ain't<00:02:07.619> nothing<00:02:08.069> except<00:02:08.459> beautiful

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
there ain't nothing except beautiful

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.330 
there ain't nothing except beautiful
space<00:02:09.360> alright<00:02:10.020> let's<00:02:10.200> try<00:02:10.289> it

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
space alright let's try it

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.059 
space alright let's try it
whoa<00:02:12.000> okay<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.200> don't<00:02:13.500> know<00:02:13.650> if<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.920> was

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
whoa okay so I don't know if that was

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.640 
whoa okay so I don't know if that was
successful<00:02:14.640> but<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.239> did<00:02:15.569> long<00:02:15.840> jump<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.470> I

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
successful but I did long jump and I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.110 
successful but I did long jump and I
didn't<00:02:17.069> notice<00:02:17.220> anything<00:02:17.640> happening

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
didn't notice anything happening

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.250 
didn't notice anything happening
actually<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.720> know<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.840> never<00:02:19.080> actually

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
actually you know I never actually

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.140 
actually you know I never actually
thought<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.620> would<00:02:19.830> have<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.950> bust<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.730> glitch

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
thought I would have to bust a glitch

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.760 
thought I would have to bust a glitch
even<00:02:21.540> though<00:02:21.660> we're<00:02:21.840> called<00:02:22.020> egg<00:02:22.290> Buster's

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
even though we're called egg Buster's

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.500 
even though we're called egg Buster's
the<00:02:22.800> name<00:02:23.280> I'll<00:02:23.489> explain<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.940> name<00:02:24.090> later<00:02:24.239> I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
the name I'll explain the name later I

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.940 
the name I'll explain the name later I
didn't<00:02:25.080> think<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.290> would<00:02:25.349> actually<00:02:25.500> ever<00:02:25.800> have

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
didn't think I would actually ever have

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.860 
didn't think I would actually ever have
to<00:02:26.069> bust<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.489> but<00:02:26.790> based<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.209> result<00:02:27.660> it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
to bust one but based on that result it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.550 
to bust one but based on that result it
felt<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.860> long<00:02:29.250> jumped<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:31.080> don't<00:02:31.290> know

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
felt like I long jumped and I don't know

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.229 
felt like I long jumped and I don't know
we'll<00:02:31.769> try<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.010> again<00:02:32.569> hope<00:02:33.569> that<00:02:33.780> didn't<00:02:33.989> work

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
we'll try it again hope that didn't work

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.790 
we'll try it again hope that didn't work
nope<00:02:36.269> that<00:02:36.900> didn't<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.319> anything<00:02:39.650> well<00:02:40.650> we'll

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
nope that didn't do anything well we'll

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.650 
nope that didn't do anything well we'll
try<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.010> again<00:02:41.099> we'll<00:02:41.819> see<00:02:42.000> maybe<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.540> know

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
try it again we'll see maybe you know

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.970 
try it again we'll see maybe you know
maybe<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.989> just<00:02:43.110> have<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.380> jump<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.650> little<00:02:43.860> bit

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
maybe you just have to jump a little bit

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.900 
maybe you just have to jump a little bit
later<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.690> life<00:02:45.690> cycle<00:02:46.640> not<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.760> life

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
later in the life cycle not the life

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.979 
later in the life cycle not the life
cycle<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.680> whoa

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
cycle it whoa

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.259 
cycle it whoa
okay<00:02:51.989> well<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:53.220> lends<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.730> little<00:02:54.030> bit<00:02:54.150> of

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
okay well that lends a little bit of

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.690 
okay well that lends a little bit of
credence<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.930> because<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:55.920> didn't<00:02:56.489> long

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
credence to it because I didn't long

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.490 
credence to it because I didn't long
jump<00:02:57.060> but<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.299> I<00:02:57.330> accidentally<00:02:57.840> hit<00:02:57.900> Z<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.380> then

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
jump but I I accidentally hit Z and then

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.039 
jump but I I accidentally hit Z and then
a<00:02:58.739> which<00:02:58.980> does<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.400> backflip<00:03:00.030> here<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.569> I

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
a which does this backflip here and I

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:18.170 
a which does this backflip here and I
went<00:03:01.260> really<00:03:01.830> high<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.650> maybe<00:03:17.400> if<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.820> just<00:03:18.000> do

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
went really high so maybe if I just do

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.910 
went really high so maybe if I just do
it<00:03:18.329> properly<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.870> did<00:03:19.290> do<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.620> little<00:03:19.739> bit

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
it properly I did do it a little bit

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.069 
it properly I did do it a little bit
closer<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.549> end<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> flip<00:03:21.420> up<00:03:21.570> cycle

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
closer to the end of the flip up cycle

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.470 
closer to the end of the flip up cycle
so<00:03:22.980> no<00:03:23.340> maybe<00:03:23.519> let's<00:03:23.820> see<00:03:24.000> let's<00:03:24.209> see<00:03:24.299> I'm

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
so no maybe let's see let's see I'm

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.060 
so no maybe let's see let's see I'm
gonna<00:03:24.600> run<00:03:24.780> out<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.079> sort<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.320> an<00:03:25.440> angle<00:03:25.859> here

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
gonna run out it's sort of an angle here

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.890 
gonna run out it's sort of an angle here
you'll<00:03:26.790> see<00:03:26.940> if<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.060> can<00:03:27.180> get<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.359> to<00:03:27.480> flip<00:03:27.780> me

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
you'll see if I can get it to flip me

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.199 
you'll see if I can get it to flip me
all<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.170> way<00:03:28.260> across<00:03:28.760> all<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.910> way<00:03:30.030> over

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
all the way across all the way over

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.720 
all the way across all the way over
there<00:03:31.489> alright<00:03:32.489> ready

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
there alright ready

nope that's not right
nope<00:03:36.660> nope<00:03:36.900> nope<00:03:37.049> spin<00:03:37.290> again<00:03:37.470> spinning<00:03:37.739> okay

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
nope nope nope spin again spinning okay

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.009 
nope nope nope spin again spinning okay
don't<00:03:38.609> run<00:03:39.000> towards<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.540> don't<00:03:39.780> know<00:03:39.840> if<00:03:39.959> you

that is glitch confirmed

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.520 
that is glitch confirmed
obviously<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.239> didn't<00:03:48.540> do<00:03:48.630> anything<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.350> help

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
happens because I didn't expect it to

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.930 
happens because I didn't expect it to

I<00:04:14.110> don't<00:04:15.110> see<00:04:15.290> if<00:04:15.350> we<00:04:15.410> can<00:04:15.530> do<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.710> on<00:04:15.770> this<00:04:15.890> next

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
I don't see if we can do it on this next

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.250 
I don't see if we can do it on this next
one<00:04:16.340> because<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:17.239> problem<00:04:17.810> we're<00:04:18.049> gonna<00:04:18.140> have

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
one because the problem we're gonna have

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.380 
one because the problem we're gonna have
now<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:18.799> if<00:04:19.010> this<00:04:19.160> is<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.430> only<00:04:19.760> galaxy<00:04:20.030> you

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
now is if this is the only galaxy you

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.820 
now is if this is the only galaxy you
can<00:04:20.450> do<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.930> in<00:04:21.700> if<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:23.630> can't<00:04:23.930> get<00:04:24.110> over<00:04:24.140> these

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
can do it in if you can't get over these

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.300 
can do it in if you can't get over these
I<00:04:25.510> mean<00:04:26.510> you're<00:04:26.900> not<00:04:26.990> gonna<00:04:27.140> have<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.680> fun<00:04:28.040> day

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
I mean you're not gonna have a fun day

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.470 
I mean you're not gonna have a fun day
because<00:04:28.730> obviously<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:30.350> will<00:04:30.590> die<00:04:31.480> alright

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
because obviously you will die alright

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.760 
because obviously you will die alright
we'll<00:04:32.660> see<00:04:32.810> this<00:04:32.960> will<00:04:33.110> be<00:04:33.140> kind<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.530> test

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
we'll see this will be kind of the test

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.900 
we'll see this will be kind of the test
as<00:04:33.920> to<00:04:33.950> whether<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.310> can<00:04:34.460> use<00:04:34.580> it<00:04:34.730> as<00:04:34.880> a

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
as to whether you can use it as a

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.450 
as to whether you can use it as a
legitimate<00:04:35.800> speedrunning<00:04:36.800> technique<00:04:37.220> I

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
legitimate speedrunning technique I

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.520 
legitimate speedrunning technique I
doubt<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.480> I<00:04:38.600> don't<00:04:38.840> think<00:04:38.900> I'm<00:04:39.110> gonna<00:04:39.200> make<00:04:39.410> it

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
doubt it I don't think I'm gonna make it

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.320 
doubt it I don't think I'm gonna make it
over<00:04:39.650> these<00:04:39.890> I<00:04:40.160> think<00:04:40.460> that's<00:04:40.640> just<00:04:40.850> gonna<00:04:41.060> be

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
over these I think that's just gonna be

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.960 
over these I think that's just gonna be
a<00:04:41.560> zap<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.800> death<00:04:43.100> but<00:04:43.400> we'll<00:04:43.550> see<00:04:43.760> we'll

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
a zap and a death but we'll see we'll

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.990 
a zap and a death but we'll see we'll
see<00:04:44.000> what<00:04:44.240> we<00:04:44.330> can<00:04:44.480> accomplish<00:04:44.690> here<00:04:46.000> okay

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
see what we can accomplish here okay

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.260 
see what we can accomplish here okay
that<00:04:47.150> wasn't<00:04:47.300> right<00:04:47.570> why<00:04:48.080> oh<00:04:48.790> wait<00:04:49.790> there<00:04:50.060> was
