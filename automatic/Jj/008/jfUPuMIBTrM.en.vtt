00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.710
 in the field is our future 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.840
 ap by rural sector 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.399
 It is a production 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:10.679
 all of that color 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.219
 the subsidiary 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.219
 full 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.979
 photo ap 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.979
 long halo of time 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.030
 with respect to the previous ones 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.080
 we've talked 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.610
 what it is 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.450
 the production of fish in tajamar 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.900
 the producer ordered 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.490
 not to mention 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.900
 just a topic that you have requested 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.880
 that is how they worked in tajamar how to make fish production in 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.940
 tajamar is 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.870
 how many in the field 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.160
 and that is fundamental to have jundolÃ¡ advantage 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.200
 not only the kun omen 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.160
 animals 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
 but also to make fish production advantage 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.869
 the production will weigh you in panama requires some care 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.960
 to be able to have satisfactory results in a holding of ps 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 in a closed aquatic enclosure as it is a tajamar 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.409
 one of the main management that should be considered in this 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.049
 it is full to maintain the water level at a depth according to the requirements 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.420
 which are for the pc 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.689
 that this one in a range of cuneteo and means in average this facilitates to him so that 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.910
 the fish are in a comfort both in winter and in summer photo management I 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.049
 I was so important also thousands taking care of the quality of that water 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.070
 say that we have to take care 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.070
 so that this water does not get to enter a degree of decomposition 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.850
 that is to say that our water does not 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.460
 It must not have any nauseating odor. 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.719
 If this occurs in a tajamar 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.169
 or in a pond float 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.319
 of an indicative that that water is p decomposed and that can create 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.849
 disadvantage in the weak part in this network of fish and can reach 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.109
 cause a mass death 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.589
 another point also of sumat importance 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:27.839
 in a production to present to marc is supplementation with the 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:33.619
 incorporation of ealing cent so that they can gain weight in time and 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:34.439
 shape 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.459
 in the previous program we were watching 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.290
 of the biometrics work to know what is the size of the fish 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.849
 in terms of weight to be able to perform a diet that will be 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.269
 directly related to a fish production to have a 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.760
 techito cabal in pocheon months of a sports production in this case a 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.650
 colic last of pacu with therapy is necessary to make a feeding 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.840
 activision in this case can be giving balance to the eyes of the opposite 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.250
 supplementary feeding with some of their products either from 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.220
 industry or something like just those that expels from the pdl different 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.619
 raw material whether long where steele 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:21.569
 so hopefully among others 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.799
 but it is important to make a mix with other products so we can 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.099
 anticipates joining the pedal the requirements that the bs require for 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.339
 gain the weight 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:33.579
 correspondent 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.589
 you can also be a feed with some farm products like 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:43.489
 can be some grains like corn sorghum or corn is soy 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.809
 among others that can also be taken advantage of and offering 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.099
 Mind that to the fish 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.989
 there we have here after a harvest 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.159
 we have this result that is directly appreciating our 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.049
 they understand 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.849
 pd vintage 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.630
 how are the dry ones a lot of speed there min 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.470
 very appetizing to be able 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.620
 You should take it to a family table or share it with friends and loved ones 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.730
 dear ones
