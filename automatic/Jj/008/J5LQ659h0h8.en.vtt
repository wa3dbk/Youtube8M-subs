wiper<00:00:09.630> switch<00:00:09.929> on<00:00:10.679> an<00:00:10.860> e39<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.240> at<00:00:12.389> my<00:00:12.540> car

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
wiper switch on an e39 this is at my car

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.200 
wiper switch on an e39 this is at my car
is<00:00:12.840> actually<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.170> 546<00:00:13.889> speed<00:00:14.340> sport<00:00:14.790> but<00:00:15.000> I

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
is actually a 546 speed sport but I

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.180 
is actually a 546 speed sport but I
believe<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.780> will<00:00:15.870> work<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.170> any<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> five

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
believe it will work on any of the five

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.140 
believe it will work on any of the five
series<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.880> were<00:00:18.000> built<00:00:18.300> prior<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.760> 99<00:00:20.760> there

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
series that were built prior to 99 there

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.700 
series that were built prior to 99 there
was<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> cut-off<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.109> want<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.350> say<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.529> was<00:00:22.650> a

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
was a cut-off I want to say it was a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.759 
was a cut-off I want to say it was a
three<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.220> 99<00:00:23.699> something<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.480> range<00:00:24.779> this

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
three of 99 something in that range this

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.830 
three of 99 something in that range this
is<00:00:25.920> four<00:00:26.189> cars<00:00:26.430> built<00:00:26.820> prior<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.660> there

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
is four cars built prior to that there

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.939 
is four cars built prior to that there
was<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> change<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.099> switch<00:00:29.519> after<00:00:30.269> that

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
was a change in this switch after that

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.110 
was a change in this switch after that
and<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.160> apparently<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.730> different

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
and it's apparently a different

switch right here in my hand and I had

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.400 
switch right here in my hand and I had
the<00:02:30.730> camera<00:02:31.180> turned<00:02:31.420> off<00:02:31.569> for<00:02:31.780> probably<00:02:32.110> a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
the camera turned off for probably a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.160 
the camera turned off for probably a
minute<00:02:33.129> not<00:02:33.489> even<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:34.060> get<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.330> out<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.049> this

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
minute not even to get this out so this

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.960 
minute not even to get this out so this
was<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.500> top<00:02:35.709> tang<00:02:36.010> she<00:02:36.430> just<00:02:36.610> pushed<00:02:36.819> down

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
was the top tang she just pushed down

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.520 
was the top tang she just pushed down
with<00:02:37.090> your<00:02:37.269> finger<00:02:37.599> and<00:02:37.750> then<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.379> bottom

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
with your finger and then on the bottom

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.589 
with your finger and then on the bottom
Tang<00:02:38.980> you'll<00:02:39.760> probably<00:02:40.090> need<00:02:40.329> to<00:02:40.420> get<00:02:40.569> a

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
Tang you'll probably need to get a

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.509 
Tang you'll probably need to get a
screwdriver<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.349> there<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.709> push<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.099> on<00:02:42.340> that

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
screwdriver in there to push up on that

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.430 
screwdriver in there to push up on that
so<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.090> push<00:02:43.269> up<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.690> push<00:02:43.810> out<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.260> just

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
so you push up and push out and it just

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.839 
so you push up and push out and it just
literally<00:02:44.739> slides<00:02:45.629> right<00:02:46.629> out<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:47.849> this

stay<00:03:48.069> on<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.669> had<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.299> pop<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.660> fuse<00:03:50.010> like<00:03:51.010> a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
stay on and had to pop the fuse like a

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.170 
stay on and had to pop the fuse like a
dumbass<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.910> took<00:03:52.419> the<00:03:52.630> entire<00:03:52.989> wiper<00:03:54.180> assembly

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
dumbass I took the entire wiper assembly

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.990 
dumbass I took the entire wiper assembly
under<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:56.169> hood<00:03:56.349> apart<00:03:56.739> remove<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.760> motor

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
under the hood apart remove the motor

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.599 
under the hood apart remove the motor
took<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.599> motor<00:03:58.900> housing<00:03:59.200> apart<00:03:59.829> thinking<00:04:00.489> it

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
took the motor housing apart thinking it

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.580 
took the motor housing apart thinking it
was<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.790> switch<00:04:01.329> there's<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.840> switch<00:04:02.169> inside

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
was the switch there's a switch inside

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.619 
was the switch there's a switch inside
of<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.769> motor<00:04:02.980> housing<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.940> tells<00:04:04.209> when<00:04:04.510> the

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
of the motor housing that tells when the

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.170 
of the motor housing that tells when the
wiper<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.139> at<00:04:05.290> rest<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:06.010> thought<00:04:06.549> that<00:04:06.760> was<00:04:06.940> bad

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
wiper is at rest I thought that was bad

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.180 
wiper is at rest I thought that was bad
turns<00:04:07.989> out<00:04:08.199> there<00:04:08.349> was<00:04:08.440> nothing<00:04:08.590> wrong<00:04:08.980> with

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
turns out there was nothing wrong with

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.710 
turns out there was nothing wrong with
that<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.720> also<00:04:10.720> replaced<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.819> relay<00:04:12.819> thinking

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
that I also replaced the relay thinking

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.469 
that I also replaced the relay thinking
that<00:04:13.870> might<00:04:14.109> a<00:04:14.139> minute<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:15.459> then<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.239> last

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
that might a minute and then the last

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.140 
that might a minute and then the last
thing<00:04:16.840> is<00:04:17.079> this<00:04:17.320> switch<00:04:17.650> here<00:04:18.160> which<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.910> sure

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
thing is this switch here which I sure

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.459 
thing is this switch here which I sure
as<00:04:19.269> heck<00:04:19.419> wish<00:04:19.599> I<00:04:19.750> would<00:04:19.930> have<00:04:19.959> done<00:04:20.049> first

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:20.469 
as heck wish I would have done first

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.409 
as heck wish I would have done first
because<00:04:20.799> it's<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.099> easiest<00:04:21.489> well<00:04:21.969> the<00:04:22.120> relays

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
because it's the easiest well the relays

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.959 
because it's the easiest well the relays
the<00:04:22.599> easiest<00:04:22.930> but<00:04:23.620> this<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:24.520> pretty<00:04:24.760> easy

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:24.969 
the easiest but this is pretty easy

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:25.470 
the easiest but this is pretty easy

what I did with the motor switch that
was<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.430> that<00:04:28.270> was<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.390> two<00:04:29.260> hour<00:04:29.410> job<00:04:29.770> easy<00:04:30.130> and
