00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
programmed into my multi we okay so I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.880 
programmed into my multi we okay so I
auxiliary<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.729> got<00:01:33.060> barometer<00:01:33.890> delivery

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
auxiliary one I got barometer delivery

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.140 
auxiliary one I got barometer delivery
to<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.130> got<00:01:35.579> GPS<00:01:36.240> home<00:01:36.770> GPS<00:01:37.770> hold<00:01:38.040> that's<00:01:38.880> my

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.810 
to I got GPS home GPS hold that's my
three-position<00:01:39.780> switch<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:41.340> middle<00:01:41.640> would

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
three-position switch the middle would

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.749 
three-position switch the middle would
obviously<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.409> hold<00:01:43.409> down<00:01:44.369> home<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.490> can
