if<00:02:04.289> I<00:02:04.439> was<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.649> lazily<00:02:05.220> just<00:02:05.579> throw<00:02:05.850> this

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
if I was to lazily just throw this

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.449 
if I was to lazily just throw this
technique<00:02:06.600> with<00:02:07.380> my<00:02:07.530> punch<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.920> my<00:02:08.009> low<00:02:08.190> kick

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.120 
technique with my punch of my low kick
and<00:02:08.670> then<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.970> forget<00:02:09.239> about<00:02:09.360> my<00:02:09.630> guard<00:02:10.130> okay

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
and then I forget about my guard okay

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.370 
and then I forget about my guard okay
she<00:02:11.430> could<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:12.150> open<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.080> hit<00:02:13.230> me<00:02:13.349> right
