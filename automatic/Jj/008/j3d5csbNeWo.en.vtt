what's great about like filmmaking now

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.830 
what's great about like filmmaking now
is<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.500> don't<00:02:34.770> need<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.430> huge<00:02:36.209> budget<00:02:36.600> you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
is that you don't need a huge budget you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.400 
is that you don't need a huge budget you
need<00:02:37.050> like<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.650> crazy<00:02:38.870> unstoppable<00:02:39.870> belief<00:02:40.170> in

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
need like a crazy unstoppable belief in

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.260 
need like a crazy unstoppable belief in
your<00:02:40.530> idea<00:02:40.890> like<00:02:41.400> when<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.580> was<00:02:41.640> coming<00:02:41.910> up<00:02:42.120> as<00:02:42.239> a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
your idea like when I was coming up as a

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.479 
your idea like when I was coming up as a
filmmaker<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.750> wasn't<00:02:43.020> like<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.320> i<00:02:43.590> needed

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
filmmaker it wasn't like that i needed

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.940 
filmmaker it wasn't like that i needed
expensive<00:02:45.209> equipment<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.810> gear<00:02:46.680> and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
expensive equipment and gear and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.830 
expensive equipment and gear and
technology<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.060> stuff<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.450> i<00:02:48.510> couldn't

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
technology and stuff that i couldn't

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.660 
technology and stuff that i couldn't
afford<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.470> like<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:50.160> know<00:02:50.220> like

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
afford that I have to like you know like

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.220 
afford that I have to like you know like
I<00:02:50.700> had<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:50.940> raise<00:02:51.120> lost<00:02:51.360> money<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:51.930> start

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
I had to raise lost money to just start

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.040 
I had to raise lost money to just start
so<00:02:52.890> i<00:02:53.100> think<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.610> dynamics<00:02:54.150> are<00:02:54.360> totally

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
so i think the dynamics are totally

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.240 
so i think the dynamics are totally
awesome<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.560> they're<00:02:55.620> totally<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.100> your

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
awesome and they're totally in your

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.620 
awesome and they're totally in your
favor<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.790> should<00:02:56.940> remember<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.300> a

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
favor and you should remember that a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.380 
favor and you should remember that a
question<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.709> often<00:02:58.950> get<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.610> how<00:03:00.090> do<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.270> get

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
question I often get is how do I get

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.420 
question I often get is how do I get
this<00:03:00.930> shot<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.680> one<00:03:01.830> you're<00:03:01.980> watching<00:03:02.160> right

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.080 
this shot the one you're watching right
now<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:03.390> look<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.260> nice<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:05.040> don't<00:03:05.640> think<00:03:05.940> it's

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
now to look so nice I don't think it's

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.449 
now to look so nice I don't think it's
the<00:03:06.239> camera<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.500> lens<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:08.100> gives<00:03:08.280> me

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
the camera it's the lens that gives me

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.729 
the camera it's the lens that gives me
this<00:03:08.640> perspective<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.630> shallow<00:03:10.230> depth<00:03:10.620> of

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
this perspective and shallow depth of

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.920 
this perspective and shallow depth of
field<00:03:10.799> but<00:03:11.580> it's<00:03:11.700> really<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.150> light<00:03:12.450> that

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
field but it's really the light that

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.350 
field but it's really the light that
does<00:03:13.230> most<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.920> work<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.910> week<00:03:15.150> I

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360
