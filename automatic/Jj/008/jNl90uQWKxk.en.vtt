00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
you can just still live with the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.920 
you can just still live with the
graphics<00:02:49.040> compared<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.280> phone<00:02:50.930> then

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
graphics compared to the phone then

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.729 
graphics compared to the phone then
that's<00:02:52.170> fine<00:02:53.540> but<00:02:54.540> on<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> phone<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:57.739> graphics

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
that's fine but on a phone a graphics

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.990 
that's fine but on a phone a graphics
are<00:02:59.070> far<00:02:59.880> superior

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.100 

that's<00:03:06.500> ceramic<00:03:07.500> destroyer
