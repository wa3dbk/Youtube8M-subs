00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
 We are finally 1000 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.010
 the truth is that you wait for 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.410
 very much time this day and honestly 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.230
 When the day finally arrives you do not have 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.780
 the slightest idea that you are going to do 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.100
 least I did not expect when I opened the channel 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.809
 reach the thousand subscribers on youtube 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.820
 and it has been a very difficult and very 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.180
 heavy but I've done it with a lot 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.130
 I like it and I really like it honestly 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.710
 through the passing of days has been 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.860
 increasingly rewarding to be with 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.030
 you and be able to spread and support the 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.340

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.629

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.150
 simpler but record edit think 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.550
 in modernizing day by day so that the 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.880

 to this shot is from the reviews in Spanish 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.700
 when we decide together to improve a 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.810
 little in the quality of the video in the shot 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.970

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.590
 that little by little they were giving me their 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.620
 constructive criticism to improve the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.599

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.709
 comments from you the same comments 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.380
 of the subscribers that were 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.450
 building the canal little by little and it's 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.410
 with this mind maybe you do not remember 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.870
 but the channel started with this take this 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.750
 is the webcam of my laptop where 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.830
 work where he dedicated a part of me 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.500
 time to edit and make new 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.030
 videos for the channel if you are in this 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.519
 channel from the beginning and you're a 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.170
 follower for a long time ago 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.390
 more than a year we open channel 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.569
 Leganese stockings maybe you remember this 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.519
 taking 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.069
 Many things have already happened and they have already 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.579
 past too many events throughout 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.439
 my life and I want you to know because if 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.329
 you are a new subscriber I want you 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.760
 you know that not all the time was high 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.329
 fucking definition you do not accept that 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.159
 that you know that all the time was not 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.560
 reviews do it yourself 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.680
 I'm speech über and all those things 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.939
 that today make up the channel 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.069
 I want you to know that this is the shot 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.650
 original that this was the little 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.859
 accident by which things arose 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.409
 and for which the channel continued to work 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:54.159
 day by day to offer you one of the 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:57.370
 better reviews in Spanish if maybe not 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.709
 you like them if maybe they are not the best 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.099
 of the world but I'll bet you if you're 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.959
 here watching this video is because although 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.780
 the video you do not like it calls you the 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.810
 attention the spirit and that for me is what 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.969
 that matters most because it's not really 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.060
 as much of subscribers neither so much of likes 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:18.009
 not so much comments but the 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.959
 intention when I started recording with 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.519
 is with this camera 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.130
 sometimes in the first videos always 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.740
 was to spread the little I knew of speak 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.599
 touring and the few cubes that had that 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.210
 it's the only thing I want that's why I opened the 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:34.449
 channel to be able to let the 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.240
 Latin people to people in Spain to the 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.910
 people from mexico and a little cubes of 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.099
 rubik in your language in Spanish and it's for 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.009
 that I work every day on the channel 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:48.310
 well and finally we get to the takes 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:51.220
 famous the shots of I am spirit see 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.289

 that were built thanks to you 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.580

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.000

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.480
