00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 good morning to all from not the stefania 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.410
 I hope to make a video this morning 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.480
 very short because if everything works in the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.519
 Within five minutes we finished I 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.670
 I show how I make ice cream 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.199
 fast with fruit in this case a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.910
 strawberry fast because if you already have 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.519
 frozen fruit however at least the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.420
 you need less than five days ago 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.279
 minutes to do it then I leave because 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.890
 I can because having the fridge with the hit 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.140
 maker mutu I have no problem pulling it down 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.690
 a quintal of ice cubes a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.489
 a quintaled flight no but in short one 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.370
 grinds collections 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.660
 the first thing I do especially if 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:53.129
 then you want to quickly consume the ice cream is 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.719
 icing the pot now someone says 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.640
 put it the freezer makes me happy 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.719
 you have a cold store 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.350
 I do not have it 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.260
 so I put at speed 3 and I do it 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.540
 turn a couple of minutes so 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.360
 cool both the blade and the pot 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.450
 in a couple of minutes it is created 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.740
 the condensate should therefore be 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.650
 cool enough not to disassemble e 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.780
 crushed and heat the strawberries that 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.909
 we will go meter glass after it has 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.140
 cooled the tip of see you in 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.790
 about a minute and a half 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.190
 missing a few seconds if 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.440
 at this point where it is frozen it is 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.510
 formed condensation 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.510
 let's read it because there is a known conclusion 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:55.240
 very quickly ice them the most 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.860
 what else 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.720
 be careful not to leave many 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.440
 residues on the bottom 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.750
 because if you don't water it, you will lose it 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.899
 of ice does nothing 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:13.660
 I add these are 100 g of sugar and 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.580
 I made 320 grams of strawberries 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.200
 pieces of iced spa remaining in the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.959
 freezer for at least a week 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.100
 because he had no chance to do it again 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.989
 the generator omitted to freeze with a 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.730
 droplet but very little 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.230
 sugar so that it does not stick 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.500
 candle 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.500
 obviously I prefer using it 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.940
 Havana to knead now because you 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.840
 I love but for a few seconds with the pool e 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.980
 let's make it at strawberry prices 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.980
 slightly smaller 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.840
 little 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.350
 made me work for about one 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.920
 thirty seconds 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.930
 lower if obviously when yes 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.560
 works with high speed ends 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:43.660
 provided that the particles are fired 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:46.400
 on top of the boca to the pot 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.720
 then there seems to be a stand divided by a priest who 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.670
 you call it trentola tax because 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.150
 all your kittens confuse us 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.700
 leave me a comment maybe 5 here 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:03.530
 ok 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:06.500
 and add the cream, I have the cream 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.050
 even this refrigerator outlet 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.760
 of refrigerator means that you have it 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.590
 put at least the day before because three 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.320
 hours in the fridge does not reach me 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.269
 untie the 4 degrees of the refrigerator then 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:23.060
 this is fast if you have the ingredients 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:26.510
 at the right temperature now I do it 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.460
 I work at speed 9 for a couple 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.970
 of minutes 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.970
 usually enough 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:30.160
 we check how and then we give it a 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.160
 shot at maximum speed 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:42.190
 ok there are still small pieces 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:48.800
 however as you can see the 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:54.560
 consistency and my son would say and freeze 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:57.610
 toso and stefano has not a has not suffered 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:02.750
 the adjective uses the noun 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:05.960
 thorny then we see just one 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:09.590
 smoothies na to mix but few 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.370
 seconds can do it directly with 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.370
 turbo button 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:33.790
 now about 10 seconds and ice cream without 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.460
 bits without inclusions is served 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.450
 you can do it with other types of fruit 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.820
 the important thing is that more or less maintained 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:43.180
 the same proportions you set in 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.530
 also a fruit based on the type of fruit 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.530
 like the banana that a little bit more 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.990
 dry maybe put a little less 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.560
 because it releases less liquid than it does 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:58.360
 with strawberry and the rest if you want it 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.400
 you can also refreeze immediately though 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.580
 take it out of the freezer will be 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.650
 cold it will look like a block of ice 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.330
 let it be ten minutes, let it thaw out 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:11.260
 so much so that it becomes perfectly 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:13.090
 eatable someone i read i put the 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.280
 lama 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.020
 the accessory to assemble ice cream not 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.330
 is mounted in my opinion to use the 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.390
 blade for mounting is useless 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:25.630
 then everyone does what he wants 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:28.270
 mantecato mantecato is different from whipping 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:31.390
 See you at the next video I'll wait for you 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:34.260
 on the blog and on the facebook group ciao 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.260
