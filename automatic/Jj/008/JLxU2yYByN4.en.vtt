00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
have to unwrap your UV to do that you

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.609 
have to unwrap your UV to do that you
select<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.020> seam<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.619> your<00:00:19.859> model<00:00:20.279> by<00:00:21.619> selecting

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
select a seam on your model by selecting

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.740 
select a seam on your model by selecting
line<00:00:22.859> basically<00:00:23.670> that's<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> scene<00:00:24.510> where

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
line basically that's the scene where

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.990 
line basically that's the scene where
the<00:00:25.140> model<00:00:25.470> will<00:00:25.590> be<00:00:25.619> laid<00:00:25.949> open<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.460> UV<00:00:26.640> will

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the model will be laid open the UV will

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.290 
the model will be laid open the UV will
be<00:00:27.119> laid<00:00:27.330> open<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:28.019> your<00:00:28.140> model<00:00:28.470> laid<00:00:28.619> flat

be laid open for your model laid flat
I'll<00:00:30.300> open<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> UV<00:00:31.019> panel<00:00:31.590> here<00:00:31.980> this

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
I'll open the UV panel here this

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.930 
I'll open the UV panel here this
existing<00:00:34.320> movie<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:34.829> done<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.219> Project<00:00:35.700> but

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
existing movie was done with Project but

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.700 
existing movie was done with Project but
we<00:00:36.059> get<00:00:36.210> stretching<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> side<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.590> it's

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
we get stretching on the side so it's

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.150 
we get stretching on the side so it's
not<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.129> good<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> scene<00:00:40.500> selected

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
not that good so I have a scene selected

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.190 
not that good so I have a scene selected
here<00:00:41.430> then<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.790> go<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:43.550> selected<00:00:44.809> UV<00:00:45.809> power

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
here then I go to selected UV power

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.369 
here then I go to selected UV power
unwrap<00:00:46.800> Auto<00:00:47.180> now<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.360> lays<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:48.899> flat

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
unwrap Auto now that lays it out flat

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.520 
unwrap Auto now that lays it out flat
but<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.700> not<00:00:51.390> aligned<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> texture<00:00:52.500> I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
but it's not aligned with the texture I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.799 
but it's not aligned with the texture I
want<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.920> use<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:53.520> where<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.120> live<00:00:54.449> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
want to use so that's where the live of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.139 
want to use so that's where the live of
feature<00:00:55.079> comes<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.739> make<00:00:56.550> sure<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:57.000> your

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
feature comes in make sure you have your

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.900 
feature comes in make sure you have your
UV<00:00:57.539> power<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.050> rap<00:00:58.199> live<00:00:58.469> panel<00:00:59.129> open<00:00:59.579> here

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
UV power and rap live panel open here

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.510 
UV power and rap live panel open here
and<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> live<00:01:00.449> button<00:01:00.840> check<00:01:01.260> now<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> first

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
and the live button check now the first

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.600 
and the live button check now the first
thing<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.789> need<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:02.969> do<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.510> set<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.739> pin

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
thing we need to do is set a pin

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.300 
thing we need to do is set a pin
set<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> pin<00:01:06.299> virtus<00:01:06.869> basically<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.740> reword<00:01:08.189> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
set a pin virtus basically you reword it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.539 
set a pin virtus basically you reword it
so<00:01:08.490> i<00:01:08.520> select<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.360> fleck<00:01:09.990> nikohl<00:01:10.439> top<00:01:10.710> part<00:01:11.220> here

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
so i select a fleck nikohl top part here

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.840 
so i select a fleck nikohl top part here
and<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.840> push<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> set<00:01:13.590> button<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> septum<00:01:14.700> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and I push the set button the septum is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.859 
and I push the set button the septum is
pin<00:01:15.920> now<00:01:16.920> whenever<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.549> move<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> these<00:01:18.540> or

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
pin now whenever I move one of these or

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.440 
pin now whenever I move one of these or
more<00:01:19.350> than<00:01:19.590> one<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.770> these<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.549> rest<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
more than one of these the rest of the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.020 
more than one of these the rest of the
unpin<00:01:21.930> movies<00:01:22.439> will<00:01:22.740> automatically<00:01:23.520> fall

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
unpin movies will automatically fall

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.920 
unpin movies will automatically fall
into<00:01:24.330> play<00:01:25.070> which<00:01:26.600> eliminates<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.720> lot<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
into play which eliminates a lot of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.630 
into play which eliminates a lot of
manual<00:01:28.500> adjusting<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.100> would<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.520> do

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
manual adjusting I would have to do

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.109 
manual adjusting I would have to do
otherwise

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
otherwise

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.890 
otherwise
so<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.229> set<00:01:32.189> these<00:01:32.400> append<00:01:32.909> now<00:01:33.270> I'll<00:01:33.420> rotate

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
so I set these append now I'll rotate

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.590 
so I set these append now I'll rotate
them<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.790> you'll<00:01:35.790> see<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> rest<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
them and you'll see the rest of the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.679 
them and you'll see the rest of the
unbanned<00:01:37.110> UV<00:01:37.500> pop<00:01:38.159> into<00:01:38.460> place<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:39.299> your

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
unbanned UV pop into place because your

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.649 
unbanned UV pop into place because your
live<00:01:39.900> button<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:41.070> checked<00:01:41.240> now<00:01:42.240> I'll<00:01:42.390> move

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
live button is checked now I'll move

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.030 
live button is checked now I'll move
them<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:46.020> need<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.229> scale<00:01:46.560> them<00:01:46.799> down<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
them you need to scale them down a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.999 
them you need to scale them down a
little<00:01:49.880> fairly<00:01:50.880> good<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.299> those<00:01:51.619> but<00:01:52.619> now<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
little fairly good for those but now it

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.310 
little fairly good for those but now it
needs<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.610> different<00:01:53.790> top<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.600> bottom<00:01:54.720> so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
needs to be different top to bottom so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.690 
needs to be different top to bottom so
I'll<00:01:56.100> select<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.969> couple<00:01:57.180> other<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.869> key

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
I'll select a couple other in key

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.230 
I'll select a couple other in key
vertices<00:01:59.700> here<00:02:00.409> those<00:02:01.409> two<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.070> I'll<00:02:03.030> add

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
vertices here those two and I'll add

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.429 
vertices here those two and I'll add
them<00:02:03.840> as<00:02:04.140> pin<00:02:05.299> then<00:02:06.299> when<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.659> move<00:02:06.960> them<00:02:07.229> into

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
them as pin then when I move them into

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.809 
them as pin then when I move them into
place<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:09.539> rest<00:02:09.780> will<00:02:10.440> pop<00:02:10.739> them<00:02:11.009> top<00:02:11.580> where

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
place the rest will pop them top where

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:19.960 
place the rest will pop them top where
it<00:02:11.910> goes<00:02:12.120> much<00:02:12.629> closer<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.200> where<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.440> wanted

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:28.270 

you<00:02:20.970> need<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.209> add<00:02:21.300> these<00:02:21.660> also<00:02:22.819> add<00:02:25.069> them<00:02:26.069> over

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
you need to add these also add them over

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.260 
you need to add these also add them over
pretty<00:02:29.280> close<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.760> where<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:29.940> want<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:31.010> one
