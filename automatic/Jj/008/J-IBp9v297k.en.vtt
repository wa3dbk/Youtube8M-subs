00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
I want to talk a little bit today about

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.500 
I want to talk a little bit today about
another<00:00:39.379> cream<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.800> in<00:00:39.920> white<00:00:40.100> room<00:00:40.510> most

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
another cream to in white room most

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.729 
another cream to in white room most
because<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.870> intro<00:00:42.140> has<00:00:42.320> some<00:00:42.530> an

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
because the intro has some an

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.080 
because the intro has some an
interesting<00:00:43.100> rhythm<00:00:43.340> in<00:00:43.430> it<00:00:43.550> it's<00:00:43.850> played<00:00:44.059> in

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
interesting rhythm in it it's played in

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.910 
interesting rhythm in it it's played in
5/4<00:00:44.690> time<00:00:44.930> with<00:00:45.140> some<00:00:45.260> triplets<00:00:45.590> on<00:00:45.739> the

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
5/4 time with some triplets on the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.979 
5/4 time with some triplets on the
second<00:00:46.400> beat<00:00:46.640> I<00:00:46.760> guess<00:00:46.940> that<00:00:47.090> is<00:00:47.210> yeah<00:00:47.420> so

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
second beat I guess that is yeah so

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.930 
second beat I guess that is yeah so
starts<00:00:48.590> with<00:00:48.680> a<00:00:48.710> very<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.340> guitar<00:00:49.640> course

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940

just hits a high notes the electric

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.579 
just hits a high notes the electric
guitar<00:00:53.540> but<00:00:53.780> what<00:00:53.900> I<00:00:53.930> teach<00:00:54.110> people<00:00:54.290> it's<00:00:54.500> on

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
play a little chord and learn a pretty

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.700 
play a little chord and learn a pretty
cool<00:01:01.160> strumming<00:01:01.579> pattern<00:01:01.940> which<00:01:02.540> is<00:01:02.870> which

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
cool strumming pattern which is which

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.520 
cool strumming pattern which is which
introduces<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.220> idea<00:01:04.250> again<00:01:04.729> of<00:01:04.789> a<00:01:05.000> triplet

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
introduces the idea again of a triplet

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.160 
introduces the idea again of a triplet
the<00:01:06.530> first<00:01:06.770> beat<00:01:06.979> is<00:01:07.100> just<00:01:07.250> a<00:01:07.340> down<00:01:07.990> then<00:01:08.990> you

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
the first beat is just a down then you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.260 
the first beat is just a down then you
negative<00:01:09.530> 3<00:01:09.800> equal<00:01:10.280> strokes<00:01:10.550> on<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.910> second

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
negative 3 equal strokes on the second

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.740 
negative 3 equal strokes on the second
beat<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.950> another<00:01:13.520> down<00:01:13.789> on<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.119> third<00:01:14.360> beat

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.880 

this<00:01:17.750> is<00:01:17.869> one<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.170> few<00:01:18.380> times<00:01:18.590> when<00:01:18.860> you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
this is one of the few times when you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.650 
this is one of the few times when you
play<00:01:19.070> triplets<00:01:19.490> in<00:01:19.580> a<00:01:19.640> song<00:01:19.850> that's<00:01:20.330> this<00:01:20.570> is

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
play triplets in a song that's this is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.660 
play triplets in a song that's this is
when<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:20.899> cannot<00:01:21.289> now<00:01:21.530> keep<00:01:22.130> up<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.460> same

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
when you cannot now keep up the same

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.340 
when you cannot now keep up the same
motion<00:01:23.149> going<00:01:23.330> down<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:23.810> up<00:01:23.869> just<00:01:24.110> squeeze<00:01:24.320> a

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
motion going down and up just squeeze a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.580 
motion going down and up just squeeze a
triplet<00:01:24.800> in<00:01:24.890> there<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:26.210> have<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.690> go<00:01:27.289> down

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
triplet in there you have to go down

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.370 
triplet in there you have to go down
town<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.670> then<00:01:28.759> hurry<00:01:29.149> back<00:01:29.539> to<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.140> next

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
town and then hurry back to the next

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.469 
town and then hurry back to the next
town<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.860> is<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.069> beginning<00:01:31.399> of<00:01:31.550> in<00:01:32.330> this

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
town that is the beginning of in this

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.699 
town that is the beginning of in this
case<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.810> third<00:01:32.990> beat<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:33.560> whatever

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
case the third beat and in whatever

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.109 
case the third beat and in whatever
cases<00:01:34.039> it<00:01:34.250> would<00:01:34.340> always<00:01:34.459> be<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.729> next<00:01:34.940> beat

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
cases it would always be the next beat

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.400 
cases it would always be the next beat
so<00:01:35.630> very<00:01:35.840> slowly<00:01:36.110> we<00:01:36.410> have<00:01:36.819> down<00:01:37.819> down<00:01:38.810> up<00:01:39.170> down

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
so very slowly we have down down up down

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.969 
so very slowly we have down down up down
down<00:01:40.720> then<00:01:41.720> we<00:01:41.869> just<00:01:41.990> have<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.319> snow<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.649> on<00:01:42.860> the

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
down then we just have a snow to on the

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.330 
down then we just have a snow to on the
fourth<00:01:43.220> beat<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.910> play<00:01:44.060> them<00:01:44.179> us<00:01:44.270> both<00:01:44.450> down<00:01:45.340> or

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
fourth beat to play them us both down or

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.980 
fourth beat to play them us both down or
down<00:01:46.910> up<00:01:47.240> down<00:01:49.240> none<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.479> that's<00:01:50.690> not<00:01:50.869> too

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
down up down none of that that's not too

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.029 
down up down none of that that's not too
important<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.349> important<00:01:51.619> part<00:01:51.800> about<00:01:51.920> this

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
important the important part about this

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.469 
important the important part about this
one<00:01:52.190> is<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.340> get<00:01:52.459> the<00:01:52.550> feel<00:01:52.759> for<00:01:52.970> triplets<00:01:53.360> on

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
one is to get the feel for triplets on

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.570 
one is to get the feel for triplets on
the<00:01:53.630> third<00:01:53.810> on<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.140> second<00:01:54.470> beat<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:58.340> that's<00:01:58.489> a

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
the third on the second beat so that's a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.699 
the third on the second beat so that's a
high<00:01:58.940> G<00:01:59.270> minor<00:01:59.479> chord<00:01:59.840> played<00:02:00.080> in<00:02:00.229> an<00:02:00.349> a<00:02:00.500> minor

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
high G minor chord played in an a minor

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.800 
high G minor chord played in an a minor
