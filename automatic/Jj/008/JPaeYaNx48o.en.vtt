00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi everyone i have a short moment 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.140
 video just a quick tip 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.660
 I want to show that it goes 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.910
 about it and back up your hair I think 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.130
 that it is always with a comb 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.680
 what you do is you take a strand of hair, the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.500
 pick up a comb and then you go back and forth 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.039
 sliding say with you with you 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.140
 hair root 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.470
 and that way you would actually create it 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.820
 almost kind burdock and then struggle than 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.619
 a little bit more calmly 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.990
 which means that just a lot of volume comes 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.630
 and tapping the ipad is just one 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.030
 technology that is often used 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.020
 but i think that is always with one side 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.670
 but the existing also special toupeer 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 brushes but actually one 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.570
 better solution is to do it 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.850
 with a toothbrush 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.000
 that it once read somewhere and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 I have already given you a number 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.829
 tried it out and goes super well 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.000
 she can show it to you for a moment 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.530
 It is important that you do not have one 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.590
 use your toothbrush 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.359
 grabs him what he often sit still 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.400
 toothpaste remains in so just grab one 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.439
 clean toothbrush I mean occasionally 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.760
 are they just on offer 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.680
 and I grab falls on both eight'll 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.630
 we are not to cost about sister 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.630
 just buy with the action card 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.040
 briefly show you grab a tuft of hair 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.240
 Grab the toothbrush that you put here 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.650
 so down and standards mirror so i can do it 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.009
 not see very well 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.600
 keep it back and forth and if you like that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.820
 each time actually all small 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.060
 tufts of hair 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.060
 does and received a lot of volume 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.680
 mr she really a full bunch with her 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.200
 with it 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.790
 yes when you are done with back care 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.550
 Then you don't get the toothbrush 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.470
 put back at the other toothbrushes 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.660
 but just keep it to your normal 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.649
 hairbrush rubber bands and can you do that 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.240
 This really is just your brush and brush 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.220
 the reason why this works better than one 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.970
 camp because I can really from 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.120
 That 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.740
 teething and a brush a toothbrush 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.230
 he just has that is a lot 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.970
 closer together is also much softer 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.320
 just for your hair just a lot 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.300
 more effective 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.830
 is now a bit in the picture what you can 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.270
 and if you have it tapered 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.850
 just still very briefly a 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.320
 lightly with the comb or with a brush 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:39.020
 so come through but that just by that 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.209
 attack is just nice and up and 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.760
 this is just a very nice basis for that 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.470
 for example if you are going to learn if you 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.100
 now light up then you immediately already 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.959
 a beautiful volume sit in 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.310
 so if you are going to back up try it 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.340
 agree with a clean one 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.600
 toothbrush that is today's tip 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.910
