 Personally, the highlight of the year 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.290

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.469

 It will be an exposure of 8 to 1974 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.930
 It's a rebirth of it, but I could have said that before, but this Inagaki Jiro 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.560

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.970
 To discover it this kind of old good sound source in the event Tteyuu record store day say you Deko 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.310
 To practice 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.010
 There is very much to tell 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.010
 I think Naa hard 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.640
 I would like to hear this first without saying four to five 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.640
 To go 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.439
 voodoo 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.470
 Hmm 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.130
 t 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.620
 air 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.640
 Shin This is Seriously good 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.540
 This is genre-wise jazz rock sky or 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.540
 I think I feel Kuga 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.710
 It 's such would be nice also it has been used in the animation to something Lupine 3 world by song 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.960
 I have a song like that 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.770
 Well first, it is above all 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.550
 Audio interesting 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.800
 Very 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.130
 As I mentioned earlier, it is 1974, so it is a fairly old recording 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.900
 Also 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:03:01.140
 I think mixing isn't it, I think that we have a microphone after each instrument 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.380
 Also I that's exquisite that I mean the to mix the microphone at how much of the volume 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.250
 I think 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.270
 so 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:12.350
 I also feel good tom drum 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.350
 It feels good of the base Fender piano from it 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:26.209
 Hender piano electric piano is written, but the treble of it also feels good 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:28.270
 The say whether Miseru to become or sound it to Fu what it is people are doing to protect 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:33.540
 Is fine 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:37.900
 It will have fangs that kana personality is not it a do or arms of the show office say out 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:43.840
 I think very is e that it six'm funny 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:49.329
 Of course this is definitely a great masterpiece, not to mention I 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.500
 It may be a historical masterpiece, but it is very thankful that it is relapsed in this way 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:58.430
 think 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:03.840
 I have also bought at it is if you if have car but I do not have my car absolute cd 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:08.550
 I feel that I wonder would be comfortable was to the drive one of that night was 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:13.080
 Here it is about 5,000 yen for 4,500 yen. 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:16.290
 When I saw it, three disk unions were still in school 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.549
 I thought that I could sell out my first attack 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.490
 Well But people who are doing it I think because Les schools that it is a matter of time is 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.970
 Not particularly here 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.710
 I think that I want to ask to listen by all means get 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.729
 so 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.090
 How is this compared to the original version of that what is the sound? 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:37.150

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.600
