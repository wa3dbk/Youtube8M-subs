and up and it's off and it's about a few

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.560 
and up and it's off and it's about a few
millimeters<00:03:24.650> thick<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:25.040> aluminum<00:03:25.490> not<00:03:26.360> too

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
millimeters thick of aluminum not too

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.610 
millimeters thick of aluminum not too
heavy<00:03:28.060> but<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.480> still<00:03:29.750> does<00:03:29.900> its<00:03:30.080> job<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.470> set

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
heavy but it still does its job you set

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.860 
heavy but it still does its job you set
that<00:03:30.710> on<00:03:30.770> my<00:03:30.890> bed<00:03:31.130> okay<00:03:32.590> let's<00:03:33.590> fix<00:03:33.890> this<00:03:34.870> all

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
that on my bed okay let's fix this all

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.600 
that on my bed okay let's fix this all
right<00:03:36.110> you<00:03:36.290> have<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.500> power<00:03:36.680> supply<00:03:36.920> obviously

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
right you have a power supply obviously

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.310 
right you have a power supply obviously
on<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.820> bottom<00:03:38.150> which<00:03:38.660> makes<00:03:39.020> it<00:03:39.080> hard<00:03:39.290> for

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
on the bottom which makes it hard for

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.440 
on the bottom which makes it hard for
cable<00:03:39.710> management<00:03:39.760> all<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.820> did<00:03:41.030> was<00:03:41.060> take<00:03:41.300> all

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
cable management all I did was take all

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.700 
cable management all I did was take all
the<00:03:41.540> extra<00:03:41.720> cables<00:03:42.020> and<00:03:42.140> shove<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:42.440> underneath

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
the extra cables and shove it underneath

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.400 
the extra cables and shove it underneath
the<00:03:42.830> fan<00:03:43.310> right<00:03:43.520> there<00:03:44.020> and<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.140> rest<00:03:45.290> were

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
the fan right there and the rest were

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.170 
the fan right there and the rest were
hard<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.680> wire<00:03:45.860> because<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:46.520> eight<00:03:46.730> and<00:03:47.030> up

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
hard to wire because this eight and up

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.330 
hard to wire because this eight and up
here<00:03:47.570> I<00:03:47.720> had<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.230> route<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.410> underneath<00:03:49.220> the

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
here I had to route it underneath the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.450 
here I had to route it underneath the
graphics<00:03:49.730> card<00:03:50.050> underneath<00:03:51.050> my<00:03:51.460> xigmatek

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
graphics card underneath my xigmatek

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.700 
graphics card underneath my xigmatek
120-millimeter<00:03:53.270> rifle<00:03:53.840> cooler<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.380> around

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
120-millimeter rifle cooler and around

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.750 
120-millimeter rifle cooler and around
the<00:03:55.130> sound<00:03:55.910> card<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.470> in<00:03:57.470> there<00:03:57.710> that<00:03:58.580> was

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
the sound card and in there that was

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.780 
the sound card and in there that was
that<00:03:59.030> was<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.210> was<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.660> pain<00:03:59.870> in<00:03:59.960> the<00:03:59.990> butt<00:04:00.140> and

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
that was that was a pain in the butt and

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.650 
that was that was a pain in the butt and
then<00:04:01.790> here<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.210> have<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:04.400> exhaust<00:04:04.790> fan<00:04:05.090> you

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
then here you have the exhaust fan you

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.720 
then here you have the exhaust fan you
have<00:04:05.810> two<00:04:06.170> ports<00:04:06.590> for<00:04:06.770> water<00:04:07.010> cooling<00:04:07.490> if<00:04:07.640> you

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
have two ports for water cooling if you

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.580 
have two ports for water cooling if you
ever<00:04:07.850> decide<00:04:08.240> to<00:04:08.270> go<00:04:08.450> water<00:04:08.660> cooling<00:04:09.050> which<00:04:09.260> I

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
ever decide to go water cooling which I

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.140 
ever decide to go water cooling which I
don't<00:04:10.310> ever<00:04:10.430> decided<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:10.820> that<00:04:11.000> because

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
don't ever decided to that because

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.360 
don't ever decided to that because
that's<00:04:11.360> I<00:04:11.680> paid<00:04:12.680> enough<00:04:12.860> money<00:04:12.890> on<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.190> case

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
that's I paid enough money on the case

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.060 
that's I paid enough money on the case
and<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:14.840> really<00:04:15.020> would<00:04:15.140> not<00:04:15.410> expansion<00:04:15.830> on

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
and I really would not expansion on

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.539 
and I really would not expansion on
that<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.489> up<00:04:17.270> here<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.630> have<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.989> 5.25

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
that and up here you have the 5.25

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.500 
that and up here you have the 5.25
drives<00:04:19.549> phase<00:04:20.510> which<00:04:20.870> you<00:04:20.989> don't<00:04:21.109> have<00:04:21.230> any

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
drives phase which you don't have any

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.620 
drives phase which you don't have any
outtakes<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.660> hold<00:04:23.900> up<00:04:24.110> this<00:04:24.320> hold<00:04:24.830> up<00:04:24.980> the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
outtakes to hold up this hold up the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.960 
outtakes to hold up this hold up the
drives<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.380> have<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.920> hold<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:28.610> up<00:04:28.730> while

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
drives so you have to hold it up while

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.370 
drives so you have to hold it up while
you<00:04:29.060> screw<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.360> in<00:04:29.510> and<00:04:29.690> this<00:04:30.170> would<00:04:30.320> be

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
you screw it in and this would be

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.170 
you screw it in and this would be
because<00:04:30.590> probably<00:04:31.070> if<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.370> get<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.550> something

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
because probably if you get a something

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.330 
because probably if you get a something
that<00:04:32.270> fits<00:04:32.480> two<00:04:32.750> different<00:04:33.170> drive<00:04:33.380> bays<00:04:33.620> so

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
that fits two different drive bays so

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.680 
that fits two different drive bays so
it's<00:04:34.490> not<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.700> obstruct<00:04:34.880> that<00:04:35.210> when<00:04:35.450> you<00:04:35.510> put

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
it's not to obstruct that when you put

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.250 
it's not to obstruct that when you put
it<00:04:35.810> in<00:04:36.730> this<00:04:37.730> motherboard<00:04:38.180> tray<00:04:38.540> is<00:04:38.780> actually

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
it in this motherboard tray is actually

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.170 
it in this motherboard tray is actually
fully<00:04:39.620> removable<00:04:40.150> from<00:04:41.920> this<00:04:42.920> whole<00:04:43.280> extent

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
fully removable from this whole extent

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.020 
fully removable from this whole extent
of<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.810> 120<00:04:45.230> millimeter<00:04:45.590> fan<00:04:45.890> down<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:46.850> about

of the 120 millimeter fan down to about

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.440 
of the 120 millimeter fan down to about
the<00:04:47.180> top<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.510> pc<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.560> power<00:04:49.430> supply<00:04:49.670> holes

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
the top of the pc the power supply holes

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.340 
the top of the pc the power supply holes
completely<00:04:50.810> out<00:04:50.930> you<00:04:51.050> can<00:04:51.140> put<00:04:51.260> your

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
completely out you can put your

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.260 
completely out you can put your
motherboard<00:04:52.010> on<00:04:52.130> there<00:04:52.340> without<00:04:52.550> even<00:04:52.850> moving

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
motherboard on there without even moving

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.960 
motherboard on there without even moving
