00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:17.580
 very good this is the first video 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.630
 of the first week of training 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.420
 to run 10 kilometers at last and to my 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.720
 coach gave it to me and during the following 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.090
 two months we are going to walk doing what 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.850
 this training has been 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.910
 to be able to run 10 kilometers before 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.190
 everything is necessary to do the following 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.440
 remember that previously you 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.870
 they must have run or trained to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.390
 run a 5-kilometer race if 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.300
 for the first time they want to run for 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.800
 first time they will exercise 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.890
 after a long time this 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 training is not for you in my 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.340
 channel there is a training of four 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.320
 speech videos of running 5 kilometers and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.780
 on that occasion 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.600
 this you should do as such 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.360
 if they already ran the 5km then 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.020
 you can do the 10 km but 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.320
 good as you can get to see both the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.500
 date today is Friday November 23 and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.180
 the start of this training is 26 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
 November 2012 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.729
 then week after week we will go 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.310
 talking about the previous week what is it 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.700
 what needs to be done next week 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.800
 to be able to do this and we started 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.000
 then we started with torture 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.210
 the first on Monday is 45 minutes trot 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.830

 a minute and a half in climb plus 15 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.100
 minutes they remember we run a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.020
 minute and a half up and when you reach 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.189
 and at the end of this minute and a half 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.140
 we walked to it to the point where 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.900
 we start and go back up four 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.920
 times to do again at the end 15 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:16.180
 jogging minutes Wednesday 45 minutes 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.520
 trot at 6 minutes step Thursday this is 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.280
 something complicated but anyway is 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.239
 important that your first talk 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.230
 jog 15 minutes and then we do 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.510
 an exercise the farley farley theme like 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.319
 so what it does is that going to do 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.709
 the next thing we're going to run 300 meters to 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.550
 everything we see and the next 300 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.670
 meters are going to be a soft trot 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.299
 if to rest so that to return to 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.160
 do again 300 then four times 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.670
 what we are going to do is forgiveness 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.300
 300 meters to everything we see 300 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.750
 meters soft and so we do four 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.500
 times as you can see here there is a 222 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.580
 by four are 88 times from 300 meters to 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.800
 everything we can 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.620
 finishing with 300 meters soft 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.580
 ending these eight exercises of the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.360
 farley we do 15 minutes in a trot on 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.870
 Friday 45 minutes jog to step 6 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.390
 minutes on Saturday we make 7 km at the pace of 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.940
 5 minutes all 50 seconds and 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.000
 we finish on Sunday with a break 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.570
 As you can see, they are 55 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.070
 we take them to 0 55 axes and days 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.890
 of exercise in which we are going to do 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.370
 before running the 10 kilometers to 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.710
 term of each of these careers 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.960
 these trainings we have to do it 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:55.600
 the measurement of breathing to 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.990
 term and one minute later if it 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.360
 agree on the recovery 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.500
 is simply put into this formula 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.820
 our 220 your age in this case I 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.720
 I'm 42 years old, my 100 percent are 178 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:16.440
 in 36 are 29 points 67 pulsations is 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.440
 10 seconds 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.550
 23 points 73 beats every 10 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.870
 seconds are a quiet run is the 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.270
 call cruise where they can 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.070
 talk without stopping quietly should 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.740
 walk approximately 80% 26.70 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.260
 pulsations every 10 seconds equals 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.330
 a hectic run is the so-called step 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.090
 career should go a little hectic 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.200
 is approximately 90 percent 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.580
 so here is a series of 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.610
 instructions 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.470
 forgiveness which you can read and 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.010
 you can execute to be able to do 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.380
 your career now there is something very important 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.810
 if you feel that this 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.170
 training is very hard for you 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.050
 at the end of this week and it is very smooth 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:06.470
 please contact look through 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:10.220
 of the YouTube comments of the video 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.860
 so that I in turn put a plan 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.080
 of training according to how you feel 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.750
 if this training is excellent for 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.790
 you leave it if it enters the plan 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.080
 of training is difficult for you 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.919
 I upload a new one 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.050
 milder if it's very easy there was one that 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.419
 be more difficult for you and with what 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.319
 which you can go better but good 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:38.389
 every week I'll talk about this and I'll 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.389
