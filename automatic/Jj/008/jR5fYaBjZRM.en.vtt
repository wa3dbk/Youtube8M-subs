00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
needle and pray so the first material of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.920 
needle and pray so the first material of
course<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.710> gemstone<00:00:23.189> beads<00:00:23.460> which

amethyst these are pearls and then

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.069 
amethyst these are pearls and then
another<00:00:33.840> material<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:35.030> is<00:00:36.030> popular<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:36.809> are

lots of colors and sizes and it gives

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.330 
lots of colors and sizes and it gives
you<00:00:43.170> more<00:00:43.260> flexibility<00:00:43.739> because<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.219> all

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you more flexibility because that all

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.819 
you more flexibility because that all
the<00:00:44.520> holes<00:00:44.760> are<00:00:45.059> very<00:00:45.530> calibrated<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.680> they're

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the holes are very calibrated so they're

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.850 
the holes are very calibrated so they're
all<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.670> same<00:00:47.700> size<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.469> easier

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
all the same size so you can it's easier

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.580 
all the same size so you can it's easier
to<00:00:50.280> choose<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.270> stringing<00:00:51.750> material<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.469> it

to choose the stringing material that it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.350 
to choose the stringing material that it
goes<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.160> then<00:00:53.940> another<00:00:54.210> popular<00:00:54.930> item

of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> beads<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.409> determine<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.250> stringing

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
of the beads to determine your stringing

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.209 
of the beads to determine your stringing
material<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.990> example<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> few

material so for example I have a few
different<00:01:59.610> types<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.210> things<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
different types of things here the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.959 
different types of things here the
stringing<00:02:01.770> material<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.159> depends<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
stringing material really depends on the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.810 
stringing material really depends on the
beads<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.270> choose<00:02:03.719> normally<00:02:04.290> most

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
beads you choose normally most

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.119 
beads you choose normally most
traditional<00:02:05.820> jewelry<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.570> strung<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.259> silk<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
traditional jewelry is strung on silk so

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.220 
traditional jewelry is strung on silk so
this<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> great<00:02:08.789> product<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.420> has<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
this is a great product as it has the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.290 
this is a great product as it has the
silk<00:02:11.590> cord<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.519> comes<00:02:12.700> with<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.879> needle<00:02:13.180> so

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
silk cord and it comes with a needle so

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.089 
silk cord and it comes with a needle so
that's<00:02:13.450> very<00:02:13.599> easy<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.319> just<00:02:14.349> go<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.709> pick

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
that's very easy you just go you pick

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.619 
that's very easy you just go you pick
your<00:02:15.780> silk<00:02:16.780> cords<00:02:17.200> color<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.069> size<00:02:18.790> according

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
your silk cords color and size according

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.380 
your silk cords color and size according
to<00:02:19.659> the<00:02:19.870> size<00:02:20.049> of<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.560> holes<00:02:20.769> of<00:02:21.010> your<00:02:21.220> bead<00:02:21.400> so

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
to the size of the holes of your bead so

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.660 
to the size of the holes of your bead so
that's<00:02:22.629> for<00:02:22.900> something<00:02:23.349> more<00:02:23.590> like<00:02:23.920> gemstones

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
that's for something more like gemstones

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.220 
that's for something more like gemstones
where<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.450> want<00:02:25.599> drapey<00:02:28.019> sort<00:02:29.019> of<00:02:29.080> more

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
where you want drapey sort of more

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.380 
where you want drapey sort of more
polished<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.069> you<00:02:30.129> would<00:02:30.340> put<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:30.819> silk

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
polished so you would put that on silk

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.960 
polished so you would put that on silk
then<00:02:32.379> if<00:02:32.739> you<00:02:33.040> have<00:02:33.280> something<00:02:33.610> that's<00:02:33.760> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
then if you have something that's a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.820 
then if you have something that's a
little<00:02:34.120> heavier<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:35.290> would<00:02:35.500> use<00:02:35.650> something

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
little heavier you would use something

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.509 
little heavier you would use something
like<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.129> beadalon<00:02:36.700> product<00:02:37.269> which<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.519> metal

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
like a beadalon product which is metal

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.789 
like a beadalon product which is metal
on<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.640> are<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.239> tons<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.409> tons<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.650> like

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
on it are like tons and tons of like

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.619 
on it are like tons and tons of like
little<00:02:42.040> wires<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.760> then<00:02:43.120> it's<00:02:43.239> all<00:02:43.329> wrapped

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
little wires and then it's all wrapped

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.740 
little wires and then it's all wrapped
in<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.349> nylon<00:02:44.920> coating<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:45.879> you<00:02:45.970> would<00:02:46.299> you<00:02:46.660> know

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
in a nylon coating so you would you know

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.869 
in a nylon coating so you would you know
it<00:02:47.110> come<00:02:47.319> ups<00:02:47.500> also<00:02:47.739> comes<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.129> sizes<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.730> it

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
it come ups also comes in sizes and it

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.110 
it come ups also comes in sizes and it
also<00:02:49.090> comes<00:02:49.629> in<00:02:49.900> different<00:02:50.319> weight<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.970> you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
also comes in different weight that you

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.180 
also comes in different weight that you
need<00:02:52.329> to<00:02:52.480> choose<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.079> comes<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.829> this<00:02:53.980> one

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
need to choose so it comes so this one

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.580 
need to choose so it comes so this one
for<00:02:54.220> example<00:02:54.489> comes<00:02:55.030> with<00:02:55.269> a<00:02:55.420> gold<00:02:55.930> nylon

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
for example comes with a gold nylon

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.170 
for example comes with a gold nylon
coating<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.970> one<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.709> seven<00:02:59.709> strands

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
coating and this one is seven strands

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.530 
coating and this one is seven strands
seven<00:03:01.180> strands<00:03:01.629> of<00:03:01.950> why<00:03:02.950> your<00:03:03.129> inside<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:04.359> this

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
seven strands of why your inside so this

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.030 
seven strands of why your inside so this
is<00:03:04.750> good<00:03:04.959> for<00:03:04.989> something<00:03:05.440> like<00:03:05.590> metal<00:03:05.920> bead

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
is good for something like metal bead

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.650 
is good for something like metal bead
because<00:03:06.340> metal<00:03:06.609> beats<00:03:06.760> on<00:03:06.910> silk<00:03:07.239> it'll<00:03:07.480> cut

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
because metal beats on silk it'll cut

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.089 
because metal beats on silk it'll cut
the<00:03:07.810> silk<00:03:08.049> whereas<00:03:08.500> if<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.769> use<00:03:08.799> something

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
the silk whereas if you use something

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.069 
the silk whereas if you use something
like<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:09.430> it'll<00:03:10.120> be<00:03:10.239> able<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.569> withstand<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
like this it'll be able to withstand the

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.339 
like this it'll be able to withstand the
weight<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.849> withstand<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:13.030> sharp<00:03:13.840> edges<00:03:14.079> of

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
weight and withstand the sharp edges of

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.720 
weight and withstand the sharp edges of
the<00:03:14.709> beads<00:03:14.920> then<00:03:15.430> if<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.609> go<00:03:15.790> with<00:03:16.000> something

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
the beads then if you go with something

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.770 
the beads then if you go with something
larger<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.970> can<00:03:19.000> use<00:03:19.569> um<00:03:19.840> leather<00:03:20.829> of<00:03:21.099> course

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
larger you can use um leather of course

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.259 
larger you can use um leather of course
which<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:22.959> great<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.680> easy<00:03:24.639> because<00:03:25.060> it's

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
which is great and easy because it's

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.520 
which is great and easy because it's
easy<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.540> knot<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.109> don't<00:03:26.260> have<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.410> do

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
easy to knot and you don't have to do

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.460 
easy to knot and you don't have to do
like<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.769> lot<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.209> fussy<00:03:28.209> things<00:03:28.419> with<00:03:28.599> it<00:03:28.720> then

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
like a lot of fussy things with it then

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.589 
like a lot of fussy things with it then
there's<00:03:29.769> also<00:03:29.980> hemp<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.609> that<00:03:30.760> also<00:03:31.000> comes<00:03:31.359> in

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
there's also hemp and that also comes in

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.409 
there's also hemp and that also comes in
different<00:03:31.630> thicknesses<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:33.220> colors<00:03:33.609> and<00:03:33.849> the
