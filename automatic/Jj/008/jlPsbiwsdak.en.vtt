00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
yesterday it's all about basics and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.459 
yesterday it's all about basics and
that's<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.450> wanted<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> started<00:00:46.140> off

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that's what I wanted to do I started off

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.319 
that's what I wanted to do I started off
by<00:00:46.739> pressing<00:00:47.070> some<00:00:47.460> half<00:00:47.700> around<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> walls

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
by pressing some half around the walls

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.680 
by pressing some half around the walls
it's<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.680> really<00:00:50.460> weak<00:00:50.640> point<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.270> me<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it's a really weak point for me when it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.060 
it's a really weak point for me when it
comes<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.020> loads<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.410> don't<00:00:52.620> really<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:53.039> too

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
comes to loads I don't really do too

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.590 
comes to loads I don't really do too
many<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.550> them<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.420> row<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.469> wanted<00:00:56.340> to

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.080 
know what it was but I lost my focus at
this<00:03:00.570> point<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.170> really<00:03:01.470> wasn't<00:03:01.650> up<00:03:02.100> for

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
this point and I really wasn't up for

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.780 
this point and I really wasn't up for
doing<00:03:03.270> many<00:03:03.930> no<00:03:04.110> touches<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.950> felt<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.400> bit<00:03:05.550> tired

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
doing many no touches I felt a bit tired

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.480 
doing many no touches I felt a bit tired
after<00:03:06.150> doing<00:03:06.180> all<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.540> basics<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.680> kinda

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
after doing all the basics so I kinda

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.170 
after doing all the basics so I kinda
just<00:03:08.520> left<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.120> at<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:10.160> decided<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.190> save

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
just left it at that and decided to save

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.910

session<00:03:16.440> ever<00:03:17.030> hopefully<00:03:18.030> I'll<00:03:18.120> get<00:03:18.300> better

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
consistent at it and and I should do it

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.500 
consistent at it and and I should do it
at<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.080> end<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.410> combo<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:47.090> in<00:03:48.090> different
