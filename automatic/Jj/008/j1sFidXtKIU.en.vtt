a<00:00:07.230> previous<00:00:07.890> episode<00:00:08.099> I've<00:00:08.760> talked<00:00:09.030> about<00:00:09.179> how

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
a previous episode I've talked about how

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.290 
a previous episode I've talked about how
the<00:00:09.389> entire<00:00:10.110> solar<00:00:10.740> system<00:00:10.940> collapse<00:00:11.940> down

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
the entire solar system collapse down

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.959 
the entire solar system collapse down
from<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.110> cloud<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.410> hydrogen<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.130> helium<00:00:14.190> left

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
from a cloud of hydrogen and helium left

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.320 
from a cloud of hydrogen and helium left
over<00:00:15.330> from<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.900> Big<00:00:16.080> Bang<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.619> yet<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:18.029> stand

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
over from the Big Bang and yet we stand

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.689 
over from the Big Bang and yet we stand
here<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.690> planet<00:00:19.050> earth<00:00:19.260> with<00:00:20.010> all<00:00:20.220> its<00:00:20.400> water

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
here on planet earth with all its water

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.259 
here on planet earth with all its water
so<00:00:21.390> how<00:00:22.289> did<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.590> h2o<00:00:23.070> get<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.609> our<00:00:23.730> planet

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
so how did that h2o get to our planet

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.200 
so how did that h2o get to our planet
the<00:00:25.109> hydrogen<00:00:25.740> came<00:00:26.279> from<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> solar<00:00:26.820> nebula

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the hydrogen came from the solar nebula

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.830 
the hydrogen came from the solar nebula
but<00:00:28.019> where<00:00:28.289> did<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> oxygen<00:00:29.279> come<00:00:29.550> from

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
but where did the oxygen come from

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.350 
but where did the oxygen come from
here's<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> amazing<00:00:31.170> part<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:32.309> oxygen<00:00:33.059> came

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
here's the amazing part the oxygen came

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.530 
here's the amazing part the oxygen came
from<00:00:33.600> stars<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.230> lived<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.130> died<00:00:35.700> before

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
from stars that lived and died before

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.740 
from stars that lived and died before
our<00:00:36.660> Sun<00:00:37.020> was<00:00:37.710> even<00:00:37.860> born<00:00:38.280> when<00:00:38.550> those<00:00:39.480> stars

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
our Sun was even born when those stars

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
our Sun was even born when those stars
puffed<00:00:40.230> out<00:00:40.410> their<00:00:40.620> final<00:00:41.010> breaths<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.610> oxygen

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
puffed out their final breaths of oxygen

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.350 
puffed out their final breaths of oxygen

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
dead stars that came before and when our

dead stars that came before and when our
Sun<00:00:54.030> dies<00:00:54.300> it'll<00:00:54.989> give<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.350> some<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.559> its

Sun dies it'll give up some of its

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.189 
Sun dies it'll give up some of its
heavier<00:00:56.340> elements<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> next<00:00:57.690> generation

heavier elements to the next generation
of<00:00:58.350> stars<00:00:58.789> so<00:00:59.789> mix<00:01:00.000> hydrogen<00:01:00.570> together<00:01:00.780> with

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
this donated oxygen and you get h2o it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.530 
this donated oxygen and you get h2o it
doesn't<00:01:05.159> take<00:01:05.280> any<00:01:05.430> special<00:01:05.700> process<00:01:06.330> or

how did it get from being spread across

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.630 
how did it get from being spread across

it's entirely possible that the answer
is<00:02:58.860> all<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.310> the<00:03:00.120> above<00:03:00.650> asteroids<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.830> comets

for<00:03:10.440> sure<00:03:10.549> I'm<00:03:11.549> sure<00:03:11.580> glad<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.090> water<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.420> here

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
for sure I'm sure glad the water is here

life<00:03:13.590> wouldn't<00:03:13.980> exist<00:03:14.340> without<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.940> thanks
