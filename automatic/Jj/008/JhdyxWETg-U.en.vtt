double<00:04:36.020> jump<00:04:36.170> in<00:04:36.500> that<00:04:36.650> picture<00:04:36.890> where<00:04:37.160> she

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
double jump in that picture where she

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.429 
double jump in that picture where she
goes<00:04:38.020> so<00:04:39.020> we'll<00:04:39.410> see

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:41.439 
goes so we'll see

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:43.779 
goes so we'll see
what<00:04:42.439> that<00:04:42.620> does<00:04:42.889> people<00:04:43.370> whether<00:04:43.580> you

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
what that does people whether you

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.369 
what that does people whether you
painted<00:04:44.180> with<00:04:44.300> people<00:04:44.629> like<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:44.930> but<00:04:45.050> I<00:04:45.110> wanted

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
painted with people like it but I wanted

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.320 
painted with people like it but I wanted
to<00:04:45.439> try<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.740> before<00:04:45.919> we<00:04:46.849> were<00:04:46.970> done<00:04:47.150> with<00:04:47.270> the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
to try it before we were done with the

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.550 
to try it before we were done with the
game<00:04:47.569> so<00:04:47.840> now<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:47.990> tried<00:04:48.289> it<00:04:48.439> so<00:04:48.710> there<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:48.889> go

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
game so now I tried it so there you go

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.749 
game so now I tried it so there you go
and<00:04:51.560> obviously<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.219> same<00:04:52.400> thing<00:04:52.580> twice

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
and obviously the same thing twice

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.249 
and obviously the same thing twice
Valentine<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.389> velocity<00:04:53.719> gets<00:04:54.080> cut<00:04:54.229> off

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
Valentine you velocity gets cut off

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.800 
Valentine you velocity gets cut off
there<00:04:55.039> was<00:04:55.159> a<00:04:55.189> bug<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.729> marble<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.509> all<00:04:56.689> the

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
there was a bug in marble to and all the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.270 
there was a bug in marble to and all the
other<00:04:56.930> versus<00:04:57.259> games<00:04:57.439> oddly<00:04:57.860> which<00:04:58.009> was<00:04:58.159> if

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
other versus games oddly which was if

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.580 
other versus games oddly which was if
you<00:04:58.370> chained<00:04:58.639> out<00:04:58.789> of<00:04:58.879> the<00:04:58.969> attack<00:04:59.240> right<00:04:59.479> away

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
you chained out of the attack right away

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.100 
you chained out of the attack right away
you<00:05:00.590> kept<00:05:00.830> your<00:05:00.979> velocity<00:05:01.430> even<00:05:01.930> because<00:05:02.930> it

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
you kept your velocity even because it

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.879 
you kept your velocity even because it
no<00:05:03.319> longer<00:05:03.349> counted<00:05:03.889> you<00:05:04.009> in<00:05:04.039> and<00:05:04.310> attacked<00:05:04.719> is

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.390 

everywhere<00:05:09.889> and<00:05:10.460> uh<00:05:10.520> oh<00:05:11.180> as<00:05:11.629> the<00:05:11.840> last<00:05:12.080> thing

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
everywhere and uh oh as the last thing

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.399 
everywhere and uh oh as the last thing
that<00:05:13.400> is<00:05:13.759> not<00:05:13.909> a<00:05:13.969> beta<00:05:14.270> change<00:05:14.599> or<00:05:14.840> experiment

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
that is not a beta change or experiment

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.300 
that is not a beta change or experiment
or<00:05:15.500> whatever<00:05:16.539> Valentine<00:05:17.539> can<00:05:18.310> actually

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
or whatever Valentine can actually

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:29.080 
or whatever Valentine can actually
counter<00:05:19.819> first<00:05:20.620> know<00:05:21.620> if<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.889> do<00:05:21.949> this<00:05:28.030> now<00:05:29.030> she

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
counter first know if I do this now she

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.129 
counter first know if I do this now she
can't<00:05:29.740> or<00:05:30.740> if<00:05:30.860> you<00:05:30.949> have<00:05:31.069> the<00:05:31.219> poison<00:05:31.580> loaded

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.469 

I<00:05:37.439> always<00:05:38.439> end<00:05:38.830> up<00:05:38.919> paying<00:05:39.159> any<00:05:39.370> attention<00:05:39.479> if

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
I always end up paying any attention if

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:53.070 
I always end up paying any attention if
you<00:05:40.599> have<00:05:40.749> a<00:05:40.780> poison<00:05:41.199> loaded<00:05:51.810> again<00:05:52.810> you<00:05:52.990> have

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
you have a poison loaded again you have

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.480 
you have a poison loaded again you have
to<00:05:53.139> make<00:05:53.319> a<00:05:53.349> hard<00:05:53.590> read<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.919> costs<00:05:54.099> to<00:05:54.279> bars

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
to make a hard read it costs to bars

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.640 
to make a hard read it costs to bars
whatever<00:05:54.759> so<00:05:55.150> we'll<00:05:55.419> give<00:05:55.569> it<00:05:55.599> a<00:05:55.719> try<00:05:55.749> that<00:05:56.529> was

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
whatever so we'll give it a try that was

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.100 
whatever so we'll give it a try that was
harder<00:05:56.919> to<00:05:56.949> do<00:05:57.129> than<00:05:57.159> it<00:05:57.490> should<00:05:57.669> have<00:05:57.699> been

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
harder to do than it should have been

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.209 
harder to do than it should have been
because<00:05:59.110> I<00:05:59.229> built<00:05:59.379> in<00:05:59.499> a<00:05:59.560> lot<00:05:59.680> of<00:05:59.710> safeguards

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:00.219 
because I built in a lot of safeguards

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:01.619 
because I built in a lot of safeguards
for<00:06:00.279> your<00:06:00.460> not<00:06:00.610> being<00:06:00.759> able<00:06:00.909> to<00:06:01.060> do<00:06:01.180> that<00:06:01.330> but

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
for your not being able to do that but

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.570 
for your not being able to do that but
we're<00:06:01.930> going<00:06:02.080> to<00:06:02.139> give<00:06:02.259> it<00:06:02.349> a<00:06:02.409> try<00:06:02.590> alright<00:06:03.219> so

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
we're going to give it a try alright so

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.029 
we're going to give it a try alright so
those<00:06:04.330> ends<00:06:04.719> me<00:06:04.900> not<00:06:05.469> reading<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:05.830> street

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
those ends me not reading the street

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:15.559 
those ends me not reading the street
chat<00:06:06.279> oh<00:06:09.689> I<00:06:10.689> should<00:06:11.169> mention<00:06:12.779> related<00:06:13.779> to<00:06:13.870> this

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
chat oh I should mention related to this

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:21.780 
chat oh I should mention related to this
then<00:06:17.430> because<00:06:18.430> of<00:06:18.669> the

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.640 

because<00:06:22.540> of<00:06:22.720> the<00:06:22.840> super<00:06:22.990> jump<00:06:23.290> change

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.260 

obviously<00:06:26.650> some<00:06:27.310> combos<00:06:27.700> won't<00:06:27.910> work<00:06:28.060> but

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
obviously some combos won't work but

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.910 
obviously some combos won't work but
that's<00:06:28.480> true<00:06:28.660> and<00:06:28.810> basically<00:06:29.170> everybody<00:06:29.680> but

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
that's true and basically everybody but

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.380 
that's true and basically everybody but
new<00:06:30.040> combos<00:06:30.430> will<00:06:30.580> work<00:06:30.730> with<00:06:30.880> everybody<00:06:31.300> so

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
new combos will work with everybody so

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.750 
new combos will work with everybody so
we'll<00:06:31.690> see<00:06:31.810> what<00:06:31.930> it<00:06:32.050> actually<00:06:32.230> does<00:06:32.410> but<00:06:33.220> if

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
we'll see what it actually does but if

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.680 
we'll see what it actually does but if
you<00:06:33.970> want<00:06:34.690> to<00:06:34.810> do<00:06:34.930> your<00:06:35.910> for<00:06:36.910> the<00:06:37.000> most<00:06:37.240> part<00:06:37.450> if

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
you want to do your for the most part if

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.240 
you want to do your for the most part if
they<00:06:37.810> started<00:06:38.170> with<00:06:38.260> a<00:06:38.320> jab<00:06:38.620> in<00:06:39.010> the<00:06:39.160> air

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
they started with a jab in the air

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.460 
they started with a jab in the air
they'll<00:06:39.490> still<00:06:39.730> work<00:06:39.910> if<00:06:40.780> they<00:06:40.990> turn<00:06:41.200> it<00:06:41.350> with

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
they'll still work if they turn it with

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.840 
they'll still work if they turn it with
a<00:06:41.500> medium<00:06:41.860> you<00:06:41.980> can<00:06:42.010> do<00:06:42.280> but<00:06:42.580> they'll<00:06:42.820> be

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
a medium you can do but they'll be

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:51.510 
a medium you can do but they'll be
slower<00:06:46.080> yeah<00:06:47.080> I<00:06:47.110> got<00:06:47.560> it<00:06:47.590> right<00:06:48.180> and<00:06:49.180> wheel<00:06:50.520> her

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
slower yeah I got it right and wheel her

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.900 
slower yeah I got it right and wheel her
flight<00:06:52.560> starting<00:06:53.560> from<00:06:53.590> a<00:06:53.800> ferret<00:06:54.220> correcting

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910 
flight starting from a ferret correcting

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.700 
flight starting from a ferret correcting
down<00:06:55.060> to<00:06:55.240> you<00:06:55.540> in<00:06:55.720> one<00:06:55.930> frame<00:06:56.230> was<00:06:56.440> a<00:06:56.470> little

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
down to you in one frame was a little

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.890 
down to you in one frame was a little
bit<00:06:56.830> weird<00:06:57.010> flight<00:06:57.880> now<00:06:58.090> corrects<00:06:58.540> down<00:06:58.750> to

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
bit weird flight now corrects down to

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.800 
bit weird flight now corrects down to
height<00:06:59.050> gradually<00:07:00.900> which<00:07:01.900> means<00:07:03.600> the<00:07:04.600> hike<00:07:04.780> is

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
height gradually which means the hike is

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.020 
height gradually which means the hike is
still<00:07:05.200> the<00:07:05.290> same<00:07:05.470> as<00:07:05.740> it<00:07:05.980> used<00:07:06.010> to<00:07:06.190> be

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
still the same as it used to be

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.210 
still the same as it used to be
but<00:07:08.180> correction<00:07:09.170> is<00:07:09.290> plenty<00:07:09.590> more<00:07:09.740> gradual

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
but correction is plenty more gradual

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.460 
but correction is plenty more gradual
