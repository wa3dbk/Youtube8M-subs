00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.109 
into the race prepared as prepared as I
can<00:01:20.600> be<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:21.189> can<00:01:22.189> we<00:01:22.340> get<00:01:22.460> some<00:01:22.579> good<00:01:22.700> starts

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
can be and can we get some good starts

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.880 
can be and can we get some good starts
and<00:01:23.299> sprint<00:01:23.600> away<00:01:23.659> as<00:01:23.900> fast<00:01:24.140> as<00:01:24.259> I<00:01:24.320> can<00:01:24.380> and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
and sprint away as fast as I can and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.830 
and sprint away as fast as I can and
it's<00:01:25.369> only<00:01:25.490> ten<00:01:25.700> laps<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.720> know<00:01:26.810> don't

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
it's only ten laps so you know don't

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.630 
it's only ten laps so you know don't
sound<00:01:27.229> like<00:01:27.320> very<00:01:27.530> long<00:01:27.829> but<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:28.250> use<00:01:28.400> three

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
sound like very long but you use three

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.730 
sound like very long but you use three
of<00:01:28.759> them<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.030> row<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.750> takes<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:30.530> tail<00:01:30.710> on

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
of them in a row it takes the tail on

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.890 
of them in a row it takes the tail on
the<00:01:30.890> body<00:01:31.100> it's<00:01:31.340> taxing<00:01:31.759> race<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.180> if<00:01:32.720> you're

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
the body it's taxing race so if you're

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.359 
the body it's taxing race so if you're
in<00:01:33.020> shape<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.560> got<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.770> right<00:01:33.920> practice

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
in shape and you got the right practice

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.460 
in shape and you got the right practice
and<00:01:34.549> preparation<00:01:34.850> going<00:01:35.329> in<00:01:35.479> you<00:01:36.170> should<00:01:36.380> do

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
and preparation going in you should do

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.630 
and preparation going in you should do
pretty<00:01:36.619> well<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.159> that's<00:01:37.399> what<00:01:37.520> I've<00:01:37.610> been

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
pretty well so that's what I've been

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.819 
pretty well so that's what I've been
doing<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.180> hopefully<00:01:38.540> see<00:01:39.290> if<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.470> pays<00:01:39.619> off

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
doing and hopefully see if it pays off

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.800 
doing and hopefully see if it pays off
I'd<00:01:40.610> say<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.909> fans<00:01:41.149> of<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.360> monster<00:01:41.600> energy
