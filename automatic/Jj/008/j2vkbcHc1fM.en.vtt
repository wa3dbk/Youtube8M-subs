00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
it's big different from what we've had

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.790 
it's big different from what we've had
in<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.000> past<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.750> not<00:02:10.840> Maya<00:02:11.019> truth<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.590> too

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
in the past it's not Maya truth that too

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.130 
in the past it's not Maya truth that too
is<00:02:12.190> it's<00:02:12.760> unfortunate<00:02:13.420> in<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.599> past<00:02:13.840> we've

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
is it's unfortunate in the past we've

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.600 
is it's unfortunate in the past we've
had<00:02:14.170> riders<00:02:14.650> injured<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.160> you're<00:02:15.310> able<00:02:15.430> to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
had riders injured but you're able to

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.449 
had riders injured but you're able to
pull<00:02:15.849> from<00:02:16.540> your<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:17.230> satellite<00:02:17.680> team<00:02:17.920> the

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
pull from your the satellite team the

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.250 
pull from your the satellite team the
troy<00:02:18.670> lee<00:02:18.819> honda<00:02:19.150> team<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.510> kohls<00:02:19.900> had<00:02:20.110> an

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
troy lee honda team and kohls had an

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.229 
troy lee honda team and kohls had an
opportunity<00:02:20.590> i<00:02:20.950> think<00:02:21.459> he's<00:02:21.580> even<00:02:21.700> raced<00:02:22.000> here

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
opportunity i think he's even raced here

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.900 
opportunity i think he's even raced here
on<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> 450<00:02:22.989> before<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:23.590> i<00:02:23.800> think<00:02:24.250> did<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.580> when

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
on a 450 before so i think did that when

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.610 
on a 450 before so i think did that when
you're<00:02:25.030> coming<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.420> as<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.599> rookie<00:02:25.840> yeah<00:02:26.560> you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
you're coming in as a rookie yeah you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.040 
you're coming in as a rookie yeah you
have<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> little<00:02:27.220> bit<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:28.120> little<00:02:28.150> bit<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.930> an

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
have a little bit a little bit of an

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.170 
have a little bit a little bit of an
advantage<00:02:29.319> rather<00:02:29.709> than<00:02:29.950> just<00:02:30.220> fresh<00:02:30.940> out<00:02:31.120> of

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
advantage rather than just fresh out of

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.509 
advantage rather than just fresh out of
the<00:02:31.360> 250<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.019> 450<00:02:32.650> he<00:02:32.769> kind<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.069> knows<00:02:33.190> what

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
the 250 on a 450 he kind of knows what

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.280 
the 250 on a 450 he kind of knows what
it's<00:02:33.670> like<00:02:33.849> exactly<00:02:34.629> any<00:02:34.810> near<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.080> team

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
it's like exactly any near the team

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.080 
it's like exactly any near the team
environment<00:02:35.590> we<00:02:35.860> knew<00:02:36.010> what<00:02:36.220> what<00:02:36.970> we

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
rides a 450 at my opinion better than

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.839 
rides a 450 at my opinion better than
rides<00:02:49.390> at<00:02:49.540> 250<00:02:50.019> I'm<00:02:50.860> hoping<00:02:51.310> this<00:02:51.459> carries

rides at 250 I'm hoping this carries

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.490 
rides at 250 I'm hoping this carries
through<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.150> momentum<00:02:52.720> carries<00:02:53.019> through<00:02:53.230> for

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
through the momentum carries through for

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.580 
through the momentum carries through for
outdoors<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.160> he<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:54.880> we<00:02:55.180> can<00:02:55.329> see<00:02:55.480> some<00:02:55.660> good

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
outdoors and he can we can see some good

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.300 
outdoors and he can we can see some good
results<00:02:56.799> with<00:02:57.069> them<00:02:57.430> for<00:02:57.640> outdoors

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.370
