00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.460
 well here we come to the end that if the last three races 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.839
 and what I'm going to do now is mount the last half point 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.279
 What I'm I missing of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.019
 because remember that as we started the round it was three half points 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.380
 I was missing an efe piece 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.730
 so that the union was in the middle part 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.220
 and here what I'm going to do is an idol to the last point 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.590
 so that I stay 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.860
 the four half means 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.409
 well let's continue with two chains we will raise because 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:40.450
 let's do here 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.870
 one time only half points 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.949
 on each half point we are going to mount a half point 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.470
 I've been three here 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.110
 then in these chains that are three buoy ride 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.600
 three half points 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.940
 hiding the era that I stay at the beginning 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.650
 in every half point here all one 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.910
 two 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.910
 street 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.910
 i three half points flying here in this chain 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.170
 so look here are the four this is the first half point 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
 we took a half point here is the one that follows 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.610
 here is the one that follows 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.750
 sanchez the one who does 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.670
 and later 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.490
 three half points 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.880
 and so on until the end of the lap we will do two equal laps 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.250
 eta 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.630
 good here we arrived 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.080
 to what is the end of the return to the fabric three half-ends here 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.080
 and now very special the last half point 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.820
 and here I am going to take 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.350
 the two chains 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.090
 then 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.860
 gerrard what is the return 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.200
 and here we have already 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.500
 two laps 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.760
 I'm going to lift two chains 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
 because it is a buoyant ger a next turn 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.140
 half points and this will be our last round here we are going to continue 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.140
 the whole spin knitting means point 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.239
 well here we are almost finishing what is our turn 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.619
 I want to tell you that this and what I'm using 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:22.279
 style that they sell loose they ask you for 100 grams or 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.229
 200 grams 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:29.529
 per cent suddenly good has disadvantages this thread is a bit more 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:31.470
 thin that the one that comes in 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.249
 certain brand on the stock market 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:34.309
 percent 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:38.259
 well he can knit but he is the one who considers that it is more 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.259
 thin and then that you use crystal thread 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:45.939
 of the one that comes in a bag while it's going to come out is a little bit more they have done 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.239
 here since it is a thicker thread 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.319
 I am using for this entity ejido I am using tiring of the number 2 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.460
 although crystal style i hales use the number four 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.640
 and I'm looking forward to the moon because I wanted to stay a little longer 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.679
 weak what is the tissue 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:08.109
 here I finished the round and close with a delicate point I will knit two 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.899
 very strong chains 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.899
 then cut the strand 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.000
 and now what we are going to do here we have level so that they see what we are going 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:18.619
 advancing we have 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.520
 a part of a side 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.529
 now we are going to start doing the same thing 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.529
 in the other side 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.950
 good since if we bother chain reinforced 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.160
 and we'll start at 15 1 2 3 in the fourth point 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.249
 to start our first half point 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.119
 the second half point 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:44.049
 however, remember 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.159
 that here are 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.159
 four half points 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:53.179
 and this effect 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:54.629
 three chains 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:00.010
 and we continue here weaving our four half point half points 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.079
 nooo 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.649
 three chains 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:13.570
 and so on 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.009
 up to the end 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:16.129
 the turn 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:20.509
 we weave others we finish the return we closed it and that we are another 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.020
 I always want to also suggest another of the things that you can do to the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.520
 finish the round instead of continuing 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.210
 seeing about pure rights 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.520
 they can rotate their fabric i despite the next turn on the side of 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.409
 resale 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.030
 and then the fabric tour returns and weave it again 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.630
 if you want the ending to be different here we did everything 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.099
 rights on right and that is the texture that we are going 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.610
 then the terminal is also an option if you want to do them with 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.789
 a little different 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.300
 well let's do the laps so they can see how it looks 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.909
 well look here we have the headband already finished 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.599
 this is how society 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:01.500
 percent 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.139
 if they fix here we did everything can 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.409
 circular 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.830
 And by the way it's here I made it instead of leaving them alone 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.319
 if it was better for me to make a finish on the edges to give 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.629
 the firmness to what would be of more 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.589
 you can combine the brown color oic is the sustenance 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:23.190
 in what yes this is an advance for you to see 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.449
 as what to our tissue that using the hospital 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.770
 with a bidding percent of wolf carancho of number 2 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.450
 i as to the points that must be mounted on each of the rings and 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.190
 as is also with the half points and you when the 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.289
 mesh area will see if it would be over 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.339
 the largest installation for what is an adult but this is the measure 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:48.010
 standard this measure fits very well 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.620
 I was the country the device that I hope you like at least until next time you should not 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.210
