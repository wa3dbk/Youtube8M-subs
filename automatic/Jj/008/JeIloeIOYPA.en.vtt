mixing the colors is because I wanted

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.089

control<00:05:35.870> when<00:05:36.380> you<00:05:36.500> do<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.890> in<00:05:37.070> that<00:05:37.280> order

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
control when you do it in that order

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.700
