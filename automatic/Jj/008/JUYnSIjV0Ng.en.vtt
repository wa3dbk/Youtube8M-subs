in a medium drill for the i use the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.220 
in a medium drill for the i use the
threaded<00:00:53.250> portion<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.760> your<00:00:53.970> second<00:00:54.839> ad<00:00:54.930> cap

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.789 

so<00:01:17.520> they<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:19.020> basically<00:01:19.320> have

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
so they have it we basically have

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.250 
so they have it we basically have
assembled<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:21.560> wine<00:01:22.560> cork<00:01:23.010> tripod<00:01:24.080> again<00:01:25.080> we

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
assembled or wine cork tripod again we

cork but one common is apply should have

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.880 
cork but one common is apply should have
looked<00:01:37.289> at<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.710> kind<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.640> width<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.210> the

the<00:01:42.460> cork<00:01:42.760> there's<00:01:43.300> one<00:01:43.510> side<00:01:43.720> is<00:01:43.840> typically

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
the cork there's one side is typically

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.310 
the cork there's one side is typically
more<00:01:44.380> narrow<00:01:44.620> than<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.980> top<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:46.080> that's<00:01:47.080> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
more narrow than the top and that's the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.930 
more narrow than the top and that's the
side<00:01:47.470> that<00:01:47.500> normally<00:01:47.860> goes<00:01:48.010> into<00:01:48.490> your<00:01:48.520> wine

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
side that normally goes into your wine

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.300 
side that normally goes into your wine
bottle<00:01:49.300> so<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.050> looks<00:01:50.560> like<00:01:50.650> this<00:01:50.920> side<00:01:51.130> would

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
bottle so it looks like this side would

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.640 
bottle so it looks like this side would
have<00:01:51.430> been<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.640> top<00:01:51.850> better<00:01:52.120> top<00:01:52.390> side<00:01:52.660> but<00:01:53.620> I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
have been the top better top side but I

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.940 
have been the top better top side but I
made<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:54.190> bottom<00:01:54.550> oops<00:01:55.140> anyhow<00:01:56.140> but<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.830> can

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
made the bottom oops anyhow but you can

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.340 
made the bottom oops anyhow but you can
see<00:01:57.130> with<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.430> one<00:01:57.550> that<00:01:57.670> we<00:01:57.730> made<00:01:57.880> first<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
see with the one that we made first it

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.660 
see with the one that we made first it
was<00:01:59.470> done<00:01:59.620> correctly<00:01:59.830> you<00:02:00.220> can<00:02:00.310> see<00:02:00.490> how<00:02:00.550> it's

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
was done correctly you can see how it's

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.400 
was done correctly you can see how it's
narrow<00:02:00.880> narrow<00:02:01.480> were<00:02:01.810> at<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.880> bottom<00:02:04.410> but

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
narrow narrow were at the bottom but

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.200 
narrow narrow were at the bottom but
overall<00:02:05.710> it's<00:02:06.610> still<00:02:06.790> going<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:06.970> work<00:02:07.060> out

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
overall it's still going to work out

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.930 
overall it's still going to work out
just<00:02:07.300> fine<00:02:07.420> we<00:02:07.690> can<00:02:07.750> give<00:02:07.900> it<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:08.050> shot<00:02:08.790> you<00:02:09.790> also

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
just fine we can give it a shot you also

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.330 
just fine we can give it a shot you also
want<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.360> sort<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.750> clean<00:02:10.990> out<00:02:11.230> your<00:02:11.340> your

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
wine and see this is going to fit yeah

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.890 
wine and see this is going to fit yeah
this<00:02:18.760> isn't<00:02:18.910> for<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> right<00:02:19.300> bottle<00:02:19.600> system

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
this isn't for the right bottle system

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.690 
this isn't for the right bottle system
do<00:02:19.990> they<00:02:20.080> go<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.320> but<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.459> see<00:02:21.580> how<00:02:21.670> it

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
do they go in but you can see how it

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.990 
do they go in but you can see how it
works<00:02:21.910> before<00:02:22.270> we<00:02:22.420> had<00:02:22.570> already<00:02:22.720> made

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
works before we had already made

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.680 

this<00:02:26.000> up<00:02:26.270> here<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:27.680> can<00:02:27.860> see<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.129> tip<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.370> it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
this up here you can see the tip of it

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.780 
this up here you can see the tip of it
will<00:02:29.690> then<00:02:31.060> take<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.330> timed<00:02:32.750> photo<00:02:33.260> here<00:02:33.730> see<00:02:34.730> if
