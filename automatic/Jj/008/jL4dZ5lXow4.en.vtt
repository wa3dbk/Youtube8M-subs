00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:03.870
 Romans chapter 8 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.490
 So, now 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.640
 no condemnation there for those who are in Christ Jesus 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:12.599
 that do not walk according to the flesh 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.059
 if not according to the spirit 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.789
 because the law of the spirit of life in Jesus Christ 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.789
 He has freed me from the law of sin and death 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.970
 because what was impossible to the law 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.210
 because he was weak because of the flesh and because of sin 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.650
 God sending his son in the likeness of sinful flesh 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.260
 condemned sin in the flesh 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.140
 so that the justice of the law 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.120
 was fulfilled and we 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.630
 that we do not walk according to the flesh 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.300
 yes not according to the spirit 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.190
 because those who are according to the flesh the things that are of the flesh know 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.390
 more than those who according to the spirit 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.270
 the things that are of the spirit 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.190
 because the prudence of the flesh that his death 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.450
 more to the prudence of the spirit 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.270
 life ipas 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.400
 because the prudence of the flesh 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.450
 it is enmity against God 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.150
 because it is not subject to the law of God 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.220
 nor can 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.420
 so those who are carnal 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.810
 They can not please God 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.350
 more you ask us for the flesh if not in the spirit 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.460
 for the spirit of God 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.350
 dwell in you 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.280
 and if anyone does not have the spirit of Christ 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.150
 he is not from 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.340
 but if the Christ is in you 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.509
 the body to the dead truths 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.210
 because of sin 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.210
 more of the spirit lives because of justice 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.670
 and if the spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.350
 dwell in you 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.660
 the one who raised Jesus the Christ of the dead 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.010
 will also vivify our mortal bodies 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.380
 for his spirit 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.640
 that dwells in you 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.260
 so the brothers 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.740
 of u2 of us 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.939
 no to meat 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.670
 so that we live according to the flesh 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 because if I lived dissatisfied to the flesh you will die 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.899
 more and because of the spirit 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.239
 mortify and the body works live ellis 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.459
 because all those who are guided by the spirit of God 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.850
 such are 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.419
 Children of God 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.200
 why have not you received 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.779
 the spirit of servitude to be 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:23.629
 again in fear 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.449
 you have received the spirit of adoption 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:27.649
 of children 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.649
 by which we cry 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:33.209
 because the same spirit 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.509
 our spirit testifies 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.719
 that we are hinjÃ³s means 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.279
 and if you also heirs 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:44.879
 certainly of god and joint heirs with Christ 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.939
 if we suffer together with him 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.450
 so that together with him we may be glorified 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:54.969
 because I'm sure 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.329
 that what is suffered in this time 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.430
 it is not to compare with the coming glory that we have to be manifested 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.340
 because hope asks 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.789
 of the creatures 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.169
 awaits the manifestation of God's scams 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.169
 because the creatures subject 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:13.609
 they went to vanina 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.439
 not of his will 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.940
 but for cause 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.729
 of the one who held her 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.099
 with hope that also the same creatures 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.389
 will be a thousand frogs of corruption servitude 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.309
 in freedom and glory 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.119
 of the god types 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:33.150
 because we already know that all creatures ine 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.189
 to a 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.719
 and they are still in labor until now 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.139
 and not only them 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.299
 but also ourselves 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.109
 that we have the first fruits of the spirit 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.109
 we also come within ourselves 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:48.619
 waiting for adoption 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:49.849
 it is to know 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.609
 the redemption of our body 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.059
 because in hope we are albos 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:56.909
 but the hope that you see 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.439
 it is not hope 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.019
 because what some see 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.709
 do not expect it 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.259
 yes, what we do not see, we hope 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.259
 we wait for patience 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.640
 and likewise 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.579
 the spirit helps us in our weakness 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.589
 because to act as is convenient 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:15.949
 we do not know 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:17.909
 but the same spirit 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.309
 demand for us with unspeakable moans 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.309
 to be that he searches the hearts 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:27.099
 he knows that it is the desire of the spirit 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:28.800
 that according to God 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.389
 demand for losantos 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.659
 and we already know 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.499
 and those who goodbye kaman 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.229
 all things are helped well 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.419
 to those who according to the purpose are called 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.349
 to be saints 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.210
 because to those who before known 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.620
 he also pointed me 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.629
 from before the road 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:49.770
 to be made conforming 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.590
 in the image of his son 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.820
 so that it is 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.290
 the firstborn 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.509
 among many brothers 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.610
 and to those who pointed out to him from before the way to these he also called 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.599
 and those who called these also justified 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.189
 and those he justified 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.189
 to these also pain and mischievous 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:11.680
 what shall we say to this 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.839
 if god is for us 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:16.370
 who will be against us 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.400
 the one that even his own son did not spare 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.479
 before he gave it to all of us 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.649
 how he will not also give us all things with him 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.259
 who accuse the chosen ones of God 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.439
 God is the one who replaced him 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.490
 has close will condemn them 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.240
 Jesus Christ 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.699
 he is the one who died 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:37.810
 even more 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.770
 the one who also resurrected 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.219
 who is also the right hand of God 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:45.219
 who also demands for us 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.009
 who will separate us from the charity of Christ 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.289
 tribulation 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.879
 when busti a operÃ© sewed 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:53.870
 or hungry 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.110
 You can clouds 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.719
 open hydro or knife 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:59.240
 how is it written 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.619
 because of you we are dead all the time 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:04.060
 we are estimated 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.189
 as slaughter sheep 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:07.279
 before 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.249
 in all these things 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:11.309
 we are more than winners 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:13.569
 for the one who loved us 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.520
 for which I am certain 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.909
 that neither death 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:20.430
 neither life nor angels nor principalities 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.719
 neither powers nor the present nor the future 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.119
 neither the high nor the low nor any creature will be able to separate us 

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:32.029
 of God's charity 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:33.669
 what is in the Christ 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:34.580
 Jesus 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.560
 Lord our
