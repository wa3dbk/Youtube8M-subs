today<00:00:14.300> Jamie<00:00:14.780> we're<00:00:14.990> gonna<00:00:15.110> play<00:00:15.349> a

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
today Jamie we're gonna play a

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.730 
today Jamie we're gonna play a
probability<00:00:15.950> game<00:00:17.169> ready<00:00:18.169> ability

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
probability game ready ability

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.529 
probability game ready ability
probabilities<00:00:19.519> okay<00:00:19.759> what<00:00:19.939> is<00:00:20.089> that<00:00:20.269> well

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
probabilities okay what is that well

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.329 
probabilities okay what is that well
we're<00:00:20.810> gonna<00:00:20.929> try<00:00:21.140> to<00:00:21.199> find<00:00:21.499> out<00:00:21.710> if<00:00:21.919> kids

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:22.339 
we're gonna try to find out if kids

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.210 
we're gonna try to find out if kids
understand<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.509> likelihood<00:00:24.289> that<00:00:24.589> we'll

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
understand the likelihood that we'll

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.909 
understand the likelihood that we'll
roll<00:00:25.550> certain<00:00:26.029> roles<00:00:26.300> okay<00:00:26.749> okay<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:27.259> we<00:00:27.769> have

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
roll certain roles okay okay so we have

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.269 
roll certain roles okay okay so we have
two<00:00:28.099> dice<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:28.909> we<00:00:29.779> have<00:00:30.050> created<00:00:30.769> game<00:00:30.979> boards

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
two dice and we have created game boards

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.920 
two dice and we have created game boards
on<00:00:31.399> just<00:00:31.579> regular<00:00:31.729> pieces<00:00:32.119> of<00:00:32.360> paper<00:00:32.540> although

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
on just regular pieces of paper although

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.950 
on just regular pieces of paper although
we<00:00:33.260> will<00:00:33.469> have<00:00:33.680> this<00:00:34.570> downloadable<00:00:35.570> version

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
we will have this downloadable version

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.279 
we will have this downloadable version
on<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.379> website<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.390> we've<00:00:38.600> just<00:00:38.809> created

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
on the website and so we've just created

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.450 
on the website and so we've just created
five<00:00:39.890> columns<00:00:40.309> with<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.480> letters<00:00:42.109> SK<00:00:42.710> UNK

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
five columns with the letters SK UNK

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.270 
five columns with the letters SK UNK
above<00:00:43.879> them<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:44.929> we<00:00:45.230> play<00:00:45.440> five<00:00:45.679> rounds<00:00:46.160> and

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
above them and we play five rounds and

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.549 
above them and we play five rounds and
whoever<00:00:46.820> has<00:00:47.089> the<00:00:47.329> highest<00:00:47.359> total<00:00:47.839> at<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.410> end

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
whoever has the highest total at the end

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.340 
whoever has the highest total at the end
of<00:00:48.679> the<00:00:48.769> five<00:00:48.980> rounds<00:00:49.429> is<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.940> winner<00:00:50.350> here's

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
of the five rounds is the winner here's

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.130 
of the five rounds is the winner here's
how<00:00:51.679> you<00:00:51.739> have<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.339> play<00:00:52.550> you<00:00:53.329> roll<00:00:53.539> both<00:00:53.839> dogs

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
how you have to play you roll both dogs

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.459 
how you have to play you roll both dogs
so<00:00:54.260> each<00:00:54.440> letter<00:00:54.730> is<00:00:55.730> around<00:00:56.210> absolutely<00:00:56.660> so

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
so each letter is around absolutely so

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.729 
so each letter is around absolutely so
we're<00:00:57.739> going<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:58.039> roll<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.120> if<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.539> roll<00:00:59.870> a<00:01:00.230> one

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
we're going to roll and if I roll a one

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.579 
we're going to roll and if I roll a one
I'm<00:01:01.730> done<00:01:02.149> for<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:02.539> round<00:01:02.839> and<00:01:03.079> I've<00:01:03.350> lost

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
I'm done for that round and I've lost

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.000 
I'm done for that round and I've lost
the<00:01:03.859> points<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.210> my<00:01:05.750> first<00:01:05.960> roll<00:01:06.260> I<00:01:06.530> didn't<00:01:06.950> do

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
the points so my first roll I didn't do

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.130 
the points so my first roll I didn't do
very<00:01:07.040> well<00:01:07.280> my<00:01:07.970> ass<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.420> would<00:01:08.570> have<00:01:08.660> had<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.810> zero

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
very well my ass I would have had a zero

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.860 
very well my ass I would have had a zero
but<00:01:09.350> there<00:01:09.590> is<00:01:09.680> another<00:01:09.950> roll<00:01:10.280> okay<00:01:11.120> but<00:01:11.510> if<00:01:11.720> I

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
but there is another roll okay but if I

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.800 
but there is another roll okay but if I
rolled<00:01:12.700> I'm<00:01:13.700> just<00:01:13.970> gonna<00:01:14.060> have<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.300> pretend

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
rolled I'm just gonna have to pretend

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.400 
rolled I'm just gonna have to pretend
let's<00:01:15.260> say<00:01:15.470> I<00:01:15.500> roll<00:01:16.600> double<00:01:17.600> ones

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
let's say I roll double ones

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.640 
let's say I roll double ones
if<00:01:19.070> I<00:01:19.280> roll<00:01:19.520> double<00:01:20.030> ones<00:01:20.300> then<00:01:20.690> I<00:01:20.720> lose<00:01:21.080> every

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
if I roll double ones then I lose every

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.100 
if I roll double ones then I lose every
point<00:01:22.010> from<00:01:22.340> every<00:01:22.700> previous<00:01:23.120> round<00:01:23.690> as<00:01:23.960> well

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
point from every previous round as well

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.960 
point from every previous round as well
so<00:01:24.740> those<00:01:24.950> are<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.190> rules<00:01:25.370> you<00:01:25.580> want<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.790> stay

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
so those are the rules you want to stay

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.120 
so those are the rules you want to stay
away<00:01:26.150> from<00:01:26.180> so<00:01:26.840> here's<00:01:27.230> what<00:01:27.440> can<00:01:27.590> happen<00:01:27.650> I

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
away from so here's what can happen I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.780 
away from so here's what can happen I
can<00:01:28.670> roll<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.890> I'm<00:01:30.890> doing<00:01:31.220> some<00:01:31.400> mental<00:01:31.760> math

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
can roll and I'm doing some mental math

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.660 
can roll and I'm doing some mental math
at<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.240> same<00:01:32.510> time<00:01:32.750> I'm<00:01:33.080> worrying<00:01:33.530> about

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
at the same time I'm worrying about

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.970 
at the same time I'm worrying about
probability<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:34.940> I've<00:01:35.210> rolled<00:01:35.540> a<00:01:35.690> six<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.770> 5

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
probability so I've rolled a six and a 5

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.520 
probability so I've rolled a six and a 5
so<00:01:37.190> I<00:01:37.220> have<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.520> total<00:01:37.730> of<00:01:37.940> 11<00:01:38.330> now<00:01:39.080> if<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.470> don't

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
so I have a total of 11 now if I don't

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.400 
so I have a total of 11 now if I don't
want<00:01:39.980> to<00:01:40.070> risk<00:01:40.280> my<00:01:40.430> 11<00:01:40.940> points<00:01:41.390> I<00:01:41.510> can<00:01:41.600> score<00:01:42.200> it

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
want to risk my 11 points I can score it

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.680 
want to risk my 11 points I can score it
right<00:01:42.620> now<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.430> then<00:01:43.610> you're<00:01:43.790> done<00:01:44.060> I'm<00:01:44.660> done

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
right now and then you're done I'm done

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.030 
right now and then you're done I'm done
with<00:01:45.050> that<00:01:45.170> round<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.620> would<00:01:45.770> be<00:01:45.890> your

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
with that round and it would be your

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.790 
with that round and it would be your
turn<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.310> roll<00:01:46.550> but<00:01:47.030> if<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.420> want<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:48.140> chance<00:01:48.560> it

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
turn to roll but if I want to chance it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.800 
turn to roll but if I want to chance it
which<00:01:49.010> this<00:01:49.400> is<00:01:49.550> where<00:01:49.700> probability<00:01:50.360> comes<00:01:50.600> in

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
which this is where probability comes in

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.870 
which this is where probability comes in
because<00:01:51.500> if<00:01:51.620> I<00:01:51.740> want<00:01:51.980> to<00:01:52.100> chance<00:01:52.400> it<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.700> can

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
because if I want to chance it I can

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.510 
because if I want to chance it I can
risk<00:01:53.090> these<00:01:53.390> 11<00:01:53.840> points<00:01:54.260> and<00:01:54.410> roll<00:01:54.890> again<00:01:55.040> as

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
risk these 11 points and roll again as

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.760 
risk these 11 points and roll again as
long<00:01:55.850> as<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.090> don't<00:01:56.150> roll<00:01:56.480> a<00:01:56.510> 1<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:57.050> keep<00:01:57.500> adding

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
long as I don't roll a 1 I keep adding

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.660 
long as I don't roll a 1 I keep adding
it<00:01:58.040> up<00:01:58.190> so<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:59.000> have<00:01:59.330> 11<00:01:59.860> up<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.400> would<00:02:01.580> have

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
it up so I have 11 up and I would have

one<00:04:35.140> apart<00:04:35.470> we<00:04:35.950> could<00:04:36.100> total<00:04:36.370> up<00:04:36.460> our<00:04:36.580> scores

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
one apart we could total up our scores

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.130 
one apart we could total up our scores
and<00:04:36.970> if<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.180> had<00:04:37.300> more<00:04:37.480> people<00:04:37.630> playing<00:04:37.960> that

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
and if you had more people playing that

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.690 
and if you had more people playing that
would<00:04:38.290> be<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.440> lot<00:04:38.800> more<00:04:38.980> important<00:04:39.400> so<00:04:39.460> then

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
would be a lot more important so then

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.370 
would be a lot more important so then
total<00:04:40.000> up<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.090> scores<00:04:40.420> at<00:04:40.540> the<00:04:40.570> end<00:04:40.690> what<00:04:41.320> do

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
total up the scores at the end what do

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.750 
total up the scores at the end what do
you<00:04:41.440> think<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:41.860> think<00:04:42.100> it's<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.340> quick<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.670> easy

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
you think I think it's a quick and easy

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.880 
you think I think it's a quick and easy
game<00:04:43.150> but<00:04:43.180> it's<00:04:43.600> a<00:04:43.690> lot<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:43.870> good<00:04:44.080> good<00:04:44.470> mental

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
game but it's a lot of good good mental

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.340 
game but it's a lot of good good mental
math<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:45.460> strategy<00:04:46.140> absolutely<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.260> it

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
math and strategy absolutely and it

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.159 
math and strategy absolutely and it
helps<00:04:47.560> your<00:04:47.650> kids<00:04:47.860> learn<00:04:48.580> that<00:04:48.850> they<00:04:49.780> have<00:04:49.930> one

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
helps your kids learn that they have one

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.300 
helps your kids learn that they have one
out<00:04:50.320> of<00:04:50.350> six<00:04:50.650> chances<00:04:51.160> of<00:04:51.400> hitting<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.300> one

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
out of six chances of hitting that one

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.280 
out of six chances of hitting that one
on<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.370> roll<00:04:54.760> so<00:04:54.970> they<00:04:55.180> have<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.480> be<00:04:55.570> careful<00:04:56.020> and

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
on a roll so they have to be careful and

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.870 
on a roll so they have to be careful and
be<00:04:56.680> willing<00:04:56.860> to<00:04:56.980> risk<00:04:57.220> it<00:04:57.430> if<00:04:57.580> they're<00:04:57.760> gonna

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
be willing to risk it if they're gonna

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.180 
be willing to risk it if they're gonna
but<00:04:58.300> does<00:04:58.419> it<00:04:58.540> increase<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:58.900> 12<00:04:59.290> since

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
but does it increase the 12 since

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.610 
but does it increase the 12 since
there's<00:05:00.430> two<00:05:00.490> ones<00:05:01.060> actually<00:05:01.480> no<00:05:01.870> it<00:05:02.230> really

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
there's two ones actually no it really

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.590 
there's two ones actually no it really
it<00:05:02.890> doesn't<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.400> actually<00:05:03.850> is<00:05:04.000> it's<00:05:04.270> even

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
it doesn't it actually is it's even

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.770 
it doesn't it actually is it's even
bigger<00:05:04.990> than<00:05:05.169> that<00:05:05.380> because<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.610> have<00:05:07.330> one<00:05:07.630> out

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
bigger than that because I have one out

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.220 
bigger than that because I have one out
of<00:05:07.810> six<00:05:08.140> chances<00:05:08.730> of<00:05:09.730> what<00:05:10.480> I<00:05:10.510> would<00:05:10.750> roll<00:05:10.960> on

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
of six chances of what I would roll on

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.610 
of six chances of what I would roll on
the<00:05:11.440> first<00:05:11.680> dice<00:05:11.919> so<00:05:12.880> there's<00:05:13.169> so<00:05:14.169> I<00:05:14.200> have<00:05:14.410> one

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
the first dice so there's so I have one

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.610 
the first dice so there's so I have one
out<00:05:14.740> of<00:05:14.770> six<00:05:15.100> of<00:05:15.280> getting<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.700> one<00:05:15.960> on<00:05:16.960> the

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
out of six of getting the one on the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.010 
out of six of getting the one on the
first<00:05:17.830> dice<00:05:18.070> but<00:05:18.790> on<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.030> second<00:05:19.390> dice<00:05:19.540> I<00:05:19.780> also

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
first dice but on the second dice I also

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.610 
first dice but on the second dice I also
have<00:05:20.410> one<00:05:20.800> out<00:05:20.950> of<00:05:20.979> six<00:05:21.340> chances<00:05:21.850> holy<00:05:22.270> cow

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
have one out of six chances holy cow

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.790 
have one out of six chances holy cow
you're<00:05:23.620> right<00:05:23.890> so<00:05:24.280> that<00:05:24.460> it<00:05:24.580> increases<00:05:24.990> so<00:05:25.990> for

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
you're right so that it increases so for

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.500 
you're right so that it increases so for
this<00:05:27.010> it'd<00:05:27.310> be<00:05:27.490> it'd<00:05:27.790> be<00:05:27.850> a<00:05:28.030> multiplication

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
this it'd be it'd be a multiplication

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.260 
this it'd be it'd be a multiplication
problem<00:05:28.690> so<00:05:29.140> I'd<00:05:29.500> have<00:05:29.710> one<00:05:30.040> out<00:05:30.340> of<00:05:30.550> 36

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
problem so I'd have one out of 36

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.270 
problem so I'd have one out of 36
chances<00:05:31.990> of<00:05:32.820> getting<00:05:34.169> double<00:05:35.169> ones<00:05:35.350> so<00:05:35.919> it's

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
chances of getting double ones so it's

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.550 
chances of getting double ones so it's
not<00:05:36.490> very<00:05:37.150> likely<00:05:37.419> you're<00:05:37.900> gonna<00:05:38.020> get<00:05:38.200> double

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
not very likely you're gonna get double

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.040 
not very likely you're gonna get double
ones<00:05:38.740> but<00:05:39.400> sometimes<00:05:39.640> you<00:05:40.090> do<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.479> that<00:05:40.870> would

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
ones but sometimes you do and that would

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.130 
ones but sometimes you do and that would
wipe<00:05:41.229> out<00:05:41.380> all<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:42.010> scores<00:05:42.310> that<00:05:42.370> came<00:05:42.640> before

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
wipe out all the scores that came before

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.020 
wipe out all the scores that came before
