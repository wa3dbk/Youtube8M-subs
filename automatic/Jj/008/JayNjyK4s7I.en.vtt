well<00:02:19.370> with<00:02:19.730> Ivan<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.660> were<00:02:20.780> essentially

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
well with Ivan you were essentially

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.180 
well with Ivan you were essentially
immune<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:23.660> if<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.500> I<00:02:24.740> will

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
immune to that and if you I will

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.760 
immune to that and if you I will
sometimes<00:02:25.520> stick<00:02:25.730> Ivan<00:02:26.150> on<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.390> base<00:02:26.770> without

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
sometimes stick Ivan on a base without

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.640 
sometimes stick Ivan on a base without
any<00:02:28.130> intent<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.820> finish<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.240> base<00:02:29.450> off<00:02:29.720> but

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
any intent to finish that base off but

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.230 
any intent to finish that base off but
just<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.010> simply<00:02:31.340> his<00:02:31.490> special<00:02:31.790> ability<00:02:32.060> comes

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
just so simply his special ability comes

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.180 
just so simply his special ability comes
into<00:02:32.450> play<00:02:32.630> especially<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.710> get<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.920> bunch

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
into play especially if you get a bunch

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.100 
into play especially if you get a bunch
of<00:02:34.370> smaller<00:02:34.670> minions<00:02:35.090> maybe<00:02:35.300> in<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.540> mixed<00:02:35.960> up

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
of smaller minions maybe in a mixed up

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.300 
of smaller minions maybe in a mixed up
deck<00:02:36.380> with<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:37.030> then<00:02:38.030> we<00:02:38.180> have<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.570> count

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
deck with that then we have the count

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.300 
deck with that then we have the count
the<00:02:40.310> count<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.930> basically<00:02:42.470> just<00:02:42.590> your<00:02:42.980> blood

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
counter on him which is a huge deal

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.730 
counter on him which is a huge deal
because<00:02:50.510> minions<00:02:51.140> are<00:02:51.200> gonna<00:02:51.290> be<00:02:51.440> stored

quite<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> bit<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.370> game<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:52.820> if<00:02:53.510> the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
quite a bit in this game and if the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.180 
quite a bit in this game and if the
count<00:02:53.840> can<00:02:53.990> make<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.320> happen<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:54.680> much<00:02:55.010> to

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
count can make that happen so much to

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.520 
count can make that happen so much to
better<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.880> count<00:02:56.510> is<00:02:56.660> great<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.020> mix<00:02:57.230> with

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
better the count is great to mix with

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.440 
better the count is great to mix with
the<00:02:57.740> pirates<00:02:58.160> or<00:02:58.370> I'm<00:02:58.580> sorry<00:02:58.760> with<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.060> ninjas

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
the pirates or I'm sorry with the ninjas

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.940 
the pirates or I'm sorry with the ninjas

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
because they're killing minions right

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.500 
because they're killing minions right
and<00:03:01.220> left<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.670> so<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.940> count<00:03:02.150> just<00:03:02.270> gets

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
and left and so the count just gets

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.310 
and left and so the count just gets
stronger<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.260> stronger<00:03:04.240> then<00:03:05.240> we<00:03:05.360> have<00:03:05.540> micro

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
stronger and stronger then we have micro

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.910 
stronger and stronger then we have micro

other card I think then we have the
mimic<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.459> love<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.330> mimic<00:04:14.630> because<00:04:14.959> his<00:04:15.080> power

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
mimic I love the mimic because his power

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.229

so anyhow one of the cool things about

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.040 
so anyhow one of the cool things about
faction<00:05:32.630> is<00:05:32.750> how<00:05:32.930> unique<00:05:33.470> all<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:34.220> different

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
faction is how unique all the different

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.300
