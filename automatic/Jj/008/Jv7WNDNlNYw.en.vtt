00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.789
 version 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.090
 Anyway, you have to pay a bit more 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.949
 you also get more 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.640
 Koller to the first point 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.260
 The point is hardly on the subjects of fashion only distributes plays is specifically in the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.920

 Pictures Videos Whatever 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.610
 There you will see their concepts of how they approached what that might be like 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.400
 She could have looked like she lives now and everything she looks like 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.820
 thought her notes 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.080
 diligent snow building 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.690
 People and threw 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.720
 Kiel's you are average for the air that looks like one 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.720

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.710
 future Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare 3 here sees latex mattresses 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.040
 that means a lot of the battery now has excessive to come a year to call of 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.180
 Duty withdraws 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.320
 that usually costs 50 dollars over 50 euros I'm not quite 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.170
 for sure 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.740
 and that's part of it 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.450
 and bassist special concern 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.670
 it's not just that they sing as four months 3 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.510
 Viermetz degenerates 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.619

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.420
 St Japan Brandau and seemed to be coming from new maps are the Achimer 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.120
 December all that 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.670
 and the other one probably i'm not sure anything on it 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.900
 Once municipalities empty cover the always a bit so acted in the access 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.900
 to early maps which can also be very beneficial 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.590
 and the printed special special status at Call of Duty the British 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.019
 had explicit go in Bremen 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.170
 Player card new weapons came who had ill explido for additional the 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.989
 It means as much as he could in Call of Duty Elite 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.589
 at Handke Land more in sync we had more 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.479
 Experience points so the strings running has different weapons 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.589
 unknown access probably still had other implemented by project 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:33.849
 are displayed 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.009
 and many other things 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.519
 high quality Steelbooks special packaging 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.149
 This pack is suitable as the name suggests for collectors 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.459
 that means a lot of time has passed Andrews 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.730
 other materials great she looks very nice as you already on the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.929
 can occupy 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:55.419
 and yes, but also the final version so far we will not let us

 exclusive PlayStation Networks team with animated Modern Warfare 3 degrees 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:06.249
 Now I'm not sure if it's just bad luck between being the last player 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.179
 come fit for a bit 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.589
 but he got the Xbox 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.339
 he always comes one month earlier by text 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.189
 but I know that I do not believe it will actually do it 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.189
 That's one you have not achieved yet 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:25.659
 LÃ¼beck's oldest diary on more than 100 pages insights and 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.099
 Backgrounds to the entire time had 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.289
 that means so much yield of a diary Spanish from 1 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:35.539
 Paperbacks 1 and there are quite a lot of information too long danced Call 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:37.199
