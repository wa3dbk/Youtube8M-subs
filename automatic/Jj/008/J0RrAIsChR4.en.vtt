shapes I might want to connect all of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.999 
shapes I might want to connect all of
these<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> could<00:01:37.200> actually<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.680> an<00:01:37.799> elbow

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
these so I could actually do an elbow

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.240 
these so I could actually do an elbow
arrow<00:01:38.520> connector<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.860> take<00:01:41.009> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
arrow connector and I can just take that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.980 
arrow connector and I can just take that
and<00:01:41.430> draw<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.700> down<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:41.880> from<00:01:42.390> here<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.720> there

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and draw it down here from here to there

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.350 
and draw it down here from here to there
and<00:01:43.399> then<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.430> might<00:01:44.700> need<00:01:44.850> another<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and then I might need another one of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.350 
and then I might need another one of
those<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:47.460> could<00:01:47.610> actually<00:01:47.759> there<00:01:48.090> copy

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
those and so I could actually there copy

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.300 
those and so I could actually there copy
or<00:01:48.600> paste<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> could<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.770> insert

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
or paste this one or I could just insert

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.600 
or paste this one or I could just insert
another<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> ability<00:01:53.579> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
another one so we have the ability to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.840 
another one so we have the ability to
insert<00:01:54.090> more<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.509> those<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.430> maybe<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.549> want<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
insert more of those and maybe I want to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.910 
insert more of those and maybe I want to
take<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.799> run

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
take this one and I want this one to run

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.030 
take this one and I want this one to run
over<00:01:59.100> here<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.079> it'll<00:02:01.079> connect<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.590> all<00:02:01.740> that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
over here and it'll connect to all that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.789 
over here and it'll connect to all that
the<00:02:02.340> little<00:02:02.930> tangential<00:02:03.930> places<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.500> here<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the little tangential places on here and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.830 
the little tangential places on here and
then<00:02:04.920> when<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.100> move<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.520> around<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.719> all

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
then when I move it around then it all

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.740 
then when I move it around then it all
stays<00:02:07.110> connected<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> very

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
stays connected and so this is a very

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.839 
stays connected and so this is a very
easy<00:02:10.020> way<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.379> start<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.860> draw<00:02:11.009> little<00:02:11.340> simple

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
easy way to start to draw little simple

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.920 
easy way to start to draw little simple
charts<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.450> things

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
charts and things

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.240 
charts and things
now<00:02:13.989> one<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.439> the<00:02:14.530> things<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.829> use<00:02:15.010> the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
now one of the things I use the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.399 
now one of the things I use the
gridlines<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:16.209> lay<00:02:16.420> everything<00:02:16.540> out<00:02:16.959> but<00:02:17.230> then

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
gridlines to lay everything out but then

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.880 
gridlines to lay everything out but then
once<00:02:17.620> I'm<00:02:17.829> done<00:02:17.859> we<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.819> go<00:02:18.939> over<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.530> view<00:02:20.530> and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
once I'm done we can go over to view and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.800 
once I'm done we can go over to view and
turn<00:02:21.099> off<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.430> grid<00:02:21.640> lines<00:02:21.879> on<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.239> page<00:02:22.540> and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
turn off the grid lines on this page and

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.800 
turn off the grid lines on this page and
now<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:23.019> get<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> nice<00:02:23.469> clean<00:02:23.829> looking<00:02:24.430> page<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
now we get a nice clean looking page and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.449 
now we get a nice clean looking page and
if<00:02:26.319> we<00:02:26.409> wanted<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.709> we<00:02:26.829> could<00:02:26.980> put<00:02:27.250> in<00:02:27.370> a

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
if we wanted to we could put in a

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.699 
if we wanted to we could put in a
decision<00:02:28.030> Dimond<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:29.079> again<00:02:29.439> we<00:02:29.560> could

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
decision Dimond and again we could

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.789 
decision Dimond and again we could
change<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.219> colors<00:02:30.579> on<00:02:30.609> that<00:02:31.139> and<00:02:32.139> just

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
change the colors on that and just

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.190 
change the colors on that and just
connect<00:02:33.280> all<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.790> dots<00:02:33.819> here<00:02:34.389> so<00:02:35.049> it's

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
connect all of the dots here so it's

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.839 
connect all of the dots here so it's
pretty<00:02:35.409> easy<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.799> start<00:02:36.129> to<00:02:36.250> draw<00:02:36.430> whatever

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
pretty easy to start to draw whatever

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.619 
pretty easy to start to draw whatever
kind<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.510> diagram<00:02:38.379> you<00:02:38.590> want<00:02:39.090> now<00:02:40.090> sometimes

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
kind of diagram you want now sometimes

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.990 
kind of diagram you want now sometimes
we<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.439> things<00:02:41.739> like<00:02:41.859> charts<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.730> maybe<00:02:42.939> I

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
we have things like charts and maybe I

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.869 
we have things like charts and maybe I
want<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.299> make<00:02:43.420> an<00:02:43.569> annotation<00:02:43.870> on<00:02:44.319> this<00:02:44.500> chart

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
want to make an annotation on this chart

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.210 
want to make an annotation on this chart
like<00:02:45.879> an<00:02:46.030> insert<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:47.500> can<00:02:47.709> choose<00:02:47.980> to

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
like an insert and I can choose to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.149 
like an insert and I can choose to
insert<00:02:48.579> up<00:02:48.939> you<00:02:49.780> know<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:49.959> can<00:02:50.139> do<00:02:50.230> chart<00:02:50.980> you

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
insert up you know you can do chart you

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.940 
insert up you know you can do chart you
can<00:02:51.280> do<00:02:51.459> some<00:02:52.060> sort<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.359> box<00:02:52.629> again<00:02:53.139> or<00:02:53.379> you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
can do some sort of box again or you

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.009 
can do some sort of box again or you
could<00:02:54.099> use<00:02:54.280> some<00:02:54.549> sort<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.849> text<00:02:55.239> box<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.810> use

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
could use some sort of text box so I use

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:06.059 
could use some sort of text box so I use
text<00:02:56.409> boxes<00:02:56.439> a<00:02:56.859> lot<00:03:00.090> process<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.419> stabled<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:06.010> I

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
text boxes a lot process is stabled so I

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.309 
text boxes a lot process is stabled so I
might<00:03:06.250> want<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.540> put<00:03:07.540> some<00:03:07.599> little<00:03:07.930> special

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
might want to put some little special

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.690 
might want to put some little special
things<00:03:08.530> on<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.739> chart<00:03:09.069> so<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.310> can<00:03:09.400> actually

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
things on a chart so you can actually

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.330 
things on a chart so you can actually
just<00:03:10.060> stick<00:03:10.389> things<00:03:10.780> right<00:03:11.079> on<00:03:11.200> charts<00:03:11.680> you

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
just stick things right on charts you

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.179 
just stick things right on charts you
can<00:03:12.489> stick<00:03:12.730> them<00:03:12.819> on<00:03:12.969> worksheets<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.530> really

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
can stick them on worksheets and really

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.640 
can stick them on worksheets and really
start<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.930> make<00:03:16.930> everything<00:03:17.469> that<00:03:17.590> you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
start to make everything that you

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.460 
start to make everything that you
produce<00:03:17.829> a<00:03:18.099> lot<00:03:18.250> more<00:03:18.430> readable<00:03:19.229> so<00:03:20.229> again

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
produce a lot more readable so again

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.640 
produce a lot more readable so again
there's<00:03:20.680> very<00:03:21.250> many<00:03:21.609> kinds<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.409> things<00:03:23.409> that

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
there's very many kinds of things that

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.830 
there's very many kinds of things that
you<00:03:23.739> can<00:03:23.889> draw<00:03:24.099> it<00:03:24.190> here<00:03:24.430> curly<00:03:25.030> lines<00:03:25.269> square

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
you can draw it here curly lines square

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.869 
you can draw it here curly lines square
lines<00:03:28.709> flowcharts<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:30.099> know<00:03:30.220> if<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.459> wanted<00:03:30.760> to

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
lines flowcharts you know if I wanted to

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.879 
lines flowcharts you know if I wanted to
I<00:03:30.909> could<00:03:31.180> take<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.599> put<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.780> call-out<00:03:32.079> on<00:03:32.290> here

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
I could take and put a call-out on here

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.789 
I could take and put a call-out on here
you<00:03:33.639> know<00:03:33.669> and<00:03:34.030> simply<00:03:34.930> attach<00:03:35.229> that<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.769> a

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
you know and simply attach that to a

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.990 
you know and simply attach that to a
point<00:03:36.129> and<00:03:36.370> say<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:37.540> know<00:03:38.220> process<00:03:39.220> changed

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
point and say you know process changed

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.390 
point and say you know process changed
here<00:03:43.000> or<00:03:43.689> something<00:03:44.019> like<00:03:44.139> that<00:03:44.409> these<00:03:45.340> are

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
here or something like that these are

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.740 
here or something like that these are
the<00:03:45.549> kinds<00:03:45.849> of<00:03:45.909> things<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.449> can<00:03:46.629> do

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
the kinds of things that you can do

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.300 
the kinds of things that you can do
quickly<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.229> easily<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.889> then<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:48.069> just

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
quickly and easily and then you just

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.039 
quickly and easily and then you just
redirect<00:03:48.939> things<00:03:49.239> around<00:03:49.509> so<00:03:49.689> that<00:03:49.840> they<00:03:49.989> sit

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
redirect things around so that they sit

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.129 
redirect things around so that they sit
where<00:03:50.409> they're<00:03:50.530> supposed<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:50.979> sit<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:51.579> on<00:03:52.139> so
