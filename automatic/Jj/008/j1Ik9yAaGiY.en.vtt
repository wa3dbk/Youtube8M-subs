right<00:00:24.019> theros<00:00:25.019> trying<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.890> thought

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
right theros trying to get that thought

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.470 
right theros trying to get that thought
seized<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.609> think<00:00:26.849> that's<00:00:27.029> Khan's<00:00:27.300> of

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
seized and I think that's Khan's of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.990 
seized and I think that's Khan's of
tarkir<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.199> possible<00:00:28.859> chance<00:00:29.099> at<00:00:29.310> fetch<00:00:29.760> lands

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
tarkir so possible chance at fetch lands

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.170 
tarkir so possible chance at fetch lands
if<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.080> cons<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:35.149> crack<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
if that is cons I think it is crack a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:47.709 
if that is cons I think it is crack a
crack<00:00:36.780> syntax<00:00:45.440> yep<00:00:46.440> Khan's<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.950> tarkir<00:00:46.980> cool

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
crack syntax yep Khan's of tarkir cool

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.779 
crack syntax yep Khan's of tarkir cool
so<00:00:48.719> definitely<00:00:49.590> after<00:00:49.920> any<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> cool
