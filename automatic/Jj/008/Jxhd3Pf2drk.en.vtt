00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.450
 hola que tal soy oscar acosta by 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.250
 of electronic corporation we are going to 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.000
 introduce the reader 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.890
 800 magellan and the family of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.330
 datalogic and readers about 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.680
 directional then we're going to see a 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.600
 little what has been the design of 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.890
 this team if they fix is ​​pretty 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.910
 stylized what is being the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.199
 design as well as the ideal size for what 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.600
 what is a point of sale 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.650
 because it is omnidirectional good because 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.250
 it does not matter in which position we have it 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.710
 it's going to be a fairly broad beam of light 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.450
 that allows us to bring a code of 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.250
 bars read it quickly then 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.930
 knowing it we have a green light that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.149
 will allow us to identify that the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.879
 reading was correct as well as a sound 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.300
 or a beep and if they are fixed we have a light 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.680
 of led and an internal camera that without 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.800
 import the position of the code 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.399
 we can see it in addition to the fact that 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.619
 team can read 1d and 2d then let's 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.960
 do some tests in this case I'm going to 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.700
 take this container as it is located 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.390
 bar code and it does not matter the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.270
 position 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.400
 that the present is going to read shift and that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.620
 the reading is very good and it is enough that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.150
 approach it to the light ones to make your 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.650
 reading 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.570
 let's take this other then 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.700
 we identify the barcode and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.430
 it is enough that we approach it so that the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.729
 reading is done correctly and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.870
 immediate not in this case I'm also going to 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.610
 teach them what they are saying 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.430
 a 2d code in this case is a 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.070
 leave Jalisco then if they fix 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 We have a code containing as pdf 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.920
 a lot of information then we are going to do 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.580
 Reading to be given an idea 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.270
 the reader capabilities I will bring 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.350
 what they set in a matter of seconds 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.780
 did the reading of a lot of data no no yes 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.990
 you can see on the screen but 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.930
 Well in this case it's a lot 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:22.580
 information in a few seconds we are going to 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.940
 repeat this process I will delete it and the 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.400
 2d code we bring it closer and there we have 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.280
 all the information displayed in so 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.620
 just a few seconds this is with a 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.170
 license obviously we can do it with 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.879
 different products and quickly 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.670
 we can not mix it 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.739
 It is a team as well as very economic 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.959
 versatile for the people that we have 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.110
 than having your hands free when it comes to 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.230
 be processing the information or 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.860
 using different codes then 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.950
 in short it is the evil of lan 800 and 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:07.569
 available in electronic corporation if 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:09.720
 via webpage www.xtb.es contacts with 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:15.239
 us for any questions or 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.239
 sales clarification thanks
