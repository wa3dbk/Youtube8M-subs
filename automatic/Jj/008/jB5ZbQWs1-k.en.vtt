00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
up happening is they don't have the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.900 
up happening is they don't have the
graphics<00:00:46.260> power<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.649> make<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.890> happen<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
graphics power to make it happen and to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.209 
graphics power to make it happen and to
push<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> software<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.170> wait<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:49.829> buying

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
push the software so wait so then buying

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.240 
push the software so wait so then buying
a<00:00:50.640> separate<00:00:51.360> video<00:00:51.600> card<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> 9600<00:00:53.070> GT

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
a separate video card like the 9600 GT

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.760 
a separate video card like the 9600 GT
actually<00:00:54.120> makes<00:00:54.300> my<00:00:54.480> pc<00:00:54.870> run<00:00:54.899> faster<00:00:55.500> yeah

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
actually makes my pc run faster yeah

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.529 
actually makes my pc run faster yeah
exactly<00:00:55.980> again<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> store-bought<00:00:56.969> pcs

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
exactly again with the store-bought pcs

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.029 
exactly again with the store-bought pcs
a<00:00:57.629> lot<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.930> times<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> graphics<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.829> built

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
a lot of the times the graphics is built

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.979 
a lot of the times the graphics is built
into<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> motherboard<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.359> CPU<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
into the motherboard and the CPU is

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.029 
into the motherboard and the CPU is
actually<00:01:01.260> putting<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> picture<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
actually putting the picture on the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.280 
actually putting the picture on the
screen<00:01:02.160> well<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.930> now<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
screen well with that you now have a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.690 
screen well with that you now have a
processor<00:01:04.830> that's<00:01:05.010> supposed<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.460> doing

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
processor that's supposed to be doing

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490 
processor that's supposed to be doing
application<00:01:06.330> work<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:07.140> putting<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
application work but now putting a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.719 
application work but now putting a
picture<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> screen<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.159> by<00:01:08.400> having<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
picture on the screen so by having a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.070 
picture on the screen so by having a
separate<00:01:09.150> graphics<00:01:09.390> card<00:01:09.780> which<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
separate graphics card which is a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.289 
separate graphics card which is a
processor<00:01:10.920> what<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.670> does<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.000> now<00:01:12.240> takes

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
processor what it does is it now takes

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.330 
processor what it does is it now takes
all<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> power<00:01:13.110> off<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.350> computer<00:01:13.920> processor

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
all the power off the computer processor

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.800 
all the power off the computer processor
and<00:01:14.700> puts<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> graphics<00:01:15.450> processor<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and puts it on the graphics processor to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.719 
and puts it on the graphics processor to
put<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> picture<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.439> screen<00:01:16.560> by<00:01:17.369> doing

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
put a picture on the screen by doing

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.700 
put a picture on the screen by doing
that<00:01:17.759> again<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.540> CPU<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.170> free<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.530> do

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that again your CPU is now free to do

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.990 
that again your CPU is now free to do
what<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.920> was<00:01:19.979> meant<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.670> meant<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
what it was meant to do it was meant to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.210 
what it was meant to do it was meant to
do<00:01:21.259> applications<00:01:22.259> where<00:01:22.439> there<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.710> Photoshop

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
do applications where there be Photoshop

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.550 
do applications where there be Photoshop
again<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.790> studio<00:01:24.090> plus<00:01:24.390> Microsoft<00:01:25.380> Office

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
again or studio plus Microsoft Office

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.950 
again or studio plus Microsoft Office
any<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.130> those<00:01:26.250> things<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.790> now<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.570> CPU

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
any one of those things and now the CPU

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.270 
any one of those things and now the CPU
can<00:01:28.110> actually<00:01:28.350> run<00:01:28.470> faster<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.799> your<00:01:29.009> PC

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
can actually run faster and your PC

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.460 
can actually run faster and your PC
overall<00:01:29.610> runs<00:01:29.790> faster<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.180> well<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.720> Josh<00:01:30.990> for

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
overall runs faster as well so Josh for

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.800 
overall runs faster as well so Josh for
