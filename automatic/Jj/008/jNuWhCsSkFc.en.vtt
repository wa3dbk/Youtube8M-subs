okay<00:00:00.719> so<00:00:01.319> watching<00:00:02.010> and<00:00:02.790> then<00:00:03.030> when<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:03.870> got

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
okay so watching and then when you got

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.690 
okay so watching and then when you got
someone<00:00:04.259> then<00:00:04.710> you<00:00:04.830> can<00:00:04.980> practice<00:00:05.430> with<00:00:05.460> this

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
someone then you can practice with this

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.000 
someone then you can practice with this
so<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.390> poncho<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.779> when<00:00:07.080> he<00:00:07.170> punch<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.740> block

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
so the poncho is when he punch I block

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.600 
so the poncho is when he punch I block
after<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.030> use<00:00:09.570> knowing<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.860> first<00:00:11.070> couple

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
after you use knowing the first couple

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.770 
after you use knowing the first couple
episode<00:00:12.030> we<00:00:12.120> thought<00:00:12.330> about<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.570> lot<00:00:12.719> of

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
episode we thought about a lot of

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.930 
episode we thought about a lot of
blocking<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.320> lot<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.559> hitting<00:00:13.790> exactly<00:00:14.790> what

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
blocking a lot of hitting exactly what

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.369 
blocking a lot of hitting exactly what
we<00:00:15.059> taught<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.330> repeat<00:00:15.630> album<00:00:15.960> here<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.260> when

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
we taught to repeat album here so when

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.519 
we taught to repeat album here so when
he<00:00:16.440> punch<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.539> particular<00:00:18.539> using<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.289> hand

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529

now<00:00:34.290> learning<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.219> learning<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
now learning this is learning to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.270 
now learning this is learning to
understand<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> energy<00:00:37.170> where<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
understand in the energy where is the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.209 
understand in the energy where is the
energy<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:39.270> he<00:00:39.450> forcing<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:39.989> Assuan<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> know

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
energy if he forcing in Assuan so I know

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.020 
energy if he forcing in Assuan so I know
where<00:00:41.550> he<00:00:41.760> is

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
where he is

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.540 
where he is
that's<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.510> energy<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:43.620> he<00:00:43.800> movie<00:00:44.100> hand<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that's the energy if he movie hand I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.729 
that's the energy if he movie hand I
don't<00:00:45.059> need<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> move<00:00:45.690> anywhere<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.410> it's

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
don't need to move anywhere because it's

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.310 
don't need to move anywhere because it's
no<00:00:47.129> force<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.700> movie<00:00:48.329> hand<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.719> don't<00:00:49.110> need<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
no force here movie hand I don't need to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.930 
no force here movie hand I don't need to
go<00:00:49.469> whit<00:00:49.680> ladder<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.550> he<00:00:50.640> started

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
go whit ladder because if he started

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000 
go whit ladder because if he started
doing<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.539> lost<00:00:51.750> balance<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.320> can

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
doing that I lost balance and that can

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.700 
doing that I lost balance and that can
become<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.300> dangerous<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.620> he

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
become very very dangerous so when he

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.260 
become very very dangerous so when he
doing<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.160> particular<00:00:56.340> bit<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.090> it

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
doing this particular bit here it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.660 
doing this particular bit here it
knowing<00:00:57.780> where<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> body<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.670> understanding

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
knowing where the body is understanding

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.069 
knowing where the body is understanding
where<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> hand<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.239> knowing<00:01:00.840> where<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
where the hand is knowing where the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.229 
where the hand is knowing where the
movement<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:01.980> where<00:01:02.250> he<00:01:02.340> hit<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> when

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
movement is that's where he hit it when

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.390 
movement is that's where he hit it when
he<00:01:03.329> hit<00:01:03.539> make<00:01:03.899> sure<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> grab<00:01:04.409> because<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.309> he

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
he hit make sure you grab because if he

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.640 
he hit make sure you grab because if he
not<00:01:05.580> corrupt<00:01:05.939> later<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.020> find<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.470> will

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
not corrupt later on you find it will

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.500 
not corrupt later on you find it will
trap<00:01:07.950> while<00:01:08.310> he<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> moment<00:01:09.090> he<00:01:09.240> you

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
trap while he do in a moment he you

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.539 
trap while he do in a moment he you
relax<00:01:09.900> he<00:01:10.260> will<00:01:10.409> return<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.280> need<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
relax he will return and I need to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
relax he will return and I need to
resume<00:01:11.850> then<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.450> movement<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.200> and
