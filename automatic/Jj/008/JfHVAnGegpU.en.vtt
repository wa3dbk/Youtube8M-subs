00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.870 
there's also a fishing spot so if you're
having<00:03:08.470> no<00:03:08.769> look<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.280> right<00:03:09.489> side<00:03:09.730> when

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
having no look on the right side when

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.789 
having no look on the right side when
you're<00:03:10.000> home<00:03:10.150> for<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.359> salmon<00:03:10.600> then<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.620> just

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
you're home for the salmon then you just

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.660 
you're home for the salmon then you just
try<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:11.980> left<00:03:12.160> side<00:03:12.340> moccasin<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:14.579> you<00:03:15.579> know

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
try the left side moccasin and you know

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.099 
try the left side moccasin and you know
eventually<00:03:15.910> you'll<00:03:16.269> have<00:03:16.389> luck<00:03:16.630> at<00:03:16.750> one<00:03:16.959> of

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
eventually you'll have luck at one of

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.129 
eventually you'll have luck at one of
them<00:03:17.910> then<00:03:18.910> somewhere<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.420> was<00:03:19.480> like<00:03:19.690> right

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
them then somewhere it was like right

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.720 
them then somewhere it was like right
here<00:03:20.410> something<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.920> may<00:03:21.100> be<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.250> mistake<00:03:21.549> in

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
here something I may be a mistake in

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.610 
here something I may be a mistake in
there

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
there

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.890 
there
swirl<00:03:23.620> his<00:03:23.829> leg<00:03:23.950> right<00:03:24.130> here

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.780 

they<00:03:27.530> do<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.680> little<00:03:27.890> bit

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
they do a little bit

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.490 
they do a little bit
okay<00:03:30.330> let's<00:03:30.540> see<00:03:30.659> if<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> one<00:03:30.959> on<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.140> left<00:03:31.379> is

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
okay let's see if the one on the left is

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.399 
okay let's see if the one on the left is
at<00:03:31.680> least<00:03:31.890> there<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.900> one<00:03:34.019> on<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.230> Left

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
at least there and the one on the Left

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:40.610 
at least there and the one on the Left
isn't<00:03:34.709> even<00:03:34.890> there<00:03:38.959> maybe<00:03:39.959> it's<00:03:40.200> only<00:03:40.319> there

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
isn't even there maybe it's only there

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.399 
isn't even there maybe it's only there
when<00:03:40.829> you're<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.099> for<00:03:41.370> salmon<00:03:42.200> we'll<00:03:43.200> come

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
when you're going for salmon we'll come

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:53.190 
when you're going for salmon we'll come
back<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.599> later

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.290 

let's<00:03:53.740> see<00:03:53.950> if<00:03:54.010> we<00:03:54.099> can<00:03:54.220> find<00:03:54.400> some<00:03:54.700> fish<00:03:55.000> yeah

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
let's see if we can find some fish yeah

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:04.130 
let's see if we can find some fish yeah
finish<00:03:55.690> up<00:03:55.840> this<00:03:56.050> one

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.570 

now<00:04:04.680> what<00:04:04.860> does<00:04:04.920> head<00:04:05.070> back<00:04:05.220> over<00:04:05.430> here<00:04:05.490> to

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
now what does head back over here to

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:17.870 
now what does head back over here to
this<00:04:05.760> first<00:04:06.000> little<00:04:06.180> buoy<00:04:07.170> thing<00:04:16.730> okay<00:04:17.730> we'll

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
this first little buoy thing okay we'll

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.250 
this first little buoy thing okay we'll
go<00:04:18.000> ahead<00:04:18.060> finish<00:04:18.600> this<00:04:18.720> one<00:04:18.870> off<00:04:18.959> right<00:04:19.170> here

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
go ahead finish this one off right here

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.039 
go ahead finish this one off right here
at<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.470> buoy<00:04:20.299> we<00:04:21.299> can<00:04:21.420> catch<00:04:21.570> up<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.810> fuller

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
at this buoy we can catch up a fuller

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:35.370 
at this buoy we can catch up a fuller
fish<00:04:22.290> so<00:04:23.330> shouldn't<00:04:24.330> be<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.600> difficult

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:47.330 

Oh

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.500 

we<00:04:47.880> have<00:04:49.370> should<00:04:50.370> do<00:04:50.639> it<00:04:50.790> hopefully<00:04:51.120> we'll<00:04:51.389> get

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
we have should do it hopefully we'll get

00:04:51.510 --> 00:05:07.740 
we have should do it hopefully we'll get
a<00:04:51.570> pretty<00:04:51.780> big<00:04:51.990> one<00:04:52.139> this<00:04:52.290> time

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.570 

well<00:05:08.350> it's<00:05:08.800> not<00:05:08.950> going<00:05:09.100> to<00:05:09.160> do<00:05:09.280> this<00:05:09.370> nothing

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
well it's not going to do this nothing

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.840 
well it's not going to do this nothing
they<00:05:09.700> go<00:05:10.830> we'll<00:05:11.830> try<00:05:11.980> one<00:05:12.160> more<00:05:12.430> time<00:05:12.670> because

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
they go we'll try one more time because

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.800 
they go we'll try one more time because
we<00:05:13.060> like<00:05:13.390> seventy<00:05:13.780> one<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.110> half<00:05:14.290> pounds

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
we like seventy one and a half pounds

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:25.020 
we like seventy one and a half pounds
and<00:05:16.810> then<00:05:17.320> we<00:05:17.410> only<00:05:17.500> have<00:05:17.680> sixty<00:05:18.010> six<00:05:24.030> wasn't
