00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.669
 Hello 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.689
 From now on 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.169
 About Japanese Language for Junior High School Examinations 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.719
 I want to talk 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.370
 I am a student of junior high school exam tutor 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.369
 Thank you 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.039
 First of all I would like to see a little bit 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.999
 If you roughly divide it with mail 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.849
 It is also referred to as an explanatory note 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.240
 I was an explanatory member 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.020
 Two wins 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.030
 It is me, there is a pattern 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.629
 I will put this together 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.120
 I was in fourth place last month 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.110
 It is a mistake to say that we should refrain mainly in 1998 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.180
 Not 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.920
 I will be the chief of the reporter 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.580
 It is an assertion of one company 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.530
 That's why I am not listening to the American and American masters 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.530
 This is 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.680
 Talk 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.280
 a For the most part Katayama will be asked once 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.690
 Hero's feelings 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.230
 It is a new year 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.070
 So the feeling of the hero is 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 With what feelings head on to resume 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.710
 So this too 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.340
 That morning in the Kanto region 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.450
 Being tired is 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.610
 Because there is not 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.850
 So I want you not to make a mistake there 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.580
 Read the Skymark story and constant rootkit bases etc. 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.430
 There is a story that is 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.010
 In such a case 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.010
 Most of the time when I can get it that hero 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.800
 And feelings of 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.720
 I will follow my feelings 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.020
 However 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.530
 Feeling of the hero or feeling of the character 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.440
 If you disagree or disagree 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.300
 In that case, if you do not have the seedlings to substitute 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.990
 Draft if you enter 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.140
 Military force 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.660
 Can escape 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.810
 So first of all the name was too much 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.990
 Get 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.790
 I can't wait from now on 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.839
 Talking about eco-explanatory text 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:14.229
 More about holding 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:15.379
 What 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.989
 I want to do it 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.269
 Thank you
