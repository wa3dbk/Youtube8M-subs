crap you don't need a board and they're
using<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.400> carbon<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.780> know

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
using this carbon then you know

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
using this carbon then you know
basically<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:19.650> did<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.250> no

idea<00:01:20.549> how<00:01:20.640> they<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.390> they're<00:01:21.570> using

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
idea how they do it but they're using

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.800 
idea how they do it but they're using
the<00:01:22.229> carbon<00:01:22.799> fiber<00:01:23.100> from<00:01:23.490> next<00:01:24.090> year's<00:01:24.299> f1

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810

the carbon fiber from next year's f1
cars<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> Imperator<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.189> tuned<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
cars so the Imperator is tuned like a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
cars so the Imperator is tuned like a
race<00:01:27.119> car<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.960> fragile<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> race

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
race car and it's fragile like a race

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.620 
race car and it's fragile like a race
car<00:01:28.950> because<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.909> doesn't<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.270> those<00:01:30.420> extra
