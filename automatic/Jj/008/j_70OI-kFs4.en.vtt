 this becomes a very comfortable thing if 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.580
 we don't want to do for let's say for two 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.050
 the same very interesting passage 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.490
 also the possibility of giving 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.920
 take a look immediately based on the little icon 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.990
 that is created when we go to download 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.490
 a song what are the songs we have 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.490
 already downloaded to the device 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.689
 in any case once the tracks have been decided by 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.200

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:35.020

 download from our music section e 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.470
 even if we add playlists then 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.720
 we can go and find both as 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.880
 playlist is then obviously the songs both 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.140

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.890
