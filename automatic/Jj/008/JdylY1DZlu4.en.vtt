00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.280

 be sexual problems aus sexual 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.860
 personality disorders bipolarity 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.629
 taking to the point really where I want 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.640
 arrive as you will have seen in a 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.350
 song of mine that is called the boy and the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.239
 monster that I'm going to leave you there in 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.920
 the description that song too and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.740
 this song they loved a lot because 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.409
 express 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.600
 the hundreds of other people who suffer 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.950
 this misfortune and something that all 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.659
 people who listen to this song will 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.430
 put in their shoes for and many are 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.439
 they ask every time that a song if 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.119
 all the songs speak about me and 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.950
 it's really not that I'm talking about all the 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.570
 songs with things that happened to me but 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.340
 with things that I feel with things that I 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.289
 they hurt like for example if I get to do 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.670
 a song to put of africa of children 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.080
 that die of hunger I do not know what I am 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.970
 explaining that I'm starving but 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.220
 that is already a separate issue what I 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.200
 I want to emphasize is that the truth 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.600
 all the fans came very much 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.880
 mine who suffer from the misfortunes that 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.850
 I am a victim of bullying and 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.640
 way that they felt identified 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.950
 as much as to be able to dare to 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.470
 express and tell everything they feel 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.080
 them and everything that happens to them of people 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.780
 expressing yourself and feeling what the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.280
 song the truth mentions me very much 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.929
 because I feel that the message I wanted 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.200
 give here arrived but very very 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.209
 deep 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.069
 I think I want to say is that I do not know 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.289
 surrender to everyone who has already passed 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.630
 this move on may be many 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.000
 songs of mine without which he spoke as of 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.340
 depression they feel like I speak 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.050
 of sad things what I do the other but 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.610
 basically everything I want to think about 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.380
 these songs are affections 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.900
 psychological that he may have had 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.690
 anyone for different reasons 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.760
 and take them to the point of saying this you 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.560
 can destroy but like that does not 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.240
 means that one can not 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.520

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.400

 mine too see how many followers 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.140
 they felt identified as much as 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.510

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.770
 I really congratulate all of them

 say what one feels or suffers in a 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.150
 courage because many are silent many 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.790
 they are locked in themselves and do not say 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.980
 nothing but there are others who tell what 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.040
 express and consciously identified with 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.530

 high with the dream they have no matter 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.690
 because with dedication effort everything is 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.910
 may not let that nonsense like 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.700
 it makes them fall under all always 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.770
 can solve if one is worth it 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.210
 same layers that you feel that nobody 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.190
 can help but there are going to be many 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.110
 moments when you indicate for help and go 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.820
 to have to be worth the same and 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.980
 answer is that it is worth the same and when 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.260
 you have to really put eggs and 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.200
 face reality and do everything 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.210
