00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.440 

okay<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:30.360> is<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.930> finished<00:03:31.410> lip<00:03:32.450> it's

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
okay so this is the finished lip it's

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.510 
okay so this is the finished lip it's
kind<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.840> bigger<00:03:34.080> but<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.950> really<00:03:35.340> really

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
kind of bigger but I really really

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.550 
kind of bigger but I really really
really<00:03:35.730> like<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.420> um<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:37.470> went<00:03:38.250> back<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:38.730> fixed

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
really like it um I went back and fixed

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.890 
really like it um I went back and fixed
most<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.980> lines<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.150> messed<00:03:42.390> up<00:03:42.600> on

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
most of the lines that I messed up on

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.260 
most of the lines that I messed up on
but<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:44.040> think<00:03:44.310> overall<00:03:44.580> it<00:03:44.730> looks<00:03:44.940> really

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
but I think overall it looks really

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.420 
but I think overall it looks really
really<00:03:45.330> good<00:03:45.510> um<00:03:45.960> I<00:03:46.680> know<00:03:46.920> I'm<00:03:47.130> going<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.310> get

really good um I know I'm going to get

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.970 
really good um I know I'm going to get
some<00:03:47.580> questions<00:03:47.760> on<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.690> don't<00:03:49.650> have<00:03:49.800> any

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
some questions on this I don't have any

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.040 
some questions on this I don't have any
lip<00:03:50.220> fillers<00:03:50.610> I<00:03:50.940> have<00:03:51.090> not<00:03:51.240> done<00:03:51.360> anything<00:03:51.690> to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
lip fillers I have not done anything to

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.260 
lip fillers I have not done anything to
my<00:03:52.170> lips<00:03:52.350> as<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.650> can<00:03:52.800> tell<00:03:52.980> by<00:03:53.670> that<00:03:53.700> scar

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
my lips as you can tell by that scar

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.950 
my lips as you can tell by that scar
right<00:03:54.510> there<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:55.050> was<00:03:55.620> bit<00:03:55.920> by<00:03:56.190> my<00:03:56.700> dog<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.570> I

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
right there I was bit by my dog and I

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.240 
right there I was bit by my dog and I
had<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.170> get<00:03:58.260> stitches<00:03:58.500> that's<00:03:58.800> why<00:03:58.920> my<00:03:59.040> lips

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
had to get stitches that's why my lips

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.950 
had to get stitches that's why my lips
are<00:03:59.370> kind<00:03:59.550> of<00:03:59.610> uneven<00:04:00.000> on<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.390> top<00:04:00.570> but<00:04:00.870> that's

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
are kind of uneven on the top but that's

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.350 
are kind of uneven on the top but that's
why<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.140> fill<00:04:01.410> them<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.680> because<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.460> don't<00:04:02.820> like

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
why I fill them in because I don't like

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.080 
why I fill them in because I don't like
that<00:04:03.570> it's<00:04:03.810> kind<00:04:03.960> of<00:04:03.990> like<00:04:04.140> an<00:04:04.260> insecurity<00:04:04.740> so

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
that it's kind of like an insecurity so

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.780 
that it's kind of like an insecurity so
yeah<00:04:06.090> that's<00:04:06.360> why<00:04:07.190> they<00:04:08.190> look<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.490> little<00:04:08.610> bit

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
yeah that's why they look a little bit

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.040 
yeah that's why they look a little bit
different<00:04:09.150> it's<00:04:09.270> not<00:04:09.330> because<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.840> any

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
different it's not because I have any

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.780 
different it's not because I have any
work<00:04:10.230> done<00:04:10.410> or<00:04:10.890> anything<00:04:11.100> like<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:11.490> I

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
work done or anything like that so I

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.070 
work done or anything like that so I
don't<00:04:12.000> even<00:04:12.090> want<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.450> guys<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.630> think<00:04:12.810> that
