to use it here and I imagine it makes a
bit<00:01:25.759> of<00:01:25.790> a<00:01:25.910> difference<00:01:26.330> you<00:01:26.420> know<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.780> the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
bit of a difference you know the the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.780 
bit of a difference you know the the
strings<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.830> racket<00:01:28.160> that<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.399> use<00:01:28.610> when

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
strings and the racket that you use when

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.040 
strings and the racket that you use when
you're<00:01:28.910> playing<00:01:29.090> in<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.300> tennis<00:01:29.420> match<00:01:29.570> it

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
you're playing in a tennis match it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.510 
you're playing in a tennis match it
makes<00:01:30.259> a<00:01:30.410> tremendous<00:01:30.560> difference<00:01:30.920> when<00:01:31.490> the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
makes a tremendous difference when the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.760 
makes a tremendous difference when the
top<00:01:31.820> players<00:01:32.090> spend<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.840> lot<00:01:33.110> of<00:01:33.140> money<00:01:33.259> invest

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
top players spend a lot of money invest

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.400 
top players spend a lot of money invest
a<00:01:33.860> lot<00:01:33.979> of<00:01:34.040> money<00:01:34.280> in<00:01:34.840> getting<00:01:35.840> their<00:01:35.990> rackets

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
a lot of money in getting their rackets

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.710 
a lot of money in getting their rackets
exactly<00:01:37.100> how<00:01:37.220> they<00:01:37.399> want<00:01:37.430> them<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.030> then<00:01:38.509> all

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
exactly how they want them and then all

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.230 
exactly how they want them and then all
the<00:01:38.750> rackets<00:01:39.229> exactly<00:01:39.800> matched<00:01:40.039> and<00:01:40.759> then<00:01:40.970> top

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
the rackets exactly matched and then top

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.210 
the rackets exactly matched and then top
class<00:01:41.509> ringing<00:01:41.930> as<00:01:42.080> well<00:01:42.259> so<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.130> obviously

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
class ringing as well so it obviously

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.370 
class ringing as well so it obviously
makes<00:01:43.550> a<00:01:43.729> difference<00:01:44.119> on<00:01:44.270> these<00:01:44.479> marginal

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
makes a difference on these marginal

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.889 
makes a difference on these marginal
gains<00:01:45.560> that<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.310> it's<00:01:47.060> quite<00:01:47.240> topical<00:01:47.750> at<00:01:47.810> the

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
gains that so it's quite topical at the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:48.920 
gains that so it's quite topical at the
moment

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
moment

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.230 
moment
then<00:01:49.470> these<00:01:50.310> make<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> hell<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.910> a<00:01:51.060> difference

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
then these make a hell of a difference

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.480 
then these make a hell of a difference
when<00:01:51.690> you're<00:01:51.870> adding<00:01:52.080> up<00:01:52.350> all<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.770> aspects<00:01:53.370> of
