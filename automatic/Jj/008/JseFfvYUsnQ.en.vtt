00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
biggest hits that we took was to our

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.700 
biggest hits that we took was to our
soybeans<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.870> at<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> time<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> beans<00:00:43.440> went

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
soybeans in at the time the beans went

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.990 
soybeans in at the time the beans went
in<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:43.950> wasn't<00:00:44.190> enough<00:00:44.340> subsoil<00:00:44.940> moisture

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
in there wasn't enough subsoil moisture

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.690 
in there wasn't enough subsoil moisture
or<00:00:45.570> enough<00:00:46.050> actually<00:00:46.920> surface<00:00:47.250> moisture<00:00:47.370> to

or enough actually surface moisture to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.250 
or enough actually surface moisture to
germinate<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> seeds<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.660> they<00:00:48.809> SAT<00:00:49.050> there

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
germinate the seeds so they SAT there

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.930 
germinate the seeds so they SAT there
forever<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.039> stayed<00:00:50.250> dry<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.879> they

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
forever and then it stayed dry and they

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
forever and then it stayed dry and they
never<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.449> did<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.780> growing<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> had<00:00:53.250> a

never really did get growing so I had a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760 
never really did get growing so I had a
bunch<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.610> food<00:00:53.789> plots<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.180> only<00:00:54.390> had<00:00:54.770> three

bunch of food plots that only had three

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.250 
bunch of food plots that only had three
to<00:00:55.890> four<00:00:56.100> inch<00:00:56.309> tall<00:00:56.520> beans<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.030> them<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
to four inch tall beans in them and to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.010 
to four inch tall beans in them and to
rescue<00:00:58.590> these<00:00:58.710> plots<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.190> went<00:00:59.430> in<00:01:00.020> sometime

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
really this is the time when a lot of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.480 
really this is the time when a lot of
the<00:01:46.140> other<00:01:46.409> things<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> deer<00:01:47.310> would<00:01:47.460> be

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the other things that the deer would be

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.700 
the other things that the deer would be
eating<00:01:47.729> are<00:01:48.360> starting<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.689> disappear<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
eating are starting to disappear the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.649 
eating are starting to disappear the
farmers<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.250> harvested<00:01:50.490> their<00:01:50.790> crops<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.360> lot

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
farmers have harvested their crops a lot

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.920 
farmers have harvested their crops a lot
of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> waste<00:01:52.290> grain<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.829> gone<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.360> Browse<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
of the waste grain is gone the Browse is

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.020 
of the waste grain is gone the Browse is
pretty<00:01:55.439> well<00:01:55.619> dried<00:01:56.009> up<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.369> scammy<00:01:56.729> there's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
pretty well dried up and scammy there's

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.179 
pretty well dried up and scammy there's
not<00:01:57.149> much<00:01:57.299> browse<00:01:57.570> left<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.100> have

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
not much browse left so to have

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.760 
not much browse left so to have
something<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> come<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.780> deer<00:02:01.740> are

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
something to come in that the deer are

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.350 
something to come in that the deer are
really<00:02:02.130> attracted<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> right<00:02:02.909> now<00:02:03.060> makes<00:02:03.299> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
really attracted to right now makes a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.539 
really attracted to right now makes a
lot<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.509> sense<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.649> brassicas<00:02:05.130> continue

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
lot of sense and the brassicas continue

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.280 
lot of sense and the brassicas continue
to<00:02:05.640> grow<00:02:05.820> during<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.299> late<00:02:06.450> summer<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:07.079> they

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
to grow during the late summer then they

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.270 
to grow during the late summer then they
hit<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> certain<00:02:07.619> point<00:02:07.860> where<00:02:08.129> they're

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
hit a certain point where they're

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.610 
hit a certain point where they're
they're<00:02:09.179> basically

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
they're basically

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.589 
they're basically
they<00:02:11.620> stop<00:02:11.890> growing<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.430> then<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.360> deer<00:02:13.569> are

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
they stop growing and then the deer are

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.140 
they stop growing and then the deer are
super<00:02:14.319> attracted<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.950> them<00:02:15.129> until<00:02:15.909> it<00:02:16.030> gets

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
super attracted to them until it gets

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.699 
super attracted to them until it gets
really<00:02:16.299> cold<00:02:16.599> and<00:02:16.900> there's<00:02:17.319> something<00:02:17.500> the

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
really cold and there's something the

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.440 
really cold and there's something the
changes<00:02:18.129> in<00:02:18.159> the<00:02:18.400> chemical<00:02:18.790> composition<00:02:18.909> of

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
changes in the chemical composition of

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.479 
changes in the chemical composition of
the<00:02:19.569> plants<00:02:20.019> they<00:02:20.470> become<00:02:20.769> more<00:02:20.950> palatable

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
the plants they become more palatable

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.759 
the plants they become more palatable
the<00:02:21.970> colder<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.480> gets<00:02:22.659> and<00:02:23.200> what<00:02:23.319> we<00:02:23.409> find<00:02:23.560> is

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
the colder it gets and what we find is

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.229 
the colder it gets and what we find is
they<00:02:23.890> do<00:02:23.950> hit<00:02:24.129> them<00:02:24.280> somewhat<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:24.909> early

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
they do hit them somewhat in the early

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.300 
they do hit them somewhat in the early
fall<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:26.019> they<00:02:26.140> start<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.799> really<00:02:27.040> hit<00:02:27.190> him

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
fall but they start to really hit him

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.699 
fall but they start to really hit him
hard<00:02:27.370> during<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.819> late<00:02:28.000> season<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.620> is

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
hard during the late season so it is

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.800 
hard during the late season so it is
just<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.980> simple<00:02:30.310> thing<00:02:30.549> of<00:02:30.700> broadcasts<00:02:31.450> eating

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
just a simple thing of broadcasts eating

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.650 
just a simple thing of broadcasts eating
the<00:02:32.140> brassicas<00:02:32.799> into<00:02:33.519> my<00:02:33.640> soybean<00:02:34.060> food<00:02:34.360> plots

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
the brassicas into my soybean food plots

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.839 
the brassicas into my soybean food plots
during<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.440> middle<00:02:35.739> of<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.920> summer<00:02:36.160> that's

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
during the middle of the summer that's

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:37.949 
during the middle of the summer that's
led<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.150> some<00:02:37.329> really<00:02:37.569> pretty<00:02:37.720> good

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
led to some really pretty good

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.360 
led to some really pretty good
opportunities<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.680> we've<00:02:38.769> got<00:02:38.980> coming<00:02:39.220> up

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
opportunities that we've got coming up

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.160 
opportunities that we've got coming up
here<00:02:39.549> during<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.849> late<00:02:40.000> season<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.989> without

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
here during the late season and without

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.449 
here during the late season and without
those<00:02:41.349> brassicas<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:41.950> don't<00:02:42.129> know<00:02:42.190> what<00:02:42.340> we'd

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
those brassicas I don't know what we'd

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.369 
those brassicas I don't know what we'd
be<00:02:42.579> doing<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:43.060> mean<00:02:43.360> we<00:02:43.569> would<00:02:43.720> be<00:02:43.870> kind<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.260> dead

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
be doing I mean we would be kind of dead

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.869 
be doing I mean we would be kind of dead
in<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> water<00:02:44.769> right<00:02:44.890> now<00:02:45.160> with<00:02:45.370> no<00:02:45.519> food<00:02:45.730> on

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
in the water right now with no food on

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.130 
in the water right now with no food on
the<00:02:46.000> farm<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.450> deer<00:02:46.599> would<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:46.810> spread<00:02:47.110> out

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
the farm the deer would be spread out

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.839 
the farm the deer would be spread out
all<00:02:47.410> over<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.680> place<00:02:47.920> very<00:02:48.280> difficult<00:02:48.760> to

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
all over the place very difficult to

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.819 
all over the place very difficult to
hunt<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.629> fact<00:02:49.900> they<00:02:50.049> might<00:02:50.200> even<00:02:50.379> leave<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
hunt in fact they might even leave the

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.410 
hunt in fact they might even leave the
farm<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.220> go<00:02:51.340> someplace<00:02:51.579> else<00:02:51.879> to<00:02:52.000> find<00:02:52.239> food

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
farm and go someplace else to find food

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.449 
farm and go someplace else to find food
so<00:02:53.140> keep<00:02:53.319> that<00:02:53.349> one<00:02:53.620> in<00:02:53.650> mind<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.280> know<00:02:54.340> it's

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
so keep that one in mind you know it's

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.770 
so keep that one in mind you know it's
not<00:02:54.579> something<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.180> can<00:02:55.209> put<00:02:55.510> into

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
not something that you can put into

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.420 
not something that you can put into
effect<00:02:55.810> right<00:02:56.260> now<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:57.129> it's<00:02:57.220> definitely

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
effect right now but it's definitely

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.130 
effect right now but it's definitely
something<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.060> applies<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.780> hunting

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
something that applies to the hunting

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.920 
something that applies to the hunting
that<00:02:59.260> takes<00:02:59.500> place<00:02:59.709> during<00:03:00.549> December<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.269> on

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
that takes place during December and on
