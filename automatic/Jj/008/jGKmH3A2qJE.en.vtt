00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.080 
take out a very small slow-growing
native<00:03:43.200> plant<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:44.100> could<00:03:44.250> have<00:03:44.340> wiped<00:03:44.519> out<00:03:44.790> a

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
native plant you could have wiped out a

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.229 
native plant you could have wiped out a
hundred<00:03:45.630> years<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.560> plant<00:03:47.310> growth<00:03:47.430> where's<00:03:48.120> if

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
hundred years of plant growth where's if

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.990 
hundred years of plant growth where's if
you<00:03:48.300> take<00:03:48.510> out<00:03:48.630> an<00:03:48.720> invasive<00:03:49.050> plant<00:03:49.820> take<00:03:50.820> all

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
you take out an invasive plant take all

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.670 
you take out an invasive plant take all
you<00:03:51.120> want<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.600> US<00:03:51.840> government<00:03:52.290> spending

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
you want the US government spending

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.410 
you want the US government spending
billions<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.250> dollars<00:03:53.610> taking<00:03:54.000> out<00:03:54.120> invasive

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
billions of dollars taking out invasive

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.050 
billions of dollars taking out invasive
plants<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.620> think<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.130> way<00:03:56.370> you're

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
plants and I think that way you're

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.030 
plants and I think that way you're
really<00:03:57.360> giving<00:03:57.840> something<00:03:58.170> back<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.769> land

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
really giving something back to the land

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.210 
really giving something back to the land
and<00:03:59.340> you're<00:04:00.209> not<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:00.660> taking<00:04:00.900> from<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.410> so

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
and you're not just taking from it so

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.530 
and you're not just taking from it so
maybe<00:04:02.400> you're<00:04:02.640> still<00:04:02.880> on<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.000> fence<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.450> you

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
maybe you're still on the fence and you

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.599 
maybe you're still on the fence and you
think<00:04:03.750> where<00:04:04.530> am<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.709> going<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:04.980> find<00:04:05.190> each<00:04:05.459> of

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
think where am I going to find each of

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.069 
think where am I going to find each of
these<00:04:05.700> plans<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.450> just<00:04:06.720> start<00:04:06.930> with<00:04:07.049> one

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
these plans and just start with one

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.740 
these plans and just start with one
thing<00:04:07.859> so<00:04:08.250> something<00:04:08.670> like<00:04:08.700> onion<00:04:09.389> grass

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
thing so something like onion grass

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.340 
thing so something like onion grass
which<00:04:10.470> has<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:10.980> round<00:04:11.370> blade<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.330> it's<00:04:12.510> I<00:04:12.810> have

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
which has a round blade and it's I have

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.190 
which has a round blade and it's I have
an<00:04:13.530> oniony<00:04:14.130> smell<00:04:14.430> or<00:04:14.970> garlic<00:04:15.210> mustard<00:04:15.540> it's

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
an oniony smell or garlic mustard it's

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.170 
an oniony smell or garlic mustard it's
invasive<00:04:16.530> girls<00:04:17.160> everywhere<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.579> makes<00:04:18.060> a

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
invasive girls everywhere and makes a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.120 
invasive girls everywhere and makes a
delicious<00:04:18.510> pesta<00:04:19.140> let's<00:04:19.470> get<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.709> know<00:04:19.739> that

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
delicious pesta let's get to know that

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.130 
delicious pesta let's get to know that
and<00:04:20.310> use<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.730> in<00:04:20.790> different<00:04:20.850> ways<00:04:21.180> or<00:04:21.959> maybe

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
and use it in different ways or maybe

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.750 
and use it in different ways or maybe
you<00:04:22.350> think<00:04:22.500> this<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:23.040> another<00:04:23.250> trendy

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
you think this is just another trendy

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.180 
you think this is just another trendy
food<00:04:24.000> movement<00:04:24.330> but<00:04:24.660> it's<00:04:24.810> not<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.320> trend<00:04:25.950> in

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
food movement but it's not a trend in

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.280 
food movement but it's not a trend in
that<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:26.730> going<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.060> die<00:04:27.210> out<00:04:27.240> foraging<00:04:28.020> is

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
that it's going to die out foraging is

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.070 
that it's going to die out foraging is
where<00:04:28.500> we<00:04:28.590> came<00:04:28.770> from<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.280> foraging<00:04:29.820> is<00:04:30.000> how<00:04:30.300> we

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
where we came from so foraging is how we

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.800 
where we came from so foraging is how we
used<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.650> eat<00:04:31.710> before<00:04:32.250> we<00:04:32.640> had<00:04:32.820> agriculture<00:04:33.630> I

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
used to eat before we had agriculture I

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.450 
used to eat before we had agriculture I
just<00:04:34.200> think<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.410> we<00:04:34.650> have<00:04:34.770> lost<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.250> lot<00:04:35.430> of

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
just think that we have lost a lot of

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.190 
just think that we have lost a lot of
that<00:04:35.670> knowledge<00:04:35.850> because<00:04:36.510> most<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.900> us<00:04:37.050> are

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
that knowledge because most of us are

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.620 
that knowledge because most of us are
immigrants<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:37.980> land<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.240> all<00:04:39.480> I'm

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
immigrants to this land and so all I'm

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.510 
immigrants to this land and so all I'm
trying<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.900> do<00:04:40.080> is<00:04:40.200> to<00:04:40.230> reconnect<00:04:40.920> us<00:04:43.520> for

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
trying to do is to reconnect us for

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.200 
trying to do is to reconnect us for
