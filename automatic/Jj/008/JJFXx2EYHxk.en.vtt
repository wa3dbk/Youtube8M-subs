minutes<00:03:50.750> left<00:03:50.870> because<00:03:51.080> I<00:03:51.140> was<00:03:51.230> on<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.350> fucking

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
minutes left because I was on a fucking

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.670 
minutes left because I was on a fucking
1<00:03:51.860> bar<00:03:52.130> like<00:03:52.459> what<00:03:53.290> but<00:03:54.290> they're<00:03:54.440> gonna<00:03:54.560> be

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
1 bar like what but they're gonna be

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.930 
1 bar like what but they're gonna be
staying<00:03:54.920> with<00:03:54.980> us<00:03:55.220> up<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.520> New<00:03:55.610> Hampshire<00:03:55.760> I

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
staying with us up in New Hampshire I

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.949 
staying with us up in New Hampshire I
think<00:03:56.000> it'd<00:03:56.180> be<00:03:56.270> cool<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.480> have<00:03:56.660> another

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
think it'd be cool to have another

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.410 
think it'd be cool to have another
family<00:03:57.830> or<00:03:58.130> our<00:03:58.160> cousins<00:03:58.640> with<00:03:58.820> us<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.120> be<00:03:59.209> kind

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
family or our cousins with us to be kind

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.270 
family or our cousins with us to be kind
of<00:03:59.480> fun<00:03:59.720> or<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.110> newer<00:04:00.470> microphone<00:04:01.010> is<00:04:01.100> not<00:04:01.130> a

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
of fun or and newer microphone is not a

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.280 
of fun or and newer microphone is not a
word<00:04:01.459> B<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:02.030> would<00:04:02.090> be<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.239> new<00:04:02.510> aspect<00:04:03.080> of<00:04:03.170> going

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
word B it would be a new aspect of going

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.870 
word B it would be a new aspect of going
camping<00:04:03.560> because<00:04:03.830> we<00:04:04.100> have<00:04:04.190> a<00:04:04.220> new<00:04:04.400> family<00:04:04.610> and

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
camping because we have a new family and

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.490 
camping because we have a new family and
new<00:04:04.970> people<00:04:05.090> around<00:04:05.390> us<00:04:05.600> and<00:04:05.810> just<00:04:05.959> my<00:04:06.110> family

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
new people around us and just my family

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.690 
new people around us and just my family
so<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.650> think<00:04:06.739> it'd<00:04:06.890> be<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.010> little<00:04:07.100> bit<00:04:07.280> more<00:04:07.430> fun

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
so I think it'd be a little bit more fun

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.830 
so I think it'd be a little bit more fun
and<00:04:07.940> it'll<00:04:08.360> be<00:04:08.420> would<00:04:08.540> have<00:04:08.570> been<00:04:08.720> more

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
and it'll be would have been more

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.390 
and it'll be would have been more
enjoyable<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.560> think<00:04:09.770> what<00:04:10.250> we're<00:04:10.370> doing

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
enjoyable and I think what we're doing

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.800 
enjoyable and I think what we're doing
is<00:04:10.730> I<00:04:10.790> think<00:04:10.970> one<00:04:11.209> of<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.360> days<00:04:11.480> we're<00:04:11.630> going

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
is I think one of the days we're going

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.300 
is I think one of the days we're going
kayaking<00:04:12.080> I'm<00:04:12.500> gonna<00:04:12.650> get<00:04:12.770> some<00:04:12.920> GoPro

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
kayaking I'm gonna get some GoPro

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.010 
kayaking I'm gonna get some GoPro
footage<00:04:13.459> hopefully<00:04:13.940> for<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.900> other

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
footage hopefully for that and the other

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.300

day<00:04:15.140> we're<00:04:15.290> doing<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.530> ropes<00:04:15.770> course<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.280> I

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
day we're doing a ropes course and I

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.530 
day we're doing a ropes course and I
think<00:04:16.459> we<00:04:16.520> might<00:04:16.669> going<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:16.940> hike<00:04:17.150> or<00:04:17.299> just
