00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that powerfully issues it means there's

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.510 
that powerfully issues it means there's
something<00:00:37.440> there<00:00:37.680> doing<00:00:37.980> something<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.370> guys

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
something there doing something you guys

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.150 
something there doing something you guys
doing<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.910> combination<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.510> both<00:00:40.160> goaltending

really think we're getting some good
chances<00:00:44.000> I<00:00:45.649> feel<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.399> go<00:00:47.550> out<00:00:47.640> there

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
chances I feel like we we go out there

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.880 
chances I feel like we we go out there
and<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.450> know<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.600> think<00:00:48.899> both<00:00:49.110> teams<00:00:49.140> Fargo<00:00:49.739> is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and you know I think both teams Fargo is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.590 
and you know I think both teams Fargo is
probably<00:00:50.280> slipped<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.760> little<00:00:50.820> bit<00:00:51.090> then<00:00:51.420> over

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
probably slipped a little bit then over

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.389 
probably slipped a little bit then over
time<00:00:51.780> there<00:00:52.020> as<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> little<00:00:52.649> more<00:00:52.800> tired<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.370> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
time there as a little more tired and I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.610 
time there as a little more tired and I
kill<00:00:53.640> gets<00:00:53.820> more<00:00:54.000> aggressive<00:00:54.390> much<00:00:55.289> bounce

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
kill gets more aggressive much bounce

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.620 
kill gets more aggressive much bounce
for<00:00:55.980> me

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
for me

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.860 
for me
sonor<00:00:57.290> big<00:00:57.470> ones<00:00:57.650> want<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:57.950> put<00:00:58.100> in<00:00:58.220> but<00:00:58.870> i'll

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
the way that turned out what happened

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.580 
the way that turned out what happened
there<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:25.729> thought<00:01:26.630> we<00:01:26.750> responded<00:01:26.900> well<00:01:27.410> it

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
did everything we could / sides look at

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.109 
did everything we could / sides look at
that<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:32.750> feel<00:01:32.900> like<00:01:33.020> other<00:01:33.460> well<00:01:34.460> maybe<00:01:34.580> he's

the<00:01:35.150> regulation<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.869> guys<00:01:36.020> can't<00:01:36.259> got<00:01:36.380> better

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the regulation you guys can't got better

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.010 
the regulation you guys can't got better
with<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.830> experience<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:38.210> thought<00:01:38.810> we<00:01:38.960> were

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
with the experience I thought we were

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.480 
with the experience I thought we were
pretty<00:01:39.140> solid<00:01:39.560> all<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.710> way<00:01:39.800> through<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.400> we

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
pretty solid all the way through and we

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.219 
pretty solid all the way through and we
didn't<00:01:40.759> feel<00:01:40.910> like<00:01:41.119> at<00:01:41.390> any<00:01:41.420> point<00:01:41.869> if<00:01:42.110> they

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
didn't feel like at any point if they

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.109 
didn't feel like at any point if they
really<00:01:42.470> grabbed<00:01:43.250> momentum<00:01:43.400> then<00:01:43.850> we<00:01:43.940> had<00:01:44.060> a

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
really grabbed momentum then we had a

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.700 
really grabbed momentum then we had a
couple<00:01:44.330> shifts<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:44.869> I<00:01:44.900> other<00:01:45.320> than<00:01:45.410> that<00:01:45.680> I

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
couple shifts so I other than that I

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.980 
couple shifts so I other than that I
thought<00:01:45.979> we<00:01:46.160> played<00:01:46.450> pretty<00:01:47.450> comfortably

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
thought we played pretty comfortably

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.940 
thought we played pretty comfortably
when<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.590> know<00:01:48.740> when<00:01:49.180> final<00:01:50.180> drive<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.750> with

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
when you know when final drive and with

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.040 
when you know when final drive and with
add<00:01:51.950> some<00:01:52.160> chances<00:01:52.550> but<00:01:52.790> nothing<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:53.240> really

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
add some chances but nothing that really

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.249 
add some chances but nothing that really
gave<00:01:54.320> them<00:01:54.530> which<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:54.710> good<00:01:55.990> Sydney<00:01:56.990> what<00:01:57.020> is

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
gave them which is good Sydney what is

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.780 
gave them which is good Sydney what is
the<00:01:57.440> one<00:01:57.619> thing<00:01:57.650> tonight<00:01:58.160> that<00:01:58.369> gives<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.670> the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
the one thing tonight that gives you the

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.419 
the one thing tonight that gives you the
most<00:01:58.880> help<00:01:59.240> going<00:01:59.900> into<00:02:00.020> game<00:02:00.229> four<00:02:00.500> I<00:02:00.860> think

most help going into game four I think

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.219

just<00:02:01.580> seeing<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.910> results<00:02:02.300> from<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:03.140> know

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
just seeing the results from you know

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.660 
just seeing the results from you know
from<00:02:03.259> our<00:02:03.560> game<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:03.950> think<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:04.250> always<00:02:04.369> believe

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
from our game I think you always believe

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.100 
from our game I think you always believe
in<00:02:04.789> it<00:02:05.030> but<00:02:05.179> it's<00:02:07.420> much<00:02:08.420> nicer<00:02:08.600> when<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:08.960> win

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
in it but it's much nicer when you win

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.050 
in it but it's much nicer when you win
and<00:02:09.259> get<00:02:09.350> rewarded<00:02:09.770> for<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:10.039> but<00:02:10.310> things<00:02:10.850> got

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
and get rewarded for it but things got

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.720 
and get rewarded for it but things got
beyond<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.770> we<00:02:12.770> saw<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.010> number<00:02:13.610> of

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
beyond that we saw the number of

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.690 
beyond that we saw the number of
opportunities<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.420> created<00:02:14.870> and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
opportunities we created and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.780 
opportunities we created and
I'll<00:02:16.660> believe<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.220> got<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.340> guys<00:02:18.520> to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
I'll believe that got the guys to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.839 
I'll believe that got the guys to
capitalize<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.450> those<00:02:19.780> more<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.470> now

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
capitalize on those more on to the now

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.510
