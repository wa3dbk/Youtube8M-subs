00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
the back side muscles just aren't used

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.130 
the back side muscles just aren't used
as<00:02:20.200> much<00:02:20.380> much<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.099> they're<00:02:21.250> there<00:02:21.700> for<00:02:22.140> like

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
as much much and they're there for like

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.990 
as much much and they're there for like
any<00:02:23.319> muscle<00:02:23.739> if<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.040> not<00:02:24.190> being<00:02:24.400> used<00:02:24.489> it

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
any muscle if it's not being used it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.180 
any muscle if it's not being used it
tends<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.390> lose<00:02:25.599> strength<00:02:25.900> another<00:02:26.830> our

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
tends to lose strength another our

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.920 
tends to lose strength another our
common<00:02:27.670> cause<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:27.940> weakness<00:02:28.420> is<00:02:28.630> when<00:02:28.810> the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
common cause of weakness is when the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.960 
common cause of weakness is when the
hamstring<00:02:29.440> muscles<00:02:29.860> which<00:02:30.489> are<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> muscles

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
hamstring muscles which are the muscles

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.280 
hamstring muscles which are the muscles
at<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.300> back<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> thigh<00:02:33.930> here's<00:02:34.930> my<00:02:35.080> arrow

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
at the back of the thigh here's my arrow

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.530 
at the back of the thigh here's my arrow
coming<00:02:35.650> up<00:02:35.830> here<00:02:36.099> so<00:02:36.340> basically<00:02:36.850> going<00:02:37.390> from

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
coming up here so basically going from

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.800 
coming up here so basically going from
the<00:02:37.780> top<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.080> pelvis<00:02:38.590> down<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.600> shin

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
the top of the pelvis down to the shin

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.410 
the top of the pelvis down to the shin
bone<00:02:40.959> if<00:02:41.290> those<00:02:41.560> muscles<00:02:42.220> become<00:02:42.400> too<00:02:42.970> strong

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
bone if those muscles become too strong

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.650 
bone if those muscles become too strong
and<00:02:43.720> too<00:02:43.750> dominant<00:02:44.500> which<00:02:45.400> can<00:02:45.700> happen<00:02:45.880> as

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
and too dominant which can happen as

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.979 
and too dominant which can happen as
there<00:02:47.230> are<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.739> lot<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.310> gym<00:02:48.580> equipment

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
there are a lot of gym equipment

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.360 
there are a lot of gym equipment
exercises<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.019> work<00:02:50.560> these<00:02:50.769> muscles<00:02:51.010> are

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
exercises that work these muscles are

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.100 
exercises that work these muscles are
not<00:02:51.519> so<00:02:51.670> many<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:52.360> work<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.780> back<00:02:52.900> side

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
not so many that work the back side

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.080 
not so many that work the back side
muscles<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:54.160> those<00:02:54.370> muscles<00:02:54.730> become<00:02:54.850> too

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
muscles so if those muscles become too

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.120 
muscles so if those muscles become too
strong<00:02:55.360> alignment<00:02:55.600> they<00:02:55.870> trying<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.380> take

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
strong alignment they trying to take

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.820 
strong alignment they trying to take
over<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.819> job<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.049> the<00:02:59.319> back<00:02:59.590> side

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
over the job that the the back side

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.039 
over the job that the the back side
muscle<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.250> blue<00:03:00.400> team<00:03:00.640> muscles<00:03:01.030> arm<00:03:01.299> into<00:03:01.510> to

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
muscle the blue team muscles arm into to

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.620 
muscle the blue team muscles arm into to
do<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.799> let's<00:03:05.980> have<00:03:06.130> a<00:03:06.220> look<00:03:06.430> at<00:03:06.670> some<00:03:07.000> ways<00:03:07.239> to

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
do so let's have a look at some ways to

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.360 
do so let's have a look at some ways to
strengthen<00:03:07.840> these<00:03:08.110> exercise<00:03:08.530> now<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.829> key<00:03:09.160> to

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
strengthen these exercise now the key to

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.190 
strengthen these exercise now the key to
strengthen<00:03:09.850> these<00:03:10.000> exercises<00:03:10.570> is<00:03:10.959> that

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
strengthen these exercises is that

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.979 
strengthen these exercises is that
you've<00:03:11.350> got<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.829> feel<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.280> these<00:03:12.400> exercises

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
you've got to feel it in these exercises

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.630 
you've got to feel it in these exercises
now<00:03:13.989> you'll<00:03:14.440> find<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:14.799> most<00:03:14.859> people<00:03:15.340> can<00:03:15.489> do

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
now you'll find that most people can do

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.819 
now you'll find that most people can do
this<00:03:15.790> motion<00:03:16.299> but<00:03:16.510> are<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.230> feeling<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.709> the

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
this motion but are you feeling in the

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.789 
this motion but are you feeling in the
right<00:03:18.010> spot<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.579> is<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.910> key<00:03:19.150> to

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
right spot and that is the key to

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.620 
right spot and that is the key to
strengthen<00:03:20.799> up<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.100> gluteals<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.510> the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
strengthen up the gluteals and so the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.660 
strengthen up the gluteals and so the
first<00:03:22.810> one<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.019> just<00:03:23.230> more<00:03:23.440> about<00:03:23.769> recruiting

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
first one is just more about recruiting

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.130 
first one is just more about recruiting
the<00:03:24.820> muscle<00:03:25.180> getting<00:03:25.420> isolated<00:03:26.049> because

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
the muscle getting isolated because

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.930 
the muscle getting isolated because
you'll<00:03:26.650> find<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.010> fit<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.220> some<00:03:27.459> people<00:03:27.730> who

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
you'll find the fit and some people who

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.000 
you'll find the fit and some people who
are<00:03:28.120> weak<00:03:28.420> they<00:03:29.140> just<00:03:29.290> have<00:03:29.350> trouble<00:03:29.590> getting

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
are weak they just have trouble getting

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.460 
are weak they just have trouble getting
this<00:03:30.220> muscle<00:03:30.579> going<00:03:30.880> so<00:03:31.060> it's<00:03:31.989> line<00:03:32.230> on<00:03:32.380> the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
this muscle going so it's line on the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.130 
this muscle going so it's line on the
back<00:03:32.650> with<00:03:32.859> the<00:03:32.950> knees<00:03:33.130> bent<00:03:34.079> keeping<00:03:35.079> you

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
back with the knees bent keeping you

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.259 
back with the knees bent keeping you
back<00:03:35.260> flat<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.890> neutral<00:03:36.069> position<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.880> you

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
back flat in a neutral position and you

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.750 
back flat in a neutral position and you
just<00:03:37.750> squeezing<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:39.250> butt<00:03:39.430> cheeks

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
just squeezing the the butt cheeks

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.080 
just squeezing the the butt cheeks
together<00:03:40.170> imagine<00:03:41.170> holding<00:03:41.319> a<00:03:41.530> coin<00:03:41.769> between

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
together imagine holding a coin between

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.690 
together imagine holding a coin between
between<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.299> backside<00:03:43.980> just<00:03:44.980> squeeze<00:03:45.459> and

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
between the backside just squeeze and

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.400 
between the backside just squeeze and
relax<00:03:45.970> so<00:03:46.840> let's<00:03:46.989> have<00:03:47.139> a<00:03:47.170> look<00:03:47.350> at<00:03:47.410> that<00:03:47.470> one

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
relax so let's have a look at that one

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.620 
relax so let's have a look at that one
now<00:03:50.410> I've<00:03:50.560> just<00:03:50.590> included<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.430> photo<00:03:52.359> of<00:03:52.540> this

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
now I've just included a photo of this

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.390 
now I've just included a photo of this
one<00:03:52.810> because<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.230> realized<00:03:53.829> when<00:03:53.980> we<00:03:54.069> looked<00:03:54.280> at

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
one because I realized when we looked at

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.509 
one because I realized when we looked at
the<00:03:54.489> video<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:56.440> don't<00:03:56.650> see<00:03:56.829> too<00:03:57.100> much

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
the video you don't see too much

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.400 
the video you don't see too much
happening<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.209> I'm<00:03:58.540> just<00:03:58.870> showing<00:03:58.989> you<00:03:59.200> the

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
happening so I'm just showing you the

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.590 
happening so I'm just showing you the
setup<00:03:59.620> position<00:03:59.889> but<00:04:00.819> it's<00:04:00.940> just<00:04:01.090> focusing

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
setup position but it's just focusing

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.559 
setup position but it's just focusing
about<00:04:02.040> squeezing<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.250> back<00:04:03.940> side<00:04:04.120> muscles

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
about squeezing the back side muscles

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.550 
about squeezing the back side muscles
together<00:04:06.150> no<00:04:07.150> method<00:04:07.480> number<00:04:07.810> two<00:04:08.109> it's<00:04:08.470> the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
together no method number two it's the

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.229 
together no method number two it's the
same<00:04:08.769> starting<00:04:09.310> position<00:04:09.430> as<00:04:09.819> method<00:04:10.120> number

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
same starting position as method number

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.689 
same starting position as method number

people that's going to be a little

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.000 
people that's going to be a little
tricky<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.970> do<00:04:25.420> initially<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.080> kind<00:04:26.740> of<00:04:26.860> also

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010

sometimes<00:04:27.970> imagining<00:04:28.570> you<00:04:28.750> know<00:04:28.810> if<00:04:28.930> you're

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
sometimes imagining you know if you're

sometimes imagining you know if you're
holding<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.470> coin<00:04:29.680> between<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:30.220> butt<00:04:30.730> cheeks

holding a coin between the butt cheeks

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.090 
holding a coin between the butt cheeks
then<00:04:31.270> you<00:04:31.390> can't<00:04:31.660> drop<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.290> sometimes

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
then you can't drop it that sometimes

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.610 
then you can't drop it that sometimes
mental<00:04:34.060> image<00:04:34.300> helps<00:04:34.450> you<00:04:34.690> focus<00:04:35.200> on<00:04:35.470> those

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
mental image helps you focus on those

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.320 
mental image helps you focus on those
muscles<00:04:36.100> a<00:04:36.280> little<00:04:36.370> bit<00:04:36.730> more<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:37.060> let's<00:04:37.240> have

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
muscles a little bit more so let's have

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:50.379 
muscles a little bit more so let's have
a<00:04:37.420> look<00:04:37.570> at<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.780> one

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.350 

and<00:04:51.389> then<00:04:52.169> we're<00:04:52.289> gonna<00:04:52.520> three<00:04:53.520> this<00:04:54.119> time

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
and then we're gonna three this time

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.450 
and then we're gonna three this time
your<00:04:54.539> line<00:04:54.689> on<00:04:54.869> your<00:04:54.960> front<00:04:55.229> and<00:04:55.529> relying<00:04:56.309> on

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
your line on your front and relying on

your line on your front and relying on
some<00:04:56.610> pillows<00:04:56.999> the<00:04:57.240> reason<00:04:57.509> we<00:04:57.599> get<00:04:57.779> to<00:04:57.930> the

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
some pillows the reason we get to the

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.809 
some pillows the reason we get to the
lines<00:04:58.469> and<00:04:58.800> pillows<00:04:59.039> is<00:04:59.219> there's<00:04:59.520> really<00:04:59.580> just

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
lines and pillows is there's really just

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:01.820 
lines and pillows is there's really just
not<00:05:00.089> a<00:05:00.119> lot<00:05:00.389> of<00:05:00.419> movement<00:05:00.869> backwards<00:05:01.110> in<00:05:01.589> the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
not a lot of movement backwards in the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.869 
not a lot of movement backwards in the
hip<00:05:02.009> if<00:05:02.909> you<00:05:03.180> do<00:05:03.360> try<00:05:03.689> and<00:05:03.719> move<00:05:04.439> the<00:05:04.740> leg<00:05:05.520> too

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
hip if you do try and move the leg too

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.760 
hip if you do try and move the leg too
far<00:05:06.180> back<00:05:06.449> in<00:05:06.689> the<00:05:06.719> hip<00:05:06.899> joint<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:07.289> you<00:05:07.559> just

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
far back in the hip joint you you just

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.889 
far back in the hip joint you you just
end<00:05:07.949> up<00:05:08.099> arching<00:05:08.789> the<00:05:09.059> lower<00:05:09.270> back<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:09.779> that's

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:09.899 
end up arching the lower back and that's

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:11.779 
end up arching the lower back and that's
something<00:05:10.289> that<00:05:10.409> we<00:05:10.649> want<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:10.949> avoid<00:05:11.490> with

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
something that we want to avoid with

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.879 
something that we want to avoid with
this<00:05:11.909> exercise<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:12.719> so<00:05:13.259> we<00:05:13.379> put<00:05:13.559> you<00:05:13.649> on<00:05:13.740> some

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
this exercise so so we put you on some

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.999 
this exercise so so we put you on some
pillows<00:05:14.309> so<00:05:14.699> that<00:05:14.960> when<00:05:15.960> you're<00:05:16.110> looking<00:05:16.499> from

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
pillows so that when you're looking from

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:18.980 
pillows so that when you're looking from
a<00:05:17.129> site<00:05:17.369> on<00:05:17.399> view<00:05:17.879> your<00:05:18.330> new<00:05:18.479> you're<00:05:18.659> starting

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
a site on view your new you're starting

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.799 
a site on view your new you're starting
off<00:05:19.050> lower<00:05:19.409> than<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.800> hip<00:05:20.009> and<00:05:20.249> you<00:05:20.849> have<00:05:21.689> the

00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:21.809 
off lower than the hip and you have the

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:23.749 
off lower than the hip and you have the
knee<00:05:21.960> bent<00:05:22.259> you<00:05:22.680> lift<00:05:22.979> the<00:05:23.099> leg<00:05:23.279> up<00:05:23.430> but<00:05:23.699> just

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
knee bent you lift the leg up but just

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.760 
knee bent you lift the leg up but just
lift<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.330> leg<00:05:24.509> up<00:05:24.539> so<00:05:24.870> that<00:05:25.020> it's<00:05:25.139> approaching

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
lift the leg up so that it's approaching

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.739 
lift the leg up so that it's approaching
being<00:05:26.039> level<00:05:26.550> with<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:26.789> hip<00:05:26.969> we<00:05:27.509> don't

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:27.749 
being level with the hip we don't

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:29.719 
being level with the hip we don't
actually<00:05:27.990> want<00:05:28.529> the<00:05:28.680> need<00:05:28.860> to<00:05:28.979> come<00:05:29.159> up<00:05:29.279> higher

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
actually want the need to come up higher

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.219 
actually want the need to come up higher
than<00:05:29.759> the<00:05:30.120> hip<00:05:30.240> inner<00:05:30.449> that<00:05:30.779> will<00:05:30.870> make<00:05:31.020> more

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
than the hip inner that will make more

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.499 
than the hip inner that will make more
sense<00:05:31.289> when<00:05:31.649> you<00:05:31.800> when<00:05:32.219> you<00:05:32.249> see<00:05:32.610> it<00:05:35.509> there's

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
sense when you when you see it there's

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.839 
sense when you when you see it there's
also<00:05:36.629> a<00:05:36.749> variation<00:05:37.469> on<00:05:37.559> this<00:05:37.979> exercise<00:05:38.309> where

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
also a variation on this exercise where

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.420 
also a variation on this exercise where
if<00:05:38.999> you<00:05:39.210> turn<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.319> leg<00:05:40.529> out<00:05:40.710> a<00:05:40.800> little<00:05:41.099> bit<00:05:41.249> so

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
if you turn the leg out a little bit so

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.129 
if you turn the leg out a little bit so
that<00:05:41.459> the<00:05:41.699> knee<00:05:41.939> is<00:05:41.969> out<00:05:42.389> further<00:05:42.659> and<00:05:42.809> the<00:05:42.959> hip

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
that the knee is out further and the hip

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.850 
that the knee is out further and the hip
that<00:05:43.379> sometimes<00:05:44.129> too<00:05:44.249> can<00:05:44.639> get<00:05:44.819> a<00:05:44.969> better

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
that sometimes too can get a better

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.749 
that sometimes too can get a better
isolation<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:46.979> contraction<00:05:47.430> in<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.550> back

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
isolation and contraction in the back

00:05:47.759 --> 00:06:05.490 
isolation and contraction in the back
side<00:05:47.999> so<00:05:48.180> let's<00:05:48.599> have<00:05:48.779> a<00:05:48.809> look<00:05:49.020> at<00:05:49.050> that<00:05:49.199> one
