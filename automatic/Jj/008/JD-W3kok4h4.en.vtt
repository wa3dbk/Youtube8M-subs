hello<00:00:00.960> guys<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.530> dr.<00:00:01.680> bass

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hello guys this is dr. bass

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.820 
hello guys this is dr. bass
I'm<00:00:03.449> with<00:00:04.279> 0s<00:00:05.629> 2012<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.930> time<00:00:07.109> modified<00:00:07.620> with

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
I'm with 0s 2012 the time modified with

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.310 
I'm with 0s 2012 the time modified with
the<00:00:08.990> 2013's

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the 2013's

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.150 
the 2013's
motor<00:00:11.480> and<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.809> will<00:00:13.019> make<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> quick

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
motor and I will make a quick

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.880 
motor and I will make a quick
acceleration<00:00:14.670> test<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.780> will<00:00:16.199> show<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
acceleration test I will show you the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.980 
acceleration test I will show you the
display<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> site<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.060> race<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.570> will<00:00:18.720> see

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
display of the site on race you will see

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.029 
display of the site on race you will see
the<00:00:19.080> power<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> speed<00:00:19.920> increase<00:00:21.710> and<00:00:22.710> I

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
the power in the speed increase and I

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.640 
the power in the speed increase and I
have<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.340> say<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> last<00:00:24.900> minutes<00:00:25.380> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
have to say that in the last minutes I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.859 
have to say that in the last minutes I
made<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> lot<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.430> acceleration<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> motor

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
made a lot of acceleration so the motor

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.020 
made a lot of acceleration so the motor
is<00:00:28.279> it's<00:00:29.279> still<00:00:29.550> hot<00:00:31.160> but<00:00:32.160> anyway<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> will<00:00:32.790> test

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
is it's still hot but anyway I will test

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.080 
is it's still hot but anyway I will test
that<00:00:33.120> anyway<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.320> best<00:00:34.559> time<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.860> get<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:35.730> for

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
that anyway the best time I get what for

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.860 
that anyway the best time I get what for
the<00:00:36.239> 0-60<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.559> 6.4<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.460> second<00:00:38.910> which<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the 0-60 was a 6.4 a second which is a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.040 
the 0-60 was a 6.4 a second which is a
great<00:00:40.260> improvement<00:00:40.640> but<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.059> torque<00:00:42.329> curve<00:00:42.660> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
great improvement but the torque curve I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.920 
great improvement but the torque curve I
have<00:00:43.379> actually<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.489> starting<00:00:45.030> from<00:00:45.210> 66

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
have actually is starting from 66

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.380 
have actually is starting from 66
nanometer<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.890> up<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.610> 115<00:00:49.100> so<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
nanometer to up to 115 so it's not a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.950 
nanometer to up to 115 so it's not a
flat<00:00:51.809> acceleration<00:00:52.739> curve<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.690> ground

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
flat acceleration curve and the ground

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.880 
flat acceleration curve and the ground
here<00:00:55.460> is<00:00:56.460> pretty<00:00:56.820> flat<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
here is pretty flat as you can see the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.080 
here is pretty flat as you can see the
guy<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.129> probably<00:00:59.760> no<00:00:59.969> problem<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> will<00:01:02.879> try

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
guy is probably no problem so I will try

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.870 
guy is probably no problem so I will try
to<00:01:03.120> hold<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.600> icon<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.379> display<00:01:04.890> while<00:01:05.430> I

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
to hold this icon is on display while I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
to hold this icon is on display while I
accelerate<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.619> hand<00:01:09.710> alright

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:52.450 

okay<00:01:15.300> one<00:01:16.300> two<00:01:16.840> three<00:01:17.410> go

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.640 

so<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.640> see<00:01:53.790> hit<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.760> great<00:01:57.650> 75

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
so you see hit here this is the great 75

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.540 
so you see hit here this is the great 75
7<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.280> hub<00:01:59.430> motor<00:01:59.610> pop<00:02:01.100> hit<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.280> runner

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
7 in the hub motor pop hit in runner

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.109 
7 in the hub motor pop hit in runner
more<00:02:03.590> I'm<00:02:04.590> usually<00:02:05.220> speaking<00:02:05.729> about<00:02:05.970> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
more I'm usually speaking about the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.139 
more I'm usually speaking about the
electric<00:02:06.390> bicycle<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.260> this<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.619> why<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.149> said

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
electric bicycle so this is why I said

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:17.120 
electric bicycle so this is why I said
hot<00:02:09.390> water<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:10.340> ok<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.870> see<00:02:15.890> maximum<00:02:16.890> amp

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
hot water but ok and you see maximum amp

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.420 
hot water but ok and you see maximum amp
recorded<00:02:20.330> 460<00:02:21.330> 1.9<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.770> voltage<00:02:23.190> has

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
recorded 460 1.9 and the voltage has

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.850 
recorded 460 1.9 and the voltage has
dropped<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:24.090> sixty<00:02:24.959> four<00:02:25.200> point<00:02:25.410> three<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
dropped to sixty four point three the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.280 
dropped to sixty four point three the
battery<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.250> not<00:02:26.400> full<00:02:26.700> I'm<00:02:27.330> starting<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.750> see

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.060 

so<00:02:31.580> thanks<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:32.700> watching<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.989> see<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.860> for<00:02:34.890> a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
so thanks for watching and see you for a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.360 
so thanks for watching and see you for a
next<00:02:35.340> video<00:02:35.430> alright
