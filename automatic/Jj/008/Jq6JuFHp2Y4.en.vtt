00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.420 
crazy and go go kamikaze and fly out
everywhere<00:00:31.470> because<00:00:31.740> you'll<00:00:32.099> know<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.399> I

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
everywhere because you'll know what I

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.880 
everywhere because you'll know what I
mean<00:00:32.640> once<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.030> try<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.480> few<00:00:33.780> times<00:00:33.890> well

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
mean once you try this a few times well

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.910 
mean once you try this a few times well
anyways<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.579> surround<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.270> box<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
anyways you surround the box so it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.760 
anyways you surround the box so it
doesn't<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:38.430> crazy<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.149> fly<00:00:39.360> everywhere<00:00:39.770> like

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
doesn't go crazy and fly everywhere like

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.060 
doesn't go crazy and fly everywhere like
so<00:00:41.100> I'm<00:00:41.489> not<00:00:41.579> doing<00:00:41.850> such<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> great<00:00:42.210> job<00:00:42.300> but
