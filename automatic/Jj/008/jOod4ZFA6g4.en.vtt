00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.880
 haha ha 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:39.930
 It's good, it's not 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.930
 it's beautiful 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.930
 ae 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.310
 talk about busy status 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.340
 Brasilia - you are here participating in this 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.670
 new picture of Saint Angelo is to have much 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.490
 satisfied honored by the invitation I'm going 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.830
 talk a little about composition 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.240
 about arrangement and generally about 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.340
 musical production 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.750
 I am a music producer and a 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.610
 many years and this happened 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.340
 really natural way in my life 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.830
 Because when I start the guitar I 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.410
 I automatically started composing something 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.700
 I'm a good sound 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:34.340
 hallucinate composition I love to compose and not 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.649
 and was not satisfied in the field alone today 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.710
 military stuff and do not create melodies 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.560
 not that the arrangements do not do 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.899
 record the magistrates and then I gave 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.470
 My way to record what I 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.840
 I was then creating this thing of 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.640
 do so many in child making humans 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.070
 including a great source of study 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.869
 musical is you can combine your 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.390
 apply what you have learned in the 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.200
 theory encounter put everything into practice 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.740
 huh 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.319
 not only your instrument you always good 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.319
 have a broader view of others 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.900
 segments know how the arrangement 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.159
 The world is then this always was part 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.939
 of my trajectory 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.709
 due to that city I passed it to me 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.620
 specialize a little more and work 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.629
 with problems but cool is that I do not 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.540
 if the products have a tool 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.400
 profits that I love that I have used since 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.950
 always and itaúba proportionally 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.969
 producing bands artists hit only 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.719
 whereas the work 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.400
 so the production is actually opening the 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.919
 range of possibilities within a 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.569
 certain composition I'm not here I 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.430
 I think the existing protocol with tv 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.400
 digital plus that's how people 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.739
 end up imposing their scarves on them 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.750
 that he believes in the composition of 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.040
 finish the news but not accepted and will 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.250
 working on the I prefer an argument 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.620
 these arguments, but I'll go 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.269
 show what they say 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.560
 the role of a music producer is 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.449
 just showing paths is this 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.519
 because he walks if he really has 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:15.290
 several times I have conviction and the 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:17.540
 It has to be that way, but it's me. 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.879
 I'll try to prove it for a while. 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.449
 that way is really the best there 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.459
 whatever it may be in that case 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:27.729
 At that time, it is important to 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.169
 things but it is more to analyze the market 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.310
 analyze the fist you want to achieve 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:35.520
 analyze 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.340
 to analyze is in general everything that 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.260
 everything that involves this thing that you 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.420
 I want it but it's very important. 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.580
 it gives the essence of the artist, right? 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.470
 the essence of the band draw from each 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.390
 better that he has to start at that 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.420
 next to that determined 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.000
 reality is what I look at 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.980
 exciting musical production is cool 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.080
 people's work and also 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.360
 add a little and say is what 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.010
 you speak music is a school is a 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.050
 class and when we respect music 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.049
 We really learn the time. 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.769
 I do not think musical production 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.950
 this is you find the best formula for 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:18.000
 that particular moment is the best 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:21.209
 you already try to capture identity because 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.360
 for me the most beautiful of all this is 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.910
 there is truth of every work, right? 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.190
 when you really believe that he 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.040
 It's making people leave for us. 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.500
 okay , okay , okay , okay , okay. 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.790
 Work is not good, that too. 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.300
 and everything else would already be in a 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.790
 change the shape with the truth, not the face 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.650
 It's the guy he likes that gives you that. 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.750
 board segment 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:53.510
 the delta good business neither so to the truth 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.760
 in music I think it's fundamental and 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.520
 I'll fuck off suddenly I'll do it. 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.320
 still have a sound why put fashionable 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.900

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.540

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.520
 having miscarried a very broad process 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.280
 which involves the production areas very 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.920
 very cool job to do and it's always
