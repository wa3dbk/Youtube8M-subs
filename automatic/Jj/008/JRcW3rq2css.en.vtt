00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.680 
weren't done with it set up just right
so<00:02:22.340> there's<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.610> little<00:02:22.820> bit<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:22.970> sound<00:02:23.360> issues

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
so there's a little bit of sound issues

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.430

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
they're closer to the pickups so it's

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.620 
they're closer to the pickups so it's
louder<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.890> another<00:02:31.160> thing<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.270> mean

not know that at the time and kind of
felt<00:04:48.270> like<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.510> total<00:04:49.080> Jack<00:04:49.530> wagon

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
felt like a total Jack wagon

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.660 
felt like a total Jack wagon
so<00:04:50.910> I<00:04:50.940> set<00:04:51.330> this<00:04:51.480> one<00:04:51.660> up<00:04:51.720> myself<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.680> could

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
so I set this one up myself I could

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.750 
so I set this one up myself I could
probably<00:04:53.940> do<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.900> tutorial<00:04:55.110> on<00:04:55.500> how<00:04:55.890> to<00:04:56.520> do<00:04:56.730> it

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
probably do a tutorial on how to do it

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.560 
probably do a tutorial on how to do it
yourself

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
guys know and that cover anyway one

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.110 
guys know and that cover anyway one
thing<00:05:40.560> I<00:05:40.740> do<00:05:40.830> like<00:05:40.980> about<00:05:41.040> this<00:05:41.340> being<00:05:41.790> a<00:05:41.910> 5

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
thing I do like about this being a 5

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.250 
thing I do like about this being a 5
string<00:05:43.220> all<00:05:44.220> my<00:05:44.400> covers<00:05:44.610> right<00:05:44.910> now<00:05:45.120> I<00:05:45.390> got<00:05:45.840> two

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
string all my covers right now I got two

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.050 
string all my covers right now I got two
so<00:05:46.470> it's<00:05:46.920> chop<00:05:47.100> suey<00:05:47.310> in<00:05:48.380> psychosocial<00:05:49.380> yeah

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
so it's chop suey in psychosocial yeah

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:57.110 
so it's chop suey in psychosocial yeah
which<00:05:51.860> RC<00:05:53.450> system<00:05:54.450> plays<00:05:54.780> dropsy<00:05:55.650> and<00:05:56.010> I<00:05:56.910> think

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
which RC system plays dropsy and I think

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.350 
which RC system plays dropsy and I think
the<00:05:57.180> size<00:05:57.360> of<00:05:57.540> psychosocial<00:05:58.260> is<00:05:58.560> we<00:05:58.830> drop<00:05:59.040> a

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
the size of psychosocial is we drop a

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.540 
the size of psychosocial is we drop a
butt<00:06:00.360> with<00:06:00.420> them<00:06:00.600> drop<00:06:00.960> B<00:06:01.320> it<00:06:01.710> sounds<00:06:02.310> pretty

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
butt with them drop B it sounds pretty

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.850 
butt with them drop B it sounds pretty
close<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.630> I'm

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
close and I'm

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.210 
close and I'm
they<00:06:05.490> got<00:06:05.669> tabbed<00:06:06.000> the<00:06:06.740> drops<00:06:07.740> of<00:06:07.860> human<00:06:08.099> by

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
they got tabbed the drops of human by

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.930 
they got tabbed the drops of human by
myself

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
myself

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.119 
myself
I<00:06:08.970> didn't<00:06:09.389> look<00:06:10.020> in<00:06:10.199> an<00:06:10.289> online<00:06:10.440> tab<00:06:10.889> or

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 
I didn't look in an online tab or

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:12.650 
I didn't look in an online tab or
nothing<00:06:11.400> I<00:06:11.490> just<00:06:11.520> listened<00:06:12.060> to<00:06:12.090> it<00:06:12.270> picked<00:06:12.539> it

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
nothing I just listened to it picked it

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.740 
nothing I just listened to it picked it
up<00:06:12.919> but<00:06:13.919> the<00:06:14.069> psychosocial<00:06:14.490> one<00:06:14.759> I<00:06:14.789> did<00:06:15.060> do<00:06:15.629> an

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
up but the psychosocial one I did do an

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.480 
up but the psychosocial one I did do an
online<00:06:15.870> tab<00:06:16.199> for<00:06:16.409> so<00:06:16.650> I'm<00:06:16.710> sure<00:06:16.889> it's<00:06:17.159> probably

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
online tab for so I'm sure it's probably

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.520 
online tab for so I'm sure it's probably
a<00:06:17.909> little<00:06:18.900> high<00:06:19.199> but<00:06:19.650> not<00:06:19.830> much<00:06:20.039> I<00:06:21.440> think<00:06:22.440> it

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
a little high but not much I think it

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.839 
a little high but not much I think it
sounds<00:06:22.770> good

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
sounds good

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:27.800 
sounds good
it's<00:06:24.750> accurate<00:06:24.960> huh<00:06:26.039> not<00:06:26.819> tone<00:06:27.180> wise<00:06:27.449> but

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
it's accurate huh not tone wise but

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.800
