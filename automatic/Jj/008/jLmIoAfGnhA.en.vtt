 He is the eighth plate of the plate

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.460
 come 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.440
 what is the thought of this production it 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.379
 There are eight eight- thousanders in Nepal and it 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.449
 There are eight Tibetan symbols of happiness and 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.010
 my idea was that the country was nepal 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.379
 would like to explain at eight 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.469
 protagonists each one of these 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.059
 store eight copper plates to the base 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.789
 bring the eight thousand 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.580
 That's how we learn about the country 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.920
 Nepal on the religion of Nepal and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.900
 of course, about the way we up 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.520
 to this base camp 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.470
 we were on the road with dhaulagiri 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.390
 the saado shiva with that already since 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.520
 many years on pilgrimages traveling 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.280
 was and there the first copper plate 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.890

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.540
 what shamans do there, too 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.250
 have a plate deposited 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.049
 and so we are from the west 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.100
 pulled east through nepal 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.350
