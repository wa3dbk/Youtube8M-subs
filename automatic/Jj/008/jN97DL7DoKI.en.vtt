00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.130
 Talk to me, beauty. I am what you are. 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.820
 vernet today I want to clarify the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.250
 doubts about glass 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.509
 used by sony on their devices 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.150
 on here 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.779
 good glass that sony use its 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.240
 Most appliances are not gorilla 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.109
 glass and neither takes the trophy 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.980
 ok the glass used by sony is itself 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.920
 of the brand to whom it is a chemical or to 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.079
 This can not help comments if I 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.300
 speak or wrong name but it seems to me that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.070
 video and composition of the silicate 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.829
 with whom I can not guarantee 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.329
 This is not my specialty but 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.489
 it seems like it is 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.550
 well what I can say to you is the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.539
 next the own glass of sony 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.730
 it is protected by a film at a 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.129
 filme called cher prof da sony 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:04.920
 this film has two functions to 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:08.070
 first is to protect you from the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.610
 as if you dropped your cell phone 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.710
 in his pocket he will fill with glass 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.340
 and can cut your leg with the film 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.900
 will keep the cars in place and if you 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.850
 also break the cell phone through some 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.830
 reason to try to move the screen you can 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.080
 cut your finger 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.540
 so with this film it 's a matter of 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.009
 health protection and the second one 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.220
 second aspect is to increase the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.750
 resistance of glass in case of fall ok 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.820
 this film strikes with great 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.530
 only that it is also applied 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.420
 people do not realize that they are the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.950
 technical and think it's the mobile glass 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.579
 it 's not personal 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.509
 Take a good look at the edges. 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.880
 You realize here you will see that 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.229
 There is a movie, okay? 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:00.799
 here you feel the film that's a 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:05.310
 film is removing this film 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.079
 violates this glass guarantee but it is very 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.030
 you need the guarantee of this 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.190
 video 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.130
 in case of fall with same person then 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.860
 which is a guarantee of this glass partner and 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.069
 in an alleged case of crack glass 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.140
 alone there maybe you can not get on 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.290
 guarantee if you take the film 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.660
 so any advice if you're already 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.300
 scratched there is no way to take the film 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.760
 internet search how to take that is the 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.080
 your model will not come out the symbol the case 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.780
 you take film 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.450
 in the case of xperia z that does not go rock 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.330
 it seems that xperia s does not leave either 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.540
 I know I did not use a sai on z looks like 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.980
 also go out then see if the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.239
 sony symbol 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.239
 and if you take the film put another 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.150
 because unfortunately the bottom glass is 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.000
 anti risk but as TA occurred 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.440
 grace of life only that is not homophobic 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.790
 then it is a glass that it will retain the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.590
 fingerprints 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.440
 and when you see that clean 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.480
 shirt how do you complete weapons or 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.110
 with a flannel will not come easy to 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.230
 dirt 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.079
 Why is not homophobic okay then? 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.880
 negative aspect of sony glass is that 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.190
 it pretty much requires you to use a 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.870
 because they are not euphoric and strip 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.870
 original you get anti-scratch video 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.510
 but it's not the focus and if you stick with the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.970
 also original sony she film 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.340
 It risks very easy or it is with the 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.840
 good film puts one more over 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.060
 no problem will not be bad to 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.750
 result image is with periculum 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.000
 bad 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.850
 see if you can take it if you can 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.940
 take this film off and put another 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.730
 because the glass is not look phobic now 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.040
 has a good looking glass of sony 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.190
 is much more resistant in case of falls 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.170
 there are far fewer cases of screen breaking 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.470
 with sony glass than with 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.630
 Samsung and LG for that google aggression 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.700
 he strangely strong against it you 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.180
 can put in the pocket of your pants with xavi 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.060
 This is no problem, it's all just a knife. 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.850
 you a silly crush Sometimes it breaks everything 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.620
 mainly from quince, then this 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.810
 sony video has a negative aspect 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.690
 do not look the forum requires a movie 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.880
 and if the skin when the factory 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.060
 2800 is good 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.080
 only doubt the positive aspect of this 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.850
 resistance 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.730
 I think sony made a nice move 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.830
 because I do not see anyone taking advantage of 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.550
 feature of gorilla glass sandy 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.980
 scratchs 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.160
 It's very rare for a user like me, right? 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.320
 when he had to leave the cell phone without 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.100
 film the staff picks up the iphone that is 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.890
 which also has glass risks to the will 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.130
 there and endangers takes the lg 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.930
 samsung talk on film porxa celular 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.740
 is already a risk does not need in the film 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.810
 staff but the staff goes there and then 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.670
 since nobody is giving the ball to this 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.620
 andré security glass took a 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.380
 cap not pericumã then better even by 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.850
 a stronger glass and worry about the 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.920
 existence in falls and not with 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.110
 scratch resistance because the film 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.710
 original factory is fragile against 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.430
 scratchs 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.530
 ok glass is strong but not the focus of 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.840
 team is the focus people always end up 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.840
 for a film even then I think 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.460
 Sony made it right to a small parcel 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.640
 of users who will not like this 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.550
 Like I like gorilla glass without 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.390
 film but I'm getting used to it 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.800
 Okay, so this is where I come in the original zone. 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.900
 he is resistant to scratches he will insist 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.890
 periculosa them in film and will be 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.670
 resistant to it 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.440
 however this glass is not the focus and will 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.140
 mark the fingerprint will be 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.150
 difficult to clean my suggestion is okay 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.760
 with the good film because a movie by 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.650
 The top is with the bad film, see if you 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.860
 can take the high school of sony without 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.660
 removed soon or even that remote soon 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.390
 You want to take it out and you want it. 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.760
 solves your problem then puts another 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.670
 film only for the sake of 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.180
 finger marks even beauty so this is it 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:13.640
 glass of sony ok positive point 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.460
 is stronger at negative point falls 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.860
 it comes with a film over with 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.390
 a good intention is to protect both against 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.940
 those hiring health but this 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.040
 film is easy there so you end up 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.890
 staying with the cell phone like the two 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.580
 films on the screen or at a minimum 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.349
 an 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.990
 Be the cell obliging you to use 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:34.789
 film if you do not mind using 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.250
 for which you will be happy in life with 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:39.319
 and will have the advantage of having a 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.800
 screen more resistant to falls 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:45.439
 now if you were part of the 5% that 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.539
 like our home with nothing around you 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:49.580
 You're going to have to think I like it that way. 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:51.379
 Nothing I'm used to using with 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.590
 he put sony soon one more 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:56.270
 one above but that 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.599
 in the end I think it's worth 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.280
 this point that for some 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:05.650
 may be negative think it was neither 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.650
 worth rather a hug earned
