I might have three or four five lessons
and<00:00:25.820> going<00:00:26.820> between<00:00:27.210> them<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:27.810> all<00:00:28.170> of

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
and going between them because all of

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.349 
and going between them because all of
the<00:00:28.500> planning<00:00:28.800> has<00:00:28.859> been<00:00:28.920> done<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:30.060> really

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359

like<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.660> make<00:00:30.779> sure<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.230> bring<00:00:31.470> energy<00:00:32.040> to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
like to make sure that I bring energy to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
like to study mathematics is really to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.740 
like to study mathematics is really to
be<00:00:52.500> able<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.739> get<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> hold<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.539> what's

reality<00:00:54.989> made<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.879> walk

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
reality made of like you know we we walk

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.090 
reality made of like you know we we walk
along<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.539> ground<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.050> don't<00:00:58.230> race<00:00:58.859> off

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
along the ground and we don't race off

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.619 
along the ground and we don't race off
into<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> air<00:00:59.489> because<00:00:59.579> gravity<00:01:00.390> these

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
into the air because gravity these

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.290 
into the air because gravity these
mathematical<00:01:01.530> laws<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:02.190> holding<00:01:02.910> us<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
mathematical laws are holding us to the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.359 
mathematical laws are holding us to the
ground<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.809> when<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.650> want<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> understand

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
ground and when we want to understand

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.429 
ground and when we want to understand
you<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.820> world<00:01:06.150> around<00:01:06.360> us<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.990> look<00:01:07.350> at

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
you know the world around us you look at

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.719 
you know the world around us you look at
a<00:01:07.500> flower<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.159> look<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> number<00:01:08.670> of

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
a flower and you look at the number of

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.730 
a flower and you look at the number of
petals<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.240> are<00:01:09.390> there<00:01:09.689> or<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.080> shape<00:01:10.260> of

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
petals that are there or the shape of

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.760 
petals that are there or the shape of
all<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:12.030> seeds<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.900> all<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
all of the little seeds on it and all of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.820 
all of the little seeds on it and all of
that<00:01:14.180> mathematical<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:15.960> me<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.409> get

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that mathematical so for me I just get

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.560 
that mathematical so for me I just get
so<00:01:17.130> much<00:01:17.250> enjoyment<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.060> learn<00:01:18.210> from

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
so much enjoyment then we learn from

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.749 
so much enjoyment then we learn from
being<00:01:19.290> able<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> talk<00:01:20.159> about<00:01:20.430> such<00:01:20.640> an

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
being able to talk about such an

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.999 
being able to talk about such an
interesting<00:01:21.000> thing<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.570> day<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> also

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
interesting thing all day but I also

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.830 
interesting thing all day but I also
love<00:01:23.430> seeing<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> when<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> student<00:01:24.659> has<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
love seeing you when a student has a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.770 
love seeing you when a student has a
really<00:01:25.460> hard<00:01:26.460> movement<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.420> there's<00:01:27.600> some

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
really hard movement when there's some

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.480 
really hard movement when there's some
insight<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.439> they<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.860> couldn't

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
insight that they they just couldn't

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.730 
insight that they they just couldn't
wrap<00:01:29.850> their<00:01:30.060> heads<00:01:30.240> around<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.689> suddenly<00:01:31.530> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
wrap their heads around and suddenly you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
wrap their heads around and suddenly you
know<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:32.070> talked<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:32.880> questioned<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.479> go

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
know we talked and we questioned we go

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.969 
know we talked and we questioned we go
round<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.930> round<00:01:33.990> around<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.650> draw

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
round and round around and we draw

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.300 
round and round around and we draw
things<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.689> suddenly<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.840> clicks<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:38.100> can

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
things and suddenly it clicks and I can

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.100 
things and suddenly it clicks and I can
literally<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.240> moment<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.810> their<00:01:39.930> eyes

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
literally see that moment and their eyes
