only equalizer you can do is for
everything<00:02:30.469> so<00:02:31.010> if<00:02:31.099> you<00:02:31.189> switch<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.579> the

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
everything so if you switch the the

everything so if you switch the the
clean<00:02:32.540> chain<00:02:32.840> or<00:02:33.139> the<00:02:33.290> clean<00:02:33.680> gain<00:02:33.980> on<00:02:34.219> it<00:02:34.370> it's

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
clean chain or the clean gain on it it's

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.670 
clean chain or the clean gain on it it's
