we're gonna talk about sensitivity in
game<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:01.230> simple<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.250> lower<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.789> better

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
game it's simple the lower the better

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.359 
game it's simple the lower the better
having<00:01:03.899> low<00:01:04.140> sensitivity<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.949> game<00:01:05.159> will

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
having low sensitivity in game will

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
having low sensitivity in game will
increase<00:01:05.790> your<00:01:05.909> aim<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.360> lot<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.990> will<00:01:07.350> even<00:01:07.650> be

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
increase your aim a lot and will even be

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.789 
increase your aim a lot and will even be
easier<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.220> get<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> headshots<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.150> players<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
easier to get the headshots on players I

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.590 
easier to get the headshots on players I
recommend<00:01:10.799> using<00:01:11.040> any<00:01:11.310> sensitivity<00:01:12.180> between

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
recommend using any sensitivity between

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.609 
recommend using any sensitivity between
