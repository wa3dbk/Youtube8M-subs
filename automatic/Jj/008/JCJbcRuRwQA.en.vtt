00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hey people and welcome to mikes 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:13.860
 suite today I'll show you how to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:17.640
 right the sound of money I have 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.609
 here the sgm 2x from the first on this 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.920
 Many thanks to harper team for that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.689
 that you give me the microphone for this 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.210
 have provided video and 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.640
 I'll show you what it's about when 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.880
 then if you want to fish the sound ton 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.390
 Fishing means that you have the microphone in 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.969
 best fall a directional microphone on one 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 duopoly or on a tonagel has that 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.250
 Aldi is here a more professional tone 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.600
 you can also diverge in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.780
 I have one of my last videos 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.579
 my do it yourself story 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.170
 shown how I even built myself 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.190
 you can pretty much do it here 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.739
 extend far 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.530
 depending on how the premises are 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.510
 you have to be careful how to do that from 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.860
 Of course, driving always depends on it 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.790
 how far the camera is filming the person 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.490
 far away 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.260
 because it is important if you fish the sound 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.060
 that you either from above or from 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.140
 down the sound work i have to do that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.570
 helpless moor short 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.630
 either from above the ton art or from 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.970
 downstairs but be careful that you with 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.080
 the microphone is not in the camera in it 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.090
 is that filming the protagonist 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.500
 So he naturally much too close because 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.170
 I see you here on the monitor 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.790
 the microphone is in there because of that 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.460
 I go down here 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.750
 and there you have to pay attention 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.450
 Again , we are far behind 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.759
 the camera is maybe removed 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.740
 more space up or down and 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.560
 depending on whether you choose from 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.590
 fished down or rather from here 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.509
 above acts and as in the video 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.939
 explains how to set up properly 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.159
 It is important that you use it 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.229
 directional microphone as close as possible to the sound 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.930
 Place source so close as possible 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.899
 that's why this is for 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.710
 example much closer to the mouth than 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.920
 Of course that's logical too 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.690
 it just depends on what 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.000
 other noise maybe in the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.290
 background are heard 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.120
 depending on you can then again 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.640
 decide if you maybe from below 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.820
 or from above the sound weber takes because 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.680
 if, for example, up there a crane is the much 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.960
 Of course, noise does not mean much 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.970
 sense to fish from below and also 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.890
 in the direction of the construction sun then 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.090
 rather switch from this source of interference 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.340
 the same way if down here 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.490
 something would be what makes a lot of noise then 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.900
 prefer to fish from below and against 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.960
 the ahl against the direction of 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.010
 source of noise is important too 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.920
 to make a bit of strain relief for 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.710
 the cables with straight such cables can 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.510
 cause fast wiggle contact and 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.370
 this always causes noises 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.650
 if you have such a cable a few times 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:10.530
 I wrap around and wrap the boom paul 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.040
 ever a small strain relief and 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.380
 not much can happen here 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.120
 Another tip is if you are 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.360
 a boom paul does not have this one 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.670
 Fabric cover was around velvet plating 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.700
 to recommend that you gloves 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.910
 because it's just when you're up 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.790
 bare on bare metal with hands 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.470
 maybe to grab or something 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.370
 noise is generated by the microphone 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.930
 with absorbs 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.030
 So there you really have to 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.640
 Pay attention when you hear the sound that you can 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.950
 then also stands still and not the whole 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.900
 time here and there almost exactly because 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.600
 that will be later on the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.810
 be heard microphone 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.450
 It is also important that you as possible 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.470
 I recommend you the sound as possible 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:03.060
 with listening headphones to the camera 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.640
 because if it is possible or as 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.170
 recording device and then in any case 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.090
 the tower with higher because then you hear 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.860
 logically, if any 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.170
 Noises are recorded 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.600
 or maybe you are from 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.739
 bottom from top to bottom starts with 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.600
 the micro walde the sound is better 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.090
 otherwise there is not much to note 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.480
 one then turns 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.070
 it just out of the picture so whether 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.930
 from the front or from the side 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.760
 completely no matter main thing from the picture 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.229
 out 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.780
 mostly you do that behind the camera 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:40.520
 because then on the monitor of the 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.740
 watching cameraman can see something 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.150
 and then you can see how close you are 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.710
 no panning in the picture before 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.930
 before the micro can be seen 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.780
 and now, for example, on this one 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.580
 height looks pretty wet but it is 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.290
 stop to see in the picture 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.210
 and now pad could be for example 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.330
 explain what we do here 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.639
 yes, I think it's really exciting 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.320
 yes video and sound technology, I know myself so 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.180
 not at all for that reason is for me too 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.300
 completely new territory what Michael makes 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.220
 and shows while keeping the pose there 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.880
 it's not that much 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.830
 to be observed 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.200
 then you just have to have a safe one 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.970
 have a firm grip and try 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.830
 as comfortably as possible to stand because under 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.370
 circumstances could be there already several 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.530
 hours 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.030
 many hours in several minutes 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.280
 stand and then it is natural 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.380
 Sometime in the long run it goes to the 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.240
 poor and then uncomfortable and then comes 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.850
 then in the arms and thereby can too 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.880
 disturbing noises arise when you 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.630
 over the head, for example, then fishes 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.849
 it is recommended that the shoulders as 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.810
 So I like to use prop 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.669
 support 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.610
 then you have more or less one 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.220
 hand free what I already saw 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.099
 I have it all the way to 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.130
 keep it under your arm 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:00.889
 then you still have a hand around freely 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.870
 for example if you have an external one 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.419
 external recording device has then you can 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.340
 here then the sound mission if if 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.879
 it is too quiet or too loud under 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.590
 circumstances otherwise really stop if 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.569
 if it has to be high of course the 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.029
 poor high tires then it does not work 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:20.479
 different but try as possible 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:20.960
 a firm but comfortable stop with it 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.120
 to have 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.650
 these were fishing my tips on the subject 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.979
 So a few things you notice 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.900
 should be here together with the sgm 2x of 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:32.419
 first super microphone as I think 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.340
 just for such things really great 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.139
 suitable link you will find below 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.830
 in the video description would me 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.349
 interest 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.270
 have you ever fished or toned 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.729
 maybe you have more tips on what 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.689
 You should be careful to write down 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:46.370
