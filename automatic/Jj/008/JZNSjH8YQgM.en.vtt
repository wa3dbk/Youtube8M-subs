00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.839
 Sas we have the camera today 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.809
 maria set of glass and tested 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:17.240
 and it is a tribute action camera 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.060
 camera under water on that we 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.720
 somehow paragliding or what knows 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.500
 not me 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.450
 the camera is the company hama that is 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.390
 super cool so really robust now 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.730
 and handy yes just tested the same 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.829
 is now better than prisoners 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.379
 longer and have a real garish 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.329
 Saddled and were just ridden 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.179
 it's really over two 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.519
 are hours of the region to courts 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.229
 she, too, will become independent of me 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.149
 somehow to get lost that we will then 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.879
 are almost back home almost been 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.589
 It was really good there but the camera 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.239
 did not have as much disk space because 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.249
 had I never use them at much faster 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.870
 but not so many companies can 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:59.449
 but I have a little bit now 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.370
 impression step trot gallop so the 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.379
 Camera is set to chest height 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.900
 because I have someone now 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.190
 it got shaken it went 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.890
 now in the meeting for example now exactly 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.890
 but rather when it's on coffee 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.390
 It's not like that and so it's me 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.230
 camera really ten points I think 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.000
 that cool 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.710
 the were as handy I have the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.170
 Immediately and easily 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.360
 to use 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.150
 Immediately clean is not difficult for anyone 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.860
 understand us great quality so that 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.350
 really expensive not been linked 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.690
 the exact left camera that is still 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.400
 an eleventh box 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.050
 So I think it would be super cool 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.360
 recommend and I want to go by myself 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.090
 put on his camera because the tournaments 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.850
 For example, only very handy if you are on 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.610
 has hands while one can namely 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.590
 is very understood and I hope 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.170
 I have a small impression of the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.600
 camera and looks so right one soon 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.450
 maybe a few videos in the style was the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.560
 veltins and I would be glad the erich 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.560
