00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.880
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.980
 teach how to make profiteroles 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.710
 to make some profiteroles for it 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.259
 we have arranged within this manga 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.329
 the pasta that we are going to discover 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.300
 little by little 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.679
 and let's go do those little ones 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.070
 profiteroles about the size of plus or minus 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.070
 of a nut 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.469
 It is very important when doing it 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.960
 leave a space between them and over 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.800
 all have the oven preheated to 200 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.800
 degree temperature 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.980
 I say it's important to leave space 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.980
 because obviously the mass will then go 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.810
 falling and going down a bit then it's 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.810
 easy to stick to each other 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.710
 well we're not going to the oven for space 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 from 20 minutes to 200 degrees 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.799
 temperature once that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.770
 time what we are going to do is going to know 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.869
 leave the door ajar and turn off the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.659
 oven for about 10 to 15 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.159
 minutes until the dough has remained 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.140
 completely dry it is important that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.850
 during the course of that time of 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.050
 the first 20 minutes do not open in 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.060
 any time the oven door 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.920
 because otherwise what would happen is 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.170
 that the mass would be lowered now with the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.940
 thermal contrast that will see what's going 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.729
 to happen is that it will insufflate quite 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.259
 was going to be hollow inside fruit 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.229
 the action of water evaporation that 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.539
 is going to push up the dough and 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.850
 leaving as I say an empty space a 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.399
 empty space in the center that then is 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.270
 what what we pgje to fill 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.369
 all these profiteroles 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.000
 and nothing said we go to the oven and 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.270
 now we show you the result 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.640
 well we come from the oven and here we have 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.110
 our profiteroles you see that they have 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.820
 insufflated enough have been by 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.280
 for 20 minutes to 200 degrees 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.040
 temperature and then we have left them with 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.080
 the door opened about 15 minutes and the 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.959
 the oven is already completely off 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.410
 Texture is the ideal presenting see 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.000
 They are completely dry and out 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.190
 within they still have that degree 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.780
 of tenderness and above all have created a 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.210
 empty that would allow us then 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.610
 fill them in let's open one 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.640
 so you can see it inside as they are 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.950
 so perfect now we could already 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.230
 Fill them with chantilly and cream 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.140
 custard a little bit of what 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.690
 we want and in principle this is 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.960
 the way to make profiteroles well 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.960
 good ones
