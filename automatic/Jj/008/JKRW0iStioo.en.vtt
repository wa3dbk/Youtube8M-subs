00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello and welcome today i want 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.610
 to draw your attention to this 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.610
 stunning andy platformer 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.900
 we play for a girl named well on 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.420
 which came up with a great idea 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.920
 go in a terrible blizzard in search 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.710
 the source of this blizzard itself 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.599
 of course she did not go far and if not 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.360
 magic scribe would be and have dinner 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.460
 bear on now seriously what me 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.260
 absolutely bribed so this is what with 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.320
 every level with every turn of the plot 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.200
 a new video opens and this is most often 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.960
 mini documentary life of the Eskimos about their 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.739
 beliefs and prejudices about their wisdom 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.739
 and everyday life 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.930
 control in the game is standard for 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.789
 platformer you can either switch 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.979
 between the scribe immune would play 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.020
 together with someone 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.450
 but on can run jump drag 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.240
 heavy box and hurl magical 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.549
 naked scribe run faster jumps higher 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.009
 and at the same time encourages local spirits on 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.479
 help is also a nice bonus game 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.670
 controller supports this platformer 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.580
 and of course that will have to die 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.229
 but often at the last levels of the second 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.119
 the player will make your life much easier 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.330
 because ideally you need to manage 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.610
 both characters still have incomprehensible 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.979
 moments with spirit and that here it seems like he 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.560
 here but at some incomprehensible point i to 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.630
 it does not jump about the fact that art 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.030
 amazing i'm not going to grovel you and 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.250
 see for yourself the game is played on one 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.280
 breathing if it is not a game at all and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.259
 what an adventure told of course 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.080
 graze danger guys at every corner 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.170
 weird yes and blizzard it really 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.009
 well, the problem comes from the game and this aura 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.979
 calm and peace in general 45 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.019
 hours of positive emotions guaranteed 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.709
 That seems to be all thanks for watching 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.709
 and all the rays of good
