end up in profit if you win 400 k and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.649 
end up in profit if you win 400 k and
let<00:01:16.170> me<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.470> bring<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.799> my<00:01:16.950> calculator<00:01:17.659> very

let me just bring up my calculator very

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:28.840 
let me just bring up my calculator very
quick<00:01:20.150> here<00:01:21.150> um<00:01:22.369> to<00:01:23.369> point<00:01:24.799> like<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.420> so

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
quick here um to point like that so

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.590 
quick here um to point like that so
minus<00:01:29.850> 200<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:32.159> 2<00:01:32.939> million<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
minus 200 then we have a 2 million and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.770 
minus 200 then we have a 2 million and
600<00:01:34.380> k<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.970> release<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:38.009> 400<00:01:38.460> k<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:38.729> well<00:01:41.780> then

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
600 k and release the 400 k as well then

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.090 
600 k and release the 400 k as well then
we<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.740> point<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.430> mill<00:01:44.640> okay<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:46.649> now

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
we have to point to mill okay and now

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.060 
we have to point to mill okay and now
the<00:01:47.159> 800<00:01:47.820> k<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.509> very<00:01:48.869> important<00:01:49.560> we

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the 800 k and this is very important we

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.999 
the 800 k and this is very important we
gotta<00:01:50.310> win<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:51.049> or<00:01:52.049> else<00:01:52.200> i'm<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> show

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
gotta win this or else i'm going to show

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.260 
gotta win this or else i'm going to show
you<00:01:53.040> if<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.430> lose<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.909> um<00:01:55.939> then<00:01:56.939> we're<00:01:57.119> going

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
you if you lose it um then we're going

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.819 
you if you lose it um then we're going
to<00:01:57.329> end<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:59.060> 1.4<00:02:00.060> mil<00:02:00.270> that's<00:02:00.469> 200<00:02:01.469> k<00:02:01.619> off

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
to end up with 1.4 mil that's 200 k off

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.109 
to end up with 1.4 mil that's 200 k off
that<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.780> number<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.439> should<00:02:04.790> stay<00:02:05.790> we

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
that that number we should stay we

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.619 
that that number we should stay we
should<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.659> staking<00:02:07.550> 1.6<00:02:08.550> mil<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:09.360> that

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
should be staking 1.6 mil because that

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.340 
should be staking 1.6 mil because that
is

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
is

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.240 
is
you<00:02:10.740> may<00:02:10.890> do<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.400> math<00:02:11.670> okay<00:02:12.050> April<00:02:13.050> say<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.680> 16

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
you may do the math okay April say is 16

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.390 
you may do the math okay April say is 16
so<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:16.140> pretty<00:02:16.290> important<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.950> would<00:02:17.190> win

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
so it's pretty important that would win

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.350 
so it's pretty important that would win
the<00:02:17.640> last<00:02:17.790> one<00:02:18.060> um<00:02:18.800> if<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.580> lose<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.060> got

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
the last one um if I if I lose it I got

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.920 
the last one um if I if I lose it I got
to<00:02:21.450> show<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.600> later<00:02:22.260> if<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.650> lose<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.810> then<00:02:24.810> I'm
