00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.230
 welcome to the ksc 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.450
 surely you have already asked yourself 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.300
 What this is actually for a car 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.070
 Now that's a track this way trip though 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.980
 it is not so to buy but 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.310
 this is a conversion i once had easily 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.310
 Taken and tried something like that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.920
 Center Rail Cage Car Expanding 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.840
 and I think she's pretty horny 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.760
 theme I have here the storage from the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.859
 movie legend with tom cruise i took 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.539
 think this is a cool movie character and 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.750
 That's how the whole car looks like 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.649
 black green and I'll show you now 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.000
 times how to build the whole thing 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.640
 The whole thing is based on that 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.629
 roll bar from baha as it is light 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.629
 can already recognize 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.600
 Of course some parts are optional like 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.680
 the lighting and so on he needs 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.390
 but in any case, just everyone 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.869
 and of course as / he will then 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.780
 first the chance plate and dribbles 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.380
 on the side the whole boxes next to the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.280
 Battery compartment load but the attachment 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.050
 for the two skip plates on the edge 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.090
 then you write first about everything 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.340
 stands on some plastic remnants and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.140
 of course you can do that too 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.850
 you do not have to do it with your hand 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 here such a beautiful live-blog necessarily 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.899
 but is of course helpful 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.479
 just faster 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.429
 and then you do everything over 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.289
 the side away so it's really nice 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.140
 glass is here you see again like that 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.090
 form looks like then you take the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.569
 alu are doing the right thing lately 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.470
 length so that they are in jazz and 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:52.170
 then and there makes the cutouts 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.369
 the dremel rhine where afterwards the kit 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.849
 place sit at chance that you see 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.849
 Now again 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.619
 then you need a lot in the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:11.640
 three screws one centimeter long and 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:14.060
 makes the alu profiles at justice 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.500
 firmly 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.450
 and if you 're that far then screw 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.670
 he just the fore and aft part of 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.739
 / back to normal because I have it 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.840
 now all need tuning and on 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.459
 rear part I rustler wishbone 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.330
 installed and the whole a little wider 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.620
 The serb will just be here 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.800
 adapted to the front now 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.900
 because the aluminum strip is pure and right 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.340
 the whole then if this is always here 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.010
 right angle gives that is true 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.150
 also for almost all models so with 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.550
 other words when the wheels 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.489
 stand straight 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.940
 then I should here the steering linkage 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.680
 just be so parallel to the axis that 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.620
 a right angle and then with the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.630
 servo on again a right angle like that 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.890
 then the whole thing just comes in there 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.110
 you come then still the servo am 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.260
 between and then are exactly right 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.220
 Angle, that's not how you scare me 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.700
 I am already a whole step 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.370
 continue 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.930
 So if you then afford the alu 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.150
 the side then you have the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.060
 First , another piece of bar 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.530
 from below, however, also with 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.840
 screw a threesome and stop mother 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.600
 Fix it so it's on the side like that 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.850
 an area gets where you after di 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.070
 carlo can do it if you can 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.200
 baarer nose installed then fits the with 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.549
 the hole exactly on the bracket of 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.180
 battery klib and the whole is based 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.680
 said on the roll bar of the bafa 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.590
 You can decorate that beautiful there 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.180
 is the side fitting of the caro 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.950
 from / there I have from the leds 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.640
 Posed on top looks to be his eighties 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.459
 pc fan grille and regulator comes 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.769
 of course, again 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.579
 in the front there are still lamps from the baha 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:03.060
 installed the roll bar is off the ball 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:05.459
 front just off the shock absorbers 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.510
 and the whole thing is always moored with 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.489
 cable ties 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.440
 because cable ties have a big one 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.520
 advantage you can do it all again 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.590
 to dismantle and 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.120
 is not at your / much change a lot 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.930
 screw it up on the 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.570
 actual bottom plate the bamba den 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.850
 front bumper I've cut and rear 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.150
 that is folded up the trick at the 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.400
 whole thing is the bumper from / is 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.200
 Rear of the engine bracket and bottom 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.190
 Kit plate actually with four screws 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:39.660
 turn it on and you replace it and then do it 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:43.500
 the lower mounts of the real 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.880
 bamba where previously the upper railway and 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:52.260
 then you can do the whole bumper 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:54.650
 fold up and then he lies exactly on 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.080
 the rear body mount on 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.810
 and there then lays me the barra 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.270
 Roll bar on the back and could that 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.050
 whole then there also with cable ties 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.600
 moor 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.100
 have children are your friend with 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.770
 cable ties is indeed the 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.350
 Fan grille firm and the whole 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.420
 Everything else just with everything 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.710
 cable ties tightened is 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.360
 maybe not the fine English kind 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.180
 is working but it stops 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.090
 flawlessly several flashovers until the 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.080
 already endured and easy 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.120
 and make it fast 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.310
 but what is still screwed is 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.830
 this middle part of the roll bar 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.140
 he simply screws it with thick ones 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.620
 screw from below against the all 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:42.180
 afford and that's the whole thing then 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:44.610
 Do not be surprised at the front 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.770
 Spector sticker on the wheels easy 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.750
 because I always find that these white ones 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.450
 stickers pretty cool on the wheels 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.100
 Of course, that's not a look at sea 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.470
 Spector that's me in the case though 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.280
 really times it does not matter that 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.020
 Things just look good on you 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.940
 can leek from behind with a piece 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.010
 tied a spare wheel against it 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.490
 screw and who wants can a pc 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.560
 Install fan and front a led 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.150
 The whole thing just becomes micro 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.700
 plug with clamped 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.910
 I also have the front bumper 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.280
 cut a bit and the side panels 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.830
 that can be seen down there are simple 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.830
 Pieces the back of the 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:29.760
 spoiler holder from baha roll bar 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.380
 are the shortened is the pc fan 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.200
 Incidentally, I have no problem with that 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.360
 made several rashes that has sand 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.490
 gotten the water has gotten the 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.130
 has the whole shock on offroad 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.980
 strayed and runs after 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.230
 altogether now six liters 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.890
 Charges still without problems 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.660
 so that's not an issue of the spoiler 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.980
 here at the moment still sitting on it 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.830
 I then broke down again 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:59.330
 that did not look great 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.330
 I still have these on the side 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.130
 pulled in for the windows and in front 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.770
 even a fan cover purely as 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.720
 Front protection from the rear window and 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.350
 on the side the actual body 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.230
 that is a piece of plastic and that 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.360
 I recommend you from the Baumarkt 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.310
 so-called light light track 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.320
 this is usually for skylight 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.730
 that does not cost much and that's great 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.020
 You can easily do that with the scissors 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:30.120
 cut and loosely loosen her 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.190
 does not need sails or else 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.990
 that's not what some materials are 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.110
 how else to work 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.790
 the holds that is flexible that is soft 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.460
 that can be great and you 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:44.040
 see it on the back strut of 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:48.470
 the roll bar with bolted and 

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:51.180
 below also at the side bar 

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.610
 screwed in and still sitting in there 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:57.030
 a barbie I painted green 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:59.360
 and a few small plastic parts are 

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.360
 also installed
