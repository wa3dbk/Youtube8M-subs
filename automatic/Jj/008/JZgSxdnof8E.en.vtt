00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.410
 hi all users spaceshames are 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.440
 Dr. White we are here today with a new one 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.379
 video dedicated to fifa 15 latest teams 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.630
 we return the reviews we leave for 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.580
 a moment the team of the season with which i 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.890
 team of the week players for 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.130
 speak of a legend the first 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.810
 legend that I report this year on 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.429
 indeed we had already seen space 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.230
 however this is really the crepe 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.890
 legend by definition is the soccer player 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.940
 who knows more about value between versions 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.760
 base because obviously we cannot 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.539
 count the various ronaldo 99 put 98 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.940
 etc. etc. 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.670
 we are talking you have already seen of 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.500
 Pele is not the version in early as 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.730
 the xbox owners could 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.890
 try this for five days 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.410
 this is the basic version with normal 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.180
 the one you buy on the market we start 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.820
 to see his statistics starting 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.309
 as always from the speed that speed 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.140
 it's really no problem 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.340
 because at 95 of acceleration and 95 disk 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.460
 rinspeed so understand that it is a 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.680
 very very fast player does not have 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.290
 trouble skipping opponent defenders 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.330
 in speed and this unites one thing 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.520
 that I really liked the strength 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.430
 physics you will say is not much e 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.860
 you are right if you compare it to maybe a 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.440
 an ibrahimovic at a ronaldo but for the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.930
 Pele played in only one meter and 74 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.580
 trust you feel this strength 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.170
 physics also happened to me to win 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.020
 of physical contrasts 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.300
 despite not being as great as 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.330
 player regarding the shot 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.510
 instead pelè is fantastic in this one too 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.360
 category has no particular problems 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.090
 91 of finalization that seems higher 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.880
 in game because it's seen how many goals vms 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.680
 in the clips below and how many I've owed 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.800
 discard because maybe they were more banal 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.960
 and not long shot and you can hear it here 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.810
 because really shooting from a distance is 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.050
 really great that is power either 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.540
 especially of precision despite the 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.000
 81 of effect that might seem 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.280
 quite low as a value I have not 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.109
 never had trouble pulling around 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.080
 second pole then also under this 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:18.540
 point of view those promoted 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.950
 all this combines the four stars 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.720
 weaker so you can pull 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.210
 quietly it's right they are 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.010
 strong foot is his left that is his 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.430
 foot slightly less strong but 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.770
 however, you will succeed in making it happen 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.630
 regarding the fantastic dribbling 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.620
 here we understand why it is the fusion of 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.330
 put and ronaldo to 94 stiffness and 94 of 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.560
 excellent ball control so can 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.300
 go away in the strait 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.850
 quietly even without needing 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.770
 of skill as opposed to put that is 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.440
 very good in the trip but sins 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.230
 slightly for the skills what has penis a 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.990
 five-star skill like ronaldo then 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.959
 you can decide whether to use agility 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.060
 direction changes to jump 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.860
 the opponent or make them skills because 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.830
 he can do them all and he really is one 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.660
 extraordinary skimmer if you love a 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.760
 billion opponent I am not able 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.990
 because I want to be honest I'm not 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.580
 not at all able to humiliate 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.680
 the opponent 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.150
 you can safely use batteries is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.500
 probably the strongest player 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.050
 even stronger the various versions of 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.330
 ronaldo and neymar that I could 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.940
 try regarding the passage 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.190
 good because at 89 so at a very good 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.880
 value of passage to 89 of passage 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.410
 short and 85 passing long than not 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.090
 they are scarce values ​​but I have it 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.620
 used more as a finalizer than this 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.870
 what it means though means that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.970
 you can easily use it too 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.239
 as a file I was a playmaker if 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.280
 look for very elaborate hybrids 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.350
 but I preferred to deploy as a point 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.209
 because it has offensive statistics from 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.769
 afraid therefore I preferred to use him as 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.840
 finalizer than as a creator of 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.310
 game is however able to do so by 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.570
 we have already talked about physical 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.070
 good physical strength 86 elevation not 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.290
 It marks the head of a lot between a 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.600
 bulletin I managed however to 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.250
 do it which put you are advised 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.459
 I think they are quite trivial I would say 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.140
 the basic restyle cams so let's go to 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.450
 improve all the 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.600
 player features where 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.060
 use the pelè here is the tip that 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.560
 needed for the championship for the teams 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.660
 of brazil 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.940
 and you know there aren't these tips like that 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.200
 strong so if you are six box and you have the 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.240
 possibility to buy it because 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.770
 obviously it can be cheap 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.310
 quietly used also as 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.310
 tip 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.560
 in this case with neymar and lucas a 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.770
 support and then the solidity of the 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.900
 Brazilians behind or if you have more 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.310
 money can also be deployed in a 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.710
 attacks two I have deployed with 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.330
 cristiano ronaldo is fine with 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.300
 an ibra in swinging a player more 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.060
 high that maybe lever head Sutomore 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.500
 for pelé pelè that is hybridized in this 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.930
 team thanks to a gene that does not 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.550
 they cost a lot like ag and f berger 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.740
 if you wanted you could also put zola 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.570
 the important thing is that they are three legends 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.100
 close to give each other the maximum agreement and then 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.250
 behind we have the defense of 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.380
 very solid bundesliga very strong 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.760
 physically fast and above all not 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.680
 it costs a lot 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.260
 in conclusion, however, it is simply 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.960
 extraordinary extremely fast 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.320
 grandiose 4- star finalizer plus 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.840
 weak lap shooting is fantastic 5 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.030
 stars skill like cristiano ronaldo ea 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.700
 these combine agility and control 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.370
 of ball out of the municipality of leo messi 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.710
 the warcraft high bass allows you to 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.980
 always be in the right place at the moment 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.800
 right and physical strength is good 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.680
 the only one against which is the price is a 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.840
 question mark though because it costs so much 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.630
 because this between the two million and 7 and 4 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.760
 millions but it doesn't cost that much respect 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.950
 to the value of the player consider that 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.440
 it is the rarest card of the game because it is 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.730
 much more difficult to unpack Pele 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.920
 that you don't unpack a Christian 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.190
 ronaldo team of the year is a player 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.480
 who knows how to do everything is inseparable puts 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.310
 fear of the opponent because I have seen 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.890
 many who are afraid of pelè ad 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.410
 face it so it's worth all the money 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.060
 that you're going to spend on this 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.370
 player I know someone can 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.320
 spend because I know there are people who have 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.770
 so many credits if you have the 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.020
 possibility 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.970
 give it a try you won't regret it for everyone 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.150
 other players on xbox 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.770
 be aware that there is still the possibility 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.820
 to try it on loan for five 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.330
 start so maybe you already have them 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.330
 tried 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.830
 tell me what you think about it like 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.660
 player on pivot order team if 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.860
 you faced it saw gave problems 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.990
 or not 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.990
 we will see each other soon
