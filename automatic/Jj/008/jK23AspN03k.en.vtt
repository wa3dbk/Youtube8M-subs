00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 no special company team of the year 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.609
 so we went to try to 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.050
 pick these three players out there who are 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.650
 so xavi franck ribery and iniesta so 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.790
 here we go 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.590
 I hope we will have a lot more 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.230
 chances that the first episode that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.940
 frankly was really very very bad 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.020
 first pack the vega I hope we'll have 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.580
 heavy 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.260
 we believe in it we believe it is moment or 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.800
 never frankly with the packs 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.220
 problem of players in addition is what we 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.220
 will have heavy 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.860

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:52.379

 first episode of course what I have 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.620

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.960
 opening but actually 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.539

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.490

 it's the last one we can always 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:21.169
 pray we will have nothing but slab I think very 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.029
 all 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.520

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:32.240
 will change something 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:34.300
 this is barzagli stalls at 84.2 general on 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.979
 tipi often put credit am sorry but 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.430
 to by not convinced that it will 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.590
 open 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.669
 though albeit okay jordi 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.039
 alba 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.990
 I do not know how much it costs but I think 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.949
 that with valencia he must pretty much 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.930
 be worth the same price 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:54.020
 so here's the guys that's the end of this 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:57.439
 small pack opening for part 2 so 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.629
 for circles I hope it has you 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:01.189
 not too disappointed that I had shit 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:03.620
 once again in any case me it was me 

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:04.550
 disappointed but really disgusted but something 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.529
 crazy 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.300
 in any case if you remembered me 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:08.779
 do not hesitate to bombard me this bar 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.089

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.669

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.110
 to reach where even or even 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:21.469
 maybe more to really enjoy yourself 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.539

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:26.899
 last opening not that we will say so 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:29.839

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:34.699
 do not hesitate to tell me about 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:37.580
