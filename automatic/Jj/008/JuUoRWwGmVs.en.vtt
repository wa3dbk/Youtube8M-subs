00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.299 
long as it's comfortable the horse
doesn't<00:00:41.610> tense<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.620> yeah<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.890> fact<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.129> I'm

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
doesn't tense and yeah the fact that I'm

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.369 
doesn't tense and yeah the fact that I'm
close<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> horse<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.079> all<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.200> can

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
close to the horse so it's all I can

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.049 
close to the horse so it's all I can
really<00:00:46.680> feel<00:00:46.890> her<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.520> controllable

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
really feel her it's a controllable

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.459 
really feel her it's a controllable
isn't<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.539> want<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:48.960> -<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
isn't it you want that so - is the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.439 
isn't it you want that so - is the
formula<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:50.969> happens<00:00:51.329> as

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
formula really and then what happens as

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.700 
formula really and then what happens as
you<00:00:51.539> go<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> horse<00:00:52.140> loses<00:00:52.469> weight<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
you go and the horse loses weight and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.459 
you go and the horse loses weight and
changes<00:00:53.250> shape<00:00:53.430> during<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> race<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.629> can

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
changes shape during the race I can

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.560 
changes shape during the race I can
either<00:00:55.620> adjust<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.160> slightly<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.850> most<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
either adjust it slightly or most of the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.500 
either adjust it slightly or most of the
time<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.109> saddle<00:00:58.379> adjusts<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.190> horse

comfortable<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.280> hundred<00:01:35.579> miles<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:36.270> one

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
comfortable for a hundred miles in one

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.200 
comfortable for a hundred miles in one
day<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.840> need<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.320> sort<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.680> comfort<00:01:38.210> of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
day you need that sort of comfort of

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.670 
day you need that sort of comfort of
course<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> comfort<00:01:39.930> factor<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.500> horse

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
course the comfort factor for the horse

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
course the comfort factor for the horse
is<00:01:40.799> vital<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.790> reactor<00:01:42.270> panel<00:01:42.509> design

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
is vital and this reactor panel design

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.960 
is vital and this reactor panel design
is<00:01:42.930> quite<00:01:43.140> revolutionary<00:01:43.290> isn't<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.100> yeah<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
is quite revolutionary isn't it yeah the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.179 
is quite revolutionary isn't it yeah the
the<00:01:45.000> panel<00:01:45.540> system<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.990> based<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.409> having<00:01:47.159> a

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the panel system is based on having a

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.219 
the panel system is based on having a
globe<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.149> service<00:01:48.479> spread<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:48.840> long<00:01:49.079> as

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
globe and service spread as long as

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:49.850 
globe and service spread as long as
possible

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
possible

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.950 
possible
that's<00:01:50.130> very<00:01:50.369> flexible<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.970> both<00:01:51.119> ends<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that's very flexible on both ends the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.859 
that's very flexible on both ends the
panel<00:01:52.619> system<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.450> actually<00:01:54.450> attached<00:01:54.689> with

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
panel system is actually attached with

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.539 
panel system is actually attached with
Velcro<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:55.350> saw<00:01:55.530> behind<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.009> which<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.369> shock

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
Velcro we saw behind this which is shock

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.249 
Velcro we saw behind this which is shock
absorbers<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.930> actually<00:01:58.170> adjust

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
absorbers and they can actually adjust

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.889 
absorbers and they can actually adjust
the<00:01:58.649> positioning<00:01:59.149> worth<00:02:00.149> where<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.540> adjust

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the positioning worth where we adjust

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.330 
the positioning worth where we adjust
them<00:02:01.079> actually<00:02:01.350> affects<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.860> way<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.100> fits

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
them actually affects the way it fits

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.370 
them actually affects the way it fits
and<00:02:02.670> also<00:02:02.939> affects<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.420> horse<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:04.259> they

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and also affects the horse but they

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.200 
and also affects the horse but they
absorb<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> shock<00:02:05.100> as<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> sounds<00:02:06.060> being

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
absorb the shock as the sounds being

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.449 
absorb the shock as the sounds being
ridden<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.250> cover

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
ridden on and what we do is we cover

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.850 
ridden on and what we do is we cover
them<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.970> our<00:02:09.090> normal<00:02:09.539> saddle<00:02:10.020> pads<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.470> these

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
them in our normal saddle pads and these

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.690 
them in our normal saddle pads and these
are<00:02:11.039> lovely<00:02:11.370> lovely<00:02:11.550> sheepskin<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.270> there's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
are lovely lovely sheepskin then there's

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.190 
are lovely lovely sheepskin then there's
we<00:02:12.790> reckon<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.390> best<00:02:13.599> quality<00:02:13.959> that<00:02:14.110> we

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
we reckon of the best quality that we

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.710 
we reckon of the best quality that we
can<00:02:14.349> source<00:02:14.590> absolutely<00:02:15.220> gorgeous<00:02:15.660> they<00:02:16.660> do

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
can source absolutely gorgeous they do

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.259 
can source absolutely gorgeous they do
go<00:02:16.959> in<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.110> Washington<00:02:17.440> even<00:02:17.590> tumble<00:02:17.950> dry<00:02:18.269> for

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
go in the Washington even tumble dry for

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.759 
go in the Washington even tumble dry for
the<00:02:19.360> FEI<00:02:19.629> rides<00:02:20.050> of<00:02:20.319> course<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.590> lighter

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
the FEI rides of course the lighter

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.140 
the FEI rides of course the lighter
riders<00:02:21.190> have<00:02:21.280> got<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.489> carry<00:02:21.670> weights<00:02:21.910> that's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
riders have got to carry weights that's

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.240 
riders have got to carry weights that's
mostly<00:02:22.450> women<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.319> how<00:02:23.530> do<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.800> build<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
mostly women so how do you build the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.130 
mostly women so how do you build the
weight<00:02:24.400> carrying<00:02:24.910> aspect<00:02:25.330> into<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.599> saddle

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
weight carrying aspect into the saddle

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.110 
weight carrying aspect into the saddle
well<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.709> riders<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.280> International<00:02:27.760> riders

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
well the riders the International riders

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.479 
well the riders the International riders
have<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.510> weigh<00:02:29.110> 75<00:02:29.650> kilograms<00:02:30.099> with<00:02:30.310> their

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
have to weigh 75 kilograms with their

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.000 
have to weigh 75 kilograms with their
saddle<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.450> we<00:02:31.599> builded<00:02:32.140> weight<00:02:32.650> into<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
saddle and so we builded weight into the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.070 
saddle and so we builded weight into the
city<00:02:33.310> into<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.640> actual<00:02:33.819> saddle<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.330> this<00:02:34.930> is

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
city into the actual saddle and this is

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.690 
city into the actual saddle and this is
actually<00:02:35.470> part<00:02:35.739> of<00:02:35.860> an<00:02:35.980> integral<00:02:36.280> part<00:02:36.519> of<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
actually part of an integral part of the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.009 
actually part of an integral part of the
saddle<00:02:37.000> which<00:02:37.300> we<00:02:37.450> actually<00:02:37.660> put<00:02:37.810> weight<00:02:37.989> in

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
saddle which we actually put weight in

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.229 
saddle which we actually put weight in
eventually<00:02:38.980> putting<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.340> in<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.580> saddle<00:02:39.940> is

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
eventually putting this in the saddle is

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.880 
eventually putting this in the saddle is
there<00:02:40.480> actually<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.989> saddles<00:02:41.290> balance<00:02:41.650> and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
there actually the saddles balance and

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.080 
there actually the saddles balance and
most<00:02:42.069> of<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.190> riders<00:02:42.370> did<00:02:42.640> not<00:02:42.730> notice

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
most of the riders did not notice

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.309 
most of the riders did not notice
they've<00:02:43.269> actually<00:02:43.420> got<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.840> added<00:02:44.140> weight

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
they've actually got that added weight

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.170 
they've actually got that added weight
in<00:02:44.500> which<00:02:44.890> allows<00:02:45.160> them<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.519> go<00:02:45.640> on<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.000> ride

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
in which allows them to go on and ride

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.390 
in which allows them to go on and ride
as<00:02:46.599> they<00:02:46.750> normally<00:02:46.900> would<00:02:47.080> without<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
as they normally would without the the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.550 
as they normally would without the the
feeling<00:02:48.640> big<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.150> additional<00:02:49.599> weight<00:02:49.750> now

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
feeling big of the additional weight now

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.830 
feeling big of the additional weight now
for<00:02:51.280> some<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.790> riders<00:02:51.970> that's<00:02:52.360> not<00:02:52.569> enough

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
for some of the riders that's not enough

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.839 
for some of the riders that's not enough
for<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.140> Kris<00:02:53.380> that's<00:02:53.650> not<00:02:53.799> enough<00:02:54.099> so<00:02:54.579> what<00:02:54.730> we

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
for a Kris that's not enough so what we

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.699 
for a Kris that's not enough so what we
do<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.120> we<00:02:55.269> add<00:02:55.420> another<00:02:55.989> feature<00:02:56.260> which<00:02:56.530> is

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
do is we add another feature which is

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.289 
do is we add another feature which is
actually<00:02:56.980> weight<00:02:57.130> bags<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:58.180> can

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
actually weight bags and you can

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.640 
actually weight bags and you can
actually<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.870> riders<00:02:59.140> can<00:02:59.260> actually<00:02:59.500> put

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
actually the riders can actually put

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.559 
actually the riders can actually put
that<00:02:59.799> weight<00:02:59.980> in<00:03:00.310> where<00:03:00.790> they<00:03:00.910> like<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.360> when

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
that weight in where they like to when

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:02.819 
that weight in where they like to when
they<00:03:01.690> need<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.019> order<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.380> get<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.680> up<00:03:02.739> to

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
they need to in order to get it up to

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.350 
they need to in order to get it up to
