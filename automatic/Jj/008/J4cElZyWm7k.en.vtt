00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.109
 I'm trying to gather all the pieces of the puzzle 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.029
 any other testimony says I knew that would happen 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 although justice 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.749
 I did not know if you warned them that the bridge was going to collapse 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.069
 based on the automotive 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.069
 minutes later it happened 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.610
 Canada 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.390
 this is what I believe 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.390
 there is an answer for everything 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.239
 the payroll they call the collapse of the bridge 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.659
 the legal norm in the law courts the natural sciences 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.660
 with death 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.790
 we like to be deceived 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.700
 I've seen this before 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.010
 a few timely when disaster struck 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 and then a group uru 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 death is saw 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 I'm not saying we could not avoid that 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.510
 they should not be alive I do not know what to say that death wants someone 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.240
 more in place 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 a moment if we send someone we will survive 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.990
 when we finish you will have a perfect vision
