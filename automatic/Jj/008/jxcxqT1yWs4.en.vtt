really like that when she dresses up she
keeps<00:02:49.409> her<00:02:49.590> style<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.159> when<00:02:50.280> I've<00:02:50.400> seen<00:02:50.670> her<00:02:50.819> in

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.399 
a dress she still had on socks and
sandals<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.849> paired<00:02:54.329> this<00:02:54.629> light<00:02:55.230> blue

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
sandals so I paired this light blue

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.190 
sandals so I paired this light blue
dress<00:02:55.680> with<00:02:56.220> my<00:02:56.579> socks<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.180> Oxford's<00:02:57.959> just
