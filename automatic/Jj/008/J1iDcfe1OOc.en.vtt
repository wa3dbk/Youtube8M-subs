turning like so and then on the side you

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.710 
turning like so and then on the side you
have<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:35.190> piece<00:02:35.460> which<00:02:36.240> controls<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.870> forks

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
have this piece which controls the forks

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.510 
have this piece which controls the forks
it's<00:02:39.720> not<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.020> sturdiest<00:02:40.230> design<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.250> try<00:02:41.460> it

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
it's not the sturdiest design to try it

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.120 
it's not the sturdiest design to try it
like<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.780> raise<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.320> lower<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.620> forks

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.650 

I'll<00:02:47.130> turn<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.400> over<00:02:47.460> here's<00:02:47.730> get<00:02:48.000> gear<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
I'll turn it over here's get gear on the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:57.650 
I'll turn it over here's get gear on the
side<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.980> used<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.670> Mindstorms

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
classic Technic wheels you see them in a

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.970 
classic Technic wheels you see them in a
lot<00:03:44.960> of<00:03:45.080> sets<00:03:45.400> not<00:03:46.400> rare<00:03:46.700> or<00:03:46.910> anything

everything's<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.160> classic<00:03:49.870> like<00:03:50.870> Grey's<00:03:52.600> do

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
everything's the classic like Grey's do

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.150 
everything's the classic like Grey's do
that<00:03:53.750> is<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.020> point<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.350> book<00:03:54.530> does<00:03:54.860> have

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
that is the point the book does have

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.090 
that is the point the book does have
three<00:03:56.060> models<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:57.050> can<00:03:57.200> build<00:03:57.500> so<00:03:57.890> even

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
three models that you can build so even

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.620 
three models that you can build so even
though<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.310> doesn't<00:03:58.490> say<00:03:58.910> it<00:03:59.090> it's<00:03:59.300> really

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
though it doesn't say it it's really

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.120 
though it doesn't say it it's really
like<00:03:59.780> it's<00:03:59.960> almost<00:04:00.080> like<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.350> three-in-one<00:04:00.800> did

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
like it's almost like a three-in-one did

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.980 
like it's almost like a three-in-one did
you<00:04:01.220> see<00:04:01.400> today<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.700> can<00:04:02.000> build<00:04:02.210> this<00:04:02.390> road

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
you see today you can build this road

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.980 
you see today you can build this road
scraper<00:04:03.610> it's<00:04:04.610> very<00:04:04.790> simple<00:04:05.240> a<00:04:05.420> lot<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.810> pieces

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
scraper it's very simple a lot of pieces

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.140 
scraper it's very simple a lot of pieces
do<00:04:06.410> it<00:04:06.470> doesn't<00:04:07.100> use<00:04:07.280> all<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.580> pieces<00:04:07.790> I<00:04:08.030> don't

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
do it doesn't use all the pieces I don't

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.020 
do it doesn't use all the pieces I don't
think<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:09.050> then<00:04:09.320> you<00:04:09.410> can<00:04:09.560> build<00:04:09.710> this

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
think and then you can build this

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.370 
think and then you can build this
hydraulic<00:04:11.030> type<00:04:11.510> lift<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:12.080> mean<00:04:12.200> it's<00:04:12.290> not

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
hydraulic type lift I mean it's not

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.100 
hydraulic type lift I mean it's not
hydraulic<00:04:12.980> but<00:04:13.160> it's<00:04:13.310> like<00:04:13.460> a<00:04:13.870> it's<00:04:14.870> like<00:04:14.990> a

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
hydraulic but it's like a it's like a

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.539 
hydraulic but it's like a it's like a
lift<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.500> see<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:17.359> go<00:04:17.480> up<00:04:17.660> and<00:04:17.840> down<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.769> then

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
lift you see and go up and down and then

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.120 
lift you see and go up and down and then
it<00:04:19.670> shows<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:19.910> how<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.380> connect<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.560> motor

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
it shows you how to connect the motor

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.840 
it shows you how to connect the motor
and<00:04:22.970> we<00:04:23.660> didn't<00:04:23.840> have<00:04:23.990> remote<00:04:24.380> control<00:04:24.820> so<00:04:25.820> you

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
and we didn't have remote control so you

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.610 
and we didn't have remote control so you
had<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.419> wire<00:04:26.600> connected<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.230> it<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.560> they

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
had the wire connected to it and they

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.970 
had the wire connected to it and they
just<00:04:27.830> make<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.220> make<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:29.240> go<00:04:29.390> forward<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:30.680> go

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
just make the make you go forward and go

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.180 
just make the make you go forward and go
up<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.340> down<00:04:32.440> and<00:04:33.440> then<00:04:33.680> what<00:04:33.890> did<00:04:34.040> they<00:04:34.070> do

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
up and down and then what did they do
