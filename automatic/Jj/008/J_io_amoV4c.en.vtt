00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.160
 that's our haye's hapless so well 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:15.240
 the eyes opened in the clutches of the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:17.850
 fashion bears king htc finally again 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.090
 great culture on the console 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.670
 yes because the group games is almost a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.500
 interactive play and you have to 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.670
 Now do not imagine theater sounds yes 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.099
 a bit boring for 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.180
 Video player here it is easy 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.460
 Feast the creative ideas and do it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.059
 it really fun to watch 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.480
 theater in the spot again is just like that 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.860
 that the whole action on a kind 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.780
 So the virtual stage will take place 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.980
 backdrops and so on everything is like this 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.809
 made that you think that you 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.539
 any cardboard cutouts and also the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.820
 So, characters do not see why 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.039
 Puppets or figures you over there 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.390
 the screen he conducts it goes 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.300
 because you as a puppet the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.489
 no head has against the evil one 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.909
 moon bears king fights on the moon 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.590
 the souls of the children enslaved no so 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.270
 something nasty and the audience is too 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.290
 there and there are more meters and that 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.509
 audience reacted 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.920
 and he tells narrated and you stay 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.420
 always on the same stage only the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.490
 scenery moves precisely and also the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.470
 figures break through this fourth 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.970
 wall as you always say they are raining 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.680
 let's see that the other actors 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.600
 Mist, for example, make this cross 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.369
 I'd like to climb here now 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.729
 it is incredibly funny 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.729
 easy 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.070
 the game is far from it today 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.750
 There are many more crazy ideas 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.700
 There are even pairs of musical inserts 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.860
 where I have to say that I found mine 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.479
 not quite so successful because yes 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.530
 musicals just hard to do then 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.630
 the music must be correct then the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:15.100
 lyrics that was from time to time 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:18.100
 a little too stupid but is still one 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.320
 yes in the reason are namely the 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.120
 Puppeteer doing a job man like in 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.580
 to save rayman origins 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.650
 the special feature is the hero 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.940
 a pair of scissors with which it can be in the year 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.420
 through the scenery we cut here 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.209
 see 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.590
 that is used very often you can 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.720
 But campell on but make the fighting 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.739
 are really very simple and what we 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.510
 just got his head 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.840
 lost 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.400
 that is, serves as the living of the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.320
 Heroes can because different heads 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.340
 have up to 3 and can change 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.989
 can also use it 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.459
 You can then like here to 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.829
 example octopus revive gets a few 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.739
 points or there are then bonuslevels the 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.900
 to make one so obvious is one 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.030
 very nice idea 100 different 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.500
 Heads are there yes a lot of man play 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.150
 there is also this replay value 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.180
 that one then with different minds 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.650
 comes back to the old level and 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.150
 then redone special bonus levels 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.400
 can or you get too 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.350
 abilities that one has just this 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.180
 hook it on and then you can 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.250
 certain regions of the proposals 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.500
 not by the way had the boss fight 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.510
 have seen that for me one of the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.160
 biggest weaknesses I say 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.920
 quotes of the game because the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.340
 are pretty formulaic the three dogs 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.170
 therefore do not make the best of it 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.780
 thing complicates but I think it's great 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.829
 how the audience goes 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.690
 that is very different than here at 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.579
 our sound about this here always 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.230
 we had great I can do it the 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.060
 Puppeteer only recommend as 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.459
 I was very creative 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.019
 fun to play for me one of the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.870
 highlights still on the playstation 3 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.270
 before she goes the earthly way all the way 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.360
 must see 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.610
 my story is trying since you 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.880
 you really do not fool yourself 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.880
 Keep it all different
