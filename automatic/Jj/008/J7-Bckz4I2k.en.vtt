it's going to have very little impact
yes<00:00:26.900> there<00:00:27.140> will<00:00:27.200> be<00:00:27.260> lots<00:00:27.500> more<00:00:27.590> streams

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
think that's going to affect the service

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.930 
think that's going to affect the service
at<00:00:32.239> all<00:00:32.360> of<00:00:32.570> course<00:00:32.989> time<00:00:33.470> will<00:00:33.710> tell<00:00:33.940> there's

pc i honestly believe this is going to

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.300 
pc i honestly believe this is going to
be<00:01:04.999> a<00:01:05.030> huge<00:01:05.479> boom<00:01:05.840> of<00:01:06.109> the<00:01:06.200> industry<00:01:06.679> live

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310

for<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.869> past<00:01:09.109> year<00:01:09.829> and<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.009> half<00:01:10.219> is

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
for the past year and a half is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.489 
for the past year and a half is
absolutely<00:01:11.479> massive<00:01:11.749> but<00:01:12.020> i<00:01:12.079> think<00:01:12.259> this<00:01:12.380> will

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:12.499 
absolutely massive but i think this will

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:14.949 
absolutely massive but i think this will
solidify<00:01:12.709> streaming<00:01:13.670> as<00:01:13.819> a<00:01:13.850> legitimate<00:01:14.569> form

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
just trying to start stream because

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.490 
just trying to start stream because
you're<00:01:41.060> stuck<00:01:41.300> in<00:01:41.330> a<00:01:41.510> sea<00:01:41.570> of<00:01:41.840> people<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.380> are

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
you're stuck in a sea of people that are

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.800 
you're stuck in a sea of people that are
streaming<00:01:42.740> from<00:01:42.980> consoles<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:43.700> getting<00:01:44.690> your

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
streaming from consoles and getting your

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.290 
streaming from consoles and getting your
first<00:01:44.960> five<00:01:45.260> years<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:45.740> getting<00:01:45.980> out<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:47.180> that

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
first five years and getting out of that

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.240 
first five years and getting out of that
ocean<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:48.050> zero<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.620> your<00:01:48.740> strain<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.040> going<00:01:49.160> to

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
ocean of zero of your strain is going to

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.030 
ocean of zero of your strain is going to
be<00:01:49.310> very<00:01:49.340> difficult

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
be very difficult

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.070 
be very difficult
though<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.730> do<00:01:51.910> believe<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.360> opportunity<00:01:52.930> for

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
though I do believe the opportunity for

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.710 
though I do believe the opportunity for
long-term<00:01:53.260> success<00:01:54.070> will<00:01:54.790> be<00:01:54.940> much<00:01:55.270> higher

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
long-term success will be much higher

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.530 
long-term success will be much higher
for<00:01:56.110> streamers<00:01:56.650> because<00:01:57.190> of<00:01:57.340> this<00:01:57.490> i<00:01:57.700> think<00:01:58.390> it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
for streamers because of this i think it

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.760 
for streamers because of this i think it
was<00:01:58.600> really<00:01:58.780> inevitable<00:01:59.230> that<00:01:59.350> streaming<00:01:59.710> is

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
was really inevitable that streaming is

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.410 
was really inevitable that streaming is
going<00:01:59.890> to<00:01:59.950> gain<00:02:00.100> popularity<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.270> more

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
going to gain popularity and the more

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.670 
going to gain popularity and the more
people<00:02:01.630> are<00:02:01.720> trying<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:02.020> do<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.200> same<00:02:02.410> thing

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
people are trying to do the same thing

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.550 
people are trying to do the same thing
the<00:02:02.860> harder<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.280> will<00:02:03.340> be<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.730> succeed<00:02:04.300> at<00:02:04.480> it

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the harder it will be to succeed at it

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.440 
the harder it will be to succeed at it
that<00:02:05.560> being<00:02:05.860> said<00:02:06.130> more<00:02:06.790> people<00:02:07.000> being<00:02:07.150> aware

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
that being said more people being aware

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.389 
that being said more people being aware
of<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.720> service<00:02:08.020> provides<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.740> stand<00:02:09.130> out

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
of the service provides you to stand out

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.670 
of the service provides you to stand out
and<00:02:09.700> if<00:02:09.790> you<00:02:09.880> can<00:02:10.119> stand<00:02:10.390> out<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:11.170> opportunity

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
and if you can stand out the opportunity

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.770 
and if you can stand out the opportunity
for<00:02:11.710> long-term<00:02:11.920> success<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.730> better<00:02:13.540> than

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
for long-term success is better than

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.020 
for long-term success is better than
ever<00:02:13.960> so<00:02:14.860> overall<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.250> think<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.820> next

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
ever so overall I think the next

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.790 
ever so overall I think the next
generation<00:02:16.570> consoles<00:02:16.960> having<00:02:17.440> integrated

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
generation consoles having integrated

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.080 
generation consoles having integrated
streaming<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.400> going<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.640> be<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.760> very<00:02:19.030> good

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
streaming is going to be a very good

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.210 
streaming is going to be a very good
thing<00:02:19.240> for<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.630> site<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.050> broadcasters<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:21.190> a

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
thing for the site and broadcasters as a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.030 
thing for the site and broadcasters as a
whole<00:02:21.540> but<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.630> will<00:02:22.750> become<00:02:23.050> harder<00:02:23.320> that's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
whole but it will become harder that's

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.530 
whole but it will become harder that's
all<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.280> got<00:02:24.400> on<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.580> subject<00:02:24.910> thanks<00:02:25.420> for
