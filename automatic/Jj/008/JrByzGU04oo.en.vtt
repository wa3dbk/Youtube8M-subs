00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.350 
because frankly there's already been way
too<00:01:55.590> much<00:01:55.890> math<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.490> review<00:01:56.790> all<00:01:57.149> I'm

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
too much math in this review all I'm

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.749 
too much math in this review all I'm
saying<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.710> have<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.340> that's

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
saying is you have that that's that's

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:10.430 
saying is you have that that's that's
poopy<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.560> five-year-olds<00:02:01.560> no<00:02:01.710> poopy

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.980 

so<00:02:11.440> quantity<00:02:12.310> aside<00:02:12.670> what<00:02:13.390> are<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.600> minigames

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
so quantity aside what are the minigames

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.980 
so quantity aside what are the minigames
entail<00:02:14.500> well<00:02:15.480> sometimes<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.600> get<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.810> match

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
entail well sometimes you get to match

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.500 
entail well sometimes you get to match
stuff<00:02:17.350> other<00:02:17.890> times<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.400> get<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.550> trace<00:02:19.150> stuff

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
stuff other times you get to trace stuff

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.540 
stuff other times you get to trace stuff
and<00:02:19.810> sometimes<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.590> get<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.860> scream<00:02:21.220> stuff

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
and sometimes you get to scream stuff

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.240
