 in addition to putting on glasses 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.920
 it's super impressive anyway 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.359

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.700

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.019
 that others were shouting the music was 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.340
 done in relation to the cm level in general 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.230
 the trumpet when she rides her 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.579
 goes down gently moves 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.620
 of the carpet maybe they did a 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.620
 simple visit to brazil a man is 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.959
 dead so that it sticks better with the game 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.799
 moving the carpet so suddenly I 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.980
 withdrew me with this and after at the time of 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.230
 by heart but in general for all who 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.849
 slalom among others that precisely I 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.989
 I rely on this instrument 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.900

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.180
 which is flat falls it's about music 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.500
 on elements and these are the 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.689
 sound cues that you can get the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.280
