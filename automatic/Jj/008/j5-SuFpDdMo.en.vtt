00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.010
 hello vinyl friends and fishing line in this 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.180
 trick we will teach you how to ride the 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:18.500
 art to fish the technique of the thick 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.970
 for this we need the thread a hook 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 where later we will hook the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.980
 vinyl and a special lead for fishing 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.060
 of the bear 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.060
 the first thing we have to do 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.039
 empathize on a floor 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.570
 for this we put it here 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.250
 we leave a distance that we want to 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.000
 that the distance that the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.000
 lead from the hook 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.359
 we just need to do 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.550
 this yarn crossing 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.690
 you know we have the crossing 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.510
 simply 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.510
 we have to go around like this 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.470
 we will do about six or seven laps 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.760
 that we already have these laps 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.420
 the hook 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.420
 here 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.680
 just stuck 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.340
 we think 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.340
 the knot 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.860
 and we can see that the bulls are 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.960
 they are looking up 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.080
 Well now we just need 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.380
 until the lead to the tip of the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.799
 line 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.250
 for this we put the thread through the hole 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.250
 of lead 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.140
 six or seven turns to the line 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.819
 we put 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.819
 the thread for the game that we have left 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.170
 we have the thread 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.120
 this form 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:45.299
 we have the lead all the line 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.299
 and the hook ready to put the vinyl
