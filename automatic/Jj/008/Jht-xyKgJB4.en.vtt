00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello everyone, hello to all 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.620
 as you can see I returned to this mine 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.530
 old channel that you are familiar 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.210
 but I am a novelty already has me now 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.240
 I'm opening a new channel where I cast 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.580
 together with my uncle he did it but this 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.470
 not and had to Valencian ministers 0 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 and yes I started planning the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.230
 playlist tutorials but the intention of 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.630
 to continue 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.880
 I made so many videos with you and the new one 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.940
 channel how many kids we've been through 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.640
 thank you perhaps these inscriptions but but 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.890
 let's leave with the past here is the future 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.629
 the new channel after the canal 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.399
 essentially put you turn on 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.460
 in fact your attention is extreme 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.730
 video and for now let's start on two games 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.440
 heroes of new york and starcraft 2 the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.629
 new channel will be immediately organized 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.910
 very well it is divided into playlists that 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.270
 new themes will follow 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.690
 here we begin immediately with the first 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.300
 playlist dedicated to reds on the web 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.250
 we have a replay 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.869
 unfortunately they are mine is not yet one 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.820
 of yours for this I will tend and come 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.380
 give a taste, however, would say the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.509
 response of this fight decidedly 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.110
 negative to make appearance are 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.299
 news coming up and with the first shot you have 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.479
 seen what was taken out of the cia gave him a 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.150
 finally more internal kiss between 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:35.759
 barbed lakes boat of the useless lava 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:41.610
 because I accept it from 449 was the film 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.110
 for science it has not done in time and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.100
 to view this is what 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.479
 I mean when I talk about me as you see 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.880
 the time and video are done much better 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.860
 I'm doing music audio 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.780
 hard this tub but let's move on to 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.250
 second apprentice of the sports channel 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.810
 live of heroes of new york not one 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.000
 first for those of us is 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.130
 English is here in Italian of where skin 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.400
 with a first fill 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.500
 this skill does damage and I say 80 damage 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.119
 per second and reduces fairy tales by months 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.470
 when you fear the scout's turn 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.010
 by 32 percent 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.570
 and it lasts five seconds we see the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.970
 first ski nexus s roy that as you see 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:26.080
 reducing aromatic if outside the area 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.930
 but also the magic dice because this is 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.840
 the navy flag of his style 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.780
 now we see it applied against the gand 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.420
 west in this scene we also see that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.130
 sings the end slowed highlighted 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.040
 at the top right of the skill between would be 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.840
 the third passive skill that shortly that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.350
 slow down, now we're the second 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.570
 skill that the earth forms which is a den 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.670
 which I say by dissecting the rabbit part 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.180
 of the map you enjoy transporting from 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.610
 a woman had a tender one 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.350
 useful among pd videos we will strive to 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.239
 show you all the videos of the heroes but 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.450
 they will not come out and we will slowly try to 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.549
 recover all the videos of the old heroes 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.769
 but here we go to the playlist of 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.170
 our dear starcraft videos I don't have 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.260
 let go at the strong point and wait 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:19.120
 obviously that is not sent you wanted 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:26.430
 Ing knows well, it is a well-known marine encounter 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.959
 good move yet we will have to see if 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.420
 will be able to place as many as 1000 against 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.700
 marine because it falls apart inside 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.700
 case they will take love 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.209
 if beautiful thrown in a little at random is 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:48.890
 went well because it was more 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:51.300
 it was in numerical advantage but we are there 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.890
 here is this video that surely will you 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.989
 will be the very familiar result 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.640
 in fact I initially worked only on 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.140
 these but the novelty is that I have now 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.540
 going to make you videos well 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.730

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.650
 I will use whose pedia I show you 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.750

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.150
 detailed of the operations and then the 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.859
 key point remove bild to use 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.359

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.150
