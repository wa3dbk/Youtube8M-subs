okay<00:00:01.680> we<00:00:02.490> put<00:00:02.700> some<00:00:02.879> more<00:00:03.030> solution<00:00:03.540> in<00:00:04.160> now

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
okay we put some more solution in now

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.450 
okay we put some more solution in now
we're<00:00:05.310> just<00:00:05.400> gonna<00:00:05.580> dump<00:00:05.819> in<00:00:07.220> where<00:00:08.220> are<00:00:08.309> these

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
we're just gonna dump in where are these

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.360 
we're just gonna dump in where are these
make<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.000> squirt<00:00:09.360> cans<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:10.099> think<00:00:11.099> there's<00:00:11.280> a

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
make the squirt cans I think there's a

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.499 
make the squirt cans I think there's a

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
dr. pepper

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.089

Diet<00:00:12.750> Coke<00:00:12.870> might<00:00:13.290> give<00:00:13.679> us<00:00:13.799> some<00:00:13.980> good

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
Diet Coke might give us some good

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:51.810 
Diet Coke might give us some good
success

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.619 

these<00:00:52.329> are<00:00:52.539> sealed<00:00:54.030> yeah<00:00:55.030> absolutely<00:00:55.149> up

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
these are sealed yeah absolutely up

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.910 
these are sealed yeah absolutely up
pressure<00:00:55.930> going<00:00:56.260> up<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:59.230> we<00:00:59.379> should<00:00:59.649> see

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
pressure going up what we should see

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.440 
pressure going up what we should see
happen<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:00.730> that<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.549> know<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.299> outer

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
happen is that as you know the the outer

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.930 
happen is that as you know the the outer
layer<00:01:07.780> of<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:08.280> crap<00:01:09.280> that's<00:01:09.460> on<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.789> aluminum

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940

gets<00:01:10.630> eaten<00:01:10.810> off<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:12.310> should<00:01:12.340> see<00:01:12.729> a<00:01:12.759> more

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
gets eaten off we should see a more

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.620 
gets eaten off we should see a more
rapid<00:01:13.539> increase<00:01:14.440> of<00:01:14.470> gas<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:19.000> about<00:01:19.299> nine

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
rapid increase of gas it's about nine

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.569 
rapid increase of gas it's about nine
now

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:28.440 

okay<00:01:23.090> where's<00:01:23.270> our<00:01:23.420> spark<00:01:23.689> nur<00:01:26.469> Thanks

ourselves

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:11.440 

I'm<00:02:03.400> holding<00:02:03.820> at<00:02:03.910> 15<00:02:04.330> pounds<00:02:04.570> right<00:02:04.930> now

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.850 

I'm<00:02:11.690> not<00:02:11.810> sure<00:02:12.050> we're<00:02:12.290> gonna<00:02:12.440> put<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:12.739> about

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
I'm not sure we're gonna put in about

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.750 
I'm not sure we're gonna put in about
six<00:02:13.610> camps

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
six camps

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.089 
six camps
yeah<00:02:17.540> now<00:02:18.540> I'm<00:02:18.659> dropping<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.140> way<00:02:19.230> off<00:02:19.439> my

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
yeah now I'm dropping the way off my

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.360 
yeah now I'm dropping the way off my
pressure<00:02:24.290> snows<00:02:25.290> interesting<00:02:25.890> why<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.099> drop

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
pressure snows interesting why the drop

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.580 
pressure snows interesting why the drop
so<00:02:26.610> fast<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:30.090> holding<00:02:30.510> at<00:02:30.810> about<00:02:31.049> two<00:02:31.379> and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
so fast so it's holding at about two and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.720 
so fast so it's holding at about two and
a<00:02:31.680> half<00:02:31.709> right<00:02:32.190> now

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.210 

playing<00:02:40.330> feel<00:02:40.599> I<00:02:40.870> feel<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.530> cannons<00:02:41.920> actually

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
playing feel I feel the cannons actually

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.920 
playing feel I feel the cannons actually
moving<00:02:42.400> around<00:02:42.550> in<00:02:42.849> there<00:02:45.690> that's<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.780> next

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
moving around in there that's the next

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.530 
moving around in there that's the next
point<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.680> can<00:02:47.860> see<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.250> waters<00:02:48.610> getting<00:02:49.390> a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
point you can see the waters getting a

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.160 
point you can see the waters getting a
little<00:02:49.690> important<00:02:50.440> dirty<00:02:51.370> because<00:02:52.170> we're

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
little important dirty because we're

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.330 
little important dirty because we're
getting<00:02:53.379> more<00:02:53.590> movement<00:02:54.299> faster<00:02:55.299> reaction

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
getting more movement faster reaction

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.699 
getting more movement faster reaction
I'm<00:02:57.340> actually<00:02:57.870> it's<00:02:58.870> interesting<00:02:59.170> how<00:02:59.530> it's

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
I'm actually it's interesting how it's

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.199 
I'm actually it's interesting how it's
jumping<00:03:00.040> around<00:03:00.160> now<00:03:00.519> it's<00:03:00.730> jumping<00:03:01.090> between

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
jumping around now it's jumping between

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.300 
jumping around now it's jumping between
three<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.720> five<00:03:02.049> thread<00:03:02.470> pounds<00:03:02.980> just<00:03:03.220> a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
three and five thread pounds just a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.140 
three and five thread pounds just a
little<00:03:03.610> after<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.799> there's<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.819> lot<00:03:07.000> of

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
little after this so there's a lot of

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:15.850 
little after this so there's a lot of
 okay<00:03:07.599> that's<00:03:07.840> up<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.170> seven<00:03:08.530> now

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.130 

and<00:03:16.120> probably<00:03:17.120> just<00:03:17.270> different<00:03:17.570> crap<00:03:17.900> that's

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
and probably just different crap that's

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.590 
and probably just different crap that's
coming<00:03:18.440> through<00:03:18.590> its<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.070> flop<00:03:19.730> 30<00:03:20.120> Goebbels

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
and see the reactions pretty aggressive

and see the reactions pretty aggressive

Oh

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039
