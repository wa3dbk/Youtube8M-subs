now<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.910> can<00:03:01.150> find<00:03:01.420> lenses<00:03:01.990> that<00:03:02.500> have<00:03:02.710> macro

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
now you can find lenses that have macro

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.700 
now you can find lenses that have macro
features<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.420> can<00:03:04.570> also<00:03:04.720> find<00:03:05.110> cameras

into<00:03:10.300> it

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
into it

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.080

but<00:03:11.050> none<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.410> those<00:03:11.560> are<00:03:11.830> true<00:03:12.100> macros<00:03:12.760> those

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.780 
but none of those are true macros those
usually<00:03:13.540> have<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.720> reproduction<00:03:14.410> ratio<00:03:15.010> of<00:03:15.220> one

usually have a reproduction ratio of one
to<00:03:16.030> two<00:03:16.360> or<00:03:16.690> maybe<00:03:17.200> even<00:03:17.380> one<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:17.980> three

to two or maybe even one to three

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.390 
to two or maybe even one to three
because<00:03:18.580> your<00:03:18.910> average<00:03:19.150> is<00:03:19.690> one<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.500> four<00:03:20.530> so

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
because your average is one to four so

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.280 
because your average is one to four so
these<00:03:21.610> features<00:03:22.090> well<00:03:22.390> they<00:03:22.540> do<00:03:22.600> allow<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.020> to

macro modes and macro lens features are

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.760 
macro modes and macro lens features are
typically<00:03:40.630> accessed<00:03:41.170> by<00:03:41.320> flipping<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.739> switch

or turning a multi on to macro mode and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.840 
or turning a multi on to macro mode and
what<00:03:45.459> they<00:03:45.640> do<00:03:45.700> is<00:03:46.300> they<00:03:46.870> expand<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:48.160> focusing

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
what they do is they expand the focusing

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.600 
what they do is they expand the focusing
range<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:49.720> camera<00:03:50.200> how<00:03:50.680> that's<00:03:50.920> done<00:03:51.250> is

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
range of the camera how that's done is

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.720 
range of the camera how that's done is
an<00:03:52.090> expansion<00:03:52.660> of<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.900> actual<00:03:53.410> ability<00:03:53.980> to

the<00:04:32.170> focusing<00:04:32.710> ring<00:04:32.890> will<00:04:33.400> allow<00:04:33.580> me<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.880> get

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
the focusing ring will allow me to get

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.420 
the focusing ring will allow me to get
closer<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.630> subject<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:36.070> closeness

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
closer to a subject and that closeness

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.150 
closer to a subject and that closeness
would<00:04:37.240> increase<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.900> magnification<00:04:38.260> factor

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
would increase the magnification factor

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.490 
would increase the magnification factor
so<00:04:39.790> instead<00:04:40.180> of<00:04:40.300> being<00:04:40.540> one<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:41.020> four<00:04:41.260> point

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
so instead of being one to four point

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.130 
so instead of being one to four point
five<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:42.130> might<00:04:42.580> increase<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.120> one<00:04:43.480> point<00:04:43.810> one

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
five it might increase the one point one

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.320 
five it might increase the one point one
to<00:04:44.350> two<00:04:44.560> so<00:04:45.160> while<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.430> macro<00:04:45.760> features<00:04:46.150> might

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
to two so while the macro features might

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.960 
to two so while the macro features might
be<00:04:46.480> handy<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.900> have<00:04:47.080> it's<00:04:47.620> not<00:04:47.890> true<00:04:48.220> macro<00:04:48.760> if

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
be handy to have it's not true macro if

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.850 
be handy to have it's not true macro if
you<00:04:49.240> want<00:04:49.420> a<00:04:49.480> true<00:04:49.720> macro<00:04:50.170> lens<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.590> need<00:04:50.740> to
