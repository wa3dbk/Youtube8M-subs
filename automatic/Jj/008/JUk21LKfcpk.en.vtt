would<00:02:17.960> not<00:02:18.200> leave<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.680> gap<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.750> would

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
would not leave that gap so I would

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.400 
would not leave that gap so I would
still<00:02:21.380> do<00:02:21.530> everything<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.130> same<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:23.410> would

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
still do everything the same I would

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.850 
still do everything the same I would
take<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.830> form<00:02:28.810> put<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:30.050> down

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
take the form put that down

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:39.580 
take the form put that down
rip<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:35.230> pinch<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:37.870> then<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:39.110> would<00:02:39.290> put<00:02:39.470> my

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
rip it pinch it and then I would put my

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.680 
rip it pinch it and then I would put my
finger<00:02:39.980> in<00:02:40.190> for<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.000> clients<00:02:41.390> finger

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
finger in for the clients finger

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.810 
finger in for the clients finger
depending<00:02:44.320> slide<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.500> right<00:02:45.530> up<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.070> that<00:02:46.100> so

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
depending slide it right up to that so

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.530 
depending slide it right up to that so
that<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.240> nail<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.900> actually<00:02:48.410> over<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.980> and

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
that the nail is actually over it and

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.610 
that the nail is actually over it and
then<00:02:50.540> I'm<00:02:50.690> going<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.930> make<00:02:51.080> sure<00:02:51.110> it's<00:02:51.380> lined

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
then I'm going to make sure it's lined

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.710 
then I'm going to make sure it's lined
up<00:02:51.860> so<00:02:52.070> that<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.430> middle<00:02:52.730> line<00:02:52.910> is<00:02:53.209> straight

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
up so that the middle line is straight

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.290 
up so that the middle line is straight
on<00:02:53.990> my<00:02:54.170> nail<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.760> guys<00:02:55.850> can<00:02:56.090> see<00:02:56.270> that

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
on my nail so you guys can see that

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.960 
on my nail so you guys can see that
pinch<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.410> sides<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.160> then<00:02:58.340> bring<00:02:58.580> over<00:02:58.730> the

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
pinch the sides and then bring over the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.290 
pinch the sides and then bring over the
wings<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.800> then<00:03:00.800> if<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.160> need<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.490> adjust<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:02.030> I

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
wings and then if I need to adjust it I

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.150 
wings and then if I need to adjust it I
would<00:03:02.570> stick<00:03:02.900> my<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:06.440> can<00:03:06.590> use<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.709> dotting

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
would stick my you can use a dotting

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.890 
would stick my you can use a dotting
tool<00:03:07.190> or<00:03:07.640> your<00:03:07.760> brush<00:03:08.000> whatever<00:03:08.240> and<00:03:08.690> just

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
tool or your brush whatever and just

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.080 
tool or your brush whatever and just
push<00:03:09.080> that<00:03:09.290> up<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.800> then<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.580> gives<00:03:10.760> you

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
push that up and then that gives you

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.640 
push that up and then that gives you
your<00:03:11.420> base<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:12.020> put<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.410> apply<00:03:12.800> it<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:15.170> then

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
your base to put it apply it and then

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.199 
your base to put it apply it and then
depending<00:03:16.010> what<00:03:16.310> shape<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:16.730> want<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.030> can

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
depending what shape you want you can

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.370 
depending what shape you want you can
pinch<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.630> more<00:03:17.810> for<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:18.080> stiletto<00:03:18.610> or<00:03:20.200> leave<00:03:21.200> it

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
pinch it more for a stiletto or leave it

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.150 
pinch it more for a stiletto or leave it
the<00:03:21.500> tip<00:03:21.709> wider<00:03:23.290> but<00:03:24.290> that's<00:03:24.500> basically<00:03:24.950> it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
the tip wider but that's basically it

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.410 
the tip wider but that's basically it
and<00:03:25.190> then<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.430> would<00:03:25.640> just<00:03:25.820> go<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.060> and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
and then I would just go in and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.080 
and then I would just go in and
reinforce<00:03:27.350> it<00:03:27.410> on<00:03:27.709> my<00:03:27.860> finger<00:03:28.220> like<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:31.090> so

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
reinforce it on my finger like that so

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.610 
reinforce it on my finger like that so
I'll<00:03:32.540> go<00:03:32.810> ahead<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.110> show<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.320> what<00:03:33.500> the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
I'll go ahead and show you what the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.460 
I'll go ahead and show you what the
other<00:03:33.739> form<00:03:34.130> it's<00:03:34.459> exactly<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.030> same<00:03:35.239> thing

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.410 

so<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.500> just<00:03:39.830> take<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.190> form<00:03:41.530> peel<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.680> off<00:03:43.420> take

that on there I'm gonna secure it at the
sides<00:04:10.450> first<00:04:11.550> making<00:04:12.550> sure<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.970> keep<00:04:13.120> this

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
sides first making sure to keep this

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:21.000 
sides first making sure to keep this
straight<00:04:16.890> and<00:04:18.750> then<00:04:19.750> one<00:04:20.049> wing<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:20.709> then<00:04:20.890> the

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
use that to push it up and then

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.720 
use that to push it up and then
reinforce<00:04:31.780> it<00:04:32.020> now<00:04:32.950> these<00:04:33.130> ones<00:04:33.400> because

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
reinforce it now these ones because

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.900 
reinforce it now these ones because
they're<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:33.910> little<00:04:34.090> bit<00:04:34.330> wider<00:04:35.670> they<00:04:36.670> usually

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
they're a little bit wider they usually

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.790 
they're a little bit wider they usually
leave<00:04:37.390> a<00:04:37.420> funny<00:04:37.750> little<00:04:37.930> gap<00:04:38.260> so<00:04:38.470> I<00:04:38.500> kind<00:04:38.740> of

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
leave a funny little gap so I kind of

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.180 
leave a funny little gap so I kind of
have<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.100> fiddle<00:04:39.520> with<00:04:39.790> it<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.950> sometimes<00:04:41.950> you

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
have to fiddle with it and sometimes you

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.760 
have to fiddle with it and sometimes you
do<00:04:42.400> have<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.700> take<00:04:42.850> this<00:04:42.910> off<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.690> on<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:46.770> then

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
do have to take this off and on and then

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.860 
do have to take this off and on and then
again<00:04:47.950> if<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:48.400> look<00:04:48.640> there<00:04:48.970> is<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.180> tiny<00:04:51.870> tiny

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
again if you look there is a tiny tiny

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.660 
again if you look there is a tiny tiny
little<00:04:53.050> gap<00:04:53.530> right<00:04:54.510> here<00:04:56.100> but<00:04:57.100> again<00:04:57.430> for

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
little gap right here but again for

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.280 
little gap right here but again for
practicing<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.420> don't<00:04:58.630> worry<00:04:58.810> too<00:04:59.050> much<00:04:59.080> about

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
practicing I don't worry too much about

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.130 
practicing I don't worry too much about
that<00:04:59.590> I<00:05:00.010> would<00:05:00.220> just<00:05:00.460> put<00:05:00.880> my<00:05:01.060> nail<00:05:01.330> bed<00:05:01.570> on<00:05:01.780> and

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
that I would just put my nail bed on and

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.770 
that I would just put my nail bed on and
bring<00:05:03.070> it<00:05:03.190> up<00:05:03.310> past<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.180> then<00:05:04.390> work<00:05:04.600> from

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
bring it up past that and then work from

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.890 
bring it up past that and then work from
there<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:06.760> then<00:05:07.090> again<00:05:07.300> if<00:05:07.450> I<00:05:07.510> was<00:05:07.660> applying

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
there and then again if I was applying

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.680 
there and then again if I was applying
that<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.740> myself<00:05:09.070> or<00:05:09.730> a<00:05:09.760> client<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.390> would<00:05:10.450> do

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
that to myself or a client I would do

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.590 
that to myself or a client I would do
exactly<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:11.230> same<00:05:11.260> thing<00:05:12.240> pull<00:05:13.240> off<00:05:13.419> the

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
exactly the same thing pull off the

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.300 
exactly the same thing pull off the
center<00:05:16.470> place<00:05:17.470> it<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:17.860> reinforce<00:05:18.300> open<00:05:19.300> that

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
center place it to reinforce open that

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.649 
center place it to reinforce open that
so<00:05:21.310> I<00:05:21.370> just<00:05:21.550> ripped<00:05:21.760> it<00:05:21.850> along<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.240> line

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.879 

pinched<00:05:26.229> my<00:05:26.439> two<00:05:26.499> sides<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:28.499> then<00:05:29.499> I<00:05:29.529> would

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
pinched my two sides and then I would

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.619 
pinched my two sides and then I would
put<00:05:30.129> it<00:05:30.669> on<00:05:30.879> the<00:05:31.119> nail<00:05:33.179> reinforcing<00:05:34.179> the<00:05:34.330> sides

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 
put it on the nail reinforcing the sides

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.379 
put it on the nail reinforcing the sides
and<00:05:35.259> I'm<00:05:35.740> making<00:05:35.919> sure<00:05:36.279> that<00:05:36.520> this<00:05:36.669> centerline

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
and I'm making sure that this centerline

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.929 
and I'm making sure that this centerline
is<00:05:37.770> lined<00:05:38.770> up<00:05:38.889> with<00:05:38.949> the<00:05:39.159> center<00:05:39.189> of<00:05:39.520> my<00:05:39.729> nail

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:39.939 
is lined up with the center of my nail

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.749 
is lined up with the center of my nail
and<00:05:40.439> then<00:05:41.439> I'll<00:05:41.559> push<00:05:41.740> over<00:05:42.009> one<00:05:42.219> wing<00:05:42.459> and

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
and then I'll push over one wing and

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.760 
and then I'll push over one wing and
then<00:05:42.909> the<00:05:42.999> other<00:05:43.179> and<00:05:43.539> then<00:05:43.749> if<00:05:43.990> I<00:05:44.169> have<00:05:44.379> that

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
then the other and then if I have that

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.889 
then the other and then if I have that
little<00:05:45.129> gap<00:05:45.429> right<00:05:45.669> there<00:05:45.939> I'm<00:05:46.599> just<00:05:46.749> gonna

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:46.899 
little gap right there I'm just gonna

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:51.029 
little gap right there I'm just gonna
take<00:05:47.169> my<00:05:47.199> brush<00:05:48.389> and<00:05:49.389> push<00:05:50.319> that<00:05:50.499> up<00:05:50.679> slightly

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
take my brush and push that up slightly

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.059 
take my brush and push that up slightly
and<00:05:51.490> then<00:05:52.360> once<00:05:52.599> that's<00:05:52.809> done<00:05:53.020> I'll<00:05:53.379> secure<00:05:53.919> it

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
and then once that's done I'll secure it

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:56.999 
and then once that's done I'll secure it
down<00:05:54.099> here<00:05:54.550> at<00:05:54.639> the<00:05:54.759> bottom<00:05:54.849> as<00:05:55.179> well<00:05:55.800> so<00:05:56.800> and

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
down here at the bottom as well so and

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.439 
down here at the bottom as well so and
then<00:05:57.129> if<00:05:57.249> I<00:05:57.369> want<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:57.639> stiletto<00:05:57.969> again<00:05:58.300> I'll

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
then if I want to stiletto again I'll

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.639 
then if I want to stiletto again I'll
just<00:05:58.479> pinch<00:05:58.899> it<00:05:59.050> more<00:06:00.240> and<00:06:01.439> then<00:06:02.439> just

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:02.649 
just pinch it more and then just

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:05.670 
just pinch it more and then just
reinforce<00:06:03.189> it<00:06:03.749> and<00:06:04.749> then<00:06:05.110> you're<00:06:05.229> ready<00:06:05.379> to<00:06:05.559> go
