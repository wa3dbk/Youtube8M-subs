00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.810
 a delicious piece of meat is always 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.210
 a highlight 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.830
 I'm luigi carola and show you something 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.469
 you should consider when frying if 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.240
 I respect the meat myself 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.840
 I advocate against the fiber 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.730
 to cut 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.190
 then the meat stays with you later 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.410
 I like to cook schnitzel 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.000
 I cut in the so-called 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.279
 butterfly cut for that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.990
 schnitzel equals twice as big 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.269
 It is important that the carve it 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.320
 meat is knocked over before frying 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.060
 to make it crumbly 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.070
 I give a freezer bag over it 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.570
 so that no meat hanging on mallet 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.860
 remains 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.440
 careful tap the meat 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.820
 but does not destroy the phase also thin 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.950
 chicken breast slices of veal schnitzel 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.960
 slices and beef for roulades 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.100
 should cook on this way on the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.050
 to get prepared 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.879
 back to the schnitzel the oil in the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.739
 Pan must always be very hot first 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.629
 then the schnitzel come in 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.160
 breadcrumbs I move the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.530
 flag while roasting over and over again 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.829
 so spreads the fat better and the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.420
 uneven pany becomes evenly brown 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.250
 it is a special challenge 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.439
 Roast a whole duck or one 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.240
 chicken the duck I put in first 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.290
 a geese roast with a half 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.330
 liter of boiling water 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.979
 I'll leave you there for half an hour 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.710
 thinnest to solve the field 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.180
 then I give the duck at about 250 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.180
 degrees for 90 minutes in the oven 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.999
 so that she is nice juicy over pour 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.890
 I keep frying them up 

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:32.520
 they are appetizing golden brown and ready 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.520
 is fried 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.690
 also the chicken is first on the stove 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.310
 sautéed in the roasting pan 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.560
 but here i do not use water 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.580
 but margarine and leave it of both 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.580
 to clear rooms 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.730
 a bit of rosemary to it coming 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.590
 in the oven where it is at 180 ° 45 minutes 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.190
 long break and every now and then with bold 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.190
 is poured over 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.880
 because then it succeeds perfectly and will 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.880
 wonderfully tender and juicy 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.240
 I wish you much fun 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.240
 cooking and good appetite
