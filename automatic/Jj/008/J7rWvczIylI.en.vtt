00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
right now the main part of the upper

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
right now the main part of the upper
level<00:00:32.700> storm<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> north<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.750> us<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
level storm is to the north of us and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.170 
level storm is to the north of us and

back toward the west and southwest you
can<00:00:36.329> see<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> upper<00:00:37.380> level<00:00:37.620> storm<00:00:37.710> system

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
can see the upper level storm system

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.130 
can see the upper level storm system
that<00:00:38.280> has<00:00:38.579> cut<00:00:38.910> off<00:00:39.180> from<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> main<00:00:39.750> jet

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
that has cut off from the main jet

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.690 
that has cut off from the main jet
stream<00:00:40.440> making<00:00:40.739> its<00:00:40.860> way<00:00:40.920> across<00:00:41.100> parts<00:00:41.640> of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
stream making its way across parts of

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.490 
stream making its way across parts of
California<00:00:41.969> that's<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.290> we're

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
California that's the one we're

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.049 
California that's the one we're
interested<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:44.129> because<00:00:44.430> right<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:45.000> looks

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
interested in because right now it looks

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.060 
interested in because right now it looks
like<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.600> storm<00:00:45.870> system<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> take

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
like that storm system is going to take

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.650 
like that storm system is going to take
a<00:00:47.100> curl<00:00:47.460> down<00:00:47.640> toward<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> south<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.600> then

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
a curl down toward the south and then

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479 
a curl down toward the south and then
move<00:00:48.899> its<00:00:49.110> way<00:00:49.289> toward<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> high<00:00:49.950> plains<00:00:50.250> as

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
move its way toward the high plains as

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.700 
move its way toward the high plains as
we<00:00:50.969> head<00:00:51.149> toward<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.510> day<00:00:51.719> Saturday<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.500> on

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
we head toward the day Saturday and on

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
we head toward the day Saturday and on
Sunday<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.460> that's<00:00:53.940> different<00:00:54.480> than<00:00:54.570> what

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
Sunday and that's different than what

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.000 
Sunday and that's different than what
the<00:00:54.780> models<00:00:55.050> were<00:00:55.140> showing<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.590> couple<00:00:55.890> days

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the models were showing a couple days

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.250 
the models were showing a couple days
ago<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.460> over<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.699> last<00:00:56.910> 24<00:00:57.420> hours<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.870> had

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
ago and over the last 24 hours it had

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.959 
ago and over the last 24 hours it had
the<00:00:58.410> storm<00:00:58.649> system<00:00:58.800> coming<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.430> lot<00:00:59.579> slower

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the storm system coming in a lot slower

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.000 
the storm system coming in a lot slower
and<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.660> less<00:01:00.899> moisture<00:01:01.260> now<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> looks<00:01:01.859> like

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and with less moisture now it looks like

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.950 
and with less moisture now it looks like
more<00:01:02.370> moisture<00:01:02.910> more<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.449> headache

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
more moisture more of a headache

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.140 
more moisture more of a headache
possibly<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.040> area<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.729> head<00:01:05.880> toward

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
possibly for the area as we head toward

possibly for the area as we head toward
the<00:01:06.180> day<00:01:06.330> Saturday<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.380> Saturday<00:01:07.740> night

couple of days I'm going to put this in
motion<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.470> show<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> models<00:01:17.310> are

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
motion and show you what the models are

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.429 
motion and show you what the models are
indicating<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.509> forecast<00:01:18.990> track<00:01:19.200> you

high plains now if that does happen that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.060 
high plains now if that does happen that
might<00:02:03.060> mean<00:02:03.299> more<00:02:03.360> upper-level<00:02:04.170> dynamics<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
might mean more upper-level dynamics to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.399 
might mean more upper-level dynamics to
help<00:02:05.310> generate<00:02:05.759> more<00:02:06.060> snow<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.200> looks

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
help generate more snow and it looks

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.779 
help generate more snow and it looks
like<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> most<00:02:08.129> part<00:02:08.340> we're<00:02:08.610> going<00:02:08.729> to

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
like for the most part we're going to

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.580 
like for the most part we're going to
see<00:02:08.970> snow<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.509> farther<00:02:09.750> south<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.410> far

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
see snow but farther south and the far

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.470 
see snow but farther south and the far
southern<00:02:10.830> part<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.250> panhandle<00:02:11.819> down<00:02:12.270> into

the South Plains closer to love

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.010 
the South Plains closer to love
it<00:02:14.190> might<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.790> ice<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.300> some<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.660> ice<00:02:15.810> may

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
it might be ice and some of that ice may

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.900 
it might be ice and some of that ice may
accumulate<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.770> decent<00:02:17.430> amount<00:02:17.490> so<00:02:17.760> that's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
accumulate a decent amount so that's

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.070 
accumulate a decent amount so that's
something<00:02:18.150> we're<00:02:18.239> going<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.450> watch<00:02:18.660> carefully

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
something we're going to watch carefully

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.750 
something we're going to watch carefully
but<00:02:19.470> for<00:02:19.620> us<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.950> looks<00:02:20.130> like<00:02:20.310> prominently

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
but for us it looks like prominently

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.580 
but for us it looks like prominently
snow<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.209> even<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.020> might<00:02:22.110> be<00:02:22.290> quite<00:02:22.530> a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
snow but even then it might be quite a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.050 
snow but even then it might be quite a
bit<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.310> let's<00:02:23.550> show<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.760> what's<00:02:23.880> going<00:02:23.970> to

going to move off toward the east so by

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.210

time you get to Saturday afternoon you
notice<00:03:41.459> how<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.609> snow<00:03:41.880> is<00:03:42.030> kind<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.269> hanging

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
notice how the snow is kind of hanging

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
back toward the west farther toward the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.610 
back toward the west farther toward the
east<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.730> north<00:03:44.940> it's<00:03:45.510> more<00:03:45.750> dry<00:03:46.079> air<00:03:46.320> so<00:03:46.590> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
east and north it's more dry air so the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.560 
east and north it's more dry air so the
snow<00:03:46.950> has<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.310> overcome<00:03:47.609> that<00:03:47.970> dry<00:03:48.209> air<00:03:48.420> before

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
snow has to overcome that dry air before

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.420 
snow has to overcome that dry air before
it<00:03:48.780> does<00:03:48.930> start<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> fall<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.709> that's<00:03:50.160> going

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
it does start to fall and that's going

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.069 
it does start to fall and that's going
to<00:03:50.519> be<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.790> big<00:03:50.970> question<00:03:51.390> how<00:03:51.570> long<00:03:51.630> does<00:03:52.019> it

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
to be the big question how long does it

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.140 
to be the big question how long does it
dry<00:03:52.410> air<00:03:52.680> stick<00:03:52.980> around<00:03:53.250> if<00:03:53.519> it's<00:03:53.670> longer<00:03:53.970> than

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
dry air stick around if it's longer than

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.630 
dry air stick around if it's longer than
will<00:03:54.390> have<00:03:54.570> less<00:03:54.840> snow<00:03:55.109> but<00:03:55.350> if<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:56.070> dry<00:03:56.370> air

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
will have less snow but if that dry air

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.280 
will have less snow but if that dry air
vacates<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.180> premises<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.900> moisture<00:03:58.049> is

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
vacates the premises and the moisture is

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.259 
vacates the premises and the moisture is
able<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.620> move<00:03:58.769> in<00:03:58.980> faster<00:03:59.430> we<00:03:59.880> could<00:04:00.060> have

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
able to move in faster we could have

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.759 
able to move in faster we could have
more<00:04:00.480> snow<00:04:00.780> but<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.019> way<00:04:01.109> it<00:04:01.230> looks<00:04:01.410> right<00:04:01.470> now

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
more snow but the way it looks right now

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
night and on into Sunday as well

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.569 
night and on into Sunday as well
occasionally<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.590> dry<00:04:19.769> air<00:04:19.979> tries<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.370> come

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
occasionally the dry air tries to come

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.580 
occasionally the dry air tries to come
back<00:04:20.760> in<00:04:21.000> but<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.359> think<00:04:21.750> once<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.109> moisture<00:04:22.470> is

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
back in but I think once the moisture is

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.290 
back in but I think once the moisture is
here<00:04:22.860> it's<00:04:23.010> going<00:04:23.159> to<00:04:23.280> be<00:04:23.430> here<00:04:23.760> for<00:04:23.909> the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
here it's going to be here for the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.270 
here it's going to be here for the
duration<00:04:24.479> now<00:04:25.080> how<00:04:25.320> much<00:04:25.500> snow<00:04:25.650> we<00:04:25.919> talking

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
duration now how much snow we talking

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.629 
duration now how much snow we talking
about<00:04:26.490> well<00:04:26.700> let's<00:04:26.909> advance<00:04:27.210> one

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
about well let's advance one

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.369 
about well let's advance one
more<00:04:27.759> and<00:04:27.999> I'll<00:04:28.330> show<00:04:28.539> you<00:04:28.569> several<00:04:29.139> different

computer models indications of how much

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.659

snow we could see remember down farther
south<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.240> could<00:04:34.449> be<00:04:34.599> more<00:04:34.870> in<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.110> form<00:04:35.409> of

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
south it could be more in the form of

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.980 
south it could be more in the form of
some<00:04:36.249> ice<00:04:36.490> this<00:04:36.879> is<00:04:36.969> one<00:04:37.150> computer<00:04:37.569> model<00:04:37.870> will

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
farther south that could be around say

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.159

of<00:04:50.289> purple<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.740> see<00:04:50.979> here<00:04:51.219> that<00:04:51.249> could<00:04:51.520> be<00:04:51.669> in

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
of purple you see here that could be in

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.119 
of purple you see here that could be in
excess<00:04:52.419> of<00:04:52.569> six<00:04:52.840> inches<00:04:53.199> down<00:04:53.620> closer<00:04:53.979> to

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
loving that's one computer model now

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.080 
loving that's one computer model now
another<00:04:56.319> computer<00:04:56.800> model<00:04:57.039> shows<00:04:57.249> quite<00:04:58.029> a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
another computer model shows quite a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.820 
another computer model shows quite a
different<00:04:58.479> story<00:04:58.509> has<00:04:59.080> quite<00:04:59.469> a<00:04:59.499> bit<00:04:59.680> more

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
different story has quite a bit more

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.969 
different story has quite a bit more
snow<00:05:00.129> on<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.430> order<00:05:00.789> of<00:05:00.819> between<00:05:01.810> six<00:05:02.229> and<00:05:02.409> ten

snow on the order of between six and ten
inches<00:05:03.370> of<00:05:03.550> snow<00:05:03.819> I<00:05:04.060> think<00:05:04.509> this<00:05:04.569> is<00:05:04.629> a<00:05:04.750> bit

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
inches of snow I think this is a bit

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.170 
inches of snow I think this is a bit
overdone<00:05:05.529> but<00:05:05.590> if<00:05:05.949> we<00:05:06.159> do<00:05:06.430> happen<00:05:06.879> to<00:05:06.909> get<00:05:07.060> that

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
overdone but if we do happen to get that

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.480 
overdone but if we do happen to get that
upper<00:05:07.449> level<00:05:07.719> storm<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:08.500> track<00:05:08.800> just<00:05:09.159> right

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
upper level storm to track just right

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.070 
upper level storm to track just right
and<00:05:09.729> we<00:05:09.849> have<00:05:10.090> enough<00:05:10.360> moisture<00:05:10.539> we<00:05:10.870> could

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
and we have enough moisture we could

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.379 
and we have enough moisture we could
have<00:05:11.289> in<00:05:11.500> excess<00:05:11.650> of<00:05:11.979> six<00:05:12.250> inches<00:05:12.610> in<00:05:12.789> a<00:05:13.180> few

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
have in excess of six inches in a few

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:14.850 
have in excess of six inches in a few
areas<00:05:13.629> and<00:05:13.990> we're<00:05:14.110> going<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.259> advance<00:05:14.650> and

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
areas and we're going to advance and

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.379 
areas and we're going to advance and
take<00:05:14.949> a<00:05:14.979> look<00:05:15.159> at<00:05:15.310> one<00:05:15.490> other<00:05:15.520> computer<00:05:16.120> model

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
take a look at one other computer model

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.540 
take a look at one other computer model
