video<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> Magellanic<00:00:44.160> Cloud<00:00:44.879> one

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
video this is the Magellanic Cloud one

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.840 
video this is the Magellanic Cloud one
of<00:00:45.840> them<00:00:45.960> at<00:00:46.110> least<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.620> think<00:00:46.980> that's<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.370> not

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
too large my clinic cloud that's a small

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.060 
too large my clinic cloud that's a small
amount<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.059> magellanic<00:00:51.660> cloud<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.949> was

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
amount of magellanic cloud and it was

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.160 
amount of magellanic cloud and it was
Milky<00:00:53.520> Way<00:00:54.050> yep

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
Milky Way yep

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.250 
Milky Way yep
and<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:56.370> actually<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> Milky<00:00:58.230> Way

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and we actually going in the Milky Way

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.650 
and we actually going in the Milky Way
cuz<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.820> Milky<00:01:00.120> Way<00:01:00.239> that's<00:01:00.480> where

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
okay so neutron stars are acts

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.850 
okay so neutron stars are acts
very<00:03:07.260> small<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.970> as<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.360> can<00:03:09.570> see<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.590> grad

very small and as you can see the grad

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.570 
very small and as you can see the grad
like<00:03:11.190> they<00:03:11.400> have<00:03:11.550> lots<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:11.970> gravity<00:03:12.470> um<00:03:13.580> it

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
like they have lots of gravity um it

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.310 
like they have lots of gravity um it
turns<00:03:14.820> sighs<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.300> think<00:03:15.360> it's<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> teaspoon

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
turns sighs I think it's like a teaspoon

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.520 
turns sighs I think it's like a teaspoon
of<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:17.040> material<00:03:17.490> from<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.760> neutron<00:03:18.180> star

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
of the material from a neutron star

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.110 
of the material from a neutron star
would<00:03:19.530> be<00:03:19.590> like<00:03:20.070> um<00:03:22.190> like<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.250> thousand<00:03:23.790> tons<00:03:23.970> or

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
would be like um like a thousand tons or

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.510 
would be like um like a thousand tons or
something<00:03:24.630> like<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.810> just<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:26.280> teaspoon

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
something like that just a teaspoon

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.300 
something like that just a teaspoon
because<00:03:27.360> it's<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.690> condensed<00:03:28.110> but<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.710> guess<00:03:29.070> it

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
because it's so condensed but I guess it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.730 
because it's so condensed but I guess it
gets<00:03:29.520> that<00:03:29.930> gravitational<00:03:30.930> lensing<00:03:31.380> effect

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
gets that gravitational lensing effect

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.410 
gets that gravitational lensing effect
like<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> black<00:03:32.280> hole<00:03:32.580> does<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.030> just<00:03:33.240> not

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
like a black hole does but just not

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.920 
like a black hole does but just not
intense<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.560> that's<00:03:34.710> pretty<00:03:34.950> cool<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:36.030> like<00:03:36.810> I

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
intense so that's pretty cool and like I

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.400 
intense so that's pretty cool and like I
said<00:03:36.990> this<00:03:37.440> is<00:03:37.620> actually<00:03:37.770> very<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.490> Moll

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
said this is actually very so Moll

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.430 
said this is actually very so Moll
the<00:03:41.310> system<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:42.030> only<00:03:42.150> six<00:03:42.780> hundred

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
the system is only six hundred

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.410 
the system is only six hundred
kilometers<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:45.480> actual<00:03:45.930> system<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:47.210> if<00:03:48.210> I

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
kilometers the actual system so if I

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.610 
kilometers the actual system so if I
were<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.600> go<00:03:49.020> out<00:03:49.050> here<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.960> actually<00:03:52.470> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
were to go out here this is actually the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.860 
were to go out here this is actually the
boundary<00:03:53.340> were<00:03:53.550> out<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.090> action<00:03:54.480> neutron

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
boundary were out of the action neutron

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.960 
boundary were out of the action neutron
star<00:03:55.200> system<00:03:55.650> which<00:03:55.800> is<00:03:55.920> pretty<00:03:56.160> funny<00:03:56.400> cuz<00:03:58.970> so

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
star system which is pretty funny cuz so

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:07.390 
star system which is pretty funny cuz so
yeah<00:04:00.470> there's<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.560> neutron<00:04:01.980> star<00:04:05.780> all<00:04:06.780> right

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
yeah there's a neutron star all right

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.150 
yeah there's a neutron star all right
well<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.430> guess<00:04:08.820> we'll<00:04:09.600> check<00:04:10.140> out<00:04:10.350> maybe<00:04:10.770> brown

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
well I guess we'll check out maybe brown

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.400 
well I guess we'll check out maybe brown
dwarfs<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:11.820> don't<00:04:12.030> know<00:04:12.120> let's<00:04:12.870> yeah<00:04:13.050> let's<00:04:13.080> go

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
dwarfs I don't know let's yeah let's go

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.240 
dwarfs I don't know let's yeah let's go
and<00:04:13.590> check<00:04:13.800> out<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.160> brown<00:04:14.400> dwarf<00:04:16.070> cuz<00:04:17.070> those

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
and check out a brown dwarf cuz those

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.760 
and check out a brown dwarf cuz those
look<00:04:17.549> interesting<00:04:18.270> I<00:04:18.570> think<00:04:19.169> we'll<00:04:19.380> checked

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
look interesting I think we'll checked

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.500 
look interesting I think we'll checked
out<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:19.980> black<00:04:20.280> hole<00:04:20.549> we<00:04:20.820> checked<00:04:21.090> out<00:04:21.270> black

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
out a black hole we checked out black

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.470 
out a black hole we checked out black
holes<00:04:21.810> in<00:04:22.080> one<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.500> earlier<00:04:23.460> videos<00:04:23.610> okay

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
holes in one of the earlier videos okay

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.730 
holes in one of the earlier videos okay
so<00:04:24.870> let's<00:04:25.020> go<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.230> the<00:04:25.440> first<00:04:25.650> round<00:04:26.040> live<00:04:26.400> here

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
so let's go to the first round live here

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.760 
so let's go to the first round live here
now<00:04:28.820> brown<00:04:29.820> dwarfs<00:04:30.360> like<00:04:30.660> failed<00:04:30.990> stars<00:04:31.350> sort

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
now brown dwarfs like failed stars sort

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.500 
now brown dwarfs like failed stars sort
of<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:33.180> gas<00:04:34.020> giant<00:04:34.680> space<00:04:34.980> um<00:04:35.490> yeah<00:04:36.180> gas

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
of the gas giant space um yeah gas

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.210 
of the gas giant space um yeah gas
giants<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.580> they<00:04:38.580> basically<00:04:39.110> want<00:04:40.220> they

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
giants and they basically want they

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.340 
giants and they basically want they
either<00:04:41.460> too<00:04:41.910> small<00:04:41.940> enough<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.630> produce

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
either too small enough to produce

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.010 
either too small enough to produce
nuclear<00:04:43.860> fusion<00:04:44.370> so<00:04:44.730> much<00:04:44.910> sure<00:04:45.120> if<00:04:45.390> they<00:04:45.960> do

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
nuclear fusion so much sure if they do

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.440 
nuclear fusion so much sure if they do
have<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:46.530> little<00:04:46.740> bit<00:04:46.890> of<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:47.220> in<00:04:47.430> there<00:04:48.060> oh<00:04:48.090> and

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
have a little bit of it in there oh and

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.280 
have a little bit of it in there oh and
on<00:04:48.600> but<00:04:49.080> they<00:04:49.350> are<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:51.180> hot<00:04:51.660> did<00:04:52.050> like

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
on but they are the hot did like

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.800 
on but they are the hot did like
probably<00:04:52.560> uh<00:04:54.080> I'm<00:04:55.080> not<00:04:55.320> sure<00:04:55.560> I<00:04:55.850> think<00:04:56.850> that

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
probably uh I'm not sure I think that

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.930 
probably uh I'm not sure I think that
was<00:04:57.960> in<00:04:58.140> Fahrenheit<00:04:58.680> like<00:04:58.950> two<00:04:59.370> hundred<00:04:59.520> for<00:04:59.910> a

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
was in Fahrenheit like two hundred for a

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.270 
was in Fahrenheit like two hundred for a
night<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.450> like<00:05:00.780> three<00:05:01.470> thousand<00:05:01.890> Fahrenheit

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
night to like three thousand Fahrenheit

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.159 
night to like three thousand Fahrenheit
somewhere<00:05:02.730> around<00:05:02.820> there<00:05:03.180> but<00:05:04.020> I<00:05:04.080> think

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
somewhere around there but I think

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.380 
somewhere around there but I think
that's<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.950> coldest<00:05:05.610> one<00:05:05.790> that<00:05:05.970> they<00:05:06.090> found

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
that's the coldest one that they found

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.250 
that's the coldest one that they found
is<00:05:06.600> like<00:05:07.370> like<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.400> hundred<00:05:08.940> sixty<00:05:09.570> Fahrenheit

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
is like like a hundred sixty Fahrenheit

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.710 
is like like a hundred sixty Fahrenheit
so<00:05:10.650> you<00:05:10.710> know<00:05:10.980> that's<00:05:11.790> actually<00:05:12.300> put<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.600> as<00:05:12.690> a

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
so you know that's actually put it as a

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.930 
so you know that's actually put it as a
very<00:05:13.110> cold<00:05:13.440> star<00:05:13.830> so<00:05:14.250> I<00:05:14.280> mean<00:05:14.460> that's<00:05:14.610> like<00:05:14.790> a

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
very cold star so I mean that's like a

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.200 
very cold star so I mean that's like a
star<00:05:15.240> that<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:15.930> could<00:05:16.169> go<00:05:16.289> up<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.500> and<00:05:16.979> go<00:05:17.970> near

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
star that you could go up to and go near

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.090 
star that you could go up to and go near
but<00:05:18.390> anyway<00:05:18.660> so<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:19.200> makes<00:05:19.410> this<00:05:19.650> sort<00:05:19.919> of<00:05:19.950> like

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
but anyway so it makes this sort of like

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.810 
but anyway so it makes this sort of like
reddish

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
reddish

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.650 
reddish
just<00:05:21.240> brownish<00:05:22.700> thing<00:05:23.700> and<00:05:23.910> what's<00:05:24.030> kind<00:05:24.540> of

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
just brownish thing and what's kind of

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.470 
just brownish thing and what's kind of
cool<00:05:24.810> cuz<00:05:25.080> all<00:05:25.200> the<00:05:25.320> planets<00:05:25.740> so<00:05:25.860> like<00:05:26.010> that

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
cool cuz all the planets so like that

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.920 
cool cuz all the planets so like that
all<00:05:27.480> the<00:05:27.690> planets<00:05:27.960> oh<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:29.510> sorta<00:05:30.510> have<00:05:30.690> this

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
all the planets oh I sorta have this

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.590 
all the planets oh I sorta have this
because<00:05:31.290> of<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:31.560> light<00:05:31.770> color<00:05:32.600> the

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
because of the light color the

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.370 
because of the light color the
atmospheres<00:05:34.410> or<00:05:34.650> if<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:34.950> can<00:05:35.160> find<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:36.380> they're

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
atmospheres or if I can find it they're

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.560 
atmospheres or if I can find it they're
all<00:05:37.530> very<00:05:37.770> cold<00:05:38.220> too<00:05:38.430> cuz<00:05:38.730> brown<00:05:39.150> dwarfs

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
all very cold too cuz brown dwarfs

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.310 
all very cold too cuz brown dwarfs
barely<00:05:40.290> put<00:05:40.560> out<00:05:40.710> any<00:05:41.010> heat<00:05:41.550> at<00:05:41.580> all<00:05:41.820> so<00:05:42.320> if

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
barely put out any heat at all so if

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.350 
barely put out any heat at all so if
they<00:05:43.500> do<00:05:43.560> have<00:05:43.710> an<00:05:44.040> atmosphere<00:05:44.220> like<00:05:44.880> this<00:05:44.910> one

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
they do have an atmosphere like this one

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.220 
they do have an atmosphere like this one
doesn't<00:05:45.980> obviously<00:05:46.980> you<00:05:47.250> know<00:05:47.720> no<00:05:48.720> actually

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
doesn't obviously you know no actually

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.630 
doesn't obviously you know no actually
it<00:05:49.320> does<00:05:49.470> okay<00:05:50.600> but<00:05:51.950> it's<00:05:52.950> just<00:05:53.160> kind<00:05:53.370> of<00:05:53.430> cool

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
it does okay but it's just kind of cool

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.420 
it does okay but it's just kind of cool
because<00:05:54.020> this<00:05:55.020> is<00:05:55.170> what<00:05:55.350> if<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:55.890> lived<00:05:56.160> on<00:05:56.250> it

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
because this is what if you lived on it

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.690 
because this is what if you lived on it
somehow<00:05:56.970> you<00:05:57.120> could<00:05:57.950> be<00:05:58.950> on<00:05:59.100> a<00:05:59.130> bound<00:05:59.400> to<00:05:59.610> a

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
somehow you could be on a bound to a

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.450 
somehow you could be on a bound to a
planet<00:06:00.660> with<00:06:01.410> a<00:06:01.500> brown<00:06:01.680> dwarf<00:06:01.920> on<00:06:02.190> and<00:06:02.340> this<00:06:02.400> is

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
planet with a brown dwarf on and this is

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.710 
planet with a brown dwarf on and this is
what<00:06:02.730> you<00:06:02.910> would<00:06:03.000> see<00:06:03.060> in<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.360> sky<00:06:03.660> you

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
what you would see in the sky you

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.490 
what you would see in the sky you
wouldn't<00:06:04.080> see<00:06:04.260> like<00:06:04.530> regular<00:06:05.370> star<00:06:05.930> and<00:06:06.930> let

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
wouldn't see like regular star and let

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.640 
wouldn't see like regular star and let
me<00:06:07.560> actually<00:06:07.770> go<00:06:08.070> to<00:06:08.130> one<00:06:08.310> of<00:06:08.340> these<00:06:08.490> Titans
