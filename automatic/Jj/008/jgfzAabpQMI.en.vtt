 the Strasbourgers were left for a little physics session 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.210
 the opportunity to look at a player with atypical profile at 22 one week 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.670
 charged the day he lived for two years and before that he was part 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.440
 great hopes of French judo it's a sport he starts at 5 years old 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.620
 which led him to the france pole of strasbourg were able to align his prices in 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.169
 junior france team 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.569
 in competition with a certain cost of minors this does not change course direction 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:29.659
 the rugby 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.390
 from this date 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.870
 the latter as cries and ederson 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.510
 subtracting management from 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.700
 the suspicion that it is champion of Europe champion of the world 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.420
 here we are I wanted to try something else 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.590
 by its scope regarding 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.230
 he's mostly progressing 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.289
 day by day 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.850
 what does it mean that makes several hooks again progressed 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.600
 at judo as I go 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.460
 if I know a little bit about rugby then the progress that is very 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.130
 rapid 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.679
 to the point of making him quickly integrate a team a racing 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.410
 she's growing from her coach 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.410

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.720
 who trains at the rate of children per day what will make his family no more 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.540
 all these true mares the champion c 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.680
 whoever wants to come and who gives himself enormous means 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.470
 and it's true that since the reaches and a half 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.400
 it's a beautiful revelation and I think they're already talking about a lot of 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.060
 clubs 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.370
 the racing hopes to keep its nugget still a year or two 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.820

 a race against a face to face at the mental level it does not scare me 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.240
 there is no fuss after this teammates' defeat 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.350
 more and more 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.890
