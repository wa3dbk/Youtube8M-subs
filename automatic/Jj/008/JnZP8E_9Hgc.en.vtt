just unlock it again so yeah that makes

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.540 
just unlock it again so yeah that makes
sense<00:05:18.810> that's<00:05:19.260> just<00:05:19.500> my<00:05:19.620> opinion<00:05:19.650> I<00:05:20.070> believe<00:05:20.100> I

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
sense that's just my opinion I believe I

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.280 
sense that's just my opinion I believe I
really<00:05:21.150> honestly<00:05:21.360> think<00:05:21.660> you<00:05:21.780> guys<00:05:21.960> need<00:05:22.230> to

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
really honestly think you guys need to

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.340 
really honestly think you guys need to
prestige<00:05:23.510> you<00:05:24.510> don't<00:05:24.630> have<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.080> go<00:05:25.140> all<00:05:25.200> the

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
prestige you don't have to go all the

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.720 
prestige you don't have to go all the
way<00:05:25.380> up<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:25.530> 10<00:05:25.830> if<00:05:25.950> you<00:05:26.040> don't<00:05:26.160> want<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.460> but

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
way up to 10 if you don't want to but

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.880 
way up to 10 if you don't want to but
I'd<00:05:27.420> say<00:05:27.600> just<00:05:27.810> keep<00:05:27.930> precision<00:05:28.470> until<00:05:28.740> you

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
I'd say just keep precision until you

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.500 
I'd say just keep precision until you
get<00:05:29.370> tired<00:05:29.550> with<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.790> game<00:05:29.970> even<00:05:30.270> after

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
get tired with the game even after

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.510 
get tired with the game even after
procedure<00:05:30.900> if<00:05:31.110> that<00:05:31.200> makes<00:05:31.410> sense<00:05:31.530> anyways

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
procedure if that makes sense anyways

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.100 
procedure if that makes sense anyways
