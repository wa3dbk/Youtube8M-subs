00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.370
 and 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.500
 and 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.140
 Y 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.030
 and you 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.890
 Jon Rauch and one for you 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.789
 in another video here we are in my double 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.219
 nuclear with the odd square map 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.960
 brave point multi team is the 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.549
 partition mister france outside and his 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.379
 channel in the description as always 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.329
 been is the second component of the channel 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.549
 of a woman with a lot of knowledge and 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.020
 has promoted a little while ago and I 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.420
 they record the games too, so 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.149
 well I'm your boss xy everything and has been 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.520
 thanks action for leaving a game and 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.750
 now that fund does not come out either 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.409
 It is very important but good 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.920
 I wanted to say it 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.600
 we have documented how the tips for 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.090
 get the first nuclear response 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.979
 double nuclear hs hs 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.830
 the first thing is to be comfortable with the class 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.940
 what do you do if you are not there? 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.420
 comfortable with the class that you are going to take 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.520
 We are going badly or badly, because I 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.590
 I think you do not take them out if you go with a 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.590
 arms well the first one I say the others yes 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.210
 but if they do not have nuclear safe and you 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.310
 he wants to take out one so strong with the weapon 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.990
 that you like most, be it a light one 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.400
 shotgun or 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.530
 for a flank but you do not understand me 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.940
 also apart from being comfortable because the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.580
 advantages in my opinion the best 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.220
 The vest is double scavenger hardness 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.170
 advantage 2 and last of advantage 3 that 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.500
 to dexterity the tactical mask my 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.370
 opinion the skill is better because no 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.800
 I know I like that very c4 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.720
 important also and my opinion the in the 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.380
 94 with charger the movie is very 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.660
 what's best for kids in 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.120
 the second step is the game mode 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.370
 in my opinion where more banks are there then 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.980
 gets off confirmed I do not know how I do it 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.720
 he finds me amateurs people despite 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.770
 of the backrest but if you have the bone 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.790
 then control is respected also in 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.290
 domain but the team also but 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.940
 no equipment or hot spot I think 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.830
 that confirmed low of lousy people 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.380
 so he will try and in group 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.810
 go in a group that has its constant age 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.480
 So, in my opinion, it is already or is based 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.780
 It will make things easier for us 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.819
 is the third point is to have confidence in 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.739
 yourself that you're going to get it out 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.629
 because if you do not think that I do not know 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.940
 neither is it to count the casualties that you 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.250
 stay because it's like more pressure on 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.830
 and in the end you will end up killing 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.630
 nervousness that is not the first time 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.370
 I passed one foot 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.620
 and that's all the first to have a 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.860
 comfortable class that you feel is at 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.350
 I like the second one of the game mode that 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.230
 be good and the enemies too 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.090
 you depend on the enemy and the team and the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.190
 back then that of trust in you 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.560
 same and strip p'alante will be francisco 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.660
 killing you as if you were bloodthirsty 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.760
 you keep killing because if you do not 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.940
 you sure sometimes kill you for silly 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.070
 heart or well some some campero there 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.270
 out there so go very carefully and 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.180
 that is all 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.300
 tips to be and here they paint the 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.830
 connection capacitors and 20 likes 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.210
 I do not sell at 50 as always I'm still 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.310
 know is very happy as a bar channel 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.590
 greetings and see you in the next 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.090
 video also tell me by the 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.030
 comments for comments that do not 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.310
 forget to tell me 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.190
 how did you get your first medal 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.450
 nuclear and burned everything and everything was also 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:22.239
 a hot spot multiple maps looms 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.239
 and others were June 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.080
 Y 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.080
 English I realized 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.500
 the future if a premium
