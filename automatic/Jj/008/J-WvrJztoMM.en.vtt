00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:09.809
 I'm going to bake wheat bread today 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.400
 on leaven 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.799
 ferment is very often such a bread 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.609
 leaven is also called yeastless 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.039
 leaven 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.349
 but actually yeast is here but 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.010
 yeast is not artificial lend 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:27.360
 natural ones that are in flour 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.539
 in the air and sourdough it turns out so 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.640
 flour 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.070
 water is added and accordingly these 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.440
 yeast that is in flour tusyat and 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.839
 how would yeast spontaneous ferment 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.149
 they start to develop and that's when she 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.129
 comes to such a good consistency 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.920
 such a kind of order and what happens here on 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.879
 you can already bake it, but since 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.170
 living culture 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:52.510
 it must be periodically 1 time per week 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.469
 feed for baking bread I'm now 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.819
 I take 200 grams of leaven I weighed a 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.429
 I'll feed the rest of the leaven 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:06.610
 add here 200 grams of water and the same 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:10.240
 the amount of flour is all good 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.240
 mix and put in the fridge well 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.180
 now let 's take the time starter add 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.410
 water and stir it to become 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.120
 thinner generally bake bread on sourdough 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.420
 it is easy important just to learn this 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.660
 here is the procedure but yes he is 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.420
 very simple take sourdough 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.900
 knead put on dough further from this 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.440
 dough from pike bread and sourdough itself 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.090
 feed with water and flour and all that 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.310
 repeats like this in cycles 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.270
 circle from time to time 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.690
 same sequence of the same 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.380
 action for kneading dough us 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.970
 need 400 grams of wheat flour 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.500
 remind 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.260
 wheat bread 200 grams of water and 200 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:05.290
 gram for the eyes and now on this 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:09.330
 it will be necessary to knead the dough and also 10 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.020
 grams of salt dough can be kneaded by hand 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.830
 can be kneaded 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.260
 using a bread maker or combine harvester 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.930
 well in any convenient way 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.240
 you're used to but of course hand kneading 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.520
 this is the most natural home you are the most 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.490
 best for places because when you 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.960
 together the dough by hand you pass the dough 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.340
 the warmth of their hands and there is no course 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.330
 no such secret mystical 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.600
 sense 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.750
 But the point is that our temperature 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.300
 body 36 degrees is the most 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.290
 favorable temperature in order to 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.680
 this yeast 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.050
 worked to ferment came to life and 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.090
 in order for the dough that is by transferring here 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:58.080
 this heat is already fermenting the dough under i 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.230
 already begins in the process of kneading 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.360
 first I am on a mission with it 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.670
 Silicone violin Well, because the dough 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.140
 then still liquid and must be mixed 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.470
 pretty leaven 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.410
 water and flour as well as dough 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:19.870
 getting thicker here we start 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:22.390
 then knead hands all mesim necessary 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.930
 okay knead dough to make this dough 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.950
 it was elastic and no longer it 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.320
 sticks to hands 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.769
 but now it is necessary that the dough is good 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.480
 took herself to the air so we mess here 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.930
 so that's another in the folding method 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.579
 dough pulling rock 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.450
 Now we pull the dough 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:49.079
 elastic form it into a ball like this 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.950
 Here we put on all sides and on 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.349
 surface 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.989
 flour can be on the wooden 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.450
 can in some kind of a bowl this dough 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.359
 now it is necessary to invest like this 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.879
 form the ball we fold it in here 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.620
 This scarf is ready and not quite 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:09.019
 here is a ball when the bush is 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:13.439
 and laid laying it with a napkin 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:16.680
 linen and leave for 1 hour to rise 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:19.380
 the bread has risen and now it is necessary 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.109
 neatly shift on our shoulder blade 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:27.139
 which we will put it in the oven 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.139
 sends do some cuts 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.510
 and now the oven is preheated to 250 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.430
 degrees in it is my form 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.160
 and here in this form warmed up instead 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.010
 release as baking stone will 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.270
 bake our bread here is the bread completely 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:55.660
 cool now cut and try that 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.660
 we got a crust crisp 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.650
 sourdough wheat bread is very good 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.310
 such straight bubbles rose 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.080
 are great 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:12.080
 and now we are with smoked salmon which 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.380
 yesterday for smoked from home butter 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.000
 which whipped own hands do 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.000
 sandwich and have breakfast
