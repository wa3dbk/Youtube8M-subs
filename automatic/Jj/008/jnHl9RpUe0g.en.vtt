00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:18.079 
works perfectly fine so now I'm going to

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:25.009 
works perfectly fine so now I'm going to
test<00:00:19.079> the<00:00:20.119> blue<00:00:21.119> Nintendo<00:00:21.810> Wii<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.970> see<00:00:24.019> about

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.659 
test the blue Nintendo Wii and see about
it<00:00:25.259> so<00:00:26.130> basically<00:00:27.169> you<00:00:28.169> can<00:00:28.289> also<00:00:28.470> use<00:00:28.890> Gameboy

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
it so basically you can also use Gameboy

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.470 
it so basically you can also use Gameboy
Advance<00:00:30.659> SP<00:00:30.929> systems<00:00:31.679> as<00:00:32.480> GameCube

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
Advance SP systems as GameCube

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.450 
Advance SP systems as GameCube
controllers<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.560> the<00:00:34.980> proper

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
controllers if you have the proper

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.510 
controllers if you have the proper
extension<00:00:36.300> cord<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.840> I'm<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.340> this

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
extension cord so I'm going to do this

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.430 
extension cord so I'm going to do this
with<00:00:39.230> some<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.820> course<00:00:41.960> Gameboy<00:00:42.960> Advance<00:00:43.260> SP

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
with some of course Gameboy Advance SP

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.840 
with some of course Gameboy Advance SP
controllers<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.190> I'm<00:00:44.310> just<00:00:44.430> gonna<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:44.670> one

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
controllers but I'm just gonna do one

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.990 
controllers but I'm just gonna do one
for<00:00:45.030> now<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.570> demo<00:00:46.550> basically<00:00:47.550> began

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
for now in this demo basically began

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.470 
for now in this demo basically began
keeping<00:00:48.270> I'm<00:00:48.630> gonna<00:00:48.810> test<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.710> is

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
keeping I'm gonna test out with this is

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.560 
keeping I'm gonna test out with this is
the<00:00:51.480> Legend<00:00:51.810> of<00:00:51.840> Zelda<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.470> swords<00:00:53.360> I'm<00:00:54.360> going

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the Legend of Zelda for swords I'm going

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.690 
the Legend of Zelda for swords I'm going
to<00:00:54.630> be<00:00:54.750> using<00:00:54.990> a<00:00:56.510> AG<00:00:58.040> s101

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
to be using a AG s101

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.450 
to be using a AG s101
and<00:00:59.880> I<00:01:00.000> can't<00:01:00.240> see<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:00.630> camera<00:01:01.460> Gameboy

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and I can't see what the camera Gameboy

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399 
and I can't see what the camera Gameboy
Advance<00:01:02.880> SP<00:01:03.120> these<00:01:03.780> are<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> only<00:01:04.140> colors

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
Advance SP these are the only colors

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.100 
Advance SP these are the only colors
actually<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.790> has<00:01:06.720> them

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
actually I know of that has them

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.830 
actually I know of that has them
backwards<00:01:07.800> rather<00:01:08.070> than<00:01:08.250> front<00:01:08.670> lids<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.659> all

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
backwards rather than front lids so all

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.830 
backwards rather than front lids so all
these<00:01:10.200> ones<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:10.830> funded<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.940> backlit<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.750> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
these ones are funded not backlit so you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.030 
these ones are funded not backlit so you
can<00:01:13.050> actually<00:01:13.230> see<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.980> lot<00:01:14.550> more<00:01:14.700> nicer<00:01:16.040> so

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
can actually see it a lot more nicer so

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.530 
can actually see it a lot more nicer so
I<00:01:17.870> have<00:01:18.890> this<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.010> plugged<00:01:20.370> in<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.729> course<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
I have this one plugged in of course and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.540 
I have this one plugged in of course and
let's<00:01:22.080> give<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.470> try<00:01:22.650> shall<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.390> hold<00:01:24.390> on

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
let's give it a try shall I hold on

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.270 
let's give it a try shall I hold on
so<00:01:26.550> that's<00:01:26.909> first<00:01:27.090> turn<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.479> lead<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:31.280> wait

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so that's first turn the lead and wait

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.539 
so that's first turn the lead and wait
fill<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.580> startup<00:01:35.120> and<00:01:36.120> there<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.570> goes

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
fill up a startup and there it goes

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.810 
fill up a startup and there it goes
hold<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> meantime<00:01:39.560> let<00:01:40.560> me<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.920> plug

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
hold on in the meantime let me just plug

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.770 
hold on in the meantime let me just plug
this<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:43.580> I<00:01:44.580> take<00:01:44.820> off<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> side<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
this in so I take off the side here and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.830 
this in so I take off the side here and
likes<00:01:48.780> plug<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:50.450> slot<00:01:51.450> one

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.219 

that's<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.200> game<00:01:54.440> field<00:01:54.740> controller<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:57.909> for

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
that's the game field controller and for

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.050 
that's the game field controller and for
memory<00:02:00.229> card<00:02:00.440> I<00:02:00.590> think<00:02:00.890> my<00:02:01.100> safe<00:02:01.430> file<00:02:01.670> was<00:02:01.940> on

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
memory card I think my safe file was on

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.090 
memory card I think my safe file was on
this<00:02:02.330> one<00:02:02.740> can't<00:02:03.740> remember<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:05.830> have<00:02:06.830> that

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
this one can't remember I have that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.219 
this one can't remember I have that
plugged<00:02:07.369> in<00:02:07.780> I'm<00:02:08.780> going<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:08.959> leave<00:02:09.110> it

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
plugged in I'm going to leave it

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.500 
plugged in I'm going to leave it
standing<00:02:09.560> up<00:02:09.830> sideways<00:02:10.100> for<00:02:10.429> now<00:02:10.520> because<00:02:10.940> on

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
standing up sideways for now because on

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.199 
standing up sideways for now because on
this<00:02:11.840> stool<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.230> have<00:02:12.530> here<00:02:12.980> can't<00:02:13.819> really

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
this stool I have here can't really

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.190 
this stool I have here can't really
properly<00:02:15.370> stand<00:02:16.370> up<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:16.940> either<00:02:17.420> way<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:18.140> can

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
properly stand up so either way it can

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.350 
properly stand up so either way it can
work<00:02:18.440> standing<00:02:18.860> up<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:20.300> let's<00:02:20.660> see<00:02:22.209> now<00:02:23.209> I'm

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
work standing up so let's see now I'm

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.420 
work standing up so let's see now I'm
going<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.959> select<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:26.060> channel<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.430> there's

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
going to select this channel and there's

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.970 
going to select this channel and there's
nothing<00:02:28.790> inside<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.320> so<00:02:30.320> I'm<00:02:30.590> going<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.769> put<00:02:30.950> a

nothing inside it so I'm going to put a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.670 
nothing inside it so I'm going to put a
game<00:02:31.310> -<00:02:31.640> game<00:02:32.380> inside<00:02:33.700> new<00:02:34.700> gluey<00:02:35.560> well<00:02:36.560> the

game - game inside new gluey well the
outside<00:02:36.769> part<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:39.560> let's<00:02:39.739> see<00:02:40.040> now

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
outside part of it so let's see now

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:50.250 
outside part of it so let's see now
now<00:02:41.390> it's<00:02:41.660> spinning<00:02:43.239> and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.020 

here<00:02:51.220> we<00:02:51.370> go<00:02:55.379> okay<00:02:56.379> so<00:02:57.370> I'm<00:02:57.519> going<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.730> start

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
here we go okay so I'm going to start

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:09.259 
here we go okay so I'm going to start
this<00:03:00.360> hold<00:03:01.360> on<00:03:01.629> there<00:03:06.510> let's<00:03:07.510> see

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
this hold on there let's see

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.740 
this hold on there let's see
and<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.569> point<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.900> turn<00:03:11.080> this<00:03:11.230> on<00:03:12.569> was<00:03:13.569> this

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
and the point to turn this on was this

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.350 
and the point to turn this on was this
weird<00:03:14.590> game<00:03:15.310> key<00:03:15.489> controller
