also saw in the Sony Xperia Z a montage
that<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.510> produced<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:17.080> bout<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> month<00:03:17.830> ago<00:03:18.010> and

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
that I produced a bout a month ago and

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.910 
that I produced a bout a month ago and
this<00:03:18.940> definitely<00:03:19.209> looks<00:03:19.570> even<00:03:20.200> better<00:03:20.530> than

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
this definitely looks even better than

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.640 
this definitely looks even better than
it<00:03:21.280> did<00:03:21.489> on<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.790> Sony<00:03:22.270> Xperia<00:03:22.660> Z<00:03:23.020> I<00:03:23.230> don't

know<00:03:23.770> how<00:03:23.920> well<00:03:24.130> that's<00:03:24.340> translating<00:03:24.970> over<00:03:25.269> to

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
know how well that's translating over to

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.490 
know how well that's translating over to
the<00:03:26.080> video<00:03:26.590> itself<00:03:27.040> but<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:28.150> person<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.470> is

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
the video itself but in person it is

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.289 
the video itself but in person it is

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
better than the experience he did given

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.410 
better than the experience he did given
