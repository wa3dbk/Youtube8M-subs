00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.050
 world 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.970
 perhaps because behind the direction and the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.100

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.460
 magnificent from every angle and to 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.800
 the more the artists offer themselves to the eyes 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.630
 spectators almost at 360 degrees 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.460
 given the circular shape of the stage that 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.680

 diamonds are entrusted to the duo format 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.670
 from the character of the innocent dress 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.230
 like a child with a kite in 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.450

 the two singers for each ato e 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.540
 the orchestra 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.980
 already because the music is strictly from 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.760

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.350
