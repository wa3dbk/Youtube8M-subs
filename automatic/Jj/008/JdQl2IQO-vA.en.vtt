00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.230
 good in this video we will go to do the 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.809
 procedure of compression sockets 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.680
 in a car the processes for 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.680
 do it and the tools 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.100
 hello not this time good first I'll use 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.380
 a complement 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.950
 if we can see the measurement back here 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.470
 from outside that is in psi and that of the 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.310
 interior that is measured in pascal shot 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.669
 we will use a cicada 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.210
 the extender and the die to remove it from 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.040
 the feet 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.970
 Next with the procedure 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.880
 good we will go to do the procedure 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.880
 in a 949 mazda 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.170
 first let's take out the cables 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.170
 spark plug 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.760
 here as you can see the spark plug has a 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.400
 accumulation of char that wants 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.350
 say that a bad one is happening 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.350
 combustion inside the engine 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.450
 after removing the homeland 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.810
 the confession 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.200
 and then our partner is going to give 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.200
 start 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.090
 already 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:11.270
 as a toy no compression reached 146 in 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.270
 the cylinder 1 cylinder number 15 146 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.430
 ariel 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.940
 this is vital to know the compression 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.940
 of the engine write it down on horns 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.770
 52 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.790
 now frame 140 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.579
 ah 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.520
 is there 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.310
 now he scored 130 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.280
 cylinder number 330 sometimes 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:51.760
 in this framework 175 psi 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:56.490
 this is a mode in 1008 and the manual 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:00.030
 they specify that you should dial 180 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:04.100
 and as we see each one marked 150 or 140 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.100
 one thousand 132 275 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.480
 then everything implies that we had 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.610
 Pressure loss can be the ring 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.190
 or it can be in valve 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.190
 that's what goes into these brands 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.800
 good and with this we finished the 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.450
 procedure the tool and the 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.810
 process of making compression in a 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.810
 car
