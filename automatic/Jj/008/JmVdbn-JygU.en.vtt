00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
was way less nervous the second time

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.479 
was way less nervous the second time
because<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.109> knew<00:04:00.320> with<00:04:00.470> each<00:04:00.620> step<00:04:00.890> I<00:04:01.160> was

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
because I knew with each step I was

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.870 
because I knew with each step I was
getting<00:04:01.820> closer<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.590> my<00:04:03.590> hotel<00:04:03.829> it's<00:04:04.670> weird
