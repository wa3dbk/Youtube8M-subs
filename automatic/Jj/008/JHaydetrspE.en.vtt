the<00:01:33.960> way<00:01:34.079> they're<00:01:34.229> supposed<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.430> wasn't

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the way they're supposed to and I wasn't

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.460 
the way they're supposed to and I wasn't
necessarily<00:01:36.000> looking<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.170> because<00:01:37.409> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
necessarily looking for this because I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.469 
necessarily looking for this because I
didn't<00:01:37.799> even<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.250> existed<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:39.270> when<00:01:39.450> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
didn't even know this existed but when I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.240 
didn't even know this existed but when I
saw<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.200> definitely<00:01:40.439> drew<00:01:40.979> my<00:01:41.220> attention

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
saw it it definitely drew my attention

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
like there's nothing crazy about it it's

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.400 
like there's nothing crazy about it it's
just<00:02:08.310> smaller<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.690> see<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.080> clamp

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
just smaller if you can see the clamp

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.580 
just smaller if you can see the clamp
itself<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:11.039> would<00:02:11.220> say<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.610> maybe<00:02:11.849> an<00:02:12.180> in

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
itself I would say it's maybe an in

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.800 
itself I would say it's maybe an in
and<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:12.769> half<00:02:12.950> long<00:02:13.310> that's<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.790> compared<00:02:14.629> to<00:02:14.780> a

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and a half long that's it compared to a

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.600 
and a half long that's it compared to a
regular<00:02:15.140> eyelash<00:02:15.709> curler<00:02:15.950> let<00:02:16.190> me<00:02:16.340> show<00:02:16.550> you

can see there the difference and um I
found<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.019> be<00:02:39.049> really<00:02:39.379> cool<00:02:39.650> because

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
found this to be really cool because

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.729 
found this to be really cool because
this<00:02:40.129> helps<00:02:40.400> me<00:02:40.670> target<00:02:41.239> just<00:02:41.930> my<00:02:42.110> outer<00:02:42.349> ones

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739

so<00:02:43.160> I've<00:02:43.370> been<00:02:43.580> using<00:02:43.790> this<00:02:44.090> recently<00:02:44.660> just<00:02:44.930> to

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
so I've been using this recently just to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.759 
so I've been using this recently just to
grab<00:02:45.890> my<00:02:46.250> eyelashes<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.209> end<00:02:47.470> curl<00:02:48.470> them

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
grab my eyelashes on the end curl them

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.069 
grab my eyelashes on the end curl them
go<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.610> other<00:02:49.849> one<00:02:50.090> curl<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.750> it's

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
go to the other one curl it and it's

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.289 
go to the other one curl it and it's
actually<00:02:51.620> doing<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.099> so<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.280> really<00:02:52.880> can<00:02:53.090> use

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
actually doing it so I really can use

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.530 
actually doing it so I really can use
both<00:02:53.569> in<00:02:54.069> conjunction<00:02:55.069> or<00:02:55.340> sometimes<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.329> could

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
both in conjunction or sometimes I could

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.600 
both in conjunction or sometimes I could
just<00:02:56.690> use<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:57.019> one<00:02:57.079> alone<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.010> don't<00:02:58.430> know

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
just use this one alone so I don't know

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.059 
just use this one alone so I don't know
if<00:02:58.849> anybody<00:02:59.390> out<00:02:59.480> there<00:02:59.660> has<00:03:00.230> actually<00:03:00.500> seen

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
if anybody out there has actually seen

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.830 
if anybody out there has actually seen
this<00:03:01.250> if<00:03:01.430> they<00:03:01.549> have<00:03:01.760> any<00:03:01.940> details<00:03:02.450> on<00:03:02.660> this
