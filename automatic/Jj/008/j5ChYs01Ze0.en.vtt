00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
your legs which have very minimal range

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.519 
your legs which have very minimal range
of<00:00:18.330> motion<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.750> their<00:00:18.900> job<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.260> easiest

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
of motion so their job is the easiest

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.560 
of motion so their job is the easiest
your<00:00:20.160> legs<00:00:20.400> basically<00:00:20.910> you're<00:00:21.330> struggling

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
your legs basically you're struggling

your legs basically you're struggling
your<00:00:21.960> legs<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.980> all<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.250> work<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.550> have

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
your legs just do all the work you have

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.490 
your legs just do all the work you have
a<00:00:23.699> body<00:00:23.850> can't<00:00:24.180> handle<00:00:24.240> your<00:00:24.689> likes<00:00:24.930> shoot

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
a body can't handle your likes shoot

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.380 
a body can't handle your likes shoot
straight<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.920> they<00:00:26.160> lock<00:00:26.400> out<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.970> then<00:00:27.269> it

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
straight up they lock out and then it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.849 
straight up they lock out and then it
gives<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.630> all<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.990> lower<00:00:28.170> back<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
gives you all to lower back and then you

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.910 
gives you all to lower back and then you
usually<00:00:29.010> Kern<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.609> up<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:29.910> lower<00:00:30.090> back

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
usually Kern it up with your lower back

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.100 
usually Kern it up with your lower back
fast<00:00:31.920> motion<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.700> side<00:00:33.660> note<00:00:33.930> that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110

like<00:00:39.000> my<00:00:39.120> backgrounds<00:00:39.629> often<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.469> usually

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
like my backgrounds often it's usually

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.740 
like my backgrounds often it's usually
just<00:00:40.739> my<00:00:40.920> rector's<00:00:41.309> popping<00:00:41.640> out<00:00:44.600> shooting<00:00:45.600> up

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
different kind of problem that doesn't

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.770 
different kind of problem that doesn't

reflect weakness near technique record

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840 
reflect weakness near technique record
it<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.469> reflects<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:56.100> positioning<00:00:56.670> when

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
it just reflects your positioning when

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
for me of course here's the thing now if

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.899 
for me of course here's the thing now if
I<00:01:07.619> didn't<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.920> about<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.549> second

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
I didn't know about this the second

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
I didn't know about this the second
issue<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.390> might<00:01:09.930> watch<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.320> video<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> I

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
issue I might watch that video and I

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.500 
issue I might watch that video and I
might<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.490> same<00:01:11.520> thing<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.180> then<00:01:12.479> I

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
might think the same thing and then I

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.539 
might think the same thing and then I
could<00:01:12.630> practice<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.500> know<00:01:13.619> pause<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.310> list

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
could practice you know pause that list

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.010 
could practice you know pause that list
I<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:15.090> practice<00:01:15.479> strengthening<00:01:15.930> my

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
I can practice strengthening my

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.690 
I can practice strengthening my
technique<00:01:16.320> until<00:01:16.560> i<00:01:16.590> move<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> face<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
technique until i move the face and the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.670 
technique until i move the face and the
issue<00:01:17.850> still<00:01:18.210> wouldn't<00:01:18.509> go<00:01:18.600> away<00:01:18.689> some<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
issue still wouldn't go away some of you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.260 
issue still wouldn't go away some of you
may<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.860> having<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> same<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.729> issue<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
may be having the same as that issue and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.320 
may be having the same as that issue and
that's<00:01:21.600> simply<00:01:22.020> starting<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.890> position

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
that's simply starting out of position

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.929 
that's simply starting out of position
so<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:25.229> simply<00:01:25.590> when<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.220> did<00:01:26.430> list<00:01:26.640> based

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
so very simply when you did list based

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149 
so very simply when you did list based
on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.689> length<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.170> your<00:01:28.229> limbs<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.950> legs

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
on the length of your limbs your legs

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.880 
on the length of your limbs your legs
your<00:01:29.490> arms<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.850> torso<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.140> how<00:01:31.530> far<00:01:31.799> away

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
your arms your torso and how far away

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.710 
your arms your torso and how far away
