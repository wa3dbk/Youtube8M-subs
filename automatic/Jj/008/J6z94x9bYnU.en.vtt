00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
that didn't matter and you know because

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770 
that didn't matter and you know because
she<00:00:52.530> had<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> focus<00:00:52.920> ash<00:00:53.190> anyway<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.270> she<00:00:54.420> sets

of her own or go for the explosion and
in<00:01:01.650> in<00:01:02.370> hindsight<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:03.000> should<00:01:03.330> have<00:01:03.360> gone<00:01:03.839> to

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
in in hindsight I should have gone to

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.870 
in in hindsight I should have gone to
the<00:01:04.140> stealth<00:01:04.379> rock<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:05.220> looking<00:01:05.430> back<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.760> it

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the stealth rock but looking back at it

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.300 
the stealth rock but looking back at it
now<00:01:05.910> that<00:01:06.540> actually<00:01:06.990> did<00:01:07.170> not<00:01:07.230> matter<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:08.159> did

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
now that actually did not matter it did

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.710 
now that actually did not matter it did
not<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.700> any<00:01:08.820> outcome<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.390> battle

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
not have any outcome on the battle

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.510 
not have any outcome on the battle
whatsoever<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.890> she<00:01:10.950> goes<00:01:11.190> out<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.430> his

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
whatsoever so she goes out to his

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.600 
whatsoever so she goes out to his
marowak<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.620> it's<00:01:13.620> gonna<00:01:13.710> fire<00:01:13.950> punch<00:01:14.190> me<00:01:14.370> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
marowak and it's gonna fire punch me and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.060 
marowak and it's gonna fire punch me and
she's<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.240> kill<00:01:15.390> me<00:01:15.450> off<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.440> I<00:01:16.470> got<00:01:16.830> into

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
she's going to kill me off so I got into

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.980 
she's going to kill me off so I got into
lapis<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.550> I<00:01:17.760> know<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.180> laugh<00:01:18.300> escaped<00:01:18.780> any

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
lapis and I know that laugh escaped any

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.830 
lapis and I know that laugh escaped any
hit<00:01:19.320> from<00:01:19.470> marowak<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.210> she<00:01:21.210> knows<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.570> too

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
hit from marowak and she knows that too

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.290 
hit from marowak and she knows that too
so<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:23.190> some<00:01:23.340> reason<00:01:23.370> she<00:01:23.700> goes<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.030> clam

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
so for some reason she goes out to clam

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.610 
so for some reason she goes out to clam

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
pearl oh I ice cream it's super

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.950 
pearl oh I ice cream it's super
effective<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.100> marowak<00:01:26.610> anyway<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.300> she

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
effective on the marowak anyway but she

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560 
effective on the marowak anyway but she
gets<00:01:28.110> i<00:01:28.260> get<00:01:28.410> i<00:01:28.440> get<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.710> freeze<00:01:29.010> and<00:01:29.480> she<00:01:30.480> was

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
gets i get i get to freeze and she was

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.720 
gets i get i get to freeze and she was
kind<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:30.780> miffed<00:01:30.990> about<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.440> but<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.860> don't

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
kind of miffed about that but I don't

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.980 
kind of miffed about that but I don't
think<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.060> really<00:01:33.300> mattered<00:01:33.660> because<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
think that really mattered because the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.450 
think that really mattered because the
most<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.470> clan<00:01:34.650> pro<00:01:34.830> could<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.130> done<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.310> me

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
most the clan pro could have done to me

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.790 
most the clan pro could have done to me
it<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:35.550> hidden<00:01:35.790> power<00:01:35.970> grass<00:01:36.300> and<00:01:36.630> since<00:01:37.620> she

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
it was hidden power grass and since she

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.410 
it was hidden power grass and since she
can<00:01:37.920> only<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.550> hit<00:01:38.790> off<00:01:38.910> on<00:01:39.120> me<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> don't

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
can only get one hit off on me I don't

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.360 
can only get one hit off on me I don't
think<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.080> would<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.260> been<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.410> 28<00:01:40.770> KO<00:01:40.950> at<00:01:41.130> all

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
think it would have been a 28 KO at all

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.580 
think it would have been a 28 KO at all
I'm<00:01:41.670> guessing<00:01:42.570> or<00:01:42.660> even<00:01:42.870> a<00:01:42.930> three<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.230> Kalkin

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
I'm guessing or even a three of Kalkin

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.560 
I'm guessing or even a three of Kalkin
sitting<00:01:43.800> around<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.010> special<00:01:44.460> tank<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.880> here<00:01:45.540> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
sitting around a special tank and here I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.180 
sitting around a special tank and here I
don't<00:01:45.930> see<00:01:46.230> the<00:01:46.380> trick<00:01:46.560> room<00:01:46.710> go<00:01:46.890> away<00:01:47.040> because

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
don't see the trick room go away because

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.070 
don't see the trick room go away because
I<00:01:47.310> wasn't<00:01:47.520> paying<00:01:47.760> attention<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:48.720> probably

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
I wasn't paying attention and I probably

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.270 
I wasn't paying attention and I probably
would<00:01:49.440> have<00:01:49.500> been<00:01:49.650> faster<00:01:49.830> not<00:01:50.130> anything

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
would have been faster not anything

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.120 
would have been faster not anything
considering<00:01:51.150> it's<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.330> a<00:01:51.360> trick<00:01:51.630> room<00:01:51.750> team<00:01:52.130> so

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
considering it's on a trick room team so

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770 
considering it's on a trick room team so
I<00:01:53.190> could<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.760> killed<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.150> with<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.540> surf

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
I could have killed it with the surf

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.920 
I could have killed it with the surf
been<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.400> stupidly<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.940> go<00:01:57.240> into<00:01:57.450> my

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
did next to nothing and I thunderbolt

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.160 
did next to nothing and I thunderbolt
and<00:03:01.950> I'm<00:03:02.489> guessing<00:03:03.090> she<00:03:03.150> does<00:03:03.420> not<00:03:03.690> have<00:03:03.930> grass

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
and I'm guessing she does not have grass

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.039 
and I'm guessing she does not have grass
not<00:03:04.379> considering<00:03:04.829> she<00:03:05.010> does<00:03:05.220> have<00:03:05.900> trick<00:03:06.900> room

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
not considering she does have trick room

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.280 
not considering she does have trick room
and<00:03:07.549> I<00:03:08.549> in<00:03:08.849> a<00:03:08.910> thunderbolt<00:03:09.390> just<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.019> case<00:03:10.109> she

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
and I in a thunderbolt just in case she

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
and I in a thunderbolt just in case she
decided<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.650> stay<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:10.950> could<00:03:11.099> probably

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
decided to stay and I could probably

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.770 
decided to stay and I could probably
wear<00:03:11.549> that<00:03:11.700> thing<00:03:11.879> down<00:03:12.090> eventually<00:03:12.450> with<00:03:12.720> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
wear that thing down eventually with the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.300 
wear that thing down eventually with the
toxic<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.379> super<00:03:13.650> effective<00:03:13.829> thunderballs

toxic and super effective thunderballs

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.550 
toxic and super effective thunderballs

stab and all that it's pretty damn cool
stabbed<00:03:40.109> by<00:03:40.230> spoon<00:03:40.489> only<00:03:41.489> hurts<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.090> know

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
stabbed by spoon only hurts and you know

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.400 
stabbed by spoon only hurts and you know
defensive<00:03:42.930> aspect<00:03:43.349> but<00:03:44.090> ok<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.269> see<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.959> has<00:03:46.139> ice

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
defensive aspect but ok I see it has ice

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.930 
defensive aspect but ok I see it has ice
beam<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.829> Thunderbolt<00:03:47.220> as<00:03:47.310> most<00:03:47.609> porygon

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
beam and Thunderbolt as most porygon

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.000 
beam and Thunderbolt as most porygon
tues<00:03:48.239> have<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.690> I'm<00:03:48.780> guessing<00:03:49.200> its<00:03:49.349> last<00:03:49.590> move

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010
