00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
oh by the way I've heard that the first

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
part is very dialogue heavy so time to

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:43.250 
part is very dialogue heavy so time to

so anything you're over here I'm going

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.470 
so anything you're over here I'm going
