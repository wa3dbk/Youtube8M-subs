I've saw are the belkin and they look

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.749 
I've saw are the belkin and they look
very<00:01:35.640> nice<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:37.049> here's<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.409> fake<00:01:37.650> ipod<00:01:38.430> paper

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
very nice so here's the fake ipod paper

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.310 
very nice so here's the fake ipod paper
that<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.299> usually<00:01:39.570> include<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> lot<00:01:40.290> of

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
that they usually include with a lot of

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.060 
that they usually include with a lot of
cases<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.150> ipod<00:01:42.570> shows<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.380> camera<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
cases this is ipod shows the camera and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.460 
cases this is ipod shows the camera and
i'm<00:01:45.000> guessing<00:01:45.420> socially<00:01:45.780> noise<00:01:45.960> cancellation

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
i'm guessing socially noise cancellation

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.399 
i'm guessing socially noise cancellation
but<00:01:46.590> looks<00:01:46.740> like<00:01:46.799> flash<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> well<00:01:48.409> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
but looks like flash but a well and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.950 
but looks like flash but a well and
here's<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.860> case<00:01:50.040> itself<00:01:50.399> has<00:01:51.360> coverage<00:01:51.750> for

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
here's the case itself has coverage for

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.010 
here's the case itself has coverage for
your<00:01:52.140> new<00:01:52.829> buttons<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.850> down<00:01:54.060> volume<00:01:54.360> it's

to<00:02:38.580> protect<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.240> back<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.570> your<00:02:39.660> ipod<00:02:39.990> from

getting<00:02:40.470> scratches<00:02:40.820> but<00:02:41.820> I've<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.180> invisible

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
shield on the back when it dries so this

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.150

will<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.850> extra<00:02:45.270> protection<00:02:45.630> i<00:02:45.690> guess<00:02:46.160> but

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
will be extra protection i guess but

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.880 
will be extra protection i guess but
