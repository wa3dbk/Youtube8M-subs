00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.910
 one day I act nutritionist toledo 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.309
 work with marketing to 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.139
 nutritionists and I have been receiving 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.240
 more and more emails from people who want 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.130
 set up consultancy services 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.410
 nutritionists who want to work in 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.430
 their own business riding services 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.010
 consulting 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.529
 the questions are how do I do it today? 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.060
 is the beginning with which future services 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.960
 how will I know if my idea gives 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.000
 right 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.740
 the only question that can not be 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.380
 answer is as follows 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.020
 So the idea has people who do not have 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.559
 and no idea comes to me asking 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.989
 idea does not simply create something for her 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.059
 and the business works well it is not so with 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.110
 people who have business that are 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.879
 entrepreneurs 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.370
 usually they observe some 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.710
 need the market, they observe the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.320
 needs of people or even their 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.199
 their own needs and there as a 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.710
 of this problem of pain that people 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.960
 has 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.250
 they start proposing solutions then what 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.379
 should you not answer for 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.450
 you is the idea of gold a tip that will 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.700
 turn this over, there's no way 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.530
 but how to structure a business can 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.049
 people start thinking a little about the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.150
 step by step of how is it built? 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.000
 an idea when we feel 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
 need of this service pain perceives 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.869
 missing a food service 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.270
 differentiated a delivery is any 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.080
 business even outside the area of ​​nutrition 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.270
 The idea is to first validate whether the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.130
 your cool idea or not have a video that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.530
 I did it right here explaining that 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.509
 Validation of ideas is to know if it 's you 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.490
 is passionate about your idea that you 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.950
 You think it's wonderful but only you want it. 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.290
 really a good idea that will 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.030
 turn business you need to confirm with 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.159
 possible customers with the other 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.049
 people to know if they really have 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.390
 potential of turning business 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.799
 and this validation passes through the conversation with 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.140
 many people 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.240
 it is very common who will set up business 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.890
 afraid to tell others have 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.530
 afraid someone steals your idea 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.030
 people are not like that you need to open 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.399
 talk to people with people 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.590
 certain with interesting people people 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.849
 that will give you some idea mentors 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.170
 for you will help you in the 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.600
 development of your business is 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.760
 important to open 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.310
 and go after doing market research 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.680
 to see if your idea is validated and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.170
 your client likes it if you first 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.090
 will make the sus is a business that is going 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.070
 meet people's needs 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.390
 this is the first thing the second thing 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.520
 What you have to look at are the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.640
 competing of people for me does and does not 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.130
 has no problem people competitor 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.570
 I record first if you do not have 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.490
 no competitor is likely to be 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.170
 because your bad idea because today in 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.940
 day does not exist of the unpublished one when more 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.920
 rare in the world the idea is this so if the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.550
 Your idea is so honest that no one not 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.280
 had 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.420
 or you are a genius carlos is more than the 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.030
 and one will be an item of life or 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.250
 you did not research right or what is 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.260
 worse if it's so bad that everyone tried 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.850
 put into practice has already fallen by land 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.520
 so you have to find out if 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.350
 really does not require it or if it has already been 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.030
 put into practice and went bankrupt 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.800
 precisely because it is not a good 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.020
 idea then you have no competition 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.360
 no open eye has anything 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.430
 wrong, I left and the third thing you 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.900
 have to look at your suppliers 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.000
 Let's go, you try to set one up. 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.070
 typical northeastern food restaurant 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.630
 I live here in Goiania 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.310
 there is not a good supplier of meat 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.110
 dry does not have a good supplier of cheese 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.930
 rennet and neither is a good supplier 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.270
 jerimum and there how the restaurant 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.120
 work or else another company 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.520
 software that I need for pen drives and 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.440
 specific styles and what I get 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.630
 buying is much more expensive than I 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.580
 could sell that will leave my price 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.970
 up there and my product will not sell 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.440
 because it is out of the market price 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.090
 because because my supplier is very 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.970
 So, we have to study. 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.920
 customer and supplier and 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.330
 after you do all this study 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.190
 talk to people who understand 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.620
 business people who set up businesses 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.420
 similar people who hit people 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.100
 Who made people who failed people 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.650
 have been successful and you have a 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.320
 a lot better portrait of it all there 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.360
 you assemble your product but rather 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.790
 thunderous things to spend a lot 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.300
 money the idea today is to put things together 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.950
 and refuse viewing by monitoring the 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.989
 As your customer will bring this 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.410
 back is the same product concept 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.420
 to see 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.040
 which also has a video here that I 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.190
 I explain exactly how you do it. 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.230
 a viable minimum product mvp is that 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.060
 minimum your product sells 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.560
 without you spending the tubes of money 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.880
 I then discovered that it went wrong and that 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.610
 you will lose 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.010
 the idea today building the product 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.340
 building service together with the customer 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.470
 and then you're fine-tuning and 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.870
 validating then there is no 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.910
 magic recipe to talk will work out 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.610
 your business but the idea is basically 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.080
 This is something that I strongly suggest that you 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.060
 officially do that is riding a 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.030
 business now is to get the sebrae 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.010
