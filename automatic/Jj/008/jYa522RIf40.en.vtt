00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.530
 in the engines dropped oil chives has 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.519

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.990
 only that already filled only welcomed the fulfill 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.280

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.270
 also that it will be put together 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.360
 We're going to take his retirement and 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.990
 I'm going to use a team key 24 on 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:53.390
 her castle training here and we will use 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.380
 a key 24 the vice of the time instead of 24 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.720
 24 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.440
 it rained in 2011 the mall had 24 to use 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.590
 her to pull normally 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.660
 anticlockwise you have to unscrew 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.660
 Too bad, we'll be right back 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.049
 it's not here 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.719
 Let's vote here on the other hand the team 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:44.150
 of the video that proves so points it here 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:48.530
 So we'll get what's new. 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:55.129
 The more it has the more it 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.780
 Let's put it back to cry what 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.439
 You anti-clockwise will take the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:06.109
 the piece was not clockwise and 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:09.849
 we took place that sensor jack is for 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.849
 power without seeing it on the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:40.500
 so here you go and install dinha already 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:46.200
 We put it in the river, yes. 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.200
 and now you know that's where you're fooling 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.659
 in the place that you know in fact that she 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.159
 is charging again when it is 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:58.900
 is offline 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:01.359
 she does not even ascend the eye kettle 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.280
 she not light a is off only 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.760
 when it gets grounded there 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.500
 engine block the place or even with the 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.680
 sensor she gets the password 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.750
 now it's lighting up and now you 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.889
 has more confirmation could connect the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.889
 car and she has to turn off 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:27.810
 there it works and gift is working 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.030
