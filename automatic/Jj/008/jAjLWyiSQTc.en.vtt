00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
with age so it's it doesn't remain the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.230 
with age so it's it doesn't remain the

same so you really have to be sort of in

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.050

tune<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.810> your<00:01:42.960> skin<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:44.159> realized<00:01:44.610> one

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
tune with your skin and I realized one

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.840 
tune with your skin and I realized one
is<00:01:45.450> needing<00:01:45.869> more<00:01:45.990> moisture<00:01:46.619> realize<00:01:47.430> when

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
is needing more moisture realize when

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.319 
is needing more moisture realize when
it's<00:01:48.240> needing<00:01:49.079> some<00:01:49.860> scrubbing<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:51.030> get<00:01:51.180> rid

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
it's needing some scrubbing to get rid

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.719 
it's needing some scrubbing to get rid
of<00:01:51.360> dead<00:01:51.659> skin<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.710> kind<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.130> need<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.430> see

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
of dead skin so you kind of need to see

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.260 
of dead skin so you kind of need to see
what<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.509> doing<00:01:54.600> before<00:01:55.640> applying<00:01:56.640> products

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
what it's doing before applying products

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.330 
what it's doing before applying products
on<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.899> your<00:01:58.079> routine<00:01:58.799> shouldn't<00:01:59.159> always

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
on it so your routine shouldn't always

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.860 
on it so your routine shouldn't always
be<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.090> same

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
be the same

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
shouldn't always use them in the same

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.640 
shouldn't always use them in the same
order<00:02:11.430> because<00:02:11.850> your<00:02:12.090> skin<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.600> changing<00:02:13.500> so
