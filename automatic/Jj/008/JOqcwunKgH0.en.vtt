darkening<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:10.049> there's<00:01:11.049> also<00:01:11.320> some<00:01:11.680> sort<00:01:11.979> of

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
darkening and there's also some sort of

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.730 
darkening and there's also some sort of
texture<00:01:12.670> going<00:01:13.000> on<00:01:13.149> a<00:01:13.390> very<00:01:13.960> rugged<00:01:14.259> looking

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
texture going on a very rugged looking

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.499 
texture going on a very rugged looking

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
texture and it actually looks really

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.709 
texture and it actually looks really
really<00:01:17.350> cool<00:01:17.380> there's<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.430> ten<00:01:19.000> of<00:01:19.240> diamonds
