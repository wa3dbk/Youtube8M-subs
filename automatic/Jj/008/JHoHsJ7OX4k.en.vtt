00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
I guess is about 20 minutes of footage

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.400 
I guess is about 20 minutes of footage
maybe<00:03:49.769> 30<00:03:50.070> no<00:03:50.400> let's<00:03:50.610> say<00:03:50.730> 20<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.720> but<00:03:52.230> frogs

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
maybe 30 no let's say 20 so but frogs

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.470 
maybe 30 no let's say 20 so but frogs
tend<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.950> be<00:03:53.040> reassured<00:03:53.340> anyway<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:53.790> hopefully
