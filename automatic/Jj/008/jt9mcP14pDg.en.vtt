 hello my name is soldier of fair one 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.860
 I have returned approximately after a 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.960
 year and a half without making videos and 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.330
 I was thinking about some 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.369
 interesting proposals good xd 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.170
 let's start today I'm going to 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.720
 talk about games that you can 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.879
 download on your pc are not so delayed 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.739
 to download and everyone has their touch 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.080
 special good without further ado 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.120
 let's start, I recommend you download the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.250
 wings pro is an emulator that is not so 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.129
 heavy and you can read any game 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.470
 of gba game boy color or nintendo ds in 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.269
 the personal I have it and it is incredible 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.610
 with most games I've tried 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.800
 except for those of that because because 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.989
 I usually get stuck a lot because my pc 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.720
 it is very slow compared to other 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.339
 There is a huge range of games but 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.260
 I am fascinated by those who bring me 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.970
 memories of my childhood like all the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.250
 sequel to pokemon or the games of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.200
 dragon ball I will leave you some links in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.030
 the one game designed by the former byte in 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.340
 which you can enter the characters 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.830
 that you want I recommend you download 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.020
 the dragon ball z very in 2012 or yes 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.240
 they want to start from scratch download 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.369
 the last mugen that has left the yang 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.590
 she is a woman who has almost no fault 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.810
 For example, I would never have loved you 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.820
 see a fight between mario and sonic 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 now you can make it come true in this 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.810
 king of fighters or deadly style game 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.000
 kombat my favorite character is the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.280
 supreme kiss and if of the characters 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.170
 they see in my wife they need characters 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.270
 just ask for them to my channel and I'll upload them to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.280
 mediafire now we will proceed with the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.950
 third great game that I recommend that is 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.200
 super smash flash 2 can download 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.090
 on the mac page leod gaming dotcom is 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.189
 very entertaining and good to be a 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.170
 simple flash game possesses many 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.509
 characters but still not found 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.640
 I recommend you to Goku since 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.950
 It has a lot of movements 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.409
 good and has a good speed I think 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.020
 That has been everything I say goodbye 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.020
 Justin Bieber can go fuck xd
