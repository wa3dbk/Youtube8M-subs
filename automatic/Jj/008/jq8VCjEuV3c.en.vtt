T<00:00:22.540> series<00:00:22.900> this<00:00:23.740> retails<00:00:24.430> for<00:00:24.580> around<00:00:25.050> $99<00:00:26.050> I

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
T series this retails for around $99 I

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.980 
T series this retails for around $99 I
had<00:00:27.550> this<00:00:27.700> one<00:00:27.939> for<00:00:28.119> a<00:00:28.180> little<00:00:28.419> while<00:00:28.599> so<00:00:28.900> I'll

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
had this one for a little while so I'll

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.040 
had this one for a little while so I'll
eat<00:00:29.349> thoroughly<00:00:29.949> tested<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.599> I<00:00:31.689> could<00:00:31.869> say

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
eat thoroughly tested and I could say

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.770 
eat thoroughly tested and I could say
it's<00:00:32.260> very<00:00:32.410> small<00:00:32.890> for<00:00:33.129> vacuum<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:34.420> you<00:00:34.629> know

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
it's very small for vacuum and you know

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.259 
it's very small for vacuum and you know
it<00:00:35.620> does<00:00:35.830> the<00:00:36.129> job<00:00:36.339> basically<00:00:36.970> it's<00:00:37.150> an

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
it does the job basically it's an

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.450 
it does the job basically it's an
average<00:00:37.600> vacuum<00:00:38.080> if<00:00:38.830> you<00:00:38.920> want<00:00:39.190> something

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
average vacuum if you want something

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.860 
average vacuum if you want something
better<00:00:39.610> you<00:00:39.879> want<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.089> get<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.239> bigger<00:00:40.480> one<00:00:40.600> with

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
better you want to get a bigger one with

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.070 
better you want to get a bigger one with
a<00:00:40.930> bigger<00:00:41.170> motor<00:00:41.440> and<00:00:41.860> a<00:00:42.010> lot<00:00:42.190> stronger

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
a bigger motor and a lot stronger

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.210 
a bigger motor and a lot stronger
everything<00:00:44.080> is<00:00:44.199> very<00:00:44.230> built<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:44.949> then<00:00:45.070> this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
everything is very built and then this

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:53.760 
everything is very built and then this

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
thing got the brushes here you got this

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.939 
thing got the brushes here you got this
tension<00:00:55.289> over<00:00:56.289> here<00:00:56.680> no<00:00:58.829> everything<00:00:59.829> is

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
tension over here no everything is

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.670 
tension over here no everything is
already<00:01:00.309> worried<00:01:01.120> built<00:01:01.359> in<00:01:04.530> got<00:01:05.530> this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
already worried built in got this

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.300 
already worried built in got this
session<00:01:05.979> right<00:01:06.250> here<00:01:06.280> just<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:07.539> button<00:01:08.310> this

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
session right here just the button this

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.450 
session right here just the button this
is<00:01:09.399> a<00:01:09.430> very<00:01:09.610> compact<00:01:10.119> very<00:01:10.360> I<00:01:11.220> say<00:01:12.220> very

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
is a very compact very I say very

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:21.780 
is a very compact very I say very
economical<00:01:13.360> as<00:01:13.509> well<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:20.520> win<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.610> public

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
economical as well to win the public

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.179 
economical as well to win the public
open<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.610> this<00:01:24.790> is<00:01:24.939> a<00:01:25.439> pie<00:01:26.439> on<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.710> low<00:01:26.860> end<00:01:27.070> of

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
open so this is a pie on the low end of

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.749 
open so this is a pie on the low end of
the<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.610> vacuums<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.360> I<00:01:28.420> saw<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:30.009> doesn't

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
the the vacuums and I saw but doesn't

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.420 
the the vacuums and I saw but doesn't
work<00:01:30.939> yes<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.270> does<00:01:31.920> how<00:01:32.920> does<00:01:32.979> this<00:01:33.220> sound

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430

work yes it does how does this sound
let's<00:01:34.060> plug<00:01:34.240> it<00:01:34.360> in<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.630> try<00:01:34.720> now

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.180 

suction<00:02:06.850> power<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.420> always<00:02:08.020> say<00:02:08.200> out<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.590> out<00:02:08.890> of

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
suction power I always say out it out of

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.030 
suction power I always say out it out of
five<00:02:09.460> I<00:02:09.490> give<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.530> three<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> half<00:02:11.800> of

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
five I give it a three and a half of

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.820 
five I give it a three and a half of
four<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> lot<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.660> suction<00:02:13.930> power<00:02:14.080> even

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
four not a lot of suction power even

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.280 
four not a lot of suction power even
with<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> hand<00:02:15.280> tools<00:02:15.580> tools<00:02:16.570> there<00:02:16.930> aren't<00:02:17.230> a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
with the hand tools tools there aren't a

with the hand tools tools there aren't a
lot<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.650> suction<00:02:17.830> power<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:18.580> vacuum<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
lot of suction power in this vacuum it

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.390 
lot of suction power in this vacuum it
does<00:02:21.430> have<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.640> filter<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.630> wind<00:02:22.930> tunnel<00:02:23.400> if

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
does have a filter is a wind tunnel if

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.730 
does have a filter is a wind tunnel if
you<00:02:24.610> clean<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.970> filter<00:02:25.590> indefinitely<00:02:26.590> you're

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
you clean the filter indefinitely you're

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.320 
you clean the filter indefinitely you're
gonna<00:02:26.830> get<00:02:27.070> better<00:02:27.220> suction<00:02:27.970> out<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.210> this

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
gonna get better suction out of this

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.680 
gonna get better suction out of this
unit<00:02:28.830> but<00:02:29.830> overall<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.640> unit<00:02:30.940> works<00:02:31.510> pretty

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
unit but overall this unit works pretty

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.320
