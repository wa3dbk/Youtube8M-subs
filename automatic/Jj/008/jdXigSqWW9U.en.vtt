00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 to a new day I love this day 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.210
 I have real white this game is 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.000
 really fantastic cibola there is 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.530
 a lot of freedom from a big world 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.490
 open there's a lot of stuff there is 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.180
 lots of people moving 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:23.460
 Egypt can even take a little one 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.150
 small fruit juice but it's 2 hours 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.519
 45 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.740
 so there no but there is no way of 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.980
 now all the pnj continues to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.980
 bar 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.309
 so that's when it puts me 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.410
 problems sir what is it that makes 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:47.370
 himself and try he just farted the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.989
 pear so clearly so I do not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.550
 but it's doing there because there 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.350
 so that's a real problem 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.760
 because I got into a 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.260
 new party and everyone else me 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.160
 still recognizes and everyone is scared 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.030
 so that 's the first benefit 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 is that everyone recognizes it 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.830
 with everyone's scared the second 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.350
 hypothesis is that I'm in shorts and 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.430
 that people take me for a fool 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.500
 maybe because it's two o'clock 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.670
 morning we'll check them all out 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.799
 following these parties then I will see if 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.930
 the pnj changes its behavior 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.430
 which would mean that depending on 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.840
 our holding the pnj can be more or 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.790
 less shocked what would be something 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.770
 positive 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.799
 okay guys you saw there the guy 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.810
 it has nothing to do thus far 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.340
 it's your outfit that will repel or 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.930
 not the pnj 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.479
 we will still do two three tests 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.979
 of verification and there you see there the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.479
 people are not at all shocked so 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.890
 when you're legal 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.560
 finally when you're in a swimsuit 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.640
 tatane the people they tell themselves or the him 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.679
 what he wants he's half at 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.149
 hair 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.039
 so be they afraid of you they will 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.840
 take for a crazy take for a 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.490
 mentally ill or else he 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.020
 they try they are afraid anyway 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.560
 but they are trying to hit you 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.060
 we have elucidate the mystery so 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.590
 here is a relative in poems 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.819
 it really was not normal is 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.259
 maybe because we do not have the 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.259
 right to go shirtless I know 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.549
 nothing you know there are shocks there are 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.470
 places where it's forbidden 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.910
 dad way to los angeles but 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.290
 sometimes real places we do not have 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.450
 the right 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.290
 so I would understand then there is 5 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.480
 35 hours 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.030
 the guy he's raking the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.769
 beach which is quite logical because 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.299
 okay there are some big machines that 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.620
 cleans the whole beach and the guy he is 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.859
 in the process of taking a break 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.780
 cigarette then he design in jersey 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:37.320
 bath so much me I take me for 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.720
 a serial killer when I am when I 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.750
 am in shorts as much everyone he 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.910
 do not care if you tell me it's logical 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.630

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.880
 of the morning so the rockstar the form 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.709
 explain something and then these are 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.320
 normal people to what I mean 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.900
 it's that he does not work for her the 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.600
 selling to name maybe the guy 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.680

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.620
