00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.410
 elga is to make you welcome in this 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.480
 new video here on my channel 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.910
 today we are always on the Sardinian rennes 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.340
 we represent another product of the 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.410
 master cooler always from the siem division 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.320
 storm and we're talking about the quick 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.260
 firepro a mechanical keyboard layout 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.100
 to Italian of course because I'm good at it 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.470
 rehn use keyboards her Italian e 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.989
 presents share mix red attacks 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.409
 who have really very much assistance 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.690
 low are soft yes and are great for 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:56.050
 gaming really is a sphere 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.460
 very very sensitive for those looking for a 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.710
 cashier very sensitive to this 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.589
 really a great choice has a design 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.260
 quite compact but we'll see later 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.830
 meanwhile a bit of specifics to 1 on ebi 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.830
 hard usb 2.0 port and full speed one 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.130
 so the answer is one millisecond 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.100
 present null and starts one 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.960
 red but partial backlight not 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.710
 it is completely back lit as 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.770
 you can see from this photo to a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.340
 wiring system for ours the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.520
 our cable and cable is removable cones 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.260
 it is not completely anchored to the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.300
 keyboard can be disassembled and reassembled 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.080
 when we want like the same keys 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.630
 to clean it or to 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.350
 I don't know what you have to do on ball with 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.730
 the keys disassembled and solid I would abolish it 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.400
 let's start to see what's in the true e 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.590
 own package a small part in 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.700
 class we solved a little while ago and now 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.570
 inside this polystyrene bag 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.730
 I do not know however we have the guarantee 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.580
 and own keyboard that has a design like 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.429
 I have already said quite compact being 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.550
 mechanical audio feedback is rather 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.500
 high therefore for those who are manic of one 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.810
 here is silent keyboard 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.480
 maybe it's not the best but keyboard 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.360
 mechanics however it really really buys 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.480
 all well done is for those who are gaming if 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.980
 don't hoe yourself on the keyboard like I do 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.870
 I saw that the hooves and good can 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.670
 use the mechanical card 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.550
 polyclinic see only yellow behind 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.800
 brands dictated by mine on the keyboard 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.410
 but it is a very very material indeed 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.470
 very durable and very compact e 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.470
 now we will pass see where you threaded 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.260
 the attack for the cable which is really well 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.890
 hidden and very very comfortable as 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.140
 you can well see then a couple now 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.300
 of personal opinions I have tried the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.830
 pastiera for a while and it is very much 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.709
 beautiful 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.989
 it has a really good backlight 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.650
 excellent even during the day with lights 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.810
 when you see it you can see very well if you do 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.190
 of the cashier named unlike 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.040
 of the logitech I'm using a membrane 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.200
 it is very much at a very regulation 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.690
 more powerful and is much more sensitive than 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.360
 a very simple one will switch to a membrane 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.700
 as I said, however, it is more noisy 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.640
 because obviously there are switches 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.790
 mechanics under every meal that are more 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.220
 noisy from the membrane then that 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.410
 was the instruction manual we can 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.840
 say so a guide to use very much 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.480
 fast and here we go to see two pieces 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.880
 strong this is a little gadget 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.110
 to extract our keys 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.600
 keyboard that comes to us 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:59.250
 obviously provided by master cooler as well 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.140
 to say how to be able to clean the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.030
 our our keyboard whenever we want 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.660
 we take it apart and we can clean it 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.550
 put the keys back as we wish, here it is 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.390
 this is just an overview and then 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.640
 we pass a cable completely to the cable 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.720
 extractable man already mentioned by the keyboard 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.329
 gold plated what very much 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.720
 important to avoid oxidation a 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.330
 precisely on the attack is a cable 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.280
 coated above all the fabric thing 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.520
 which as we have already seen for the mouse 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.960
 for sentinel advance two it allows us 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:38.100
 not to create traffic jams in traffic jams like 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.560
 tell of the problems here in the mouse 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.100
 what usually happens that the 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.190
 mouse and thread be torn or yes 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.930
 fold going to affect what 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.480
 is the signal I was rehearsing 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.940
 these are the two keyboards now above the 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.340
 logitech with sister quickfire pro 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.290
 as you can only see both turned on 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.979
 with the light is the quick far.pro you see 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.950
 very well 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.470
 although not very much enlightened 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.650
 while for logitech as you see here yes 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.660
 he barely sees so there is a beautiful one 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.900
 difference between the two but let's pause 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.710
 between which firepro which is the 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.940
 protagonist of this video 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.479
 I must say I was very satisfied 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.000
 now I'll show you how to disassemble i 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.590
 keys with this I do something 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.800
 very comfortable I thought 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.020
 I thought worse than the keyboard in 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.700
 everything and for everything 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.190
 the only flaw is precisely the 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.500
 partial backlighting because I love it 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.300
 the total backlight on the 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.210
 keyboard I got used to this 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.630
 now it is therefore I must say that it is one thing 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.210
 what I want is a lot to have a ladytron 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.460
 the total immersion grace however vi 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.050
 I leave it to the images I approve of this 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.419
 produced especially if you need the 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.150
 keyboard to carry on the tournament or 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.979
 however if you move a lot, I refer you 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.620
 to an upcoming video, if anything, even by aden 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.249
 sardo r nothing in joy and clear enna se 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.529
 with you 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:08.119
 and bayern press it approves this 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:08.119
 quickfire own buy
