 to 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.419
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.150
 video I hope you are very very well this 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:21.240
 Once I bring you a trick how to export 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.560
 the slow motion videos of your iphone 5 s 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.349
 as you know has a function which 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.339
 we can record videos very age of slow 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:32.699
 motion which I put one at the beginning 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.810
 but there is a fight to export them not 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.000
 is so easy 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.340
 and if you want to upload it to instagram it does not 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.870
 it goes up in slow motion it goes up normal if it 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.550
 you want to upload to twitter you also upload 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.710
 normal then there is a way to 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.840
 export it for now yes make the video 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.540
 what you want to raise it to inflate to 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.860
 youtube etcetera not then the way 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.230
 that I have found that you can 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.960
 export is two but this is the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.320
 better for me and well we need our 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.810
 iphone 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.540
 we need a mac to be able to open there 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.310
 months also good 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.890
 first of all let's go to the 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.780
 bookstore let's go to where are the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.430
 video that we want we are going to give 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.850
 select let's choose the video 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.729
 we are going to press the option to share and 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.440
 let's send it by message let's 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.440
 look for ourselves 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.090
 and we are going to send them 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.859
 okay 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.259
 and is going to send the message is going to take 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.450
 it is very heavy they send us for the message 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.039
 it's going to take a little while and they'll see that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.829
 here on the right side right now it's going to 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.409
 get the message but after that 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.659
 It also takes another process 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.939
 Once you no longer get what's coming 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.140
 being the message here is the video what 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.140
 we can reproduce so you can see 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.340
 here it is and now we want to save it in 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.680
 our brand can we are going to give you here 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.050
 open conquest 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.150
 and here I'm fed up with kick we're going 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.510
 to file 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.540
 save and now we are going to select 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.750
 the stock plan and we put your name on 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.750
 first name 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.020
 and we save and ready our video here 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.460
 is as you can see here would be the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.560
 sky desk we can reproduce 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.540
 is the way for me that is easier 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.790
 loses so much resolution that I do have to 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.490
 say it does not look the same as on the iphone 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.370
 true but there it is 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.800
 the end of the day there is the video in slow 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.710
 motion the other way to export a 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.090
 video is with the mobile as we can do 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.180
 this there are two ways but you have to 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.650
 recreate some points first of all there is 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.560
 same that we can download the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.060
 new devices like in 565 is the no 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.670
 the 9 for you 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.320
 The iPad mini retains free shine and 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.470
 for the other positives I think it has 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:57.520
 a cost but it is very little what it costs 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.710
 this application and bill and the second 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.390
 second thing when we had in slow 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.240
 motion in the slow motion option as 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.319
 constantly records 120 images per 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.200
 second 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.939
 It gives you the option to exactly 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.269
 what piece the video wants that goes on 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:17.120
 slow motion when you export that video 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.129
 here it exports everything in the domus I do not 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.139
 you see a normal part and then the piece 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.090
 that we want in the lobe is equal 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.340
 here I will have two options even 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.049
 out there movie we can make a video that 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.180
 not being is how much we can pass on to 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.920
 do is a lot but obviously not 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.200
 sees the same because they are not the same 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.959
 frames per second when you record in a 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.560
 normal video for this this video I 'm going 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.890
 to put here 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.400
 this I recorded it john snow motion and it looks 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.560
 the whole picture everything always looks 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.210
 you look exactly is how much ok 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.340
 how can we edit here when you are 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.590
 making the video if you click 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.990
 down here gives you the speed option 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.120
 they serve us here what since the 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.310
 turtle here appears an X to all 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.710
 the steps in x I can be more than one 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.940
 editor still or can I pass it a 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.940
 normal video as you can see 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.330
 is it happens to be a normal video what 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.730
 that since we like to produce 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.350
 that I liked there at that speed 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.060
 just giving back and here in 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.400
 the option to share 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.680
 give it a touch and here is the hand pass 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.480
 to save video as simple as you 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.300
 we can pass youtube directly to 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.500
 facebook vimeo in airport a message a 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.310
 mail 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.040
 and another buy this video I lived that I 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.480
 I recorded is not how much I'm going to do it 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.530
 so much so that they see it we give equal click 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.260
 normally they come and here in an X 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.150
 they are going to watch the video like that it was just look 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.920
 I was taking off the jale harry potter 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.170
 in case you want to know what was 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.780
 doing is going to click that now what 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.400
 I will pass speed and hear him give no 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.770
 all but there now they see the video of 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.680
 new 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.470
 one 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.460
 but see that gestures do not look the same 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.620
 like when I was more with the option of 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.380
 slow motion and here already simply if you already 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.220
 you liked it more back and here guards 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.810
 Your movie 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.720
 those are the two ways the most viable 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.759
 the best with there are months in which 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.550
 you can export a video of how much the 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:22.810
 of your iphone 5 is I hope you say it 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.810
 it's trick leave your comment
