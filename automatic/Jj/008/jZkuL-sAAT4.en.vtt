can do with it it does a heading hold I
can<00:02:39.319> just<00:02:39.500> hit<00:02:39.650> an<00:02:40.010> auto<00:02:40.280> feature<00:02:40.639> here<00:02:41.030> and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
can just hit an auto feature here and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.770 
can just hit an auto feature here and
it'll<00:02:42.620> do<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.010> heading<00:02:43.400> hold<00:02:43.639> the<00:02:44.359> other<00:02:44.510> thing

it'll do a heading hold the other thing

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.530 
it'll do a heading hold the other thing
we<00:02:44.900> can<00:02:45.019> do<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.230> have<00:02:45.530> routes<00:02:45.939> so<00:02:46.939> in<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.389> this

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
we can do I have routes so in in this

the<00:03:34.879> cursor<00:03:35.389> where<00:03:35.569> you<00:03:35.599> want<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.049> go<00:03:36.199> there<00:03:37.069> we

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
the cursor where you want to go there we

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.740 
the cursor where you want to go there we
go<00:03:37.250> let's<00:03:37.579> say<00:03:37.729> we<00:03:37.849> want<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.060> go<00:03:38.180> here<00:03:38.419> and

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
go let's say we want to go here and

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.379 
go let's say we want to go here and
we're<00:03:38.870> gonna<00:03:38.930> say<00:03:39.199> go<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.819> I'm<00:03:40.819> gonna<00:03:41.000> hit<00:03:41.239> the

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
we're gonna say go to I'm gonna hit the

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.249 
we're gonna say go to I'm gonna hit the
go<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.659> and<00:03:42.939> it's<00:03:43.939> gonna<00:03:44.150> draw<00:03:44.389> a<00:03:44.419> route<00:03:44.750> for<00:03:45.079> me

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:45.259 
go to and it's gonna draw a route for me

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.890 
go to and it's gonna draw a route for me
then<00:03:45.889> what<00:03:46.129> I<00:03:46.159> would<00:03:46.400> do<00:03:46.549> is<00:03:46.729> go<00:03:46.939> to<00:03:47.000> my<00:03:47.150> control

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
then what I would do is go to my control

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.170 
then what I would do is go to my control
unit<00:03:48.379> here<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:49.900> I'm<00:03:50.900> just<00:03:51.079> gonna<00:03:51.169> say<00:03:51.500> mode

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
unit here and I'm just gonna say mode

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.390 
unit here and I'm just gonna say mode
tell<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.329> to<00:03:53.419> navigate<00:03:53.629> that<00:03:54.199> route<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:54.769> now

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
tell it to navigate that route and now

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.129 
tell it to navigate that route and now
the<00:03:55.759> bowl<00:03:55.939> would<00:03:56.090> drive<00:03:56.389> me<00:03:56.629> right<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:57.019> that

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
the bowl would drive me right to that

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.490 
the bowl would drive me right to that
Waypoint<00:03:58.269> another<00:03:59.269> cool<00:03:59.569> feature<00:03:59.810> with<00:04:00.199> the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
Waypoint another cool feature with the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.580 
Waypoint another cool feature with the
nema<00:04:01.040> mm<00:04:01.759> backbone<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.299> we<00:04:02.419> can<00:04:02.569> tie<00:04:02.750> all<00:04:03.349> of

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
nema mm backbone is we can tie all of

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.229 
nema mm backbone is we can tie all of
our<00:04:03.680> different<00:04:04.009> units<00:04:04.310> into<00:04:04.579> it<00:04:04.699> so<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.150> this

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
our different units into it so in this

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.119 
our different units into it so in this
case<00:04:05.449> I<00:04:05.629> have<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.870> Evinrude<00:04:06.409> e-tec<00:04:06.769> stand<00:04:07.069> I

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
case I have the Evinrude e-tec stand I

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.849 
case I have the Evinrude e-tec stand I
have<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.400> icon<00:04:07.849> controls<00:04:08.689> so<00:04:09.259> this<00:04:09.439> is<00:04:09.620> tied

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
have the icon controls so this is tied

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.289 
have the icon controls so this is tied
right<00:04:10.099> into<00:04:10.400> my<00:04:10.519> network<00:04:10.729> so<00:04:11.030> what<00:04:11.180> you'll

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
right into my network so what you'll

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.209 
right into my network so what you'll
notice<00:04:11.479> is<00:04:11.810> when<00:04:11.930> I<00:04:11.989> hit<00:04:12.169> this<00:04:12.349> rpm<00:04:12.859> up<00:04:13.040> and

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.219 
notice is when I hit this rpm up and

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.409 
notice is when I hit this rpm up and
down<00:04:13.340> when<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.669> engines<00:04:14.030> are<00:04:14.150> in<00:04:14.269> neutral

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
down when the engines are in neutral

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.569 
down when the engines are in neutral
it's<00:04:15.079> actually<00:04:15.409> going<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.590> dim<00:04:15.829> all<00:04:16.099> of<00:04:16.430> my

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
it's actually going to dim all of my

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.219 
it's actually going to dim all of my
screens<00:04:16.969> for<00:04:17.269> me<00:04:17.389> so<00:04:17.509> it's<00:04:17.630> going<00:04:17.719> to<00:04:17.780> dim<00:04:17.959> both

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
screens for me so it's going to dim both

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.349 
screens for me so it's going to dim both
of<00:04:18.440> my<00:04:18.560> screens<00:04:18.919> as<00:04:19.190> well<00:04:19.219> as<00:04:19.489> my<00:04:19.849> I<00:04:19.880> command

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
of my screens as well as my I command

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.480 
of my screens as well as my I command
gauges<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.259> everything<00:04:21.650> moved<00:04:21.829> in<00:04:22.039> with<00:04:22.250> just

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
gauges so everything moved in with just

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.950 
gauges so everything moved in with just
one<00:04:22.699> button<00:04:23.000> instead<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.360> dimming<00:04:23.630> each

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
one button instead of dimming each

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.800 
one button instead of dimming each
device<00:04:24.789> again<00:04:25.789> because<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.330> engines<00:04:26.690> are

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
device again because the engines are

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.170 
device again because the engines are
networked<00:04:27.199> in<00:04:27.469> it's<00:04:28.009> pretty<00:04:28.310> neat<00:04:28.580> what<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.849> can

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
networked in it's pretty neat what I can

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.510 
networked in it's pretty neat what I can
do<00:04:29.300> is<00:04:29.419> just<00:04:29.599> hit<00:04:29.750> my<00:04:29.900> pages<00:04:30.199> and<00:04:30.560> I<00:04:31.070> can<00:04:31.310> hit

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
do is just hit my pages and I can hit

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.089 
do is just hit my pages and I can hit

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
for the engines I've got my trim is on

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.990 
for the engines I've got my trim is on
there<00:04:38.419> my<00:04:38.660> speed<00:04:39.069> fuel<00:04:40.069> all<00:04:40.400> that's<00:04:40.610> in<00:04:40.819> here

we<00:04:41.120> can<00:04:41.330> add<00:04:41.509> and<00:04:41.870> change<00:04:42.080> these<00:04:42.379> gauges

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
we can add and change these gauges

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.550 
we can add and change these gauges
however<00:04:43.220> we<00:04:43.460> would<00:04:43.610> like<00:04:43.819> in<00:04:44.150> here<00:04:44.870> so<00:04:45.080> it's

right now I just unmute it and I can
turn<00:05:08.090> up<00:05:08.120> my<00:05:08.360> volume<00:05:08.539> again<00:05:08.870> here<00:05:09.259> you'll<00:05:09.770> be

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
turn up my volume again here you'll be

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.960 
turn up my volume again here you'll be
able<00:05:10.009> to<00:05:10.099> hear<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:11.409> we<00:05:12.409> turn<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.740> down<00:05:12.979> which<00:05:13.849> is
