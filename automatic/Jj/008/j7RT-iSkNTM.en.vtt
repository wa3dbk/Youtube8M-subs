00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.740 

so<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.549> started<00:00:05.850> with<00:00:05.970> just<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.210> very<00:00:06.240> plain

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
so I started with just a very plain

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.629 
so I started with just a very plain
long-sleeve<00:00:07.440> black<00:00:07.740> dress<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.280> found<00:00:08.490> for

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
long-sleeve black dress that I found for

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.860 
long-sleeve black dress that I found for
a<00:00:08.700> couple<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.000> bucks<00:00:09.210> in<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.420> second-hand

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
a couple of bucks in the second-hand

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.520 
a couple of bucks in the second-hand
shop<00:00:10.910> and<00:00:11.910> then<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.059> also<00:00:12.210> got<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.690> secondhand

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
shop and then I also got a secondhand

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.079 
shop and then I also got a secondhand
black<00:00:13.830> shirt<00:00:14.099> made<00:00:14.370> out<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.580> basically<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
black shirt made out of basically the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.230 
black shirt made out of basically the
same<00:00:15.240> material<00:00:15.630> as<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.750> dress<00:00:16.850> so<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.880> took<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
same material as the dress so I took the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.939 
same material as the dress so I took the
black<00:00:18.449> shirt<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.199> cut<00:00:19.439> two<00:00:19.680> large

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
black shirt and I cut two large

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.740 
black shirt and I cut two large
triangles<00:00:20.369> out<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.970> material<00:00:23.600> they<00:00:24.600> look

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
triangles out of the material they look

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.330 
triangles out of the material they look
like<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:28.320> then<00:00:28.470> put<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.830> wrong<00:00:29.010> sides

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
like this and then put the wrong sides

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.919 
like this and then put the wrong sides
of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> fabric<00:00:29.789> together<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.720> pretty

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
of the fabric together so the pretty

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.900 
of the fabric together so the pretty
black<00:00:31.109> side<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:31.679> then<00:00:32.309> take<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> bottle<00:00:32.880> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
black side is out then take a bottle of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.190 
black side is out then take a bottle of
liquid<00:00:33.149> stitch<00:00:33.480> or<00:00:33.690> some<00:00:33.840> other<00:00:33.989> type<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
liquid stitch or some other type of

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.340 
liquid stitch or some other type of
fabric<00:00:34.590> glue<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.059> glue<00:00:36.350> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
fabric glue and just going to glue the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:47.150 
fabric glue and just going to glue the
two<00:00:37.530> triangles<00:00:37.800> together<00:00:45.950> you're<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:46.980> gonna

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
two triangles together you're just gonna

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
two triangles together you're just gonna
go<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> way<00:00:47.579> around<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> triangle<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
go all the way around the triangle and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.360 
go all the way around the triangle and
then<00:00:49.140> you're<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.320> gonna<00:00:49.469> sew<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.980> wide<00:00:50.129> end

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
then you're just gonna sew the wide end

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.830 
then you're just gonna sew the wide end
of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> triangle<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> bottom<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.750> the

of the triangle to the bottom of the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.330 
of the triangle to the bottom of the
sleeve<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.350> dress<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> same

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
sleeve of your dress and do the same

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.770 
sleeve of your dress and do the same
thing<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> other<00:00:53.910> side<00:00:54.059> next<00:00:54.629> cut

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
thing on the other side next cut

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.130 
thing on the other side next cut
yourself<00:00:55.079> four<00:00:55.260> triangles<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.010> pellon

and<00:00:58.140> you're<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> use<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> zig-zag

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and you're just going to use a zig-zag

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.279 
and you're just going to use a zig-zag
stitch<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.550> sew<00:01:00.059> two<00:01:00.120> pipe<00:01:00.600> cleaners<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
stitch to sew two pipe cleaners to the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.439 
stitch to sew two pipe cleaners to the
pellon<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:02.430> cut<00:01:02.640> some<00:01:02.850> triangles<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.390> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
pellon then cut some triangles out of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.939 
pellon then cut some triangles out of
the<00:01:03.510> black<00:01:03.690> material<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.439> bit<00:01:04.650> larger

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the black material a little bit larger

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.340 
the black material a little bit larger
than<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.189> pellon<00:01:05.460> triangles<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.350> sandwich

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
than your pellon triangles and sandwich

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.649 
than your pellon triangles and sandwich
the<00:01:07.530> pellon<00:01:07.799> triangle<00:01:08.340> between<00:01:09.330> two

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the pellon triangle between two

the pellon triangle between two
triangles<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.439> black<00:01:10.830> fabric<00:01:12.979> then<00:01:13.979> you're

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
triangles of black fabric then you're

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.469 
triangles of black fabric then you're
just<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.430> go<00:01:14.549> back<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:15.030> fabric

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
just going to go back to your fabric

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.929 
just going to go back to your fabric
glue<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.110> glue<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.100> two<00:01:17.250> triangles<00:01:17.490> together

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
glue and glue the two triangles together

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.050 
glue and glue the two triangles together
around<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> pellon<00:01:22.369> so<00:01:23.369> take<00:01:23.549> two<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.790> your

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
around the pellon so take two of your

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.929 
around the pellon so take two of your
fabric<00:01:24.570> covered<00:01:24.869> pellon<00:01:25.170> triangles<00:01:25.790> they<00:01:26.790> one

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
fabric covered pellon triangles they one

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.130 
fabric covered pellon triangles they one
on<00:01:27.060> top<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> other<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.869> then<00:01:27.990> you're<00:01:28.080> just

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
on top of the other and then you're just

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.770 
on top of the other and then you're just
gonna<00:01:28.259> sew<00:01:28.560> them<00:01:28.740> together<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> bottom

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
gonna sew them together at the bottom

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.550 
gonna sew them together at the bottom
this<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.049> look<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.229> once<00:01:31.470> they're

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
this is what they look like once they're

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.740 
this is what they look like once they're
sewn<00:01:31.799> together<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.509> sew

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
sewn together and then you just sew

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.280 
sewn together and then you just sew
three<00:01:34.020> snaps<00:01:34.350> along<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> bottom<00:01:36.170> just<00:01:37.170> like

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
three snaps along the bottom just like

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.420 
three snaps along the bottom just like
that<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> three<00:01:40.829> corresponding

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that and so the three corresponding

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.770 
that and so the three corresponding
snaps<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> collar<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.600> your<00:01:42.630> dress<00:01:44.780> so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
snaps to the collar of your dress so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.020 
snaps to the collar of your dress so
then<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.049> take<00:01:46.290> your<00:01:46.439> triangle<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.549> snap<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
then just take your triangle and snap it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.069 
then just take your triangle and snap it
right<00:01:48.149> under<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> collar<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> dress

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
right under the collar of the dress

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.020 
right under the collar of the dress
you'll<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.009> both<00:01:50.130> sides<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.520> course<00:01:53.030> so

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you'll do it to both sides of course so

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
you'll do it to both sides of course so
once<00:01:54.180> you've<00:01:54.270> got<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:54.420> triangle<00:01:55.350> snapped<00:01:55.649> on

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
once you've got your triangle snapped on

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
once you've got your triangle snapped on
you're<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> bend<00:01:57.119> them<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.509> give

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
you're just going to bend them to give

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.240 
you're just going to bend them to give
them<00:01:57.780> some<00:01:57.960> curves<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.890> they<00:01:58.979> should<00:01:59.130> hold

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
them some curves and they should hold

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.620 
them some curves and they should hold
the<00:01:59.399> shape<00:01:59.579> very<00:01:59.880> well<00:02:00.060> because<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
the shape very well because you have the
