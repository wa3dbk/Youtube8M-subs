thank you guys
let's<00:00:03.510> change<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.840> spark<00:00:04.080> plugs<00:00:04.319> on<00:00:04.500> the

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
let's change the spark plugs on the

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.560 
let's change the spark plugs on the
focus<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:05.700> thought<00:00:06.410> yeah<00:00:07.410> why<00:00:07.740> not<00:00:08.570> I'll

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
focus and I thought yeah why not I'll

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.049 
focus and I thought yeah why not I'll
show<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:09.870> guys<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.650> know<00:00:10.769> how<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> do<00:00:11.880> it

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
show you guys you know how to do it

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.189 
show you guys you know how to do it
roughly<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.870> mean<00:00:13.110> I'm<00:00:13.230> not<00:00:13.349> gonna<00:00:13.469> actually

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
roughly I mean I'm not gonna actually

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.710 
roughly I mean I'm not gonna actually
show<00:00:16.199> myself<00:00:16.410> changing<00:00:17.190> one<00:00:17.430> cuz<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.390> have

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
show myself changing one cuz all I have

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.140 
show myself changing one cuz all I have
on<00:00:19.109> me<00:00:19.140> right<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.740> second<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.460> my<00:00:21.000> phone<00:00:22.850> and<00:00:23.850> I

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
on me right the second is my phone and I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.670 
on me right the second is my phone and I
can't<00:00:24.420> find<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> tripod<00:00:25.199> for<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:25.970> anyway

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
can't find the tripod for it so anyway

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.460 
can't find the tripod for it so anyway
so<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> change<00:00:29.099> them<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.369> pretty<00:00:29.640> simple<00:00:30.470> this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
so to change them is pretty simple this

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.299 
so to change them is pretty simple this
is<00:00:31.710> your<00:00:31.980> coil<00:00:32.940> pack<00:00:33.270> /<00:00:34.219> spark<00:00:35.219> plug<00:00:35.460> wire<00:00:37.309> that

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
is your coil pack / spark plug wire that

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.250 
is your coil pack / spark plug wire that
came<00:00:38.700> out<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.180> right<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:41.629> you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.809> see<00:00:43.020> right

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
came out of right here you can see right

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.860 
came out of right here you can see right
here<00:00:43.320> there<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.190> bolt<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.670> holds<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.180> so

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
here there is a bolt that holds it in so

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.920 
here there is a bolt that holds it in so
the<00:00:45.960> first<00:00:46.200> thing<00:00:46.760> let<00:00:47.760> me<00:00:47.879> skip<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> bolt<00:00:48.750> for

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the first thing let me skip the bolt for

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.779 
the first thing let me skip the bolt for
a<00:00:48.989> second<00:00:49.289> first<00:00:49.469> thing<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.800> want<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.190> will

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
a second first thing you want to do will

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.819 
a second first thing you want to do will
show<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.590> push<00:00:52.800> down

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
show you on this one is you push down

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.439 
show you on this one is you push down
this<00:00:53.160> tab<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:56.180> pull<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> wire

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
this tab right here and pull the wire

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:06.830 
this tab right here and pull the wire
off<00:00:58.280> okay<00:00:59.629> then<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:03.359> oh<00:01:05.360> you<00:01:06.360> can't<00:01:06.689> see

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
it anyway it's an 8 millimeter you can

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
it anyway it's an 8 millimeter you can
see<00:01:11.250> I'll<00:01:11.430> show<00:01:11.610> y'all<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:12.000> let's<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.450> it's

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
see I'll show y'all now let's see it's

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.520 
see I'll show y'all now let's see it's
on<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.140> tight<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.189> 8<00:01:14.400> millimeter<00:01:15.530> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
on there tight it's at 8 millimeter and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.640 
on there tight it's at 8 millimeter and
you<00:01:16.680> pull<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.070> bolt<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:19.229> give<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
you pull this bolt out you give this a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.780 
you pull this bolt out you give this a
twist<00:01:20.509> to<00:01:21.509> break<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.840> loose<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> plug<00:01:22.790> pull

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
twist to break it loose on the plug pull

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.499 
twist to break it loose on the plug pull
this<00:01:23.970> out<00:01:24.210> set<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> aside<00:01:26.150> you're<00:01:27.150> gonna<00:01:27.270> need

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
this out set it aside you're gonna need

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.530 
this out set it aside you're gonna need
a<00:01:27.780> long<00:01:28.290> extension<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:30.950> 5/8<00:01:32.299> spark<00:01:33.299> plug

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
a long extension and a 5/8 spark plug

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.789 
a long extension and a 5/8 spark plug
socket<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.630> go<00:01:37.409> down<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:39.799> put

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
socket and then you just go down in put

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.080 
socket and then you just go down in put
a<00:01:40.890> spark<00:01:41.159> plug<00:01:41.340> out<00:01:41.750> put<00:01:42.750> your<00:01:42.780> new<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:47.090> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
a spark plug out put your new one in it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.850 
a spark plug out put your new one in it
don't<00:01:48.329> know<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> gap<00:01:48.899> off<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.500> top<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.740> my

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
don't know the gap off the top of my

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.770 
don't know the gap off the top of my
head<00:01:50.159> I'm<00:01:50.970> gonna<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> google<00:01:51.750> that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
head I'm gonna have to google that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.580 
head I'm gonna have to google that
because<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.490> not<00:01:53.759> under<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> hood<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.930> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
because it is not under the hood like it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.039 
because it is not under the hood like it
should<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.070> oh<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:57.000> wish<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
should be oh I wish I can get this to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.070 
should be oh I wish I can get this to
focus

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.040 

anyway<00:02:01.950> right<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:02.970> it<00:02:03.150> says<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
anyway right here it says that the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.300 
anyway right here it says that the
adjustment<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.190> spark<00:02:05.490> plug<00:02:05.820> gap<00:02:07.310> see

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
adjustment of the spark plug gap see

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.000 
adjustment of the spark plug gap see
spec<00:02:08.729> book<00:02:08.910> no<00:02:09.630> other<00:02:09.840> adjustment<00:02:10.530> needed

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
spec book no other adjustment needed

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.970 
spec book no other adjustment needed
they<00:02:11.220> can't<00:02:11.790> even<00:02:11.970> bother<00:02:12.530> they<00:02:13.530> can<00:02:13.710> tell<00:02:13.890> you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
they can't even bother they can tell you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.650 
they can't even bother they can tell you
to<00:02:14.100> go<00:02:14.220> read<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> book<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.240> couldn't<00:02:15.570> just

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
to go read a book but they couldn't just

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.170 
to go read a book but they couldn't just
put<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.530> know<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:17.060> fifty<00:02:18.060> one<00:02:18.210> thousand<00:02:18.780> sir

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
put you know it's fifty one thousand sir

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.700 
put you know it's fifty one thousand sir
so<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.270> think<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.990> something<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.470> that

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
so I think it is something like that

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.710 
so I think it is something like that
fifty<00:02:23.070> one<00:02:23.220> thousand<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:24.030> I'm<00:02:24.210> gonna<00:02:24.360> double

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
fifty one thousand but I'm gonna double

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.330 
fifty one thousand but I'm gonna double
check<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.650> don't<00:02:25.710> want<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.100> do<00:02:26.190> this

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
check it because I don't want to do this

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.770 
check it because I don't want to do this
again<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.950> 0.5<00:02:28.950> one<00:02:29.520> zero<00:02:30.270> five<00:02:30.450> one<00:02:32.780> so

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
again it is 0.5 one zero five one so

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.240 
again it is 0.5 one zero five one so
anyway<00:02:34.490> that's<00:02:35.490> how<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.820> do<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.590> then<00:02:37.590> put

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
anyway that's how you do it then put
