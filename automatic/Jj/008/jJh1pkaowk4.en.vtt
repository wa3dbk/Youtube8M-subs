change a lot of stuff I'll go through
that<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> little<00:01:25.560> bit<00:01:25.830> later<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> video

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
that a little bit later on in the video

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
that a little bit later on in the video
but<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.479> nice<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.869> able<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> customize

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
but it's nice to be able to customize

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.039 
but it's nice to be able to customize
this<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.979> lollipop<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:30.390> diving<00:01:30.810> into<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this on lollipop now diving into the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
this on lollipop now diving into the
settings<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:31.590> things<00:01:31.920> look<00:01:32.220> pretty<00:01:32.579> similar

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
settings here things look pretty similar

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.760 
settings here things look pretty similar
to<00:01:33.060> stock<00:01:33.420> rom<00:01:33.689> except<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.200> now<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.560> this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
to stock rom except you now have this

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.920 
to stock rom except you now have this
personalization<00:01:35.460> section<00:01:36.090> with<00:01:36.240> chroma<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
personalization section with chroma and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.170 
personalization section with chroma and
layers<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:38.009> layer<00:01:38.220> section<00:01:38.700> actually<00:01:39.000> only

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
layers the layer section actually only

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.730 
layers the layer section actually only
appears<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.990> install<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> layers

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
appears if you install the layers

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.440 
appears if you install the layers
application<00:01:41.460> from<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.850> Play<00:01:42.030> Store<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
application from the Play Store and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.690 
application from the Play Store and
that's<00:01:42.659> basically<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.439> theming<00:01:44.070> engine<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.640> you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that's basically a theming engine so you

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.389 
that's basically a theming engine so you
can<00:01:44.880> theme<00:01:45.200> pretty<00:01:46.200> much<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> entire<00:01:46.649> rom<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
can theme pretty much the entire rom you

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.190 
can theme pretty much the entire rom you
can<00:01:47.549> theme<00:01:47.759> third-party<00:01:48.450> applications<00:01:49.020> with

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
can theme third-party applications with

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690 
can theme third-party applications with
this<00:01:49.350> I'll<00:01:49.770> probably<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> separate<00:01:50.549> video

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
this I'll probably do a separate video

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.069 
this I'll probably do a separate video
on<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.119> because<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.450> kind<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.720> long<00:01:51.869> to

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
on that because it's kind of long to

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.440 
on that because it's kind of long to
explain<00:01:52.200> right<00:01:52.890> now<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:53.939> useful<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
explain right now but it's useful to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.359 
explain right now but it's useful to
have<00:01:54.570> here<00:01:54.869> now<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.710> dive<00:01:55.979> into<00:01:56.189> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
quite the way he wanted it to but we'll

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.680 
quite the way he wanted it to but we'll
move<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.550> from<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.849> underneath<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.509> you've

this on you'll probably be able to see
that<00:05:32.300> a<00:05:32.360> little<00:05:32.600> bit<00:05:32.660> better<00:05:32.900> you<00:05:33.320> have<00:05:33.500> a<00:05:33.530> few

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
that a little bit better you have a few

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.950 
that a little bit better you have a few
options<00:05:33.920> here<00:05:34.550> for<00:05:34.820> the<00:05:34.910> start<00:05:35.180> volume<00:05:35.600> and

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
options here for the start volume and

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.230 
options here for the start volume and
just<00:05:36.710> how<00:05:36.860> long<00:05:37.130> it's<00:05:37.340> going<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.550> ramp<00:05:37.850> up<00:05:38.000> or

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
just how long it's going to ramp up or

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.880 
just how long it's going to ramp up or
how<00:05:38.360> long<00:05:38.510> it<00:05:38.660> takes<00:05:38.900> for<00:05:39.080> it<00:05:39.170> to<00:05:39.200> ramp<00:05:39.500> up<00:05:39.680> so

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
how long it takes for it to ramp up so

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.800 
how long it takes for it to ramp up so
that's<00:05:40.010> pretty<00:05:40.250> cool<00:05:40.420> scrolling<00:05:41.420> down<00:05:41.450> here

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
that's pretty cool scrolling down here

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.000 
that's pretty cool scrolling down here
and<00:05:41.930> other<00:05:42.020> useful<00:05:42.290> features<00:05:42.470> you<00:05:42.980> can

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
and other useful features you can

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.260

actually customize heads up
notifications<00:05:44.990> a<00:05:45.140> little<00:05:45.350> bit<00:05:45.440> you<00:05:45.530> can<00:05:45.650> see

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
notifications a little bit you can see

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.770 
notifications a little bit you can see
you<00:05:46.370> can<00:05:46.400> change<00:05:46.760> the<00:05:46.910> timeout<00:05:47.360> I've<00:05:47.510> got<00:05:47.660> my

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
you can change the timeout I've got my

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.540 
you can change the timeout I've got my
set<00:05:47.990> to<00:05:48.140> 4<00:05:48.410> seconds<00:05:48.740> i<00:05:48.860> think<00:05:49.010> the<00:05:49.070> default<00:05:49.460> is

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
set to 4 seconds i think the default is

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.460 
set to 4 seconds i think the default is
6<00:05:49.820> but<00:05:50.330> you<00:05:50.420> also<00:05:50.540> have<00:05:50.840> a<00:05:50.870> Do<00:05:51.290> Not<00:05:51.320> Disturb

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
6 but you also have a Do Not Disturb

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.530 
6 but you also have a Do Not Disturb
section<00:05:52.280> so<00:05:52.430> certain<00:05:52.820> applications<00:05:53.360> you

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
section so certain applications you

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.090 
section so certain applications you
don't<00:05:53.750> want<00:05:53.960> heads<00:05:54.170> up<00:05:54.320> to<00:05:54.440> show<00:05:54.590> up<00:05:54.740> in<00:05:54.890> for

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
don't want heads up to show up in for
