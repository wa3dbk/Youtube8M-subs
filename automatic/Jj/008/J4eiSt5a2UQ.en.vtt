00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
in my opinion a lot more of a simple

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.840 
in my opinion a lot more of a simple
design<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.010> comparison<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> original

power<00:00:36.390> lines<00:00:36.719> I'm<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.500> sure<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:37.770> they're

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
power lines I'm not sure if they're

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740 
power lines I'm not sure if they're
discontinuing<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.820> power<00:00:39.030> lines<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.510> just

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
discontinuing the power lines and just

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.420 
discontinuing the power lines and just
producing<00:00:40.440> power<00:00:40.590> lines<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.340> point

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
producing power lines to at this point

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.160 
producing power lines to at this point
or<00:00:42.030> they're<00:00:42.239> just<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> produce<00:00:42.719> both<00:00:42.989> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
or they're just going to produce both of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.110 
or they're just going to produce both of
them<00:00:43.290> alongside<00:00:43.559> each<00:00:43.829> other<00:00:44.100> hopefully<00:00:44.820> they

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
them alongside each other hopefully they

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.430 
them alongside each other hopefully they
produce<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.510> would<00:00:45.600> continue<00:00:45.870> producing<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
produce it would continue producing the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.779 
produce it would continue producing the
power<00:00:46.649> lines<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.399> still<00:00:47.579> want<00:00:47.730> to

nike<00:03:24.090> free<00:03:24.359> outsole<00:03:24.780> which<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:25.049> somewhat

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
nike free outsole which is somewhat

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.869 
nike free outsole which is somewhat
unusual<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.949> me<00:03:25.979> i'm<00:03:26.220> not<00:03:26.250> sure<00:03:26.549> why<00:03:26.699> they

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
unusual to me i'm not sure why they

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.699 
unusual to me i'm not sure why they
didn't<00:03:27.120> upgrade<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.629> to<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.930> newer<00:03:28.109> style<00:03:28.470> on

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
didn't upgrade it to the newer style on

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.179 
didn't upgrade it to the newer style on
the<00:03:29.280> current<00:03:29.609> nike<00:03:29.909> free<00:03:30.209> run<00:03:30.650> again<00:03:31.650> i<00:03:31.919> don't

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
the current nike free run again i don't

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.949 
the current nike free run again i don't
really<00:03:32.459> have<00:03:32.639> any<00:03:32.819> answers<00:03:32.970> as<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.599> why<00:03:33.930> that

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
really have any answers as to why that

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.809 
really have any answers as to why that
is<00:03:34.319> obviously<00:03:34.829> this<00:03:34.979> isn't<00:03:35.159> a<00:03:35.280> performance

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
is obviously this isn't a performance

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.069 
is obviously this isn't a performance
you<00:03:35.970> show<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.449> it<00:03:36.510> shouldn't<00:03:36.750> really<00:03:36.780> matter

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
you show so it shouldn't really matter

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.960 
you show so it shouldn't really matter
all<00:03:37.379> that<00:03:37.409> much<00:03:37.709> but<00:03:38.370> i<00:03:38.430> definitely<00:03:38.699> prefer

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
all that much but i definitely prefer

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.939 
all that much but i definitely prefer
the<00:03:39.329> newer<00:03:39.599> outsole<00:03:40.139> as<00:03:40.319> opposed<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.829> the

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
the newer outsole as opposed to the

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.800 
the newer outsole as opposed to the
older<00:03:41.250> version<00:03:41.280> but<00:03:42.090> again<00:03:42.329> i<00:03:42.359> can't<00:03:42.659> complain

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
older version but again i can't complain

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.140 
older version but again i can't complain
all<00:03:43.229> that<00:03:43.409> much<00:03:43.620> it's<00:03:44.280> pretty<00:03:44.459> much<00:03:44.579> all<00:03:44.790> that

I'm<00:04:11.430> not<00:04:11.609> really<00:04:11.759> sure<00:04:11.849> what<00:04:12.090> kind<00:04:12.180> of

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
I'm not really sure what kind of

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.490 
I'm not really sure what kind of
durability<00:04:12.599> they're<00:04:12.930> going<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.109> bring<00:04:13.259> but

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
durability they're going to bring but

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.199 
durability they're going to bring but
again<00:04:13.709> it's<00:04:14.189> pretty<00:04:14.400> much<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.579> exact<00:04:15.030> same

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
again it's pretty much the exact same

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.719 
again it's pretty much the exact same
outsole<00:04:15.659> as<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.169> older<00:04:17.130> versions<00:04:17.489> of<00:04:17.609> the

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.189 
outsole as the older versions of the
nike<00:04:18.030> free<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:18.449> if<00:04:18.509> you<00:04:18.599> really<00:04:18.840> like<00:04:19.019> those

nike free so if you really like those

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.870

don't<00:04:19.530> like<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.769> new<00:04:19.889> one<00:04:20.070> then<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.699> power

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
don't like the new one then the power

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.219 
don't like the new one then the power
lines<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.359> definitely<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.719> good<00:04:21.840> option<00:04:21.870> for

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
lines is definitely a good option for

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.140 
lines is definitely a good option for
you<00:04:22.560> if<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:23.130> want<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.370> stick<00:04:23.550> with<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.789> exact

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
same outsole as a runner but that's

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.530 
same outsole as a runner but that's
pretty<00:04:26.310> much<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.520> as<00:04:26.729> far<00:04:26.760> as<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.090> inbox

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
pretty much it as far as the inbox

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.540 
pretty much it as far as the inbox
portion<00:04:27.930> goes<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.620> move<00:04:28.830> on<00:04:28.980> to<00:04:29.130> a<00:04:29.160> quick<00:04:29.400> on

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.100 
portion goes and move on to a quick on
feet<00:04:29.850> so<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.060> can<00:04:30.180> get<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.300> better<00:04:30.480> idea<00:04:30.570> as<00:04:31.080> to

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
feet so you can get a better idea as to

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.530 
feet so you can get a better idea as to
how<00:04:31.410> these<00:04:31.620> shoes<00:04:31.860> look<00:04:32.130> here's<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.090> look<00:04:33.300> at

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
how these shoes look here's a look at

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.990 
how these shoes look here's a look at
the<00:04:33.810> power<00:04:34.110> lines<00:04:34.470> on<00:04:34.800> feet<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.670> think<00:04:35.880> they

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
the power lines on feet and I think they

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.490 
the power lines on feet and I think they
look<00:04:36.120> really<00:04:36.450> really<00:04:36.690> good<00:04:36.780> there's<00:04:37.320> really

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
look really really good there's really

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.500 
look really really good there's really
only<00:04:37.620> one<00:04:37.950> way<00:04:38.160> to<00:04:38.430> lace<00:04:38.700> them<00:04:38.730> up<00:04:39.060> because

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
only one way to lace them up because

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.510 
only one way to lace them up because
there<00:04:39.810> are<00:04:39.960> no<00:04:40.140> actual<00:04:40.470> lace<00:04:40.740> holds<00:04:41.040> laces<00:04:41.400> are

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
there are no actual lace holds laces are

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.340 
there are no actual lace holds laces are
kind<00:04:41.700> of<00:04:41.730> directly<00:04:42.180> in<00:04:42.330> contact<00:04:42.360> with<00:04:43.200> the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
kind of directly in contact with the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.530 
kind of directly in contact with the
dynamic<00:04:43.830> flywire<00:04:44.010> if<00:04:44.760> you<00:04:44.880> left<00:04:45.120> them<00:04:45.240> unless

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
dynamic flywire if you left them unless

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.300 
dynamic flywire if you left them unless
they<00:04:45.780> would<00:04:45.870> kind<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.110> fall<00:04:46.350> out<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.890> then<00:04:47.220> the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
they would kind of fall out and then the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.100 
they would kind of fall out and then the
dynamic<00:04:47.790> flywire<00:04:47.970> could<00:04:48.390> potentially<00:04:48.840> fall

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
dynamic flywire could potentially fall

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.050 
dynamic flywire could potentially fall
and<00:04:49.410> on<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.680> inside<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.250> shoe<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.940> it

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
and on the inside of the shoe and it

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.520 
and on the inside of the shoe and it
would<00:04:51.150> just<00:04:51.240> be<00:04:51.360> a<00:04:51.390> pain<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:51.900> butt<00:04:52.140> to<00:04:52.200> try

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
would just be a pain in the butt to try

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.410 
would just be a pain in the butt to try
and<00:04:52.620> get<00:04:52.770> back<00:04:52.950> out<00:04:53.160> so<00:04:53.730> for<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:53.970> most<00:04:54.090> part<00:04:54.270> I

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
and get back out so for the most part I

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.550 
and get back out so for the most part I
would<00:04:54.540> definitely<00:04:54.660> recommend<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.380> wearing

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
would definitely recommend just wearing

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.590 
would definitely recommend just wearing
them<00:04:55.770> laced<00:04:56.010> up<00:04:56.190> as<00:04:56.700> normal<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.330> think<00:04:57.510> they

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
them laced up as normal and I think they

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.870 
them laced up as normal and I think they
look<00:04:57.750> pretty<00:04:57.810> good<00:04:58.230> that<00:04:58.440> way<00:04:58.650> it<00:04:59.340> is<00:04:59.490> a<00:04:59.520> Nike
