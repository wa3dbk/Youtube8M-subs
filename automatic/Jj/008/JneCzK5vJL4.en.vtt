00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.740
 power now our goal was to get 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.219
 studies 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.800

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.410
 Libya's mission to opt for the April curiel programming 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.009
 here history

 and how do we get through in the city 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.879
 with an annotated at night near the 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.089
 nine thirty at night 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.699
 here in buenos aires 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.630
 there's the extra background you can see 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.360
 the obelisk 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.810

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.370
 on the main avenue 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.160
 close to buenos aires nov 11 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.230
 that is eighth lost to hang 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.340
 we are going 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.180
 in search of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.730
 from the subway 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.730
 that Argentines have the Inca Trail down 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.450
 I think the low state of the earth is latent 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.950
 the subway 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.950
 ap 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 everything happening to the second level 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.070
 skimming the second level 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.650
 percent 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.650
 that promises to have 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.829
 and as such extreme that we are not aware of the provision of destinations 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.000
 simple 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.630
 ferrández as the Argentines call it 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 I'm not own stories 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.070
 can draw attention to how little is going on and we are seeing a 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.070
 underground efe 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.750
 efe another collective 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.809
 the truth 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.119
 said 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.289
 we were very lucky to find it accommodating 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:06.739
 suddenly up to Buenos Aires 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.589
 I did not have much in Europe commented 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.299
 how the system worked 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.299
 its structure 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.779
 - asturias 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.279
 and the walk through the subway is a unique experience 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.379
 When you can come to Buenos Aires does not distinguish 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.459
 we have arrived at the Federico Lacroze station 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.569

 in the southern ideas studios the south ideas channel 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.639
 We are really looking forward to getting to know this beautiful city of Buenos Aires, but 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:04.619
 as well 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.119
 as we walk we also worry about our safety 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:12.489
 and is that the natives of the sector where it reaches Murcia by the sector 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.359
 then your state are allying themselves south they recommended to us that we had 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.529
 many precautions at the end 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:20.979
 we've just arrived 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.669

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.929
 dt marcelo tinelli's program after eight districts that 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.800
 we believe we have seen and found 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.199
 on the southern ideas channel 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.689
 and all this as you know informed 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:41.639
 if we arrive on time 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.639
 8 12 one thing 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.379
