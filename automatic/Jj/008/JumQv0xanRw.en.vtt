00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
not just to dynamics but to speed as

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:28.380

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
same drum kit I want to simulate the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.699 
same drum kit I want to simulate the
environment<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.330> best<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.750> can<00:03:30.810> my

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
environment to the best that I can my

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.350 
environment to the best that I can my
neighbors<00:03:32.040> will<00:03:32.250> not<00:03:32.340> complain<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.180> kid

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
neighbors will not complain and the kid

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.880 
neighbors will not complain and the kid
can<00:03:33.510> really<00:03:33.780> take<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.019> beating<00:03:34.290> because<00:03:34.560> I

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
can really take the beating because I

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:49.360 
can really take the beating because I
hit<00:03:35.160> really<00:03:35.489> hard<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.750> it's<00:03:36.930> all<00:03:37.080> possible<00:03:37.319> now

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.780 

this<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.780> revolutionary
