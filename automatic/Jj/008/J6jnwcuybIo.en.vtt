watching mom one of the questions that
we<00:00:26.740> were<00:00:26.860> looking<00:00:27.100> at<00:00:27.220> as<00:00:27.369> individuals<00:00:27.970> is<00:00:28.270> how

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
we were looking at as individuals is how

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.849 
we were looking at as individuals is how
do<00:00:28.570> they<00:00:28.750> learn<00:00:28.900> from<00:00:29.080> one<00:00:29.230> another<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.560> how

orangutangs

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.320 
orangutangs
are<00:01:28.450> superb<00:01:29.020> copycats<00:01:30.070> but<00:01:30.610> only<00:01:31.030> when<00:01:31.210> it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
are superb copycats but only when it

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.600 
are superb copycats but only when it
serves<00:01:31.630> their<00:01:31.930> purposes<00:01:32.560> it's<00:01:33.130> known<00:01:33.370> from

serves their purposes it's known from

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.550 
serves their purposes it's known from
other<00:01:33.760> research<00:01:34.240> studies<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.630> apes<00:01:35.230> won't

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
other research studies that apes won't

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.950 
other research studies that apes won't
actually<00:01:35.790> imitate<00:01:36.790> unnecessary<00:01:37.420> actions<00:01:37.840> if

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
actually imitate unnecessary actions if

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.150 
actually imitate unnecessary actions if
they<00:01:38.050> know<00:01:38.200> it's<00:01:38.350> unnecessary

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
they know it's unnecessary

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.340 
they know it's unnecessary
so<00:01:39.640> does<00:01:39.790> this<00:01:39.970> orangutan<00:01:40.540> behavior<00:01:40.990> tell<00:01:41.230> us

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
so does this orangutan behavior tell us

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.260 
so does this orangutan behavior tell us
anything<00:01:41.650> about<00:01:42.070> how<00:01:42.250> much<00:01:42.460> humans<00:01:42.970> have

anything about how much humans have

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.690 
anything about how much humans have
evolved<00:01:43.840> Dindo<00:01:44.770> says<00:01:45.010> studies<00:01:45.430> show<00:01:45.670> that

peach other just to be part of the group
with<00:01:51.400> humans<00:01:51.820> what<00:01:52.000> we<00:01:52.030> see<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:52.659> people

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
with humans what we see is that people

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.540 
with humans what we see is that people
want<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.260> do<00:01:53.380> as<00:01:53.500> others<00:01:53.710> do<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.070> this<00:01:54.159> starts

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
want to do as others do and this starts

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.580 
want to do as others do and this starts
around<00:01:54.760> three<00:01:55.150> years<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.540> age<00:01:55.690> when<00:01:56.260> we<00:01:56.350> start

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
around three years of age when we start

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.800 
around three years of age when we start
identifying<00:01:56.830> ourselves<00:01:57.729> with<00:01:57.880> others<00:01:58.180> so

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
identifying ourselves with others so
