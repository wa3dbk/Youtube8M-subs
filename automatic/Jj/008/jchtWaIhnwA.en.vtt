00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the way I lit this as you're kind of

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.130 
the way I lit this as you're kind of
looking<00:00:50.850> at<00:00:50.999> the<00:00:51.120> video<00:00:51.449> we'll<00:00:51.659> be<00:00:51.690> looking<00:00:51.929> at

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
looking at the video we'll be looking at

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.919 
looking at the video we'll be looking at
some<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.679> in<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.069> little<00:00:53.129> bit<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
some more this in just a little bit is

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.069 
some more this in just a little bit is
basically<00:00:55.190> having<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.550> main<00:00:56.850> light<00:00:57.179> being

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
basically having one main light being

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.479 
basically having one main light being
pumped<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.679> through<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.659> outside<00:01:00.659> window

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
pumped in through this outside window

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.430 
pumped in through this outside window
going<00:01:02.489> through<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.359> diffusion<00:01:03.989> screen<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
going through a diffusion screen and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.050 
going through a diffusion screen and
that'll<00:01:07.440> be<00:01:07.530> our<00:01:07.560> main<00:01:07.830> light<00:01:08.490> source<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that'll be our main light source and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.399 
that'll be our main light source and
then<00:01:09.149> I've<00:01:09.270> got<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.509> couple<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.990> other<00:01:10.110> lights

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
then I've got a couple of other lights

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.800 
then I've got a couple of other lights
which<00:01:10.950> we'll<00:01:11.159> get<00:01:11.280> into<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:11.850> act<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.450> fill

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
which we'll get into that or act as fill

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.399 
which we'll get into that or act as fill
and<00:01:14.240> this<00:01:15.240> would<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.810> main<00:01:15.960> light<00:01:16.170> we're

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and this would be the main light we're

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.520 
and this would be the main light we're
gonna<00:01:16.500> go<00:01:16.740> back<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.219> take<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.430> look<00:01:17.759> at<00:01:18.530> this

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
gonna go back and take a look at this

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.010 
gonna go back and take a look at this
particular<00:01:20.159> setup<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.329> large<00:01:21.659> piece<00:01:21.990> of

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
particular setup I have a large piece of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.300 
particular setup I have a large piece of
ripstop<00:01:22.680> nylon<00:01:23.869> which<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.110> taped<00:01:25.740> up<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.159> this

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
ripstop nylon which I taped up to this

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.670 
ripstop nylon which I taped up to this
particular<00:01:26.640> window<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
particular window and then on the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.620 
particular window and then on the
outside<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> hallway<00:01:29.640> I've<00:01:30.030> got<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> Dino

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
outside in the hallway I've got a Dino

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.240 
outside in the hallway I've got a Dino
light<00:01:31.219> flash<00:01:32.219> head<00:01:32.600> with<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> full<00:01:34.140> CTO<00:01:34.649> filter

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
light flash head with a full CTO filter

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.380 
light flash head with a full CTO filter
on<00:01:35.399> it<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:36.229> think<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.350> end<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:37.740> using<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.430> half<00:01:38.909> CTO

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
on it I think we end up using a half CTO

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.179 
on it I think we end up using a half CTO
at<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.899> time<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:40.619> actually<00:01:41.009> did

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
at the time that we actually did

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.749 
at the time that we actually did
photograph<00:01:42.020> but<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.799> outside<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
photograph but from this outside of the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.950 
photograph but from this outside of the
conference<00:01:45.509> room

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.069 
conference room
this<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.320> our<00:01:46.500> main<00:01:46.710> light<00:01:47.369> source<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:48.210> then

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
this was our main light source and then

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.399 
this was our main light source and then
just<00:01:49.500> above<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.219> center<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.509> conference

table I have a scissor clamp fastened to
the<00:01:56.100> ceiling<00:01:56.549> panels<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.359> on<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.679> I<00:01:58.710> have

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
another flash head which is bounced into

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.260 
another flash head which is bounced into
the<00:02:01.320> ceiling<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> has<00:02:02.460> some<00:02:02.729> neutral<00:02:03.060> density

the ceiling it has some neutral density

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.200 
the ceiling it has some neutral density
filters<00:02:03.869> up<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.259> top<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.890> then<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> left

session and you can see that the you can
you<00:02:36.620> know<00:02:36.740> deconstruct<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.550> lighting<00:02:37.910> you

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
you know deconstruct the lighting you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.150 
you know deconstruct the lighting you
know<00:02:38.150> how<00:02:38.300> it's<00:02:38.480> set<00:02:38.690> up<00:02:38.720> now<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:39.740> can<00:02:39.770> kind<00:02:40.100> of

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
know how it's set up now you can kind of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.500 
know how it's set up now you can kind of
take<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.400> look<00:02:40.580> at<00:02:40.730> where<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.000> light<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.300> coming

take a look at where the light is coming
from<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.140> kind<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.040> effect<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.550> i

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
from and the kind of effect that i

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.410 
from and the kind of effect that i
achieved<00:02:44.450> with<00:02:44.720> this<00:02:44.930> if<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.980> have<00:02:46.130> any

achieved with this if you have any

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.850 
achieved with this if you have any
situations<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.750> your<00:02:47.930> lighting<00:02:48.620> for<00:02:48.800> a

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
situations that your lighting for a

as<00:02:50.750> an<00:02:50.870> approach<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.500> solving<00:02:52.130> your<00:02:52.310> lighting

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
as an approach to solving your lighting

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.110 
as an approach to solving your lighting
problems<00:02:53.060> hope<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.720> enjoyed<00:02:53.989> it
