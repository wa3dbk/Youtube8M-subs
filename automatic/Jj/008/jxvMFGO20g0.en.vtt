00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.220 
heard some people say a dr stands for
automated<00:00:13.740> dialogue<00:00:14.519> replacement<00:00:15.230> I've

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
automated dialogue replacement I've

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.970 
automated dialogue replacement I've
heard<00:00:16.470> people<00:00:16.680> say<00:00:17.449> additional<00:00:18.449> dialogue

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
heard people say additional dialogue

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
heard people say additional dialogue
recording<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.960> I<00:00:21.960> think<00:00:22.740> wikipedia<00:00:23.460> says<00:00:23.789> it

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
recording and I think wikipedia says it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.550 
recording and I think wikipedia says it
stands<00:00:24.359> for<00:00:24.720> Advanced<00:00:25.500> Dungeons<00:00:25.949> &amp;<00:00:26.519> rabbits

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
stands for Advanced Dungeons &amp; rabbits

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.429

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
but either way it doesn't really matter

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.910 
but either way it doesn't really matter

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
she just basically tries to mimic that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.969 
she just basically tries to mimic that
verbatim<00:01:59.670> exactly<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.750> way<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.259> she<00:02:01.829> heard

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
verbatim exactly the way that she heard

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.100 
verbatim exactly the way that she heard
it<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.369> she<00:02:02.460> repeats<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.299> into<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it so she repeats that into the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.920 
it so she repeats that into the
microphone<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.890> then<00:02:05.549> surprisingly<00:02:06.540> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
microphone and then surprisingly it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.990 
microphone and then surprisingly it
matches<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.350> perfectly<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:08.879> just

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
matches up perfectly and it's it's just

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.479 
matches up perfectly and it's it's just
it's<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.629> great<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.099> best<00:02:11.340> way

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
