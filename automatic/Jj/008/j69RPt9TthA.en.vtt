they're tight to the hostess stretch I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.300

thought I couldn't have gotten that much

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.770 
thought I couldn't have gotten that much
bigger<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.909> put<00:01:27.060> them<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.600> they

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
bigger and I put them on and they

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.380

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
wedding as I was upset and yeah I guess

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.859 
wedding as I was upset and yeah I guess
you<00:01:40.950> wanting<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.250> dress<00:01:41.490> did<00:01:41.729> fit<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> think<00:01:42.840> I

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
you wanting the dress did fit I think I

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.870 
you wanting the dress did fit I think I
mentioned<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.040> was<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> size<00:01:44.340> 4<00:01:44.700> and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
mentioned that and it was a size 4 and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.969 
mentioned that and it was a size 4 and
that<00:01:45.509> would<00:01:45.630> oppress<00:01:45.960> me<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:46.770> it's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
that would oppress me because it's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.889 
that would oppress me because it's
woman's<00:01:47.250> size<00:01:47.490> 4<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.820> I'm<00:01:48.090> first<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.810> all<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
woman's size 4 and I'm first of all a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.080 
woman's size 4 and I'm first of all a
junior<00:01:49.290> size<00:01:49.560> person<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> junior

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
junior size person and so the junior

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.340 
junior size person and so the junior
size<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.360> probably<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> bigger<00:01:51.899> army<00:01:52.229> which

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
size is probably the bigger army which

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.770 
size is probably the bigger army which
is<00:01:52.409> likely<00:01:52.649> depressing<00:01:53.149> public<00:01:54.149> junior<00:01:54.509> size

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
is likely depressing public junior size

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.990 
is likely depressing public junior size
5<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.079> something<00:01:55.649> good<00:01:56.100> or<00:01:56.280> maybe<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.880> don't

I<00:03:50.040> don't<00:03:50.280> know<00:03:50.340> I've<00:03:50.459> not<00:03:50.580> weighed<00:03:50.790> myself

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
I don't know I've not weighed myself

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.360 
I don't know I've not weighed myself
ended<00:03:51.299> up<00:03:51.390> being<00:03:51.599> a<00:03:51.780> bad<00:03:52.019> idea<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:53.189> haven't

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
ended up being a bad idea so I haven't

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.399 
ended up being a bad idea so I haven't
weighed<00:03:53.519> myself<00:03:53.549> but<00:03:54.420> cuz<00:03:54.900> I'm<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.170> tallest

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
weighed myself but cuz I'm the tallest

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.270 
weighed myself but cuz I'm the tallest
um<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:56.610> all<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.239> everybody<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.890> it<00:03:59.069> makes

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
um of all the everybody so it makes

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.070 
um of all the everybody so it makes
sense<00:03:59.340> if<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.790> weighed<00:03:59.970> more<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.870> fact

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
sense if I weighed more it's the fact

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.300 
sense if I weighed more it's the fact
that<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:01.260> weigh<00:04:01.439> more<00:04:01.620> doesn't<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.069> feel<00:04:02.220> like

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310
