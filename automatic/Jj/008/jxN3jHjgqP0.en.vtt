00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
it is super simple if you feel like your

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.990 
it is super simple if you feel like your
communities<00:00:37.920> might<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.190> slightly<00:00:38.460> dirty<00:00:38.790> you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
communities might be slightly dirty you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.700 
communities might be slightly dirty you
can<00:00:39.059> always<00:00:39.360> take<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.690> wet<00:00:39.960> rag<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.559> then

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
can always take out wet rag and then

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.770 
can always take out wet rag and then
just<00:00:40.920> lightly<00:00:41.399> brush<00:00:41.760> off<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.030> backs<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.600> them

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
just lightly brush off the backs of them

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.779 
just lightly brush off the backs of them
to<00:00:43.500> clean<00:00:43.680> up<00:00:43.800> any<00:00:43.980> remaining<00:00:44.309> dirt<00:00:44.640> that

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
to clean up any remaining dirt that

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.360 
to clean up any remaining dirt that
might<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.090> clung<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.480> them<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.890> our<00:00:47.100> stuffing

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
might have clung to them so our stuffing

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.389 
might have clung to them so our stuffing
is<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> consist<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:49.010> little<00:00:50.010> bit<00:00:50.219> of
