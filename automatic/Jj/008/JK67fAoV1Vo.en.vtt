before um I do I agree one hundred and
ten<00:00:51.149> percent<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.629> think<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> strongest<00:00:52.350> moment

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
ten percent I think the strongest moment

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.270 
ten percent I think the strongest moment
of<00:00:52.890> our<00:00:53.039> routine<00:00:53.489> no<00:00:53.670> was<00:00:54.360> probably<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.280> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
of our routine no was probably the the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.250 
of our routine no was probably the the
phrase<00:00:56.610> where<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.149> take<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> pirouettes<00:00:57.989> into

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
phrase where we take the pirouettes into

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.590 
phrase where we take the pirouettes into
the<00:00:58.410> hold<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> jump<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.640> just<00:01:00.149> feel<00:01:00.329> so

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
