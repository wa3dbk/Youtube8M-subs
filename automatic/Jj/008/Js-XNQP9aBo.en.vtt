number one viewed video but I have had
this<00:02:00.560> for<00:02:00.909> several<00:02:01.909> years<00:02:02.180> now<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:03.860> know

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
this for several years now and you know

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.219 
this for several years now and you know
over<00:02:04.220> time<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.850> rolls<00:02:05.390> have<00:02:05.509> come<00:02:05.720> off<00:02:05.900> and<00:02:06.200> I

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
over time the rolls have come off and I

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.050 
over time the rolls have come off and I
just<00:02:06.409> haven't<00:02:06.590> glued<00:02:06.950> them<00:02:07.220> back<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.970> I

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
just haven't glued them back on and I

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.119 
just haven't glued them back on and I
think<00:02:08.119> I've<00:02:08.390> just<00:02:08.420> outgrown<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:09.049> so<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.590> think

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
think I've just outgrown it so I think

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.129 
think I've just outgrown it so I think
I'm<00:02:10.640> going<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.879> finally<00:02:11.269> say<00:02:11.450> farewell<00:02:11.870> and

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:12.139 
I'm going to finally say farewell and

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:16.430 
I'm going to finally say farewell and
put<00:02:12.739> this<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:15.290> organizer

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
put this in this organizer

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.160 
put this in this organizer
I<00:02:16.790> think<00:02:17.790> I'm<00:02:17.880> going<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.120> stick<00:02:18.300> my<00:02:18.330> pallets<00:02:18.960> up

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
I think I'm going to stick my pallets up

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:50.060 
I think I'm going to stick my pallets up
in<00:02:19.440> here<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.190> let's<00:02:20.850> do<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.680> that's<00:02:49.800> already

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
in here so let's do it so that's already

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.830 
in here so let's do it so that's already
a<00:02:50.250> lot<00:02:50.610> more<00:02:50.910> compact<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:53.360> think<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.660> don't

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
a lot more compact I think I don't

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.400 
a lot more compact I think I don't
really<00:02:55.140> have<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> good<00:02:56.810> solution<00:02:57.810> for<00:02:58.290> my

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
really have a good solution for my

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.170 
really have a good solution for my
brushes<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:59.160> need<00:02:59.340> better<00:02:59.490> beads<00:02:59.880> in<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
brushes I need better beads in the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.480 
brushes I need better beads in the
bottom<00:03:00.510> those<00:03:01.320> clearly<00:03:01.770> aren't<00:03:01.920> working<00:03:02.340> and

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
bottom those clearly aren't working and

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.970 
bottom those clearly aren't working and
I<00:03:02.550> have<00:03:02.730> too<00:03:03.000> many<00:03:03.210> brushes<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.080> think<00:03:04.710> for<00:03:04.860> now

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
I have too many brushes so think for now

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.260 
I have too many brushes so think for now

fit in my Sterilite drawers like this

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.180 
fit in my Sterilite drawers like this
blush<00:03:32.489> duo<00:03:32.820> from<00:03:33.209> Sephora<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.320> really<00:03:34.620> chunky

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
blush duo from Sephora is really chunky

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.860

and all the false lashes and things like

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.260 
and all the false lashes and things like
that<00:03:38.090> next<00:03:39.090> I'm<00:03:39.330> going<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.510> put<00:03:39.750> all<00:03:39.959> of<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
that next I'm going to put all of the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:04:04.589 
that next I'm going to put all of the
hair<00:03:42.270> products<00:03:42.690> into<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.320> big<00:03:43.470> blue<00:03:43.739> tray

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.960 

so<00:04:05.599> they<00:04:05.930> don't<00:04:06.110> take<00:04:06.319> up<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.680> whole<00:04:06.890> tray<00:04:07.430> so

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
so they don't take up the whole tray so

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.880 
so they don't take up the whole tray so
I<00:04:08.000> think<00:04:08.150> I<00:04:08.360> bring<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.810> brushes<00:04:09.319> up<00:04:09.440> from<00:04:09.709> down

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
I think I bring the brushes up from down

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.860 
I think I bring the brushes up from down
here<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.430> put<00:04:10.580> them<00:04:10.760> right<00:04:10.910> there<00:04:10.970> they're

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
here and put them right there they're

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.850 
here and put them right there they're
still<00:04:12.260> within<00:04:12.800> reach<00:04:13.900> but<00:04:14.900> they're<00:04:15.319> off<00:04:15.530> the

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
still within reach but they're off the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.140 
still within reach but they're off the
desktop<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:16.729> that<00:04:16.880> makes<00:04:17.449> more<00:04:17.660> room<00:04:17.870> for<00:04:17.900> me

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
desktop so that makes more room for me

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.659 
desktop so that makes more room for me

moisturizers and foundations and things
like<00:05:37.700> that<00:05:38.139> because<00:05:39.139> that<00:05:39.349> fits<00:05:39.530> pretty<00:05:39.710> well

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
like that because that fits pretty well

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:40.990 
like that because that fits pretty well
the<00:05:39.979> only<00:05:40.130> thing<00:05:40.250> that's<00:05:40.370> not<00:05:40.460> fitting<00:05:40.820> is

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
the only thing that's not fitting is

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.589 
the only thing that's not fitting is
this<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:42.080> I<00:05:42.139> have<00:05:42.380> seriously<00:05:42.950> like<00:05:43.190> one<00:05:43.910> to

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
this and I have seriously like one to

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.409 
this and I have seriously like one to
two<00:05:44.630> uses<00:05:45.380> left<00:05:45.590> maybe<00:05:45.770> so<00:05:46.250> it<00:05:47.120> doesn't<00:05:47.330> really

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
two uses left maybe so it doesn't really

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.240 
two uses left maybe so it doesn't really
matter<00:05:47.630> if<00:05:47.720> that<00:05:47.900> fits<00:05:48.080> or<00:05:48.200> not<00:05:48.229> and<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.979> next

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
matter if that fits or not and the next

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.800 
matter if that fits or not and the next
one<00:05:49.400> I'm<00:05:49.520> going<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:49.760> fill<00:05:49.940> up<00:05:50.090> with<00:05:50.240> these<00:05:50.539> also

one I'm going to fill up with these also

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.170 
one I'm going to fill up with these also
the<00:05:51.410> things<00:05:51.620> that<00:05:51.740> are<00:05:51.830> too<00:05:51.979> big<00:05:52.130> to<00:05:52.190> fit<00:05:52.610> in<00:05:52.820> my

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.550 
the things that are too big to fit in my
Sterilite<00:05:53.930> drawer<00:05:55.960> I'm<00:05:56.960> going<00:05:57.080> to<00:05:57.169> take<00:05:57.349> these

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.260 
Sterilite drawer I'm going to take these
into<00:05:57.740> my<00:05:57.830> bedroom<00:05:58.099> they're<00:05:58.610> face<00:05:58.849> cream<00:05:59.150> and

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
into my bedroom they're face cream and

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.650 
into my bedroom they're face cream and
hand<00:05:59.450> cream<00:06:00.070> these<00:06:01.070> as<00:06:01.280> well<00:06:01.520> it's<00:06:02.240> a<00:06:02.300> lip<00:06:02.479> balm

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
hand cream these as well it's a lip balm

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.839 
hand cream these as well it's a lip balm
