I'm using a fluffy Sigma e25 and that's
just<00:01:33.920> gonna<00:01:34.040> go<00:01:34.250> over<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.729> inner<00:01:34.909> third<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.900> a

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
just gonna go over the inner third and a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.990 
just gonna go over the inner third and a
packet<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.409> most<00:01:36.680> on<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.310> inner<00:01:37.460> corner<00:01:37.880> and

packet the most on the inner corner and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.670 
packet the most on the inner corner and
then<00:01:38.299> kind<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.690> create<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.080> gradient<00:01:39.530> so

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
then kind of create this gradient so

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.110 
then kind of create this gradient so
it's<00:01:39.799> gonna<00:01:39.890> be<00:01:40.070> lightest<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.729> then<00:01:40.850> fade

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
it's gonna be lightest and then fade

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.390 
it's gonna be lightest and then fade
into<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:41.540> orange<00:01:41.960> then<00:01:42.950> you're<00:01:43.070> gonna<00:01:43.190> take

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
into that orange then you're gonna take

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.430 
into that orange then you're gonna take
a<00:01:43.430> really<00:01:43.790> bright<00:01:44.330> burgundy<00:01:44.930> kind<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.290> almost

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
pencil brush this one is a sigma e45 I'm

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.590 
pencil brush this one is a sigma e45 I'm
gonna<00:01:59.479> start<00:01:59.720> over<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.140> outer<00:02:00.320> like<00:02:01.270> 1/4<00:02:02.270> of

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
gonna start over the outer like 1/4 of

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.250 
gonna start over the outer like 1/4 of
the<00:02:02.720> eye<00:02:02.750> just

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
the eye just

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.600 
the eye just
again<00:02:03.500> creating<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:03.979> gradient<00:02:04.369> we've<00:02:04.490> got

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
again creating that gradient we've got

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.580 
again creating that gradient we've got
the<00:02:04.729> light<00:02:04.909> color<00:02:05.180> base<00:02:05.780> there<00:02:06.049> orange<00:02:06.229> and

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
the light color base there orange and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.109 
the light color base there orange and
then<00:02:06.680> goes<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.890> red<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.790> then<00:02:07.850> you're<00:02:08.030> gonna

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
then goes to red and then you're gonna

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.089 
then goes to red and then you're gonna
take<00:02:08.330> it<00:02:08.360> through<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.599> crease<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.769> again

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
take it through the crease and again

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.559 
take it through the crease and again
we're<00:02:10.280> just<00:02:10.459> kind<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.670> creating<00:02:11.090> more<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.480> that

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
we're just kind of creating more of that

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.000 
we're just kind of creating more of that
kind<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.870> fiery<00:02:12.170> color

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
kind of fiery color

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.979 
kind of fiery color
fiery<00:02:14.489> color<00:02:14.760> pallette<00:02:15.090> if<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.330> will<00:02:15.540> but

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
fiery color pallette if you will but

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.179 
fiery color pallette if you will but
then<00:02:16.080> you're<00:02:16.200> gonna<00:02:16.290> take<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.739> actually

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
then you're gonna take this actually

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.800 
then you're gonna take this actually
pretty<00:02:17.370> high<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.909> crease<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.269> that<00:02:18.480> we<00:02:18.659> can

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
pretty high to the crease so that we can

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.110 
pretty high to the crease so that we can
blend<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.170> out<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:20.579> can<00:02:20.760> see<00:02:20.790> I've<00:02:20.970> got<00:02:21.060> it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
blend it out so you can see I've got it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.280 
blend it out so you can see I've got it
pretty<00:02:21.299> high<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:21.930> you're<00:02:22.019> gonna<00:02:22.110> take

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
pretty high and then you're gonna take

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.899 
pretty high and then you're gonna take
that<00:02:22.470> yellow<00:02:22.650> shimmery<00:02:23.159> color<00:02:23.370> whenever<00:02:23.730> you

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
that yellow shimmery color whenever you

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.539 
that yellow shimmery color whenever you
use<00:02:24.060> before<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.629> then<00:02:25.530> put<00:02:26.189> it<00:02:26.280> underneath

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
use before and then put it underneath

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.130 
use before and then put it underneath
the<00:02:26.790> brow<00:02:26.939> bone<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.299> blend<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.659> in<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:27.840> that

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
the brow bone and blend it in with that

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.770 
the brow bone and blend it in with that
red<00:02:28.950> color<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:29.579> get<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> nice<00:02:30.000> gradient<00:02:30.360> back

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
red color so we get a nice gradient back

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.690 
red color so we get a nice gradient back
down<00:02:31.079> this<00:02:31.680> whole<00:02:31.890> look<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.370> all<00:02:32.489> about<00:02:32.519> the

gradient<00:02:33.060> kind<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.540> thing<00:02:33.720> then<00:02:34.319> take<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> deep

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
gradient kind of thing then take a deep

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.190 
gradient kind of thing then take a deep
burgundy<00:02:35.099> or<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.640> dark<00:02:36.180> brown<00:02:36.420> either<00:02:36.780> one<00:02:37.019> will

work<00:02:37.230> for<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.950> place<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:39.120> through<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
work for this and place that through the

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.420 
work for this and place that through the
crease<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:40.049> want<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.290> deepen<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.709> up<00:02:40.859> just<00:02:41.220> a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
crease we want to deepen it up just a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.160 
crease we want to deepen it up just a
little<00:02:41.459> bit<00:02:41.879> not<00:02:42.299> some<00:02:42.540> more<00:02:42.720> dimension<00:02:43.140> to

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.550 
of my cheeks just to kind of warm up my
skin<00:04:12.419> some<00:04:12.690> more<00:04:12.810> after<00:04:12.930> putting<00:04:13.260> all<00:04:13.379> those

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
skin some more after putting all those

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.559 
skin some more after putting all those
yellows<00:04:13.919> and<00:04:14.069> oranges<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:15.120> last<00:04:15.299> thing<00:04:15.479> I

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.779 
yellows and oranges and the last thing I
did<00:04:15.750> was<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.109> use<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.289> little<00:04:16.620> lip<00:04:16.829> balm<00:04:17.039> I<00:04:17.310> think

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
did was to use a little lip balm I think

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.039 
did was to use a little lip balm I think
it<00:04:17.849> would<00:04:17.940> probably<00:04:17.970> actually<00:04:18.419> be<00:04:18.659> better<00:04:18.780> to

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
it would probably actually be better to

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.659 
it would probably actually be better to
do<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.260> lip<00:04:19.530> color<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.070> was<00:04:20.280> what<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.459> did

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
do a lip color but that was what I did
