a few minutes it definitely picks up the
fingerprints<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.180> get<00:00:42.300> very<00:00:42.780> very

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
fingerprints and can get very very

device<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.120> Droid<00:03:45.330> DNA<00:03:45.510> on<00:03:45.989> the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
device this is the Droid DNA on the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.850 
device this is the Droid DNA on the
right<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:47.450> HTC<00:03:48.450> butterfly<00:03:48.810> on<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.560> left

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
right and the HTC butterfly on the left

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.640 
right and the HTC butterfly on the left
the<00:03:50.610> original<00:03:50.790> butterfly<00:03:51.390> there's<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:52.200> few

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
the original butterfly there's a few

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.590 
the original butterfly there's a few
differences<00:03:53.130> between<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.640> original<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.270> the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
differences between the original and the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.330 
differences between the original and the
new<00:03:54.780> one<00:03:55.020> so<00:03:55.170> like<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.650> said<00:03:55.800> they<00:03:55.920> all<00:03:56.040> have<00:03:56.220> the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
new one so like I said they all have the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.890 
new one so like I said they all have the
same<00:03:56.520> screen<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.989> original<00:03:58.920> butterfly<00:03:59.430> had<00:03:59.850> a

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
same screen the original butterfly had a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.620 
same screen the original butterfly had a
Snapdragon<00:04:00.900> s4<00:04:01.550> quad-core<00:04:02.550> 1.5<00:04:03.360> gigahertz

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
Snapdragon s4 quad-core 1.5 gigahertz

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.310 
Snapdragon s4 quad-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
processor

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.229 
processor
this<00:04:04.830> one's<00:04:05.100> upped<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.550> ante<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.910> little<00:04:05.970> bit

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
this one's upped the ante a little bit

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.150 
this one's upped the ante a little bit
with<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.390> Snapdragon<00:04:06.989> 600<00:04:07.620> quad-core

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
with a Snapdragon 600 quad-core

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.250 
with a Snapdragon 600 quad-core
processor<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.730> that's<00:04:09.060> clocked<00:04:09.390> at<00:04:09.540> 1.9

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
processor and that's clocked at 1.9

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.440 
processor and that's clocked at 1.9
gigahertz<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.980> definitely<00:04:11.760> some<00:04:12.000> more<00:04:12.150> speed

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
gigahertz so definitely some more speed

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.300 
gigahertz so definitely some more speed
on<00:04:12.630> this<00:04:12.780> bad<00:04:12.989> boy<00:04:13.019> it's<00:04:13.440> got<00:04:13.620> 2<00:04:13.830> gigs<00:04:14.070> of<00:04:14.160> RAM

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
on this bad boy it's got 2 gigs of RAM

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.030 
on this bad boy it's got 2 gigs of RAM
just<00:04:14.700> like<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.000> original<00:04:15.450> butterfly<00:04:16.040> but

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
just like the original butterfly but

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.940 
just like the original butterfly but
this<00:04:17.609> one<00:04:17.820> like<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.000> said<00:04:18.090> expands<00:04:19.049> storage

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
this one like I said expands storage

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.150 
this one like I said expands storage
wise<00:04:20.130> up<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.760> 64<00:04:21.510> gigs<00:04:21.750> as<00:04:21.930> opposed<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.650> 32

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
wise up to 64 gigs as opposed to the 32

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.790 
wise up to 64 gigs as opposed to the 32
gigs<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.760> you'd<00:04:24.180> be<00:04:24.360> able<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.720> add<00:04:24.840> on<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.530> the

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
gigs that you'd be able to add on to the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.760 
gigs that you'd be able to add on to the
original<00:04:26.250> butterfly

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
original butterfly

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.580

Droid DNA and the original HTC butterfly
had<00:04:59.560> two<00:05:00.130> thousand<00:05:00.580> twenty<00:05:00.729> milliamp

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
had two thousand twenty milliamp

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.450

you're running a 1080p screen so if you
were<00:05:14.500> complaining<00:05:14.979> about<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.690> battery<00:05:16.690> life

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
were complaining about the battery life

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.379 
were complaining about the battery life
