00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.360
 hello dear children big and small today 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.230
 I invite you to a new let's 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.630
 play to cultures online 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.670
 Let's go and I'll show you 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.240
 again the progress in the settlement 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.830
 Here is my current inventory 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.840
 now from a maximum of 157,000 raw materials 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.570
 that means I could already be here now 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.190
 upgrade the kitchen to level 4 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.260
 if I here a mouseover on the 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.110
 I can see what that brings to me 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.629
 the expansion and that is what I get then 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.420
 a new heroic place when the kitchen 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.610
 this is being upgraded to level 5 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.159
 means I have 123456 already here 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.890
 Heroes available in the 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.140
 Various buildings can move around 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.000
 then they just work for me 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.280
 to let 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.239
 first time I will but a new one 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.610
 hire heroes and for that my here 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.130
 Send away matryoshka 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.180
 before you should send a hero away 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.829
 But you have your complete inventory 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.579
 sell because the objects are 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.469
 otherwise there will be no foot 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.750
 again 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:25.960
 That's why I had to leave everything here 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.409
 and sell this right here, yes I am 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.439
 sure that I want to sell this 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.600
 the part here exactly and look now 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:39.179
 We'll go to the inn first 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.750
 spend gold for a new hero 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.659
 First you have to go here 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.560
 heroes 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:53.439
 move into this field to say so 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.270
 yes to send away 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.689
 then I will be a new one now 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.179
 I would like to get some heroes 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.149
 a 2 and fighter I have a hand 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.670
 Fernkampf Fernkampf one hand but none 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.900
 Two hand fighters why I am here 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.379
 hiring the balu I'll think so 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.549
 here was going to be 55,000 gold is one 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.579
 a lot of work 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.410
 I grab it anyway it right 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.810
 times out that it can also work out 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.299
 and now I'll take a look at what he does 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.160
 because there are so many things here 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.310
 Of course, only gray has equipped 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.799
 things I will now my inventory 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.250
 Rummage and see if I have him here 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.579
 maybe something better can attract yes 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.260
 directly times the pants are better here 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.879
 a necklace with strength and endurance 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.200
 That's why I said this here 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.730
 whole clutter actually always 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.739
 have lifted because then as you will see 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.340
 you need it at some point 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.829
 enduring luck tool does not look 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.700
 bad of an intelligence chest 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.889
 plate is good for a fight 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:09.040
 a weapon with twelve strength and endurance 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:12.590
 very nice then the chest is 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:17.419
 also for fernkÃ¤mpfer a belt with 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.550
 ten stronger why not then that can 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:25.020
 I still put him 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.790
 In any case, the part here the pants 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.360
 are even better than I 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.740
 He had dressed too much before 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.890
 I do not have any more anyway 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.850
 a helmet with eight strength very nice 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.480
 strength is the attribute for the 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.550
 damage of a two- handed fighter stronger 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.670
 and perseverance year I take too 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.010
 rather now glitters and shines 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.780
 Inventory here of what already 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.530
 I'll go back to Atlantis in the 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:59.690
 dungeon to tempo tomtom carton and 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.700
 drink wrong pang tong tong bonk and such 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.110
 because a two-handed fighter is good against 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.710
 I'll send a dog sign first 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.410
 directly into your balloon though 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.270
 one moment i will even get him here 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.090
 to give up a fight 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.859
 you see how many starch I drink 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.690
 lying around in the inventory here 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.170
 so now just look for the 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.190
 Best of all, take 30th strength 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.830
 we 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.500
 He has almost 30,000 here 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.420
 hurt more and let 's go as I said 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.770
 here's your own hand fighter as 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.680
 opponents come first I send mine 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.290
 two- handed fighter first for two 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.300
 hand is good against a hand so im 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.980
 advantage 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.580
 Let's go send me just with the 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.170
 then here's the mission into the race 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.820
 Must have the experience only 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.680
 divided by 2 and not by 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.460
 three that means you get main hero 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.600
 hence more of the cake 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.700
 Unfortunately I can do that now 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.600
 kitchen does not expand because of me 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:04.390
 I can not do that with gold 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.250
 I'll do something for the wood now 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.950
 look around what can i do then 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.810
 Remove 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.430
 maybe the workshop yes very much 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.530
 nice the workshop increases the 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.010
 Production of raw materials with everyone 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.750
 expansion level always one percent now 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.560
 I have already reached 16 percent 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.590
 that is a proper improvement 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.169
 For example, I produce instead of 100 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.120
 wood per hour then already 116 wood per 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.230
 hour and that goes to all buildings 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.419
 equally 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:38.860
 that means with a building which one 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.290
 Extensively one influences directly five here 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.900
 actually the university is building 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:48.130
 the quarry the forester the palace 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.510
 and the Eisenberg apropos forge one 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.090
 Unfortunately , I can not expand anymore 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.530
 we'll be fast one for that 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.750
 attack the trunk 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.990
 just for fun 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.230
 the boldest two we'll grab you 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.880
 at times 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:10.260
 Let's go I'll jump again 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:14.520
 my fight and here is already the 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.230
 last fight against block should not be 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:22.850
 Problem was not a problem 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:25.260
 my trunk win 12 points okay alright 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.080
 then I will be the expedition here 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.210
 continue and the next step 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.530
 Everybody should definitely do it 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.880
 here the kitchen or the 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.850
 bakery I'm called on the 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.740
 to bring vikings page to level 5 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.169
 then you have your sixth hero here 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.310
 The seven heroes are then faith 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.470
 me either if you do that again 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.390
 expand or you can in the university 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.440
 to research 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.870
 I'm here especially with the 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.669
 already very far in the 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.200
 palace goes with the honors managed 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.840
 already well here already 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.430
 I have eight of eleven pvp again 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.550
 I did a little bit, though 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.550
 now the tower is on display since I am 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.640
 currently got a run 20 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.470
 percent more stone for seven days and 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.120
 my resources are so high then that 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.740
 they were no longer protected that was 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.919
 me too sensitive if someone at the 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.290
 kaperfahrt makes me or me im 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:21.180
 pvp fight attacks i would have to 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.310
 lost many raw materials because of that 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.950
 I return to the mode here 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.180
 peace mode changed 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.820
 but now I will be here soon 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.740
 replace my defenders and that 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.720
 launched ingo I send grain to here 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:37.110
 ball around a new hero as 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.720
 Defender inside and say goodbye 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.830
 at this point until the next let's go 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.830
