00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.459 
words under par i'm hoping to make that
up<00:01:51.040> in<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.310> next<00:01:51.460> couple<00:01:51.700> days<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.329> then<00:01:53.290> it

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
up in the next couple days and then it

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.319 
up in the next couple days and then it
probably<00:01:53.500> dropped<00:01:54.159> right<00:01:54.460> back<00:01:54.670> down<00:01:54.909> because

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
probably dropped right back down because

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.539 
probably dropped right back down because
