00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
there there wasn't thick enough also

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.570

I've put clippings as well on top of to

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.229 
I've put clippings as well on top of to
kind<00:02:42.820> of<00:02:42.940> pack<00:02:43.540> out<00:02:43.810> um<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:45.459> already<00:02:45.760> have<00:02:46.060> done

kind of pack out um I already have done

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.420 
kind of pack out um I already have done
this<00:02:46.510> wasn't<00:02:46.750> an<00:02:47.110> extra<00:02:47.500> cost<00:02:47.709> but<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.100> guess<00:02:48.280> if

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
this wasn't an extra cost but I guess if

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.820 
this wasn't an extra cost but I guess if
you<00:02:48.580> just<00:02:49.570> starting<00:02:49.900> out<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.110> hair<00:02:50.260> extensions

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.400 
you just starting out in hair extensions

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
and maybe microwaves isn't the first

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.740 
and maybe microwaves isn't the first
option<00:02:53.980> I'd<00:02:54.190> go<00:02:54.430> for<00:02:54.580> I'll<00:02:54.700> experiment<00:02:55.420> first

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750
