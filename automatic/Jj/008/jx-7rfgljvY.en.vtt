00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
look something like this

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:14.780 
look something like this
M<00:02:07.840> -<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:10.980> mu-2<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.220> prime<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.900> like<00:02:14.049> that

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
M - you mu-2 and prime just like that

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.930 
M - you mu-2 and prime just like that
and<00:02:16.859> the<00:02:17.859> reason<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.160> don't<00:02:18.220> prefer<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.819> is

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
and the reason I don't prefer that is

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.390 
and the reason I don't prefer that is
because<00:02:19.269> of<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.660> F<00:02:19.950> first<00:02:20.950> off<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.220> don't

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
because of the a you F first off I don't

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.599 
because of the a you F first off I don't
really<00:02:21.519> like<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.239> flick<00:02:22.540> move<00:02:22.780> here<00:02:23.109> I<00:02:23.609> just

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609 
really like this flick move here I just

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.630 
really like this flick move here I just
can't<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.150> well<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.510> then<00:02:26.519> when<00:02:27.519> you

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
can't do it that well and then when you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.520 
can't do it that well and then when you
throw<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.450> f<00:02:28.660> on<00:02:28.840> top<00:02:29.049> of<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:31.440> it's<00:02:32.440> just

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
throw in a you f on top of it it's just

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.440 
throw in a you f on top of it it's just
a<00:02:32.709> lot<00:02:32.889> of<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.700> flicking<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.359> I<00:02:34.389> don't

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
a lot of this flicking and I don't

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.259 
a lot of this flicking and I don't
prefer<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.590> that's<00:02:35.739> why<00:02:35.889> I<00:02:35.920> don't<00:02:36.069> use

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
prefer that so that's why I don't use

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.410 
prefer that so that's why I don't use
you<00:02:37.269> know<00:02:37.359> use<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.819> next<00:02:39.970> one<00:02:40.269> we

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
you know use that so the next one we

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.319 
you know use that so the next one we
have<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.440> counterclockwise<00:02:42.100> u<00:02:42.579> perm<00:02:42.819> and

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
have is the counterclockwise u perm and

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.420 
have is the counterclockwise u perm and
I<00:02:43.540> do<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:43.959> this<00:02:44.109> you<00:02:44.829> know<00:02:44.950> I'm<00:02:45.100> -<00:02:45.280> like

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
I do it like this you know I'm - like

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.840 
I do it like this you know I'm - like
this<00:02:45.670> M<00:02:46.569> 2

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:00.760 

again

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.590 

just<00:03:01.770> like<00:03:01.920> that

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
just like that

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.240 
just like that
and<00:03:03.600> now<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.080> other<00:03:04.320> way<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.710> do<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.040> how

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
and now the other way you can do it how

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:16.350 
and now the other way you can do it how
cannon<00:03:05.610> would<00:03:05.760> do<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.360> make<00:03:07.140> this

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.870 

and<00:03:17.360> now<00:03:17.990> you've<00:03:18.200> got<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:18.770> perms<00:03:19.100> from<00:03:19.550> the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
and now you've got you perms from the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:33.300 
and now you've got you perms from the
back<00:03:20.300> here<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:22.250> this<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:22.580> how<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:22.730> do<00:03:22.880> it

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.600 

and<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.690> know<00:03:34.780> people<00:03:35.050> like<00:03:35.380> J<00:03:35.770> do<00:03:36.100> something

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
and I know people like J do something

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:46.080 
and I know people like J do something
along<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.569> lines<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:38.050> this<00:03:44.670> it's<00:03:45.670> something

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
along the lines of this it's something

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.630 
along the lines of this it's something
like<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.450> I've<00:03:47.380> just<00:03:47.980> never<00:03:48.130> really<00:03:48.430> picked

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
like that I've just never really picked

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.370 
like that I've just never really picked
up<00:03:48.760> on<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.030> but<00:03:49.150> I've<00:03:49.270> seen<00:03:49.540> Sameer<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.170> J<00:03:50.319> do

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
up on it but I've seen Sameer and J do

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.860 
up on it but I've seen Sameer and J do
it<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.739> it's<00:03:51.090> ridiculously<00:03:52.090> fast<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:52.690> if<00:03:52.780> you

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
it and it's ridiculously fast so if you

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.120 
it and it's ridiculously fast so if you
can<00:03:53.020> find<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.350> video<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.680> should<00:03:53.920> probably

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
can find that video you should probably

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.210 
can find that video you should probably
learn<00:03:54.310> how<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.520> do<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.880> way<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.860> then<00:03:56.860> for

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
learn how to do it that way and then for

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:06.620 
learn how to do it that way and then for
this<00:03:57.430> one<00:03:57.489> I<00:03:57.700> do

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:19.580 

oh<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:14.190> messed<00:04:14.520> up<00:04:17.209> just<00:04:18.209> like<00:04:18.360> that<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.810> the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
oh I messed up just like that and the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.930 
oh I messed up just like that and the
last<00:04:19.800> one<00:04:19.980> I'm<00:04:20.070> going<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.370> cover<00:04:20.640> is<00:04:20.880> the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
last one I'm going to cover is the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.290 
last one I'm going to cover is the
counterclockwise<00:04:21.840> u<00:04:22.380> perm<00:04:22.620> +<00:04:22.920> u<00:04:23.160> -<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.270> a

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
counterclockwise u perm + u - this is a

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.810 
counterclockwise u perm + u - this is a
really<00:04:24.570> handy<00:04:24.840> ugh<00:04:25.080> it's<00:04:25.920> just<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.370> lot<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.580> fun

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
really handy ugh it's just a lot of fun

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
you can do this it's really fast and it

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.690 
you can do this it's really fast and it
just<00:04:42.270> feels<00:04:42.540> fun<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:42.930> execute<00:04:43.410> so<00:04:44.400> that's<00:04:44.520> how

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
just feels fun to execute so that's how

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.750 
just feels fun to execute so that's how
to<00:04:45.150> execute<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.810> your<00:04:45.960> palms<00:04:46.170> like<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.410> pro

to execute the your palms like a pro

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.830 
to execute the your palms like a pro
like<00:04:47.760> I<00:04:47.880> said<00:04:48.090> there's<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.390> lot<00:04:48.540> of<00:04:48.630> different

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
like I said there's a lot of different

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.300 
like I said there's a lot of different
ways<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.080> do<00:04:49.200> you<00:04:49.350> perms<00:04:49.590> just<00:04:49.860> pick<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.160> one

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
ways to do you perms just pick the one

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.750 
ways to do you perms just pick the one
that<00:04:50.340> fits<00:04:50.490> for<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:51.470> this<00:04:52.470> is<00:04:52.650> one<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:52.980> the

that fits for you this is one of the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.370 
that fits for you this is one of the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
pilau sets that I guess I feel like is

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.370 
pilau sets that I guess I feel like is
really<00:04:55.760> subjective<00:04:56.760> on<00:04:57.480> how<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.870> can<00:04:58.110> execute

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
really subjective on how you can execute

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.050 
really subjective on how you can execute
it<00:04:58.650> or<00:04:58.800> which<00:04:58.980> aisle<00:04:59.190> you're<00:04:59.430> going<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.670> use<00:04:59.820> so

it or which aisle you're going to use so

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.700 
it or which aisle you're going to use so
I<00:05:00.090> can't<00:05:00.330> tell<00:05:00.480> you<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:00.720> know<00:05:00.840> this<00:05:01.470> one<00:05:01.680> is

the perfect one to use you know I guess

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.310 
the perfect one to use you know I guess
it's<00:05:05.460> how<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.640> is<00:05:05.760> with<00:05:05.970> most<00:05:06.210> Alex<00:05:06.690> but<00:05:06.930> those

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
it's how it is with most Alex but those
