00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and I gotta say first of all while it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.440 
and I gotta say first of all while it
doesn't<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:11.369> have<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> lot<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.909> stuff<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
doesn't really have a lot of stuff on it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.780

like there's no other than Japan created
the<00:01:14.850> top<00:01:15.030> corner<00:01:15.360> there<00:01:15.479> isn't<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.960> lot

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the top corner there isn't really a lot

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.170 
the top corner there isn't really a lot
of<00:01:16.409> things<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.250> that's<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.580> Japan<00:01:17.939> crate

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.050 
of things on it that's a Japan crate
however<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.409> good<00:01:19.439> sized<00:01:20.130> box<00:01:20.520> factoring

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
however it's a good sized box factoring

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
however it's a good sized box factoring
and<00:01:21.210> also<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.020> you're<00:01:22.140> getting<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.439> lot<00:01:22.650> of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that big you're probably gonna get a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.030 
that big you're probably gonna get a
fair<00:01:26.670> bit<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.259> why<00:01:28.259> don't<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.439> stop<00:01:28.740> doing

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
fair bit in here why don't I stop doing

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.319 
fair bit in here why don't I stop doing
this<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.369> once<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.610> should<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.880> open<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.180> up

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
this and once I should just open this up

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.330 
this and once I should just open this up
so<00:01:30.630> let's<00:01:31.140> open<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> box<00:01:31.860> from<00:01:32.280> Japan
