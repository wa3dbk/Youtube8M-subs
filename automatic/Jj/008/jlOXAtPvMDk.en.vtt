00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
game design so how are we supposed to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.759 
question like do you except for this
mushroom<00:03:06.599> and<00:03:06.870> you're<00:03:07.230> kind<00:03:07.379> of<00:03:07.409> an<00:03:07.530> ass

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
mushroom and you're kind of an ass

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.319 
mushroom and you're kind of an ass
so<00:03:07.859> you're<00:03:07.980> chuckling<00:03:08.250> select<00:03:08.519> no<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.209> then

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
so you're chuckling select no but then

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.360 
so you're chuckling select no but then
the<00:03:09.390> character<00:03:09.659> just<00:03:09.810> replies<00:03:10.079> haha<00:03:10.590> no<00:03:11.069> do

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
the character just replies haha no do

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.220 
the character just replies haha no do
you<00:03:11.430> accept<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.790> mission<00:03:11.939> these<00:03:12.810> games<00:03:13.019> gave

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
you accept this mission these games gave

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.959 
you accept this mission these games gave
you<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.469> thin<00:03:13.650> illusion<00:03:14.189> of<00:03:14.280> choice<00:03:14.489> the

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
you the thin illusion of choice the

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.009 
you the thin illusion of choice the

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
entirely different game where you sit

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.979 
entirely different game where you sit

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
around in town all day sipping coffee

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.209 
around in town all day sipping coffee
and<00:03:19.260> hitting<00:03:19.469> on<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.650> local<00:03:19.859> women<00:03:20.099> while

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
Kings second choice of hero is up to you

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.890 
Kings second choice of hero is up to you
see<00:03:23.730> how<00:03:23.819> this<00:03:23.939> one<00:03:24.090> single<00:03:24.420> choice<00:03:24.599> can<00:03:24.780> lead

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
see how this one single choice can lead

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.690 
see how this one single choice can lead
to<00:03:24.989> an<00:03:25.109> immense<00:03:25.349> workload<00:03:25.739> choice<00:03:26.489> can

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
to an immense workload choice can

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.979 
to an immense workload choice can
complicate<00:03:26.969> things<00:03:27.299> very<00:03:27.510> quickly<00:03:27.599> and

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
complicate things very quickly and

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.030 
complicate things very quickly and
that's<00:03:28.590> why<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.739> see<00:03:28.889> way<00:03:29.010> more

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
that's why you see way more

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.559 
that's why you see way more
problem-solving<00:03:29.849> in<00:03:29.969> games<00:03:30.180> then<00:03:30.359> you<00:03:30.420> see

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
problem-solving in games then you see

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.119 
problem-solving in games then you see
choice<00:03:30.720> making<00:03:31.049> now<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:31.769> certainly<00:03:31.980> isn't

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
choice making now this certainly isn't

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.409 
choice making now this certainly isn't
to<00:03:32.250> say<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.370> problems<00:03:32.819> are<00:03:32.939> bad<00:03:33.090> by<00:03:33.239> any

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
to say that problems are bad by any

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.819 
to say that problems are bad by any
means<00:03:33.629> most<00:03:34.200> games<00:03:34.409> are<00:03:34.560> built<00:03:34.680> on

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
means most games are built on

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.020 
means most games are built on
problem-solving<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.639> that's<00:03:35.760> kind<00:03:35.909> of<00:03:35.939> how

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
problem-solving and that's kind of how

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.550 
problem-solving and that's kind of how
it<00:03:36.150> should<00:03:36.180> be<00:03:36.389> you'd<00:03:37.019> be<00:03:37.109> hard-pressed<00:03:37.319> to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
it should be you'd be hard-pressed to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.899 
it should be you'd be hard-pressed to
find<00:03:37.799> more<00:03:37.919> than<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.099> handful<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.549> games<00:03:38.760> that

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
find more than a handful of games that

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:39.530 
find more than a handful of games that

problem-solving at all for that matter

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.619

there<00:03:41.700> are<00:03:41.760> tons<00:03:41.939> of<00:03:42.030> great<00:03:42.180> games<00:03:42.299> that<00:03:42.540> don't

really at the heart of all we consider

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.580 
really at the heart of all we consider
gaming<00:03:45.870> today<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.230> there's<00:03:46.349> nothing<00:03:46.530> wrong

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
gaming today and there's nothing wrong

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.750 
gaming today and there's nothing wrong
with<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:47.159> it's<00:03:47.310> important<00:03:47.639> that<00:03:47.669> we

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
with that but it's important that we

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.759 
with that but it's important that we
distinguish<00:03:48.209> them<00:03:48.359> from<00:03:48.389> choices<00:03:48.840> now<00:03:49.650> why

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
distinguish them from choices now why

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.559 
distinguish them from choices now why
does<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.040> matter<00:03:50.099> at<00:03:50.400> all<00:03:50.489> because<00:03:51.239> without

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
does this matter at all because without

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.030 
does this matter at all because without
distinguishing<00:03:51.870> between<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.439> two<00:03:52.560> it's<00:03:52.769> very

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
distinguishing between the two it's very

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.679 
distinguishing between the two it's very
easy<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.430> reduce<00:03:53.579> choices<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.239> just<00:03:54.450> being

I<00:05:33.690> do<00:05:34.199> a<00:05:34.289> lot<00:05:34.470> of<00:05:34.500> talking<00:05:34.740> here<00:05:35.009> about<00:05:35.039> games

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
I do a lot of talking here about games

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.920 
I do a lot of talking here about games
developing<00:05:35.940> as<00:05:36.030> an<00:05:36.120> artistic<00:05:36.360> medium<00:05:36.509> and

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
developing as an artistic medium and

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.870 
developing as an artistic medium and
this<00:05:37.139> is<00:05:37.259> another<00:05:37.440> important<00:05:37.889> key<00:05:38.009> to<00:05:38.099> that<00:05:38.220> in

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
this is another important key to that in

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.640 
this is another important key to that in
order<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:39.240> be<00:05:39.300> an<00:05:39.389> art<00:05:39.569> a<00:05:39.750> medium<00:05:40.169> must<00:05:40.380> be<00:05:40.500> able

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
order to be an art a medium must be able

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.960 
order to be an art a medium must be able
to<00:05:40.740> address<00:05:41.009> the<00:05:41.130> human<00:05:41.370> experience<00:05:41.699> and

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
to address the human experience and

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.370 
to address the human experience and
there's<00:05:42.479> a<00:05:42.539> huge<00:05:42.780> range<00:05:42.990> of<00:05:43.169> human

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380

there's a huge range of human
experiences<00:05:43.919> that<00:05:44.009> are<00:05:44.130> better<00:05:44.280> expressed<00:05:44.669> as

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
experiences that are better expressed as

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.100 
experiences that are better expressed as
choices<00:05:45.000> than<00:05:45.330> problems<00:05:45.660> to<00:05:45.780> be<00:05:45.840> solved

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
choices than problems to be solved

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.839 
choices than problems to be solved
because<00:05:46.710> in<00:05:46.949> life<00:05:47.099> a<00:05:47.220> lot<00:05:47.310> of<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:47.490> decisions
