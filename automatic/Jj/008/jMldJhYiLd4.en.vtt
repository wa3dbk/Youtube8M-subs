00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.929
 be careful if you look at everything 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.789

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.559
 at the end of the credits when the nemo 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.460

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.480
 have a nice lot for those who do not 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.120
 not know it was a big 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.980
 eye in the middle like that so that's it and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.269
 anyway it's an old cartoons 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.729
 but I think you can 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.649
 know in 15 we can see the 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.629
 pizza planet truck that is in toy 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.770
 story I'm going to mark it but 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.420
 I noticed style at one time but 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.620
 I did not really care but 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.780
 we can see the image we can easily 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.750
 recognize the pizza truck in there high 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.130
 we can see lotso of toy story 3 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.960
 who is sleeping peacefully 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.070
 like that huh we can see it in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.930
 any case we can recognize it are 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.920
 recognize the cartoon 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.990
 yes normally recognize it if you 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.900
 have the eye so that I had it 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.760
 honestly never noticed me who has 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.230
 watched a lot of times nemo a day there 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.780
 you tell yourself nobody I do 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.680
 trust that in fact you know at the end 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.410
 of a world by evoking the numbers 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.710
 dentist ah ben we can see in 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.870
 made 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.430
 toy story on the floor whose toys in 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.380
 the dentist's waiting room 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.490
 he's just on the ground right in front of 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 the boxes actually in front of the big 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.140
 play box I had never seen 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.900
 personally up there the car 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.080
 which is driven to exactly the same 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.040
 same wheels as cars a flash mcqueen 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.990
 for those who know anyway 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.580
 in ratatouille if you notice well 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.880
 after a while there is the same mime 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.440
 who does that ah well if we looked 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.640
 logically the indestructible 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.620
 we can actually notice that this is the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.090
 naughty and he looks exactly like 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.999
 and I even went to see on google me 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.929
 same and it's exactly the same you know 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.069
 not if you are one of the people 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.840
 who watched the movie that was 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.970
 really great at the time 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.489
 ali in any case in wall-e it can 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.030
 yet once more see the 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.680
 pizza truck dock in toy story so we 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.760
 What is really going on disney every time 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.530
 they like to show us things 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.849
 who have already shown us and we can 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.440
 really see him in the ally in 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.459
 any case and personally once from 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.900
 the more I did not notice 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.750
 did you notice that in toy 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.700
 story lady potato read the book of 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.870
 midnight a dough 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.580
 I had honestly never 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.299
 noticed and with them we would see 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.760
 and it's really true here is the island of 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.590
 walt disney is self- advertising or 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.180
 what do you see, what does that mean? 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.440
 we really see it by train 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.030
 to say the book but myself that 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.010
 watch toy story I'm not watching 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.120
 all noticed concordant walt disney 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.650
 we watch a movie walt disney there 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.510
 must really have the eye of the times not 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.000
 ratatouille we can see the shadow 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.140
 of doug the dog them playing 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.150
 precisely in the movie up there 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.069
 so if you know the movie up there 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.560
 you know exactly a little the 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.450

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.160
 immediately notice it and once of 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.870
 more than me who saw precisely 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.579
 ratatouille many times because my 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.629
 brothers and sisters the tiff is good I admit 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.459

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.410
 movie anyway for this cartoon on 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.450
 will say ah well i never noticed 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.889
 but when we have the eye and we really 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.959
 we try to really see the shadow and 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.760
 tell herself she can do doug eh ben 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.639

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.099
