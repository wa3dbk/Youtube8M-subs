the<00:00:20.100> forehand<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.869> this<00:00:21.869> angle<00:00:22.410> where<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
the forehand is this angle where the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.400 
the forehand is this angle where the
wrist<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.490> laid<00:00:23.730> back<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.779> forearm<00:00:25.289> is

supporting the hand in this position my

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.230 
supporting the hand in this position my
fingers<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.710> relax<00:00:29.010> I'm<00:00:29.699> getting<00:00:30.150> the

fingers can relax I'm getting the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.770 
fingers can relax I'm getting the
support<00:00:30.720> from<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.529> angle<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:33.300> racket

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
support from this angle here the racket

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.170 
support from this angle here the racket
is<00:00:33.899> essentially<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> tool<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.610> when<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.940> use<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
is essentially a tool and when you use a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.150 
is essentially a tool and when you use a
tool<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.750> want<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.020> apply<00:00:37.290> leverage<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:38.010> make

tool you want to apply leverage to make

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.580 
tool you want to apply leverage to make
it<00:00:38.280> easier<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.180> let<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> racket<00:00:40.290> do<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
it easier for you let the racket do the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950 
it easier for you let the racket do the
work<00:00:41.390> Lydia<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.600> are<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
work Lydia and I are going to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
work Lydia and I are going to
demonstrate<00:00:43.110> how<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> leverage<00:00:44.190> band<00:00:44.520> works

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
demonstrate how the leverage band works

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.910 
demonstrate how the leverage band works
this<00:00:45.480> may<00:00:45.750> look<00:00:45.930> pretty<00:00:46.170> similar<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.739> other

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
this may look pretty similar to other

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.610 
this may look pretty similar to other
devices<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> market<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.840> does<00:00:49.230> take

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
devices on the market but it does take

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.260 
devices on the market but it does take
care<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.980> leverage<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.460> lot<00:00:50.489> better<00:00:50.910> it's

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
care of leverage a lot better it's

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.420 
care of leverage a lot better it's
because<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.840> where<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.110> attaches<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.800> just

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
because of where it attaches up just

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.400 
because of where it attaches up just
under<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> elbow<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:54.899> down<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
under the elbow and not down by the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.400 
under the elbow and not down by the
wrist<00:00:55.710> that's<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.699> key<00:00:57.000> difference<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.230> we're

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
wrist that's a key difference so we're

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.750 
wrist that's a key difference so we're
going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> demonstrate<00:00:58.800> now<00:00:59.160> how<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.699> works

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
going to demonstrate now how this works

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.470 
going to demonstrate now how this works
in<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:01.260> position<00:01:01.829> my<00:01:02.280> palm<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.820> supported<00:01:03.359> by

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.359 
this angle here I can relax my fingers
on<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.600> grip<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.049> still<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.890> good<00:01:08.100> solid

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
on the grip and still have good solid

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.870 
on the grip and still have good solid
support<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.210> contact<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:11.280> continental<00:01:11.850> grip

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.510 
support at contact in a continental grip
that<00:01:12.210> angle<00:01:12.570> looks<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.369> Eastern<00:01:14.369> grip

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that angle looks like this Eastern grip

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.090 
that angle looks like this Eastern grip
like<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.060> semi<00:01:15.570> Western<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.259> Western<00:01:16.860> it's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
like this semi Western and Western it's

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.179 
like this semi Western and Western it's
still<00:01:17.520> too<00:01:18.090> angle<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.420> leverage<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.189> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
still too angle of leverage on the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.359 
still too angle of leverage on the
backhand<00:01:20.580> side<00:01:21.470> there's<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.740> angle<00:01:22.950> leverage

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
backhand side there's the angle leverage

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.160 
backhand side there's the angle leverage
on<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.820> volleys<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> Continental<00:01:25.140> grip

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
on the volleys in the Continental grip

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.399 
on the volleys in the Continental grip
there's<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.250> angle<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.640> leverage<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.479> slice

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
there's the angle of leverage on a slice

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.020 
there's the angle of leverage on a slice
there's<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> angle<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.670> leverage<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.850> what

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
there's the angle of leverage so what

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.460 
there's the angle of leverage so what
we're<00:01:33.180> doing<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.600> we're<00:01:33.750> regulating<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
we're doing is we're regulating the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.670 
we're doing is we're regulating the
distance<00:01:34.920> between<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.490> racket<00:01:35.880> head<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
distance between the racket head and

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.310 
distance between the racket head and
this<00:01:37.680> position<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.220> below<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> elbow<00:01:39.320> so

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
this position just below the elbow so

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.109 
this position just below the elbow so
you<00:01:40.380> want<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> make<00:01:40.890> sure<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.340> up<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.939> under

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
you want to make sure it's up just under

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.910 
you want to make sure it's up just under
