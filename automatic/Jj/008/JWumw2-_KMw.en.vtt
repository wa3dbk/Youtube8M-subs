without causing the engine overheat
which<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.309> mentioned<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.300> heat<00:00:45.780> deal<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
which I mentioned the heat deal on the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.069 
which I mentioned the heat deal on the
engines<00:00:47.010> previously<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
engines previously it's just just the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.770 
engines previously it's just just the
little<00:00:49.320> bar<00:00:49.500> next<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> your<00:00:50.039> health<00:00:50.780> this

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
little bar next to your health this

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.000 
little bar next to your health this
appears<00:00:52.110> jus<00:00:52.260> difficult<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.800> touch<00:00:52.980> down

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
appears jus difficult just touch down

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.369 
appears jus difficult just touch down
let<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.460> engine<00:00:53.670> cool<00:00:53.820> off<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:55.079> when<00:00:55.230> you're

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
let the engine cool off so when you're

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.990 
let the engine cool off so when you're
not<00:00:55.530> flying<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.070> engine<00:00:56.309> cools<00:00:56.550> off<00:00:56.730> when

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
not flying the engine cools off when

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.660 
not flying the engine cools off when
you're<00:00:57.090> flying<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.539> engine<00:00:57.780> heats<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.460> if<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
you're flying the engine heats up if the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
you're flying the engine heats up if the
engine<00:00:59.940> does<00:01:00.149> overheat<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.109> no<00:01:01.230> big<00:01:01.410> deal

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
engine does overheat it's no big deal

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.889 
engine does overheat it's no big deal
you<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.070> drop<00:01:02.280> down<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> ground<00:01:02.899> all

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
you just drop down to the ground all

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.950 
you just drop down to the ground all
right<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:06.030> should<00:01:06.210> use<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.479> arrow<00:01:06.600> keys<00:01:06.630> on

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
right you should use your arrow keys on

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.330 
right you should use your arrow keys on
the<00:01:07.020> keyboard<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.380> pilot<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> bot<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.220> keep

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the keyboard to pilot the bot but keep

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
the keyboard to pilot the bot but keep
one<00:01:08.460> hand<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> mouse<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> mouse<00:01:10.380> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
one hand on the mouse the mouse is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
one hand on the mouse the mouse is
useless<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.700> exercise<00:01:12.119> will<00:01:12.479> be

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
useless in this exercise will be

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.410 
useless in this exercise will be
essential<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.619> later<00:01:14.040> missions<00:01:14.420> they're

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
essential in a later missions they're

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.240 
essential in a later missions they're
just<00:01:15.450> basically<00:01:16.080> talking<00:01:16.380> about<00:01:16.680> using

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
just basically talking about using

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.890 
just basically talking about using
winged<00:01:18.030> BOTS<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.780> shoot<00:01:19.229> at<00:01:19.350> things<00:01:19.670> alright

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
winged BOTS to shoot at things alright

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.920 
winged BOTS to shoot at things alright
let's<00:01:21.900> see<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.790> may<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.119> useful<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.630> come<00:01:24.750> back

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
let's see so may be useful to come back

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.690 
let's see so may be useful to come back
to<00:01:25.049> these<00:01:25.140> drills<00:01:25.409> once<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> while<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.580> you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
to these drills once in a while if you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.760 
to these drills once in a while if you
wish<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> improve<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.330> reflexes<00:01:27.900> further<00:01:28.200> no

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
wish to improve your reflexes further no

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.679 
wish to improve your reflexes further no
not<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.579> ok<00:01:30.920> let's<00:01:31.920> go<00:01:32.100> ahead<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.400> start

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
not really ok let's go ahead and start

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
not really ok let's go ahead and start
now<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.750> could<00:01:34.140> go<00:01:34.590> through<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.950> manually<00:01:35.520> we

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
now we could go through this manually we

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
now we could go through this manually we
can<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.540> thicker<00:01:37.259> bought<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.770> fly

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
can you know thicker bought and fly

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.270 
can you know thicker bought and fly
through<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:39.049> little<00:01:40.049> targets<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.680> we've<00:01:41.040> got

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
through the little targets but we've got

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.899 
through the little targets but we've got
a<00:01:41.310> program<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:43.460> program<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.759> do

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
a program to do that a program to do

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.719 
a program to do that a program to do
that<00:01:45.799> there's<00:01:46.799> really<00:01:46.920> no<00:01:47.159> reason<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.610> go

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that there's really no reason to go

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.160 
that there's really no reason to go
through<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.060> alright<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> also

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
through it alright so this is a also

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.370 
through it alright so this is a also
valid<00:01:54.500> valid<00:01:55.500> program<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.520> next<00:01:56.850> mission

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
valid valid program for the next mission

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.600 
valid valid program for the next mission
nice<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:58.890> kind<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.130> interesting<00:01:59.310> it's

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
nice that's kind of interesting it's

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.640 
nice that's kind of interesting it's
already<00:01:59.880> loaded<00:02:00.140> anyways

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
already loaded anyways

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.590 
already loaded anyways
the<00:02:03.280> next<00:02:03.520> mission<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.940> exactly<00:02:04.480> identical

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
the next mission is exactly identical

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.140 
the next mission is exactly identical
except<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:05.770> switches<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.610> first-person

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
except it switches you to a first-person

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.690 
except it switches you to a first-person
view<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.780> then<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.649> tells<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.979> later<00:02:09.190> on<00:02:09.280> how

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
view and then it tells you later on how

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.760 
view and then it tells you later on how
you<00:02:10.090> can<00:02:10.330> switch<00:02:10.600> between<00:02:10.780> first<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.470> third

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
you can switch between first and third

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.430 
you can switch between first and third
person<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.730> don't<00:02:13.180> recall<00:02:13.300> how<00:02:13.690> how<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.050> do<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.260> at

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
person I don't recall how how I do it at

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.360 
person I don't recall how how I do it at
the<00:02:14.530> moment<00:02:14.860> but<00:02:15.430> we'll<00:02:16.420> just<00:02:17.370> actually

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the moment but we'll just actually

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.120 
the moment but we'll just actually
showing<00:02:18.760> yes<00:02:19.320> because<00:02:20.320> that's<00:02:20.530> always<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.040> be

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
showing yes because that's always to be

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.890 
showing yes because that's always to be
on<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.400> mission<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:22.030> just<00:02:22.390> apply<00:02:22.660> through

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
on this mission is just apply through

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.470 
on this mission is just apply through
the<00:02:22.990> hoops<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.500> think<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.190> lunar<00:02:24.850> rover<00:02:25.210> still

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
the hoops I think that lunar rover still

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.740 
the hoops I think that lunar rover still
out<00:02:25.660> there<00:02:25.900> we<00:02:26.080> can<00:02:26.260> go<00:02:26.440> find<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:27.390> we<00:02:28.390> select

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
out there we can go find it we select

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.810 
out there we can go find it we select
the<00:02:28.870> astronauts<00:02:29.320> who<00:02:29.470> can<00:02:29.620> actually<00:02:29.770> kind<00:02:30.760> of

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
the astronauts who can actually kind of

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.320 
the astronauts who can actually kind of
multitasking<00:02:31.390> see<00:02:31.990> our<00:02:32.080> bots<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.610> as<00:02:34.120> it

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
multitasking see our bots going to as it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.670 
multitasking see our bots going to as it
goes<00:02:34.480> through<00:02:34.510> each<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.050> targets<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
goes through each of the targets the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.730 
goes through each of the targets the
targets<00:02:36.070> vanish<00:02:36.730> which<00:02:37.360> which<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.500> what

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
targets vanish which which is what

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.120 
targets vanish which which is what
enables<00:02:39.130> going<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.400> do<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.610> program

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
enables going to do the program

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.520 
enables going to do the program
automatically<00:02:42.130> then<00:02:42.400> closest<00:02:42.970> throw<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:44.350> yeah

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
automatically then closest throw so yeah

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.560 
automatically then closest throw so yeah
little<00:02:45.190> lunar<00:02:45.490> Rovers<00:02:45.880> still<00:02:46.150> there<00:02:48.570> this

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
little lunar Rovers still there this

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.390 
little lunar Rovers still there this
mission<00:02:50.020> actually<00:02:50.440> completes<00:02:50.890> as<00:02:51.100> soon<00:02:51.280> as

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
mission actually completes as soon as

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.960 
mission actually completes as soon as
the<00:02:52.260> flying<00:02:53.260> bot<00:02:53.530> flies<00:02:54.040> back<00:02:54.370> over<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.880> the

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
the flying bot flies back over to the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.330 
the flying bot flies back over to the
spaceship<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.680> we<00:02:59.770> can<00:02:59.860> actually<00:02:59.920> select

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
spaceship so we can actually select

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.710 
spaceship so we can actually select
their<00:03:00.610> little<00:03:00.820> room<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.090> robot<00:03:01.450> now

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.330 

again<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:06.900> for<00:03:07.020> fun<00:03:07.290> doesn't<00:03:07.770> do<00:03:07.830> anything

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.369 

essentially<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.269> could<00:03:13.450> use<00:03:13.599> it<00:03:13.629> to<00:03:13.810> explore

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
essentially you could use it to explore

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.870 
essentially you could use it to explore
the<00:03:14.650> gorilla

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.940 

i'm<00:03:20.450> not<00:03:20.630> even<00:03:20.690> i'm<00:03:21.230> not<00:03:21.290> even<00:03:21.530> going<00:03:21.710> to<00:03:21.800> show

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
i'm not even i'm not even going to show

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.740 
i'm not even i'm not even going to show
the<00:03:22.100> next<00:03:22.280> mission<00:03:22.550> because<00:03:23.000> it's<00:03:23.150> exactly

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
the next mission because it's exactly

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.050 
the next mission because it's exactly
identical<00:03:24.220> with<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.310> exception<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.850> fact

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
identical with the exception of the fact

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.060 
identical with the exception of the fact
that<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.630> switches<00:03:27.050> you<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.560> first-person

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
that it switches you to a first-person

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.620 
that it switches you to a first-person
view<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.970> you're<00:03:29.120> supposed<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.420> practice

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
view so you're supposed to practice

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.800 
view so you're supposed to practice
flying<00:03:30.560> in<00:03:30.770> a<00:03:30.830> first-person<00:03:31.700> view<00:03:31.970> it's

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
flying in a first-person view it's

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.020 
flying in a first-person view it's
pretty<00:03:33.500> pointless<00:03:33.830> so<00:03:34.220> I'm<00:03:34.670> just<00:03:34.820> going<00:03:34.970> to

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
pretty pointless so I'm just going to

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.850 
pretty pointless so I'm just going to
skip<00:03:35.300> over<00:03:35.450> that<00:03:35.600> mission<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.290> we'll<00:03:36.560> start

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
skip over that mission and we'll start

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.040 
skip over that mission and we'll start
with<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.370> fourth<00:03:38.000> mission<00:03:38.270> of<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.750> last

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
with the fourth mission of the last

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.620 
with the fourth mission of the last
mission<00:03:39.350> on<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.710> moon<00:03:39.860> and<00:03:40.160> that'll<00:03:40.850> be<00:03:41.000> when

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
mission on the moon and that'll be when

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.590 
mission on the moon and that'll be when
we<00:03:41.840> leave<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.470> earth<00:03:42.500> all<00:03:43.070> right<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.480> see<00:03:44.480> you

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
we leave the earth all right and see you

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.960 
we leave the earth all right and see you
then<00:03:44.750> bye
