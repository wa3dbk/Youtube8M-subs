a little piece right here that comes up

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.359 
a little piece right here that comes up
-<00:01:17.990> all<00:01:18.990> right<00:01:19.049> before<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> put<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.100> arm

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
- all right before I put the little arm

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.670 
- all right before I put the little arm
pieces<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:21.000> I'm<00:01:21.270> gonna<00:01:21.600> put<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> batteries<00:01:22.650> in

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
pieces on I'm gonna put the batteries in

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.560 
pieces on I'm gonna put the batteries in
because<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.340> feeling<00:01:23.670> these<00:01:24.030> arm<00:01:24.299> pieces

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
because I'm feeling these arm pieces

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.060 
because I'm feeling these arm pieces
might<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.320> way<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.710> don't<00:01:25.740> want<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
might get in the way and I don't want to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.230 
might get in the way and I don't want to
risk<00:01:26.220> breaking<00:01:26.490> anything<00:01:26.970> because<00:01:27.150> this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
risk breaking anything because this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.920 
risk breaking anything because this
plastic<00:01:27.720> isn't<00:01:28.100> terribly<00:01:29.100> sturdy<00:01:29.720> it<00:01:30.720> looks

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
plastic isn't terribly sturdy it looks

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.510 
plastic isn't terribly sturdy it looks
like<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.200> screw<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.740> kind<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.009> hard<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.280> reach

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
like that screw is kind of hard to reach

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.700 
like that screw is kind of hard to reach
but<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.689> little<00:01:33.840> piece<00:01:34.110> lifts<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.650> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
but this little piece lifts up so you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.310 
but this little piece lifts up so you
can<00:01:34.829> access<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.430> screw<00:01:35.670> better<00:01:36.170> now<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
can access the screw better now it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.969 
can access the screw better now it
requires<00:01:37.470> two<00:01:38.220> triple<00:01:38.759> A<00:01:38.880> batteries<00:01:38.909> and

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
requires two triple A batteries and

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.380 
requires two triple A batteries and
without<00:01:40.979> screwing<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.180> want<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
without screwing it in I just want to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.450 
without screwing it in I just want to
show<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.570> how<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.020> would<00:01:43.170> all<00:01:43.399> come<00:01:44.399> back

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
show you how this would all come back

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.539 
show you how this would all come back
together<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:49.710> we'll<00:01:49.890> put<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.130> arm<00:01:50.369> pieces

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
together so now we'll put the arm pieces

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.730 
together so now we'll put the arm pieces
on<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> there's<00:01:51.840> these<00:01:51.960> little<00:01:52.110> rods<00:01:52.439> that

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
this one has a two point one point

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.150 
this one has a two point one point
reaches<00:02:52.570> into<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.870> silver<00:02:53.230> side<00:02:53.680> piece<00:02:53.920> the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
reaches into that silver side piece the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.510 
reaches into that silver side piece the
other<00:02:54.280> one<00:02:55.020> pulls<00:02:56.020> out<00:02:57.090> from<00:02:58.090> there<00:02:58.330> and

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
other one pulls out from there and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.760 
other one pulls out from there and
that's<00:03:00.520> how<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.820> locks<00:03:01.030> back<00:03:01.300> in<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:02.560> way<00:03:02.710> you

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
that's how it locks back in that way you

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.980 
that's how it locks back in that way you
don't<00:03:03.280> let<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:03.760> thing<00:03:03.820> roll<00:03:04.240> around<00:03:04.660> if

here I mean if you didn't know that that

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.860 
here I mean if you didn't know that that
wasn't<00:04:15.670> plastic<00:04:16.150> you'd<00:04:16.269> swear<00:04:16.540> that<00:04:16.600> these

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
wasn't plastic you'd swear that these

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:24.120 
wasn't plastic you'd swear that these
were<00:04:17.080> metal<00:04:18.070> plates

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.200 

and<00:04:24.250> of<00:04:24.970> course<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.420> the<00:04:25.840> rubber<00:04:26.020> of<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:26.350> tire

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
and of course the the rubber of the tire

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.180 
and of course the the rubber of the tire
reads<00:04:28.210> perfectly<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.260> I<00:04:29.710> like<00:04:29.920> that<00:04:30.070> it's

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
reads perfectly and I like that it's

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.830 
reads perfectly and I like that it's
been<00:04:30.310> painted<00:04:30.520> in<00:04:30.730> distressed<00:04:31.210> that<00:04:31.630> because

been painted in distressed that because

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.570 
been painted in distressed that because
it's<00:04:31.990> obviously<00:04:32.260> been<00:04:32.470> driven<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:32.950> for<00:04:33.430> quite

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
it's obviously been driven on for quite

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.300 
it's obviously been driven on for quite
a<00:04:33.640> while<00:04:33.880> now<00:04:34.440> this<00:04:35.440> comes<00:04:35.710> with<00:04:35.950> a<00:04:36.010> little

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
a while now this comes with a little

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.720 
a while now this comes with a little
strap<00:04:37.140> that<00:04:38.140> goes<00:04:38.200> across<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:39.070> back<00:04:39.280> of

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
strap that goes across the back of

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.580 
strap that goes across the back of
Batman's<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:41.070> little<00:04:42.070> back<00:04:42.340> piece

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
Batman's a little back piece

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.550 
Batman's a little back piece
hopefully<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.770> stays<00:04:45.840> now<00:04:46.840> what<00:04:47.020> that's<00:04:47.140> for

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
hopefully that stays now what that's for

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.720 
hopefully that stays now what that's for
is<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:48.880> hold<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:50.680> little<00:04:50.980> Cape<00:04:51.250> thing<00:04:51.520> into

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
is to hold this little Cape thing into

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.950 
is to hold this little Cape thing into
place<00:04:53.040> this<00:04:54.040> Ridge<00:04:54.450> fits<00:04:55.450> right<00:04:55.750> along<00:04:55.990> here

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
place this Ridge fits right along here

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.090 
place this Ridge fits right along here
hopefully<00:04:58.960> this<00:04:59.590> doesn't<00:04:59.830> pop<00:05:00.130> out<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:02.100> it

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
hopefully this doesn't pop out and it

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.420 
hopefully this doesn't pop out and it
did<00:05:03.670> not<00:05:03.880> awesome<00:05:04.600> now<00:05:05.200> you<00:05:05.770> flip<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.220> Cape

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
did not awesome now you flip the Cape

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.140 
did not awesome now you flip the Cape
over<00:05:07.500> this<00:05:09.060> doohickey<00:05:10.060> and<00:05:11.850> that<00:05:12.850> kind<00:05:13.090> of

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
over this doohickey and that kind of

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.550 
over this doohickey and that kind of
holds<00:05:13.570> a<00:05:14.010> pattern<00:05:15.300> for<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.390> Cape<00:05:16.600> to<00:05:16.930> like<00:05:17.080> fit

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
holds a pattern for the Cape to like fit

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.220 
holds a pattern for the Cape to like fit
onto<00:05:18.180> that<00:05:19.180> way<00:05:19.330> it's<00:05:19.450> not<00:05:19.510> just<00:05:19.600> dragging

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
onto that way it's not just dragging

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.100 
onto that way it's not just dragging
across<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:21.120> back<00:05:22.120> of<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.300> Batpod<00:05:22.690> it

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
across the back of the Batpod it

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.300 
across the back of the Batpod it
actually<00:05:23.500> looks<00:05:23.680> like<00:05:23.740> it's<00:05:23.920> kind<00:05:24.070> of<00:05:24.100> flying

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
actually looks like it's kind of flying

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.130 
actually looks like it's kind of flying
a<00:05:24.430> bit<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.700> it's<00:05:25.120> got<00:05:25.300> these<00:05:25.450> little<00:05:25.510> cuts<00:05:25.960> in

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
a bit and it's got these little cuts in
