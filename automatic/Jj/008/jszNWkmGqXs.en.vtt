00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.420
 after a year 2012 marked by 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:20.539
 the arrival of many router maxis 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.580
 very big engine 2013 is announced 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.560
 like that of the maxiscooter three 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.689
 cubic centimeters a lot of 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.640
 builders are coming to this market and 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.070
 honda no longer had any models in this 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.770
 category and so comes back with a 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.460
 vehicle that we experienced between 2005 and 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.370
 2008 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.010
 the honda forza then one comes back to us 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.120
 with a style a little evolved but little 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.280
 near the same concept 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.629
 simply it is no longer light because 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.809
 now we are in crisis 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.239
 world and so this scooter has more than 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.699
 coded key for example but it keeps 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.719
 still the cbs and ds series 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:00.620
 honda announce it between 5000 and 5500 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.390
 euros next april and so wants the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.580
 place as an intermediate vehicle 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.340
 in its range below 400 hedges at 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.900
 above 125 so on forza 3 100 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.390
 picks up the naiken spirit we had 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.480
 known on the 250 ie a small 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.870
 short bubble smoke optics enough 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.150
 sharpened a bare handlebar so without 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.710
 hood age where we see the handlebar itself 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.440
 the steel bar and all the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.660
 orders and a back to his sons years 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.520
 we can add a top 16 on the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.250
 very implanted platinum that also makes 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.770
 office of grab handles under the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.860
 saddle with a backsplash drivers have 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.180
 little lengthened full face helmet 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.790
 now let's get on board for 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.340
 see 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.740
 how is positioned we find a little 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.500
 a spirit 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.270
 pcx finally with a dashboard 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.930
 good still still enough him more 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.750
 fire but cable keys for 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.310
 open the saddle the chest and boxes 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.140
 gloves so we have two good storage 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.930
 it's quite practical a handlebar 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.640
 warnings it picked up quite enough that 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.429
 pass and I think it will be very 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.700
 efficient in town and especially its engine 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.399
 so is taken from the sh300i a vehicle 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.330
 known and which is remarkable already for 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.430
 its potential 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.739
 good it is a power of 28 horses 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.150
 but with a very good length, so we 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.440
 should have good performance and 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.720
 especially a good responsiveness to 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.569
 acceleration 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.000
 so he's ready for the city and so 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.590
 our hostess is already ready to 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.700
 reptiles to slip into the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.860
 urban traffic 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.860
 see you soon for the test 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.810
 at
