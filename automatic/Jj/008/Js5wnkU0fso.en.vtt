nails<00:02:25.599> for<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.650> kind<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.099> playing

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
nails for that and this kind of playing

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.339 
nails for that and this kind of playing
is<00:02:27.459> really<00:02:27.489> handy<00:02:28.000> if<00:02:28.870> I'm<00:02:29.049> doing<00:02:29.200> something

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
is really handy if I'm doing something

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.710 
is really handy if I'm doing something
on<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:29.950> fly<00:02:30.220> like<00:02:31.000> when<00:02:31.150> I'm<00:02:31.239> singing<00:02:31.450> at

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
on the fly like when I'm singing at

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.110 
on the fly like when I'm singing at
school<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.349> let's<00:02:33.010> say<00:02:33.160> my<00:02:33.310> claw<00:02:33.519> hammer<00:02:33.790> or

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
school and let's say my claw hammer or

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.449 
school and let's say my claw hammer or
my<00:02:34.299> finger<00:02:34.660> picking<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.290> not<00:02:35.530> fast<00:02:35.890> enough<00:02:36.130> to

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
my finger picking is not fast enough to

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.979 
my finger picking is not fast enough to
do<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:36.730> particular<00:02:37.150> song<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.569> want<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.840> do<00:02:37.959> I

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
do the particular song I want to do I

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.839 
do the particular song I want to do I
don't<00:02:38.140> know<00:02:38.410> well<00:02:38.590> enough<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:39.099> can<00:02:39.519> sort<00:02:39.730> of

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
don't know well enough I can sort of

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.309 
don't know well enough I can sort of
resort<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.299> this<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.780> makes<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.140> decent

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
resort to this and it makes a decent

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.390 
resort to this and it makes a decent
musical<00:02:41.920> sound

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.100 

okay<00:02:48.939> so<00:02:49.000> now<00:02:49.269> we're<00:02:49.450> going<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.629> try<00:02:49.840> some

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
okay so now we're going to try some

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.649 
okay so now we're going to try some
figure<00:02:50.409> picking<00:02:50.860> but<00:02:51.760> without<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.090> pics<00:02:52.480> and

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
figure picking but without the pics and

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:53.910 
figure picking but without the pics and
when<00:02:52.780> you're<00:02:52.870> just<00:02:53.049> trying<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.379> use<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.709> nail

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
when you're just trying to use the nail

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.429 
when you're just trying to use the nail
now<00:02:54.519> again<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:55.060> thumbnail<00:02:55.569> is<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.840> bit<00:02:56.170> short

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
now again the thumbnail is a bit short

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:57.569 
now again the thumbnail is a bit short
i'm<00:02:56.590> going<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.769> grow<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.099> out<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.310> bit<00:02:57.549> and

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
i'm going to grow that out a bit and

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.000 
i'm going to grow that out a bit and
then<00:02:57.790> get<00:02:57.939> them<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.239> build<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.629> up<00:02:58.720> i<00:02:59.230> need<00:02:59.829> a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
then get them to build it up i need a

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.559 
then get them to build it up i need a
little<00:03:00.400> bit<00:03:00.610> more<00:03:00.939> so<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.239> i'm<00:03:01.420> actually

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
little bit more so that i'm actually

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.009 
little bit more so that i'm actually
getting<00:03:02.019> thumbnail<00:03:03.090> on<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.450> string<00:03:04.780> and

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
getting thumbnail on the string and

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.559 
getting thumbnail on the string and
that's<00:03:05.650> mostly<00:03:06.040> flesh<00:03:06.370> really<00:03:07.209> getting<00:03:07.450> the

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
that's mostly flesh really getting the

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.839 
that's mostly flesh really getting the
nail<00:03:07.720> unless<00:03:08.680> i<00:03:08.829> really<00:03:09.099> dig<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.609> there

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
nail unless i really dig it in there

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.599 
nail unless i really dig it in there
which<00:03:10.060> force<00:03:10.299> is<00:03:10.659> not<00:03:11.099> practical<00:03:12.099> for<00:03:12.129> what

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
which force is not practical for what

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.599 
which force is not practical for what
for<00:03:12.819> playing<00:03:13.060> at<00:03:13.180> tempo<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.680> we'll<00:03:15.099> try<00:03:15.340> little

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
for playing at tempo so we'll try little

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:16.979
