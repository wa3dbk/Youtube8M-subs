00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.559
 Good first thing I do after 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.570
 that I my hair I come and come back sexy 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.640
 repurchase and it's been a long time and I do not remember 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.529
 to complete without the cover I swore to 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.840
 Geez, and I still have to go. 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.270
 know where you sell is from that brand 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.630
 called sex and I like to leave the 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:36.379
 hair very soft and trickster I do it 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:43.370
 let's avoid and I thought look with a 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:45.260
 normal school after he is 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.649
 completely set on fire 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:01:02.090
 I paid a normal fine comb and combed 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:01:05.239
 He's ahead because he 's all right. 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.910
 combed forward I gather all 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.610
 hair and it was like this on my forehead 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.649
 I'll analyze from the tip of it I think 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.100
 not so good when it starts to hunger there 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.929
 You see that part here plays good but 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.810
 How I have a lot of pains to cut it all down. 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:23.479
 this I like - put scissors 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.590
 normal I touch the hair zone but 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:33.530
 is not that serious okay I cut 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:37.459
 type here put whole upside down 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.130
 when I do it he does not stay straight 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.380
 understood that it still does not seem 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.459
 It's great, I've told a lot. 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.459
 I tried again 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.689
 and ready 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.060
 it looks healthier 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:02:02.959
 and I'll dry and I'll be back to show you 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:05.450
 you as he gets the crown molding it 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:08.030
 being much healthier changes the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.670
 length it gets thigh type fringe 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.810
 not fringed but parts thereof but 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.580
 layers 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.160
 I like it when he stays whenever he 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.569
 It gets lighter over expensive than healthy 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.599
 usually the lussa part back like this 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.540
 It seems to me that it looks much better, too. 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.630
 healthy 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.739
 I 'm thinking a lot about staying by the 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.860
 my hair 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.590
 I 'm trying very hard not to cut 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.440
 he without passing any chemistry or anything 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.819
 so I'll have to stay a while without 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.250
 show a video go to these 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.989
 changes for you, I'm doing this 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.819
 I could not take me I needed I 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.540
 I'll let the hair grow the color of 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.400
 root 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.650
 I will not go in an ink the color of 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.329
 my hair is like this but I'm going to try not to 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.130
 I'm going to hit my hair, he always said 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.470
 but now I want to change to stay with 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.030
 healthier looking more natural 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.310
 you have the same problem as me of 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.930
 twirl something kind of 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.670
 people who moves a lot on the nail heads I 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.420
 I even have my hair 20 but very 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.430
 skin 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.980
 You know how hard it is to leave. 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.980
 still I cut my hair because I like 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.660
 leave it looking healthy 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.709
 I do not agree because I want him to 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.209
 grow 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.700
 I do not know who invented this 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.549
 story that the more you cut the more 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.650
 hair grows not have anything to do this okay 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.540
 because growth always comes from 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.560
 inside the hair of the nail 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.400
 all 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.130
 no use cutting your hair all over 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.329
 I found these things do nothing 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.480
 If you want your hair to look 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.840
 Enroll are the key is to change the habits 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.480
 have six elements that are 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.060
 necessary for growth 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.489
 by the first vitamin c is too long 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.890
 hair because it makes him stronger 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:58.360
 I left with more shine everything guava 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.849
 lemon orange broccoli tomato these 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.519
 things everything has vitamin c and that's all 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.170
 very necessary that your tomato hair is 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.599
 The best thing that hair skin I do not 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.580
 I like it tinged like sacrificing myself 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.730
 because I know it's doing very well 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.970
 potassium potassium is very good hair 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.150
 also because it prevents the fall and leaves the 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.810
 much healthier root add mushroom 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.150
 avocado spinach banana white beans 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.699
 sky is also good for hair because 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.449
 leaves the hair follicles well 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:34.539
 healthy and also helps the circulation 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.690
 from the eyes of the bass then prevent 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:42.970
 stay dry know oyster pumpkin 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:45.400
 potato passes onion peach almond 5 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.500
 aid in growth and repair of hair 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.289
 is damaged when you can find 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:57.970
 an egg is not much like liver and 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:00.610

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.729

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.639
 until then the natural oil of his 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.940
 dry hair on the root like carrot

 Romaine lettuce from the pepper plant 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.370
 ultimate beauty'in is thus the key to having 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.190
 healthy hair because it helps 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.960

 this kind of food first thing 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.960

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.970
 I'm going to eat, I eat a lot of sweet potatoes. 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.370
 sweet potato is great for hair like me 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.120
 I also said tomato does not taste but I 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.979
 as for me I sacrifice the 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.660
 This one to eat because I know it's going to 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.669
 make a cumulative difference because 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.350
 it's no use eating anything except 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.210

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.220

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.979
