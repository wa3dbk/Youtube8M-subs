degree so I'm studying engineering as
well<00:01:16.220> we<00:01:16.670> get<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:16.850> lot<00:01:17.000> more<00:01:17.060> exposure<00:01:18.049> to<00:01:18.229> the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
well we get a lot more exposure to the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.929 
well we get a lot more exposure to the
applications<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:19.009> maths<00:01:19.250> mats<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:19.729> school

was a lot of memorization of the teacher

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.319 
was a lot of memorization of the teacher
would<00:01:24.170> get<00:01:24.350> up<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:24.680> say<00:01:25.520> you're<00:01:26.180> going<00:01:26.299> to

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
would get up and say you're going to
