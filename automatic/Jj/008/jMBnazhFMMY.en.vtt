00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.780
 good hello to all the users that 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:11.379
 use the ipad ipod touch or iphone and 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.929
 this is my first video tutorial 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:18.130
 basically in this included how 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.480
 have the 2012 pes in its full version 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.950
 many users say they can not 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.560
 buy the game through the 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.100
 application but that they want in 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:33.140
 other ways to have it free then the 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:37.070
 method to have the complete pes 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.309
 is to download the file and I left the link 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.490
 at the bottom in the description 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.340
 of the video 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.310
 and when you enter this address 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.370
 that I have here is there are going to be three 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.580
 Syrian archives already and documents 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.920
 what you have to do is 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.250
 unzip or download the folder 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.380
 the zip file documents download it to 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.040
 your pc in any location you 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.880
 they said 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.670
 once you have downloaded the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.010
 next step is to connect your 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.380
 device and use a tool 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.479
 call eve a box 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.920
 this is also in the description of 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.039
 video and can be downloaded for 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.369
 free on the author's page then 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.369
 we enter 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:33.330
 when the device is recognized by the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.420
 next step is to look for the application 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.820
 of the fish game you have to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.230
 have the latest version of the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.560
 fish I think that at this moment I would not know 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.330
 tell them in what and in what version 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.020
 but try to always install the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.020
 last version then we enter 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.340
 to this 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.590
 general storage 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.680
 we hope that it appears 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.710
 I seem to have made a mistake 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.860
 neither user applications 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:21.240
 and you move and start to 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.000
 find the application pes2012 are 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.990
 organized alphabetically they do not 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.610
 it will be difficult to find it 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:34.760
 ay already appeared we opened 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.190
 the next step is to copy to 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.660
 device here in this part of here 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.390
 above are given click 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.820
 and there you will appear open you 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.060
 they look for where they have lodged the file 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.060
 that they downloaded previously 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.820
 usually I keep at desk or in 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.470
 downloads and they arrive and they give to open then 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.840
 I already have it put then no 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.310
 I need to do that you give it open 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:07.570
 automatically side will add here here 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.410
 file appears this file that 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.990
 I have right here in there 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.120
 exactly what this has but it has 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.000
 a file that makes the difference for 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.100
 that you can have it complete 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.190
 being up there then 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.240
 and we go to the photo to the iphone in 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.240
 my case is ipod
