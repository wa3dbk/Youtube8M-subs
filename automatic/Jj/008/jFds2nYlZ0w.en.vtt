hey<00:00:10.679> guys<00:00:10.920> what's<00:00:11.250> up<00:00:11.400> odds<00:00:11.670> are<00:00:11.910> if<00:00:12.000> you

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
hey guys what's up odds are if you

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.970 
hey guys what's up odds are if you
clicked<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.630> video<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:13.650> are<00:00:13.679> looking

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
clicked on this video you are looking

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.700 
clicked on this video you are looking
for<00:00:14.519> better<00:00:14.670> audio<00:00:15.269> quality<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:16.049> your<00:00:16.320> videos

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
for better audio quality in your videos

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.040 
for better audio quality in your videos
and<00:00:16.740> your<00:00:17.039> music<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.670> your<00:00:17.789> songs<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.420> we're

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
and your music in your songs and we're

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.109 
and your music in your songs and we're
gonna<00:00:19.170> get<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:19.529> Mike<00:00:19.770> talk<00:00:20.039> down<00:00:20.340> here<00:00:20.609> all

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
gonna get some Mike talk down here all

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.560 
gonna get some Mike talk down here all
right<00:00:21.359> now<00:00:21.750> let<00:00:22.560> us<00:00:22.710> break<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.100> down<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.970> what

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
right now let us break it down to what

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.500 
right now let us break it down to what
exactly<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.439> sound<00:00:25.830> sound<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.849> transmitted

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
exactly is sound sound is transmitted

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.480 
exactly is sound sound is transmitted
through<00:00:27.539> vibrations<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.830> captured<00:00:29.010> in

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
through vibrations and is captured in

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.910 
through vibrations and is captured in
the<00:00:29.580> same<00:00:29.849> way<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.510> basically<00:00:31.019> all<00:00:31.380> right

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the same way so basically all right

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.280 
the same way so basically all right
think<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.340> two<00:00:32.820> cups<00:00:33.180> connected<00:00:33.719> by<00:00:33.840> string

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
think of two cups connected by string

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.979 
think of two cups connected by string
and<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> most<00:00:35.610> basic<00:00:36.239> broken-down<00:00:36.719> way

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
and it's the most basic broken-down way

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.530 
and it's the most basic broken-down way
to<00:00:37.050> describe<00:00:37.440> how<00:00:37.710> sound<00:00:38.460> travels<00:00:38.550> on

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
to describe how sound travels on

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.330 
to describe how sound travels on
microphone<00:00:40.050> works<00:00:40.290> way<00:00:40.770> different<00:00:41.219> though

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
microphone works way different though

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.060 
microphone works way different though
but<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.960> basic<00:00:43.800> way

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
but but just think of that basic way

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.420 
but but just think of that basic way
that<00:00:44.670> audio<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.500> transmitted<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> vibrations

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that audio is transmitted the vibrations

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.340 
that audio is transmitted the vibrations
in<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> air<00:00:47.730> when<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.239> hear<00:00:48.480> me<00:00:48.629> speak<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.050> you

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
in the air when you hear me speak to you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.740 
in the air when you hear me speak to you
in<00:00:49.559> front<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.449> through<00:00:51.629> your

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
in front of you and and through your

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.119 
in front of you and and through your
speakers<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.289> works<00:00:52.440> differently<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:53.010> I'll

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
speakers it works differently but I'll

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670 
speakers it works differently but I'll
get<00:00:53.309> into<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.899> order<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.079> get<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
get into that in order to get get a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.750 
get into that in order to get get a
clear<00:00:56.370> crisp<00:00:56.969> signal<00:00:57.859> clear<00:00:58.859> crisp<00:00:59.219> signal

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
clear crisp signal clear crisp signal

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.000 
clear crisp signal clear crisp signal
the<00:01:00.180> string<00:01:00.539> needs<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.960> stiff<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.559> tight

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the string needs to be stiff and tight

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
the string needs to be stiff and tight
and<00:01:02.129> compressed<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:03.719> any<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.140> guys

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and compressed and if any of you guys

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.080 
and compressed and if any of you guys
know<00:01:04.350> how<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> speaker<00:01:05.129> works<00:01:05.250> out<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.939> know

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
know how a speaker works out I know

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.700 
know how a speaker works out I know
maybe<00:01:06.479> some<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.869> guys<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.530> guys

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
maybe some of you guys do if you guys

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.399 
maybe some of you guys do if you guys
are<00:01:07.979> heavy<00:01:08.189> into<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:09.390> know<00:01:09.510> blown<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.260> your

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
are heavy into you know blown up your

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.679 
are heavy into you know blown up your
stereo<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.369> car<00:01:11.610> or<00:01:11.760> whatever<00:01:13.640> basically

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
stereo in your car or whatever basically

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.990 
stereo in your car or whatever basically
the<00:01:15.689> way<00:01:15.810> your<00:01:15.990> speakers<00:01:16.409> work<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.790> your

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the way your speakers work is and your

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.999 
the way your speakers work is and your
eardrums<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.720> vibrations<00:01:19.290> are<00:01:19.439> amplified

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
eardrums the vibrations are amplified

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.950 
eardrums the vibrations are amplified
amplified<00:01:20.880> through<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.180> diaphragm<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
amplified through the diaphragm and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.340 
amplified through the diaphragm and
there's<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> circular<00:01:23.220> copper<00:01:23.640> foil<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
there's a circular copper foil in the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.830 
there's a circular copper foil in the
speakers<00:01:25.890> sound<00:01:26.549> comes<00:01:26.909> out<00:01:27.090> through<00:01:27.450> them<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
speakers sound comes out through them it

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.719 
speakers sound comes out through them it
makes<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.259> much<00:01:28.470> louder<00:01:28.860> vibration<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
makes a much louder vibration it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
makes a much louder vibration it
amplifies<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> vibration<00:01:30.900> I'm<00:01:31.110> microphone

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
amplifies the vibration I'm microphone

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.580 
amplifies the vibration I'm microphone
is<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.310> exact<00:01:32.759> opposite<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.780> speaker<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
is the exact opposite of a speaker the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
is the exact opposite of a speaker the
diaphragm<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.369> microphone<00:01:35.820> compresses<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
diaphragm in a microphone compresses the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.960 
diaphragm in a microphone compresses the
grains<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.960> vibrations<00:01:37.880> transforming<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
grains of vibrations transforming the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.480 
grains of vibrations transforming the
vibrations<00:01:39.600> into<00:01:39.810> electrical<00:01:40.079> currents<00:01:40.920> so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
vibrations into electrical currents so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.609 
vibrations into electrical currents so
technically<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.689> use<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> speaker<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
technically you can use the speaker as a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.920 
technically you can use the speaker as a
microphone<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.759> don't<00:01:44.939> believe<00:01:45.180> me<00:01:45.390> they<00:01:45.780> go

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
microphone you don't believe me they go

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.139 
microphone you don't believe me they go
to<00:01:45.990> your<00:01:46.170> local<00:01:46.320> McDonald's<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.310> go<00:01:47.939> through

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
to your local McDonald's and go through

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.490 
to your local McDonald's and go through
the<00:01:48.210> drive-through<00:01:48.540> that's<00:01:49.110> called<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the drive-through that's called a

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.920 
the drive-through that's called a
two-way<00:01:49.799> intercom<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.479> pretty<00:01:51.630> cool

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
two-way intercom I know it's pretty cool

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.950 
two-way intercom I know it's pretty cool
or<00:01:52.530> are<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.040> asleep<00:01:53.310> yet<00:01:53.610> whatever<00:01:54.270> let's

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
or are you asleep yet whatever let's

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.420 
or are you asleep yet whatever let's
talk<00:01:55.140> about<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:55.770> you're<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.399> for

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
talk about what you're really here for

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.280 
talk about what you're really here for
to<00:01:56.759> find<00:01:56.790> out<00:01:57.210> how<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.079> best

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
to find out how you can have the best

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.850 
to find out how you can have the best
sound<00:01:59.009> quality<00:01:59.340> I<00:02:00.030> use<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> dynamic<00:02:01.380> microphone

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
sound quality I use a dynamic microphone

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.069 
sound quality I use a dynamic microphone
that's<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.159> microphone<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.820> use<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.899> an

industry standard XLR microphone which a
lot<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.630> people<00:02:06.750> use<00:02:07.200> these<00:02:07.380> days<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:09.030> and

lot of people use these days and and and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.979 
lot of people use these days and and and
you<00:02:10.110> know<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.500> use<00:02:10.860> an<00:02:11.039> audio<00:02:11.340> interface<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
you know I use an audio interface and it

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.490 
you know I use an audio interface and it
comes<00:02:13.200> through

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
comes through

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.670 
comes through
mono<00:02:14.370> sound<00:02:15.090> which<00:02:15.660> means<00:02:15.960> there's<00:02:16.200> there's

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
mono sound which means there's there's

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.470 
mono sound which means there's there's
two<00:02:16.860> channels<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.400> audio<00:02:17.550> where's<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:17.970> stereo

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
two channels of audio where's a stereo

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.050 
two channels of audio where's a stereo
microphone<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.140> only<00:02:19.320> one<00:02:19.620> channel<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.880> only

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
microphone is only one channel it only

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.940 
microphone is only one channel it only
makes<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.450> real<00:02:21.870> difference<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.620> you're

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
makes a real difference if you're

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.530 
makes a real difference if you're
looking<00:02:23.070> for<00:02:23.250> surround<00:02:23.670> sound<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.240> if<00:02:24.420> you're

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
looking for surround sound so if you're

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.850 
looking for surround sound so if you're
making<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.840> movie<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.230> would<00:02:25.410> probably<00:02:25.830> want

mono audio a stereo mic would most

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.410 
mono audio a stereo mic would most
likely<00:02:28.410> be<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> USB<00:02:29.310> which<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.820> very<00:02:30.030> simple<00:02:30.270> to

there are different types of microphones
and<00:03:31.739> now<00:03:31.830> let's<00:03:32.250> get<00:03:32.430> into<00:03:32.640> each<00:03:32.910> one<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.209> them

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
and now let's get into each one of them

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.630 
and now let's get into each one of them
you've<00:03:34.019> got<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.320> dynamic<00:03:34.950> which<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.250> just<00:03:35.400> said

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
you've got a dynamic which I just said

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.530 
you've got a dynamic which I just said
was<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.360> opposite<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:38.070> speaker<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.760> then

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
was the opposite of a speaker and then

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.570 
was the opposite of a speaker and then
you<00:03:39.690> have<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> condenser<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.980> have<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.130> cardioid

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
you have a condenser you have a cardioid

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.819 
you have a condenser you have a cardioid
and<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.180> have<00:03:42.269> an<00:03:42.360> omni<00:03:42.780> microphone<00:03:43.260> now

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
and you have an omni microphone now

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.380 
and you have an omni microphone now
let's<00:03:44.040> go<00:03:44.190> into<00:03:44.400> what<00:03:44.549> each<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:44.880> them<00:03:45.000> are<00:03:45.150> and

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
let's go into what each of them are and

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.800 
let's go into what each of them are and
we<00:03:45.989> went<00:03:46.200> over<00:03:46.290> dynamic<00:03:46.920> mics<00:03:47.190> which<00:03:47.610> is<00:03:47.810> we

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
we went over dynamic mics which is we

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.420 
we went over dynamic mics which is we
don't<00:03:49.079> really<00:03:49.170> need<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.530> go<00:03:49.650> over<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:49.980> so

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
don't really need to go over that so

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.430 
don't really need to go over that so
let's<00:03:50.640> move<00:03:50.760> on<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.030> condenser<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.720> condenser

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
let's move on to condenser a condenser

dynamic<00:04:11.760> cardioid<00:04:12.090> microphone<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:13.110> then<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
dynamic cardioid microphone and then the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.520 
dynamic cardioid microphone and then the
last<00:04:13.680> one<00:04:13.890> is<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:15.030> Omni<00:04:15.690> microphone<00:04:16.200> which<00:04:16.410> is

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
last one is the Omni microphone which is

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.740 
last one is the Omni microphone which is
basically<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:17.010> round<00:04:17.310> table<00:04:17.549> Mike<00:04:17.940> where<00:04:18.540> it

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
basically a round table Mike where it

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.750 
basically a round table Mike where it
picks<00:04:18.959> up<00:04:19.229> audio<00:04:19.620> from<00:04:19.739> all<00:04:20.010> directions<00:04:20.160> this

picks up audio from all directions this

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.330 
picks up audio from all directions this
is<00:04:20.910> probably<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.450> best<00:04:21.660> for<00:04:21.900> musicians<00:04:22.340> live

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
is probably the best for musicians live

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.820 
is probably the best for musicians live
bands<00:04:23.729> choruses<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.479> things<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.260> large<00:04:25.620> scale

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
bands choruses and things of large scale

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.879 
bands choruses and things of large scale
like<00:04:26.099> that

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
like that

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.499 
like that
because<00:04:27.099> it<00:04:27.669> captures<00:04:27.909> just<00:04:28.330> about

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
because it captures just about

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.409 
because it captures just about
everything<00:04:28.840> around<00:04:29.409> it<00:04:29.680> all<00:04:30.370> right<00:04:30.610> so<00:04:31.060> let's

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
everything around it all right so let's

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.089 
everything around it all right so let's
just<00:04:31.569> say<00:04:31.840> you've<00:04:32.020> already<00:04:32.409> chosen<00:04:32.590> you<00:04:32.860> Mike

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
just say you've already chosen you Mike

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.459 
just say you've already chosen you Mike
now<00:04:33.849> what<00:04:34.150> we<00:04:34.539> want<00:04:34.659> to<00:04:34.810> figure<00:04:34.990> out<00:04:35.259> how<00:04:35.409> to

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:35.469 
now what we want to figure out how to

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:37.769 
now what we want to figure out how to
get<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.770> best<00:04:35.800> audio<00:04:36.490> out<00:04:36.789> of<00:04:37.240> what<00:04:37.389> you<00:04:37.509> got

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:37.779 
get the best audio out of what you got

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:39.929 
get the best audio out of what you got
the<00:04:37.960> first<00:04:38.229> audio<00:04:38.710> issue<00:04:38.919> that<00:04:39.189> pops<00:04:39.460> up<00:04:39.729> for

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:39.939 
the first audio issue that pops up for

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.480 
the first audio issue that pops up for
everybody<00:04:40.389> is<00:04:40.719> something<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:41.889> I<00:04:41.949> call<00:04:42.340> the

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
everybody is something that I call the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.100 
everybody is something that I call the
peas<00:04:42.699> and<00:04:42.909> bees<00:04:43.120> it's<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:44.110> pop<00:04:44.379> noises<00:04:45.039> like<00:04:46.110> BB

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
peas and bees it's a pop noises like BB

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.309 
peas and bees it's a pop noises like BB
when<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.800> say<00:04:48.009> P's<00:04:48.669> and<00:04:48.909> B's<00:04:49.449> you<00:04:49.930> hear<00:04:50.139> that

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
when you say P's and B's you hear that

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.019 
when you say P's and B's you hear that
pop<00:04:50.560> even<00:04:50.919> if<00:04:51.009> you<00:04:51.099> do<00:04:51.189> it<00:04:51.310> intentionally<00:04:51.580> like

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:52.029 
pop even if you do it intentionally like

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.140 
pop even if you do it intentionally like
I<00:04:52.150> just<00:04:52.210> did<00:04:52.449> and<00:04:52.779> these<00:04:53.770> compressed<00:04:54.370> closest

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
I just did and these compressed closest

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.559 
I just did and these compressed closest
sounds<00:04:55.749> interfere<00:04:56.590> with<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.830> quality<00:04:57.340> and

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
sounds interfere with the quality and

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.269 
sounds interfere with the quality and
something<00:04:58.569> that<00:04:58.599> I<00:04:58.870> haven't<00:04:59.229> really<00:04:59.800> done<00:05:00.069> but

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:00.279 
something that I haven't really done but

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.100 
something that I haven't really done but
I<00:05:00.310> should<00:05:00.610> do<00:05:00.789> is<00:05:01.090> get<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.330> win<00:05:01.539> screen<00:05:01.840> from<00:05:01.960> my

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
I should do is get a win screen from my

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.809 
I should do is get a win screen from my
microphone<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:03.069> limit<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.490> amount<00:05:03.580> of

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
microphone to limit the amount of

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.119 
microphone to limit the amount of
plosives<00:05:04.360> that<00:05:04.539> I<00:05:04.569> have<00:05:04.930> you<00:05:05.560> can<00:05:05.710> use<00:05:05.830> a<00:05:05.860> pop

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
plosives that I have you can use a pop

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.619 
plosives that I have you can use a pop
filter<00:05:06.370> but<00:05:06.699> I<00:05:06.729> really<00:05:07.029> I<00:05:07.060> really<00:05:07.210> don't

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
filter but I really I really don't

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:09.570 
filter but I really I really don't
recommend<00:05:07.960> using<00:05:08.289> it<00:05:08.560> because<00:05:08.680> they<00:05:09.340> aren't

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
recommend using it because they aren't

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.279 
recommend using it because they aren't
as<00:05:09.789> good<00:05:10.060> and<00:05:10.330> they're<00:05:10.750> much<00:05:10.900> more<00:05:11.110> of<00:05:11.229> a

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
as good and they're much more of a

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.830 
as good and they're much more of a
hassle<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.710> set<00:05:12.039> up<00:05:12.219> and<00:05:12.520> stuff<00:05:12.939> like<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:13.180> so

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
hassle to set up and stuff like that so

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.570 
hassle to set up and stuff like that so
that's<00:05:14.080> if<00:05:14.409> your<00:05:14.620> microphone<00:05:15.099> could<00:05:15.250> take<00:05:15.430> it

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
that's if your microphone could take it

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.459 
that's if your microphone could take it
I<00:05:15.759> would<00:05:15.939> prefer<00:05:16.180> a<00:05:16.659> wind<00:05:16.930> screen<00:05:17.199> which<00:05:17.319> is<00:05:17.439> a

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:17.469 
I would prefer a wind screen which is a

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.769 
I would prefer a wind screen which is a
little<00:05:17.710> is<00:05:17.949> the<00:05:18.159> foamy<00:05:18.430> kind<00:05:18.819> whereas<00:05:19.449> a<00:05:19.479> pop

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:19.779 
little is the foamy kind whereas a pop

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:21.719 
little is the foamy kind whereas a pop
filter<00:05:20.020> is<00:05:20.409> something<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:20.830> might<00:05:20.979> see<00:05:21.279> like

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
filter is something you might see like

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.600 
filter is something you might see like
in<00:05:21.969> a<00:05:22.270> studio<00:05:22.659> and<00:05:23.020> and<00:05:23.469> there's<00:05:24.310> really

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
in a studio and and there's really

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.999 
in a studio and and there's really
differences<00:05:25.270> for<00:05:25.449> each<00:05:25.569> one<00:05:25.810> of<00:05:25.839> them<00:05:25.990> I<00:05:26.199> but<00:05:26.979> I

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
differences for each one of them I but I

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.010 
differences for each one of them I but I
don't<00:05:27.219> want<00:05:27.339> to<00:05:27.400> go<00:05:27.520> into<00:05:27.699> that<00:05:27.819> in<00:05:27.999> in<00:05:28.479> this

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
don't want to go into that in in this

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.409 
don't want to go into that in in this
video<00:05:29.349> one<00:05:30.099> microphone<00:05:30.490> that<00:05:30.759> I<00:05:30.819> do<00:05:30.939> want<00:05:31.360> to

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
video one microphone that I do want to

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.659 
video one microphone that I do want to
cover<00:05:31.629> before<00:05:31.870> I<00:05:32.080> wrap<00:05:32.319> up<00:05:32.560> or<00:05:32.919> well<00:05:33.189> it's<00:05:33.400> it's

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
cover before I wrap up or well it's it's

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.279 
cover before I wrap up or well it's it's
more<00:05:33.939> than<00:05:34.060> just<00:05:34.120> one<00:05:34.449> brand<00:05:34.930> but<00:05:35.080> I'm<00:05:35.199> going

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
more than just one brand but I'm going

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.140 
more than just one brand but I'm going
to<00:05:35.379> use<00:05:35.469> one<00:05:35.500> brand<00:05:35.949> as<00:05:36.129> an<00:05:36.580> example<00:05:36.909> it's

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
to use one brand as an example it's

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.959 
to use one brand as an example it's
called<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.449> electro<00:05:37.870> voice<00:05:38.050> re<00:05:38.379> 20<00:05:38.949> and<00:05:39.129> this

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
called the electro voice re 20 and this

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.200 
called the electro voice re 20 and this
microphone<00:05:40.719> is<00:05:40.990> top<00:05:41.710> of<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.919> line<00:05:42.129> for

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
microphone is top of the line for

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.070 
microphone is top of the line for
broadcasting<00:05:43.210> I'm<00:05:43.479> not<00:05:43.719> sure<00:05:43.779> which

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
broadcasting I'm not sure which

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.409 
broadcasting I'm not sure which
youtubers<00:05:44.680> really<00:05:45.129> use<00:05:45.580> this<00:05:45.819> I<00:05:46.029> don't<00:05:46.300> I

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
youtubers really use this I don't I

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.329 
youtubers really use this I don't I
don't<00:05:46.449> know<00:05:47.080> of<00:05:47.229> any<00:05:47.349> in<00:05:47.500> particular<00:05:47.589> that<00:05:48.159> use

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:48.339 
don't know of any in particular that use

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.309 
don't know of any in particular that use
this<00:05:48.550> but<00:05:49.149> I<00:05:49.180> just<00:05:49.539> found<00:05:49.750> this<00:05:49.990> because<00:05:50.169> of

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 
this but I just found this because of

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.260 
this but I just found this because of
the<00:05:50.500> style<00:05:50.889> and<00:05:51.189> I<00:05:51.279> you<00:05:51.339> i'm<00:05:51.610> using<00:05:51.879> this<00:05:51.969> as<00:05:52.149> an

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
the style and I you i'm using this as an

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.279 
the style and I you i'm using this as an
example<00:05:52.569> because<00:05:52.689> i<00:05:52.899> heard<00:05:53.050> good<00:05:53.229> things

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
example because i heard good things

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.559 
example because i heard good things
about<00:05:53.589> this<00:05:53.860> microphone<00:05:54.399> as<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:55.180> see<00:05:55.389> there

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569 
about this microphone as you see there

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.269 
about this microphone as you see there
are<00:05:55.659> all<00:05:55.810> these<00:05:55.990> little<00:05:56.199> openings<00:05:56.770> along<00:05:56.919> each

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:57.279 
are all these little openings along each

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.610 
are all these little openings along each
side<00:05:57.310> which<00:05:58.029> gives<00:05:58.330> some<00:05:58.569> relief<00:05:58.899> for<00:05:59.500> the

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
side which gives some relief for the

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.529 
side which gives some relief for the
compressed<00:05:59.979> air<00:06:00.069> entering<00:06:00.580> so<00:06:01.149> that<00:06:01.300> means

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
compressed air entering so that means

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.360 
compressed air entering so that means
there's<00:06:01.779> less<00:06:01.839> popping<00:06:02.560> noises<00:06:02.770> with<00:06:03.189> the

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
there's less popping noises with the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.760 
there's less popping noises with the
closest<00:06:03.939> sounds<00:06:04.419> and<00:06:04.599> and<00:06:05.169> one<00:06:05.439> thing<00:06:05.649> with

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
closest sounds and and one thing with

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.860 
closest sounds and and one thing with
these<00:06:05.919> top<00:06:06.129> of<00:06:06.279> the<00:06:06.339> line<00:06:06.550> studio<00:06:07.210> mikes<00:06:07.569> is

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
these top of the line studio mikes is

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.559 
these top of the line studio mikes is
something<00:06:08.830> called<00:06:08.979> a<00:06:09.279> low<00:06:09.610> proximity<00:06:10.419> effect

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:10.569 
something called a low proximity effect

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.869 
something called a low proximity effect
which<00:06:11.319> means<00:06:11.649> is<00:06:11.860> when<00:06:12.039> i<00:06:12.069> move<00:06:12.339> around<00:06:12.669> like

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:12.879 
which means is when i move around like

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:15.209 
which means is when i move around like
this<00:06:13.120> when<00:06:13.449> you<00:06:13.539> hear<00:06:13.870> me<00:06:14.050> i'm<00:06:14.529> turning<00:06:15.189> my

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:15.219 
this when you hear me i'm turning my

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.749 
this when you hear me i'm turning my
head<00:06:15.339> right<00:06:15.729> now<00:06:15.759> what<00:06:16.719> that<00:06:16.899> does<00:06:17.169> is<00:06:17.550> you<00:06:18.550> you

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
head right now what that does is you you

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.360 
head right now what that does is you you
hear<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.210> tone<00:06:19.419> of<00:06:19.479> my<00:06:19.629> voice<00:06:19.719> change<00:06:20.439> like

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
hear the tone of my voice change like

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.610 
hear the tone of my voice change like
i'm<00:06:21.550> turning<00:06:22.089> my<00:06:22.120> head<00:06:22.240> but<00:06:22.930> with<00:06:23.110> this<00:06:23.289> low

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
i'm turning my head but with this low

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.159 
i'm turning my head but with this low
proximity<00:06:24.310> effect<00:06:24.430> that<00:06:24.789> this<00:06:24.969> re<00:06:25.539> 20<00:06:25.960> gives

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
proximity effect that this re 20 gives

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.529 
proximity effect that this re 20 gives
off<00:06:26.520> you<00:06:27.520> could<00:06:27.669> turn<00:06:27.819> your<00:06:27.969> head<00:06:28.149> look<00:06:28.419> at

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
off you could turn your head look at

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:29.999 
off you could turn your head look at
your<00:06:28.659> monitor<00:06:29.110> look<00:06:29.289> at<00:06:29.409> a<00:06:29.439> piece<00:06:29.589> of<00:06:29.649> paper

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
your monitor look at a piece of paper

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.579 
your monitor look at a piece of paper
and<00:06:30.250> the<00:06:30.669> tone<00:06:30.879> of<00:06:30.909> your<00:06:31.060> volume<00:06:31.599> changes<00:06:32.080> but

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:32.589 
and the tone of your volume changes but

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:34.230 
and the tone of your volume changes but
the<00:06:32.620> tone<00:06:32.949> of<00:06:32.979> your<00:06:33.219> voice<00:06:33.250> still<00:06:33.849> stays<00:06:34.089> the

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
the tone of your voice still stays the

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.670 
the tone of your voice still stays the
same<00:06:34.449> so<00:06:34.509> it<00:06:34.810> still<00:06:35.050> sounds<00:06:35.409> like<00:06:35.500> you're

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
same so it still sounds like you're

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.379 
same so it still sounds like you're
you're<00:06:36.279> in<00:06:36.310> the<00:06:36.490> room<00:06:36.669> with<00:06:36.879> the<00:06:37.000> person

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 
you're in the room with the person

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.899 
you're in the room with the person
whereas<00:06:38.080> for<00:06:38.289> me<00:06:38.469> it<00:06:38.740> this<00:06:39.370> is<00:06:39.580> one<00:06:39.729> of<00:06:39.759> the

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:39.909 
whereas for me it this is one of the

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:40.650 
whereas for me it this is one of the
cons<00:06:40.300> of

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
cons of

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.180 
cons of
what<00:06:40.810> my<00:06:40.960> microphone<00:06:41.440> which<00:06:41.560> I<00:06:41.680> love<00:06:42.010> my

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
what my microphone which I love my

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.830 
what my microphone which I love my
microphone<00:06:42.760> but<00:06:42.940> that's<00:06:43.090> one<00:06:43.300> of<00:06:43.360> the<00:06:43.450> cons<00:06:43.690> I

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
microphone but that's one of the cons I

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.630 
microphone but that's one of the cons I
have<00:06:43.930> to<00:06:44.020> be<00:06:44.140> up<00:06:44.170> close<00:06:44.320> to<00:06:44.560> it<00:06:44.710> every<00:06:45.370> time<00:06:45.610> and

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:45.640 
have to be up close to it every time and

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.150 
have to be up close to it every time and
if<00:06:45.820> I'm<00:06:45.970> to<00:06:46.150> closing<00:06:46.480> there's<00:06:47.140> plosive<00:06:47.650> sounds

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
if I'm to closing there's plosive sounds

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.250 
if I'm to closing there's plosive sounds
and<00:06:48.340> I<00:06:48.460> could<00:06:48.730> and<00:06:48.910> so<00:06:49.570> that's<00:06:49.750> basically<00:06:49.960> all

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.260 
and I could and so that's basically all

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.750 
and I could and so that's basically all
I<00:06:50.410> wanted<00:06:50.710> to<00:06:50.830> cover<00:06:51.010> in<00:06:51.190> this<00:06:51.220> video<00:06:51.460> I<00:06:51.640> hope

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760
