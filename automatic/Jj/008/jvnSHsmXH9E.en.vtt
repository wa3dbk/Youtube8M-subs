wireless<00:00:23.430> MIDI<00:00:23.939> they<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.570> network

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
wireless MIDI they have like a network

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
wireless MIDI they have like a network
connection<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.830> way<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.029> initiate<00:00:27.029> that

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
connection the way you initiate that

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.060 
connection the way you initiate that
connection<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:27.990> bit<00:00:28.109> tricky<00:00:28.560> we

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
connection is a little bit tricky we

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.990 
connection is a little bit tricky we

sure it's on the same Wi-Fi network so

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.910 
sure it's on the same Wi-Fi network so
I've<00:00:52.110> done<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.590> here<00:00:54.230> you<00:00:55.230> could<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
I've done that here you could have to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.029 
I've done that here you could have to
double<00:00:56.910> click<00:00:57.140> Network<00:00:59.600> ok<00:01:00.600> yeah<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.710> was

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
double click Network ok yeah so I was

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.830 
double click Network ok yeah so I was
connected<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.699> before<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.420> then<00:01:03.539> if

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
connected to this before and then if

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.950 
connected to this before and then if
your<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.890> your<00:01:05.129> iPhone<00:01:05.280> goes<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> sleep<00:01:06.720> then

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
your if your iPhone goes to sleep then

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.539 
your if your iPhone goes to sleep then
the<00:01:07.110> connection<00:01:07.560> gets<00:01:07.740> lost<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.220> basically

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the connection gets lost but basically

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.719 
the connection gets lost but basically
when<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.880> open<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> double<00:01:10.350> click

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
when you open up when you double click

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.940 
when you open up when you double click
networks<00:01:12.140> icon<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.409> where<00:01:13.830> you're

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
networks icon right here where you're

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.800 
networks icon right here where you're
going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:15.119> you're<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.509> have<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
going to see is you're going to have a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
going to see is you're going to have a
directory<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.159> your<00:01:17.369> phone<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:18.390> that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
directory here with your phone in that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.670 
directory here with your phone in that
directory<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> then<00:01:21.840> basically<00:01:22.170> click

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
directory so then basically click

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.359 
directory so then basically click
connect<00:01:23.240> right<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.979> shows<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.189> my

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
connect right here it shows that my

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.100 
connect right here it shows that my
phone<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.670> connected<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.020> now<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:29.009> is

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
phone is connected so now what we do is

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.280 
phone is connected so now what we do is
you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.290> open<00:01:32.090> pad<00:01:33.090> midi<00:01:34.369> free<00:01:35.369> app<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:36.290> think

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you can open pad midi free app I think

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.969 
you can open pad midi free app I think
originally<00:01:37.979> opens<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.990> pad<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.950> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
originally opens as pad like so so you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.249 
originally opens as pad like so so you
see<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.670> use<00:01:45.000> pad<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.570> want<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.079> I

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
see you can use pad if you want but I

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.560 
see you can use pad if you want but I
mean<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.590> prefer<00:01:46.890> keys<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.509> if

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
mean I prefer keys because you know if

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.850 
mean I prefer keys because you know if
you<00:01:48.659> make<00:01:48.810> analogies<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.290> probably<00:01:49.649> want<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
you make analogies you probably want to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.620 
you make analogies you probably want to
use<00:01:49.920> key<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.149> go<00:01:51.299> into<00:01:51.420> different

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
use key so you go into different

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.940 
use key so you go into different
instruments<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.409> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.649> want<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> just

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
instruments you kind of want to just

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.100 
instruments you kind of want to just
give<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.399> good<00:01:53.579> test<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.899> works

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
give it a good test you know that works

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
give it a good test you know that works
and<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> also<00:01:55.829> don't<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.250> actual<00:01:56.759> MIDI

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and if you also don't have actual MIDI

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.760 
and if you also don't have actual MIDI
keyboard<00:01:57.570> convertor<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.560> know

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
keyboard convertor you know

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.490 
keyboard convertor you know
this<00:01:58.950> could<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> quick<00:01:59.899> quick<00:02:00.899> dirty<00:02:01.140> trick

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this could be a quick quick dirty trick

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.020 
this could be a quick quick dirty trick
to<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:02.039> it<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.549> know<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:02.789> might<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:02.939> a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
to do it you know there might be a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.669 
to do it you know there might be a
latency<00:02:03.329> again<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.899> adjust<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.560> all

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
latency again you can adjust it and all

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:12.350 
latency again you can adjust it and all
of<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:08.989> yeah<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.580> how<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.940> use

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
of that but yeah and that is how you use

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.180 
of that but yeah and that is how you use
