 Hi, I'm Juan David Jrr 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.870
 and in this video tutorial I bring you how 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.849
 put music to gta san andreas for 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.520
 listen to your favorite music while 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.950
 you play ok let's start first go to 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
 my documents or documents according to 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.210
 windows that we have I have the 7 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.400
 then it's documents then yes 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.530
 we have the gta san andreas full no 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.170
 portable or rip this we can do 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.390
 let's go to gta san andreas user files here 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.370
 we have the gallery folder that is where 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.410
 the photos that we take with the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.230
 camera and where it says user tracks is 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.269
 where we will play the songs let's make 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.030
 account that these songs were not 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.519
 here ok let's cut the songs that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.710
 let's put the eye game has them 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.079
 what to copy do not cut or if you do not 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.210
 will let you paste as a shortcut 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.399
 because these songs have to be put 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 as a shortcut for the game 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.210
 recognize them 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.910
 as they see when cutting them does not give the option of 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.630
 paste as a shortcut now if the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.630
 I'm going to copy 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.730
 ok it's all left to configure the ones in the 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.560
 game I will show you how we open the 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.290
 game and we go to options then to 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.930
 sound settings then options 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.730
 of songs in soft and finally in 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.740
 scan user songs them 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.740
 I recommend that you leave this in sequential 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.459
 [Music] 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:10.289
 [Music] 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:36.699
 [Music] 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.860
 [Music] 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.160
 as you see, since this was not all, I went 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.160
