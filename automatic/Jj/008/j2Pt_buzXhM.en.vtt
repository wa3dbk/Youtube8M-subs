00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.770
 no anthony you with a new video 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.360
 today talk about carbohydrate 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.860
 circulate 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.180
 that is actually carb in English 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.650
 cycling 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.230
 when is this actually perfect 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.509
 dot and that is sir already have some pounds 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.060
 lost then this can certainly help to those 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.680
 take the last kilos off for that 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.300
 to make abdominal muscles visible 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.279
 but it also works perfectly if you just 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.910
 starts with greasing your fat loss what is 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.009
 the carbohydrate circular is actually 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.750
 day to day differences in total 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.550
 carbohydrate intake 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.620
 so for example a high carbohydrate 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.120
 day and a low hear Monday than gold 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.429
 so have more left over 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.140
 with which carbohydrate circulates 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.570
 instead of just a layer 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.059
 carbohydrate diet is actually because one 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.670
 Key to success is more fat loss 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.260
 actually for good metabolism 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.420
 and with a low carbohydrate 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.280
 Dieting is ultimately metabolism 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.260
 what kind of slow and there is very difficult 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.920
 get the fat off 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.710
 so if you do the carb cycling stay 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.510
 you lose that fat and it makes you already 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.420
 it also makes it mentally easier 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.180
 for you because you are less likely to snack 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.040
 and cardigan goes well 9 because you just do 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.079
 your body that has to let go on that 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.759
 days that needs here and how are you 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.649
 the carbohydrate well circulate in its 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.060
 operation then I am going to tell you now 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.369
 three different days a high 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.590
 carbohydrate may be mediocre you hear that 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.259
 and also a day that your intake what 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.329
 low in those carbohydrates and that 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.189
 is also about what sports days you have 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.810
 so you have thought in nothing more 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.789
 then of course you have a layer 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.009
 carbohydrate day 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.259
 and you have a very active day so think 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.880
 then a fullbody schedule or a day 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.380
 that you roll a lot of legs from the back 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.789
 those are big muscles that many 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.649
 burning calories 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.140
 then I recommend a high carbohydrate 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.789
 day to choose from and your personal 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.530
 mediocre days that are for example 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.229
 for cardio or for the smaller muscles 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.649
 and also just the comparison, I just go 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.689
 say 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.850
 because you have the seven days a week 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.759
 we often choose three mediocre ones 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.219
 carbohydrate days three days with low 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.679
 carbohydrate intake or rest days often 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:10.500
 and a day you often choose high 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.819
 carbohydrate day that you are just as good at it again 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.159
 fills muscles 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.780
 Here's how to deliver an example 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.700
 week can look like you are going to carb 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.290
 cycling with that full body scheme where you 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.659
 so you see three times a week 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.549
 power force power and a day of cardio 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.189
 and then changing gave my waist 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.379
 low and high days ok we continue to 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.120
 the following 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.739
 how much should you take to put on low 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.340
 carbohydrate days would actually 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.439
 between 50 and a bit of 150 grams 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.049
 sit down on carbohydrates and that is 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.329
 for example a number of pieces of fruit or 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.069
 just a large portion of rice and then 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.379
 we go to a mediocre day that is 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.849
 a little between 150 and 300 grams 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.919
 carbohydrates 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.659
 well if you are someone who is not 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:54.609
 so many calories may go some more 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.260
 out of those 150 grams and that is 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.209
 for example two cereal products 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.189
 a day or late say a lot of fruit 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.599
 and a grain product 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.400
 ok now we go to the last one 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.889
 you can take that high carbohydrate day there 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.810
 really high sit 300 plus 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.209
 and I sometimes do a 900 gram myself 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.230
 carbohydrates in one day and nine hundred 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.510
 times 4 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.120
 that's are those calories is 36 100 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.280
 carbohydrate calories alone so 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.599
 then you go really well on funda but care 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.750
 then of course it is your fat layer 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.790
 down otherwise you'll be going much fast 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.099
 calories and you want that again 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.449
 let grow there mediocre for days 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.439
 grows in days and high in carbohydrate 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.599
 days 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.879
 alternate by whole week that goes for you 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.349
 who continue to write the family on that 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.389
 was the video thanks for watching 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.250
 give the video a thumbs up is one 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.349
 found interesting subscribe to my channel 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.879
 if you haven't done that yet and me 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.879
 you see the video often Wednesday
