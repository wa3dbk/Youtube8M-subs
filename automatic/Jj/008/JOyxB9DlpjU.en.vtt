00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
these questions what coming up and well

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.139 
these questions what coming up and well
it's<00:00:34.620> only<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> five<00:00:35.070> bar<00:00:35.280> dark<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.760> i<00:00:35.790> would

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
it's only a five bar dark so i would

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.580 
it's only a five bar dark so i would
think<00:00:36.300> people<00:00:36.480> could<00:00:36.719> really<00:00:37.050> wait<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.380> long

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
think people could really wait that long

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.500 
think people could really wait that long
but<00:00:38.309> maybe<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.610> can't<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.090> know<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> focus

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
but maybe they can't you know the focus

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.850 
but maybe they can't you know the focus
the<00:00:39.629> story<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.050> who<00:00:40.260> killed<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.590> Scarlet

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the story is who killed the Scarlet

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.850 
the story is who killed the Scarlet
Witch<00:00:40.950> why<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.079> what's<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.800> on

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
Witch why and and what's really going on

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.350 
Witch why and and what's really going on
and<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.129> think<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.550> people<00:00:44.670> go<00:00:44.969> through

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and I think that if people go through

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.069 
and I think that if people go through
issue<00:00:46.010> 3.1<00:00:47.010> they'll<00:00:47.969> see<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.450> almost<00:00:48.809> every

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
issue 3.1 they'll see that almost every

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.139 
issue 3.1 they'll see that almost every
one<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.379> characters<00:00:49.680> has<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.219> mystery

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
one of the characters has a mystery

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.970 
one of the characters has a mystery
about<00:00:51.239> them<00:00:51.629> some<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.199> people<00:00:52.770> think

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
about them some of which people think

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.220 
about them some of which people think
are<00:00:53.190> errors<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.730> continuity<00:00:54.090> when<00:00:54.629> they<00:00:55.050> ought

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
are errors in continuity when they ought

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.720 
are errors in continuity when they ought
to<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.379> thinking<00:00:55.530> well<00:00:56.100> no<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:56.460> must<00:00:56.579> be

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
to be thinking well no there must be

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.040 
to be thinking well no there must be
something<00:00:57.059> wrong<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.510> they're<00:00:57.870> not

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
something wrong because they're not

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.049 
something wrong because they're not
acting<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.440> way<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.590> they<00:00:58.829> normally<00:00:58.980> put<00:00:59.370> so

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
acting the way that they normally put so

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.770 
acting the way that they normally put so
it's<00:01:00.480> exciting<00:01:01.140> issue<00:01:01.440> too<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.420> Joe<00:01:03.420> many<00:01:03.600> are

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
