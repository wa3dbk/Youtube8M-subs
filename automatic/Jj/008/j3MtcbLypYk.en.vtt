00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:05.750
 in this video I would like to see it rise and give some tips about 

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:09.460
 starting the book with a 3d hanged I had quite a lot of questions 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.409
 about this 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:15.929
 he had the number pi on paper in the first half I used is the tip of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.980
 the iceberg of the hema 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.519
 though it seems 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.460
 that there were 80 grammes of paper gram was also possible 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.579
 but also difficult because I agree 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.230
 agents try to clean print paper an colored its own the sun on a cup 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.410
 coffee 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.500
 And then the tape also makes six seconds 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.330
 the standard sizes have yes but experienced the little things last year 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.650
 that is 5 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.650
 come only three centimeters by three comma 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.090
 and then i'm going to show how i'll just cut a few my pieces soon 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.110
 I am therefore more of the shock of the scare 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.580
 use the eighth edition of 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.480
 after four pieces of paper the only thing you actually do is the double double 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.180
 double mistake what you take 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.620
 square of speeches just body paper can also 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.630
 but square chocolate makers are not looking good so the best advice 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.630
 stage africa 4 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.760
 can of course also and columns 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.990
 keep holding 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.990
 hudson so it just goes quiet 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.790
 which can 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.970
 for criticism 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.970
 that site bird not 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.050
 the campaign made work 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:14.099
 basis that most people have experienced is that they have a chance 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.359
 If you have to vote for this makes you look out of a paper taxi too 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.569

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.109
 board member 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.989
 city ​​hedges made public 6 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.300
 can sail those bits and that is going to do just as much now 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.620
 but we do that with a bigger size 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.569
 that will be 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.939
 what better to sing gadgets 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:48.810
 7 only come four centimeters to the barge a2 that 6 internship the ministry 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.909
 made credibility 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.909
 the little things competition like fall out 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.919
 the first has changed also the guestbook jammed 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.729
 both as your father 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.759
 of buying 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.759
 there I go there is no damage at the top 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.939
 the three months aside as well 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.439
 the job came 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.089
 then you go these dots 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:27.019
 I'm going to .. you 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.769
 inland shipping 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.769
 of course both sides 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.579
 flap services 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.239
 from boekel 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.069
 that is a public secret 3 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.149
 now just a little 9 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:52.089
 little thing 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:55.089
 as it is now this one is closed 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.699
 what i mean is that when i see about twenty pieces of landscape, i also wear it 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:02.669
 whatever i do 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.879
 furthermore, users can easily keep track of pieces you need 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.659
 but so you get happy with it because when you get out of the story together 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.109
 so you just have pieces too 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.729
 Knokke Heist is also rare on Cassette Dusseldorp 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.729
 she mask rests a lot together once he can 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.719
 So that's just writing a piece 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:33.789
 makes 6 5 bowl with 3 centimeter pain 3com most beautiful common 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.969
 and that is slightly larger 3 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.479
 could make the first set 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.139
 just four centimeters 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.569
 five comma 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.340
 I also hope very much that the pieces are the same 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.319
 taken line 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.449
 most things that 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.339
 afterwards, if the sound is, it can still not be bent if necessary 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.009
 Certainly because he has nothing to fit we are not made yet if this is it 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.490
 easy to do if you don't mind using it for a long time 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.780
 then that is just to do and then the piece is well put together 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.310
 and I actually think that until the top such a serious degree fit are still questions 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.449
 contact has been more 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.330
 youtube 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.330
 vs hoek I can be found there despite ansell healthcare 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:23.449
 and I hope I don't have these tips yet
