00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
one looks like I purchased this gas can

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.979 
one looks like I purchased this gas can
on<00:00:36.079> ebay<00:00:36.469> cost<00:00:36.860> me<00:00:37.040> about<00:00:37.480> $70<00:00:38.480> for<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.750> scan

on ebay cost me about $70 for the scan

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.350 
on ebay cost me about $70 for the scan
but<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.980> gas<00:00:40.250> when<00:00:40.820> you're<00:00:40.940> actually

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
but the gas when you're actually

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.209 
but the gas when you're actually
squeezing<00:00:42.019> this<00:00:42.260> trigger<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:42.769> squeeze<00:00:43.070> this

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
squeezing this trigger you squeeze this

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.910 
squeezing this trigger you squeeze this
trigger<00:00:43.429> right<00:00:44.269> here<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:44.809> it<00:00:44.929> allows<00:00:45.050> gas<00:00:45.589> to

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
trigger right here and it allows gas to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.989 
trigger right here and it allows gas to
come<00:00:46.100> out<00:00:46.309> this<00:00:46.789> spout<00:00:47.179> it<00:00:47.539> fills<00:00:47.899> up<00:00:48.170> by<00:00:48.679> this

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:48.999 
come out this spout it fills up by this

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.369 
come out this spout it fills up by this
spring-loaded<00:00:49.999> thing<00:00:50.660> right<00:00:50.839> here<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:51.260> this

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
spring-loaded thing right here so this

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.860 
spring-loaded thing right here so this
gas<00:00:51.649> can<00:00:51.949> if<00:00:52.219> it<00:00:52.370> tips<00:00:52.609> over<00:00:52.850> it's<00:00:53.480> not<00:00:53.690> going

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
gas can if it tips over it's not going

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.169 
gas can if it tips over it's not going
to<00:00:53.929> spill<00:00:54.199> gas<00:00:54.469> also<00:00:55.429> if<00:00:55.489> there's<00:00:55.670> a<00:00:55.730> fire<00:00:55.969> in<00:00:56.120> a

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
to spill gas also if there's a fire in a

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.139 
to spill gas also if there's a fire in a
vehicle<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:57.109> gas<00:00:57.379> can<00:00:57.739> is<00:00:58.039> a<00:00:58.070> metal<00:00:58.579> can<00:00:58.820> and

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
vehicle the gas can is a metal can and

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.110 
vehicle the gas can is a metal can and
unlike<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.289> plastic<00:01:00.859> hand<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.640> will<00:01:01.850> melt

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
unlike a plastic hand that will melt

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.649 
unlike a plastic hand that will melt
fast<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:02.899> then<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.230> gas<00:01:03.440> is<00:01:03.769> going<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:04.659> be

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
fast and then the gas is going to be

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.110 
fast and then the gas is going to be
part<00:01:05.960> of<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.110> fire<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:06.820> enhanced<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.909> fire

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
these safety cans cause the gas to not

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.410 
these safety cans cause the gas to not
ignite<00:01:12.200> for<00:01:12.470> a<00:01:13.000> significant<00:01:14.000> amount<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:14.270> time
