00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.670
 identical chat 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.540

 white now each of these slaves 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.000
 to fold accordion pockets should 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.899
 be the same width on all parts 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 my pizza was about the width 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.340

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.709
 named a small amount of glue with 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.250
 Senator Byrd rule 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.790
 we with orchids on another paint the same 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.140
 glue together 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.930
 left to arrange 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.480
 I think you guessed our little bird for 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.400
 this black cardboard cut out 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.450
 / and I already painted on white cardboard 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.450
 draw eyes 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.890
 and also where 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:10.659
 hole for this cut 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.900
 grease glue glue if you 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:16.000
 there is a hot glue better do it with 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.540
 using hot glue after 40 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.169
 wand but for this time must pass 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.260
 because the paper tree is hiding 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:27.609
 fast if you use holes summer 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.760
 it will be much faster 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.099
 Next glue eyebrows eyes and they 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.480
 yet all these details spring home to 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.949
 stick well 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.949
 the basis of crafts 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.489

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.950

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.530

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.519
