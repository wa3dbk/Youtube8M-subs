European hockey doesn't get feisty

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.060 
European hockey doesn't get feisty
thought<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> referees<00:01:28.710> were<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.009> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
thought the referees were going to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.130 
thought the referees were going to
penalize<00:01:29.250> lots<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.939> things<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.540> these<00:01:30.810> games

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
penalize lots of things in these games

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.200 
penalize lots of things in these games
but<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.799> was<00:01:32.009> close<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> fight<00:01:32.909> don't

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
but this was close to a fight don't

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.660 
but this was close to a fight don't
often<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.049> double<00:01:34.259> IHF<00:01:34.740> games<00:01:35.009> but

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
often see that in double IHF games but

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.359 
often see that in double IHF games but
what<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.060> did<00:01:36.329> mean<00:01:36.630> was<00:01:37.200> Riga<00:01:37.619> were<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.159> on

of that five on three power-play and I

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.370 
of that five on three power-play and I
say<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> turning<00:01:44.820> point<00:01:44.850> because<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.899> scored

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
say a turning point because they scored

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.450 
say a turning point because they scored
again<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.159> pathway<00:01:48.439> 2639<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.340> the
