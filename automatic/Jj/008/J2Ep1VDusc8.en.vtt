00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.580 
box I believe a few months later they
launched<00:01:32.640> an<00:01:32.820> LTE<00:01:33.270> model<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.079> it's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
launched an LTE model for this one it's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.649 
launched an LTE model for this one it's
going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> have<00:01:34.950> LTE<00:01:35.659> compatibility

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
going to have LTE compatibility

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.420 
going to have LTE compatibility

straighten out in the box very nice
feature<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.240> also<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.750> will<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.110> hopefully

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
feature and also we will be hopefully

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.289 
feature and also we will be hopefully
team<00:01:40.770> upgrading<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> ram<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> two

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
gigabyte two gigabytes of ram would also

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.499 
gigabyte two gigabytes of ram would also
be<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> very<00:01:46.259> interesting<00:01:46.439> yeah<00:01:47.369> which<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.759> what

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
be a very interesting yeah which is what

microsd<00:02:32.010> once<00:02:33.010> again<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> very<00:02:33.520> nice<00:02:33.700> feature

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
microsd once again a very nice feature

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.880 
microsd once again a very nice feature
to<00:02:34.090> see<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.630> budget<00:02:34.900> handset<00:02:35.230> because<00:02:35.620> blood

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
to see on a budget handset because blood

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.350 
to see on a budget handset because blood
two<00:02:35.980> handsets<00:02:36.250> do<00:02:36.430> not<00:02:36.580> come<00:02:36.820> with<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.120> much

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
two handsets do not come with that much

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.930 
two handsets do not come with that much
built-in<00:02:37.750> storage<00:02:38.020> so<00:02:38.860> expandability<00:02:39.610> is

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
built-in storage so expandability is

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.210 
built-in storage so expandability is
nice<00:02:40.150> yeah<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:41.230> camera<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:41.800> phone<00:02:41.860> could

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
nice yeah the camera on this phone could

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.740 
nice yeah the camera on this phone could
be<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> little<00:02:42.580> bit<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.880> bump<00:02:43.060> off<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.570> could

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
be a little bit of bump off so we could

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.480 
be a little bit of bump off so we could
be<00:02:43.780> seeing<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.170> rear<00:02:44.350> facing<00:02:44.590> being<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.070> 13

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
be seeing the rear facing being a 13

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.070 
be seeing the rear facing being a 13
megapixel<00:02:45.610> camera<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.840> first

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
megapixel camera and the first

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.220 
megapixel camera and the first
front-facing<00:02:47.830> being<00:02:48.280> an<00:02:48.430> 8<00:02:48.640> megapixel<00:02:49.230> huge

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
front-facing being an 8 megapixel huge

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.750 
front-facing being an 8 megapixel huge
improvement<00:02:50.740> from<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.950> last<00:02:51.250> gen<00:02:51.459> which<00:02:51.580> had

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
improvement from the last gen which had

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.670 
improvement from the last gen which had
I<00:02:51.790> believe<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.209> 5<00:02:52.540> megapixel<00:02:52.810> camera<00:02:53.560> on<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
I believe a 5 megapixel camera on the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.949 
I believe a 5 megapixel camera on the
back<00:02:53.740> and<00:02:54.040> get<00:02:54.220> bj<00:02:54.580> up<00:02:54.700> front<00:02:55.000> just<00:02:55.690> don't<00:02:55.810> get

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
back and get bj up front just don't get

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.600 
back and get bj up front just don't get
too<00:02:56.019> excited<00:02:56.260> because<00:02:56.739> it's<00:02:56.980> not<00:02:57.190> going<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.519> be

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
too excited because it's not going to be

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.150 
too excited because it's not going to be
an<00:02:57.700> amazing<00:02:58.000> camera<00:02:58.480> because<00:02:59.050> megapixels<00:03:00.010> not

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
an amazing camera because megapixels not

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.979 
an amazing camera because megapixels not
everything<00:03:00.670> it's<00:03:01.060> probably<00:03:01.330> not<00:03:01.510> going<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.840> be

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
everything it's probably not going to be

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.050 
everything it's probably not going to be
the<00:03:02.140> best<00:03:02.320> in<00:03:02.530> low<00:03:02.709> light<00:03:02.890> situations<00:03:03.550> due<00:03:03.790> to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
the best in low light situations due to
