00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
okay so we went through all the

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.590 
okay so we went through all the
different<00:00:02.070> chords<00:00:02.460> modes<00:00:03.149> here<00:00:03.389> and<00:00:03.510> we

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
different chords modes here and we

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.570 
different chords modes here and we
played<00:00:03.810> us<00:00:03.929> one<00:00:04.290> octave<00:00:04.620> scale<00:00:04.950> over<00:00:05.279> them<00:00:05.430> and

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
played us one octave scale over them and

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.940 
played us one octave scale over them and
the<00:00:05.910> whole<00:00:06.089> point<00:00:06.359> really<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.529> was<00:00:07.799> to

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
the whole point really in this was to

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.310 
the whole point really in this was to
show<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.250> basically<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.690> we're<00:00:09.840> not<00:00:09.990> going

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
show you basically that we're not going

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.410 
show you basically that we're not going
outside<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.070> key<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.280> C<00:00:11.610> major<00:00:11.820> we're<00:00:12.210> just

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
outside of the key of C major we're just

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.660 
outside of the key of C major we're just
starting<00:00:12.840> at<00:00:12.990> different<00:00:13.139> points<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.490> C

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
starting at different points in the C

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.090 
starting at different points in the C
major<00:00:14.880> scale<00:00:15.030> many<00:00:15.929> people<00:00:16.289> get<00:00:16.470> confused<00:00:16.619> by

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
major scale many people get confused by

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.460 
major scale many people get confused by
that<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.609> think<00:00:18.210> you're<00:00:18.600> like<00:00:18.930> changing<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
that and think you're like changing the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.580 
that and think you're like changing the
the<00:00:19.789> notes<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> scale<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.840> they<00:00:22.439> get

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the notes and the scale and they get

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.290 
the notes and the scale and they get
really<00:00:22.830> confused<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.760> know<00:00:23.850> don't<00:00:24.090> let

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
that happen you're basically only in one

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.259 
that happen you're basically only in one
key<00:00:26.250> here<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:26.670> starting<00:00:27.029> at<00:00:27.119> different

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
key here but starting at different

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.679 
key here but starting at different
points<00:00:27.810> okay<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.490> now<00:00:30.090> what<00:00:30.330> we're<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
sound of the modes what we're going to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 
sound of the modes what we're going to
do<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.649> take<00:00:34.860> one<00:00:35.130> bass<00:00:35.850> note<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.540> going

tonality zuv all the different modes so
the<00:01:00.930> first<00:01:01.170> thing<00:01:01.379> we're<00:01:01.559> going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.859> is

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the first thing we're going to do is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.189 
the first thing we're going to do is
want<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> build<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.760> B<00:01:02.910> Ionian<00:01:03.480> now<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:03.989> said

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
want to build a B Ionian now as we said

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.859 
want to build a B Ionian now as we said
before<00:01:04.320> B<00:01:04.799> Ionian<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.150> Ionian<00:01:06.570> mode<00:01:06.600> is

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
before B Ionian the Ionian mode is

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
before B Ionian the Ionian mode is
always<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> major<00:01:07.380> scale<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.100> very<00:01:08.310> simply

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
always a major scale so very simply

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.840 
always a major scale so very simply
we're<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> key<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.840> B<00:01:09.930> major

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
we're going to be in the key of B major

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.580 
we're going to be in the key of B major
so<00:01:11.850> put<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> B<00:01:13.820> note<00:01:14.820> or<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> B<00:01:15.360> major<00:01:15.990> chord<00:01:16.470> on

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
so put a B note or a B major chord on

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.789 
so put a B note or a B major chord on
tape<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.610> play<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.720> B<00:01:18.900> scale<00:01:19.200> over<00:01:19.500> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
tape and then play the B scale over it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.100 
tape and then play the B scale over it
and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.549> improvise<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:21.960> bit

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and then improvise with it a little bit

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
and then improvise with it a little bit
just<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.009> feel<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.460> what<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> sounds

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
just to get the feel for what it sounds

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:55.210 
just to get the feel for what it sounds
like

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.830 

alright<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:56.370> there's<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.610> good<00:01:56.880> example<00:01:57.090> of

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
alright so there's a good example of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.810 
alright so there's a good example of
what<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> Ionian<00:01:58.740> mode<00:01:58.770> sounds<00:01:59.400> like<00:01:59.580> it

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
what the Ionian mode sounds like it

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.030 
what the Ionian mode sounds like it
reminds<00:02:00.150> me<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.510> real<00:02:00.720> happy<00:02:01.170> type<00:02:01.650> of<00:02:01.799> feel

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
reminds me of a real happy type of feel

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.700 
reminds me of a real happy type of feel
okay<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.729> our<00:02:02.940> next<00:02:03.240> mode<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.080> be<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
okay so our next mode is going to be the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
okay so our next mode is going to be the
Dorian<00:02:05.190> mode<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.610> let's<00:02:05.640> build<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.119> Dory<00:02:06.360> B

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
Dorian mode so let's build a Dory B

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.230 
Dorian mode so let's build a Dory B
Dorian<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.830> know<00:02:07.979> two<00:02:08.039> things<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.940> know<00:02:09.060> that

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
Dorian we know two things we know that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.090 
Dorian we know two things we know that
Dorian<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.750> minor<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.350> it's<00:02:10.380> going<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> B

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
Dorian is minor so it's going to be a B

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.229 
Dorian is minor so it's going to be a B
minor<00:02:11.340> chord<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:12.440> we<00:02:13.440> also<00:02:13.590> know<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.280> B<00:02:14.970> that

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
minor chord and we also know that B that

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.390 
minor chord and we also know that B that
Dorian<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> second<00:02:16.560> step<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.160> major

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
Dorian is the second step of a major

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.650 
Dorian is the second step of a major
scale<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:19.319> way<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.500> look<00:02:19.830> at<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.130> is

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
scale so the way I look at this is

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.360 
scale so the way I look at this is
rather<00:02:21.660> than<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.350> know<00:02:22.380> remember<00:02:23.040> all<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
rather than you know remember all the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.370 
rather than you know remember all the
notes<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.790> Dori<00:02:24.030> Dorian<00:02:24.750> scale<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.290> know

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
notes in a Dori Dorian scale you know

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.930 
notes in a Dori Dorian scale you know
the<00:02:25.590> typical<00:02:25.950> way<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.190> taught<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
the typical way it's taught is like the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.330 
the typical way it's taught is like the
Dorian<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> major<00:02:28.080> scale<00:02:28.470> with<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.739> sharp

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
Dorian is a major scale with a sharp

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.430 
Dorian is a major scale with a sharp
this<00:02:29.610> or<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.880> flat<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.750> know<00:02:30.870> who<00:02:31.110> really

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
this or a flat that you know who really

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.590 
this or a flat that you know who really
cares<00:02:31.709> all<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.459> need<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.760> do<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.060> relate<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.570> to

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
cares all you need to do is relate it to

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.479 
cares all you need to do is relate it to
the<00:02:33.780> basic<00:02:34.170> key<00:02:34.350> you're<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.950> since<00:02:35.370> we

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
the basic key you're in and since we

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.970 
the basic key you're in and since we
know<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.910> Dorian<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.080> second<00:02:37.530> step<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.920> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
know that Dorian is the second step of a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.460 
know that Dorian is the second step of a
major<00:02:38.160> scale<00:02:38.630> then<00:02:39.630> obviously<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.260> first

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
major scale then obviously the first

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.490 
major scale then obviously the first
step<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:42.090> very<00:02:42.269> simply<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.080> know<00:02:43.290> you're

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
step is a so very simply you know you're

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.199 
step is a so very simply you know you're
in<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.680> key<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:44.040> major<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.940> you're<00:02:45.060> playing

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
in the key of a major but you're playing

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.300 
in the key of a major but you're playing
over<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.720> second<00:02:46.110> chord<00:02:46.350> B<00:02:46.620> minor<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.160> you're

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
over the second chord B minor and you're

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.130 
over the second chord B minor and you're
starting<00:02:47.670> with<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.820> B<00:02:48.030> note<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.720> put<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.019> B

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
starting with a B note so put the B

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.300 
starting with a B note so put the B
minor<00:02:49.380> chord<00:02:49.500> on<00:02:50.010> tape<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:51.350> play<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.830> B

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
minor chord on tape and play the the B

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.800 
minor chord on tape and play the the B
Dorian<00:02:53.730> scale<00:02:53.850> which<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.180> going<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.450> be<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.780> a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
Dorian scale which is going to be the a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.830 
Dorian scale which is going to be the a
major<00:02:55.140> starting<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.800> B<00:02:56.010> note

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.910 

you

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.150 

you

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:25.690 

you

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.140 

you

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.250 

alright<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.270> there's<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.510> good<00:03:29.630> example<00:03:30.050> of

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
alright so there's a good example of

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.530 
alright so there's a good example of
what<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.470> Dorian<00:03:30.980> mode<00:03:31.160> sounds<00:03:31.610> like<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:32.030> call<00:03:32.420> it

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
what a Dorian mode sounds like I call it

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.510 
what a Dorian mode sounds like I call it
the<00:03:32.660> Western<00:03:33.110> mode<00:03:33.350> because<00:03:33.830> for<00:03:34.280> some<00:03:34.490> reason

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
the Western mode because for some reason

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.910 
the Western mode because for some reason
it<00:03:34.910> reminds<00:03:35.540> me<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.900> cowboy<00:03:36.350> movie<00:03:36.740> or<00:03:36.890> a

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
it reminds me of a cowboy movie or a

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.650 
it reminds me of a cowboy movie or a
western<00:03:37.340> movie<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.610> can<00:03:37.819> almost<00:03:37.970> visualize

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
western movie I can almost visualize

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.809 
western movie I can almost visualize
John<00:03:39.350> Wayne<00:03:39.590> riding<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.160> horse<00:03:40.340> through<00:03:40.730> the

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
John Wayne riding a horse through the

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:41.290 
John Wayne riding a horse through the
desert

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
desert

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.390 
desert
it<00:03:41.660> might<00:03:41.900> not<00:03:42.080> remind<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.709> anything<00:03:43.190> like

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
it might not remind you of anything like

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.820 
it might not remind you of anything like
that<00:03:43.459> but<00:03:44.300> I<00:03:44.540> think<00:03:44.840> it's<00:03:44.959> real<00:03:45.200> important<00:03:45.740> to

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
that but I think it's real important to

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.940 
that but I think it's real important to
get<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.100> visualization<00:03:46.670> of<00:03:47.240> each<00:03:48.170> mode<00:03:48.620> or<00:03:48.830> each

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
get a visualization of each mode or each

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.390 
get a visualization of each mode or each
sound<00:03:49.310> because<00:03:50.030> if<00:03:50.270> you<00:03:50.450> can<00:03:51.250> kind<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.310> be

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
sound because if you can kind of be

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.340 
sound because if you can kind of be
reminded<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.240> different<00:03:53.600> feeling<00:03:53.870> or<00:03:54.320> a

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
reminded of a different feeling or a

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.610 
reminded of a different feeling or a
different<00:03:55.190> even<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.580> song<00:03:55.850> or<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:57.290> know<00:03:57.410> a

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
different even a song or you know a

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.800 
different even a song or you know a
western<00:03:58.100> movie<00:03:58.130> whatever<00:03:58.670> if<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.360> mode<00:03:59.600> can

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
western movie whatever if a mode can

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.970 
western movie whatever if a mode can
remind<00:04:00.050> you<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.350> something<00:04:00.590> then<00:04:00.770> it's<00:04:00.860> going

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
remind you of something then it's going

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.470 
remind you of something then it's going
to<00:04:01.040> be<00:04:01.130> easier<00:04:01.459> for<00:04:01.760> you<00:04:01.850> to<00:04:01.880> remember<00:04:02.360> the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
to be easier for you to remember the

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.850 
to be easier for you to remember the
sound<00:04:02.720> of<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:02.959> mode<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.440> think<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.709> can<00:04:03.830> be

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
sound of that mode and I think it can be

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.979 
sound of that mode and I think it can be
real<00:04:04.340> helpful<00:04:04.640> in<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:04.940> long<00:04:04.970> run<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:05.780> try<00:04:05.959> to

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
real helpful in the long run so try to

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.680 
real helpful in the long run so try to
visualize<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:07.130> sound<00:04:07.459> you<00:04:08.030> know<00:04:08.120> put<00:04:08.330> it<00:04:08.420> into

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
visualize the sound you know put it into

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.729 
visualize the sound you know put it into
some<00:04:08.840> thoughts<00:04:09.080> in<00:04:09.170> your<00:04:09.230> head<00:04:09.350> so<00:04:09.590> you<00:04:09.709> can

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
some thoughts in your head so you can

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.650 
some thoughts in your head so you can
easily<00:04:10.160> remember<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.610> ok<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.330> next<00:04:11.480> thing

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
easily remember it ok so the next thing

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.300 
easily remember it ok so the next thing
we<00:04:11.750> want<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.959> do<00:04:12.080> is<00:04:12.260> build<00:04:12.440> a<00:04:12.620> B<00:04:12.769> Phrygian

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
we want to do is build a B Phrygian

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.860 
we want to do is build a B Phrygian
because<00:04:13.489> Phrygian<00:04:13.970> is<00:04:14.090> next<00:04:14.360> in<00:04:14.480> line

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
because Phrygian is next in line

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.900 
because Phrygian is next in line
we<00:04:15.320> know<00:04:15.440> that<00:04:15.620> Phrygian<00:04:16.190> is<00:04:16.370> typically<00:04:16.850> a

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
we know that Phrygian is typically a

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.180 
we know that Phrygian is typically a
minor<00:04:17.209> chord<00:04:17.540> and<00:04:17.840> it's<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.410> third<00:04:18.650> step<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:19.100> a

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
minor chord and it's the third step of a

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.510 
minor chord and it's the third step of a
major<00:04:19.370> scale<00:04:19.840> so<00:04:20.840> if<00:04:21.200> B<00:04:21.620> is<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.950> third<00:04:22.190> step

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
major scale so if B is the third step

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.650 
major scale so if B is the third step
then<00:04:22.790> obviously<00:04:24.280> our<00:04:25.280> first<00:04:25.700> step<00:04:25.940> must<00:04:26.120> be<00:04:26.270> G

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
then obviously our first step must be G

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.900 
then obviously our first step must be G
so<00:04:27.470> we<00:04:27.590> know<00:04:27.770> we're<00:04:27.919> playing<00:04:28.100> in<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.340> key<00:04:28.550> of<00:04:28.580> G

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
so we know we're playing in the key of G

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.790 
so we know we're playing in the key of G
major<00:04:28.940> it's<00:04:29.900> relative<00:04:30.260> minor<00:04:30.440> would<00:04:30.650> be<00:04:30.770> e

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
major it's relative minor would be e

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.730 
major it's relative minor would be e
minor<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:32.570> we'd<00:04:32.690> be<00:04:32.810> playing<00:04:33.050> in<00:04:33.229> G<00:04:33.380> major<00:04:33.590> E

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
minor so we'd be playing in G major E

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.920 
minor so we'd be playing in G major E
minor<00:04:34.130> but<00:04:34.370> starting<00:04:34.760> with<00:04:34.790> a<00:04:34.910> B<00:04:35.150> note<00:04:35.390> over<00:04:35.630> a

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
minor but starting with a B note over a

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.450 
minor but starting with a B note over a
B<00:04:36.140> chord<00:04:36.440> it's<00:04:36.710> as<00:04:36.860> simple<00:04:36.979> as<00:04:37.190> that

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
B chord it's as simple as that

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.940 
B chord it's as simple as that
so<00:04:37.729> put<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.210> B<00:04:38.360> minor<00:04:38.600> chord<00:04:38.720> on<00:04:39.050> tape<00:04:39.320> play

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
so put the B minor chord on tape play

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.010 
so put the B minor chord on tape play
the<00:04:40.100> scale<00:04:40.430> over<00:04:40.700> it<00:04:40.940> and<00:04:41.120> then<00:04:41.330> improvise<00:04:41.630> to

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
the scale over it and then improvise to

00:04:42.020 --> 00:05:11.300 
the scale over it and then improvise to
get<00:04:42.169> a<00:04:42.200> feel<00:04:42.500> for<00:04:42.800> it

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.190 

alright<00:05:11.790> so<00:05:11.910> there's<00:05:12.090> what<00:05:12.300> phrygian<00:05:12.810> sounds

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
alright so there's what phrygian sounds

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.530 
alright so there's what phrygian sounds
like<00:05:13.350> it's<00:05:13.560> kind<00:05:13.770> of<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:14.060> mysterious<00:05:15.060> eerie

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
like it's kind of a mysterious eerie

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.200 
like it's kind of a mysterious eerie
type<00:05:15.930> of<00:05:16.110> feel<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:16.620> there<00:05:17.520> is<00:05:17.640> an<00:05:17.790> exception

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
type of feel and there is an exception

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.420 
type of feel and there is an exception
on<00:05:18.600> this<00:05:18.660> mode<00:05:19.230> we<00:05:19.860> said<00:05:20.100> that<00:05:20.250> it<00:05:20.340> was

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
on this mode we said that it was

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.370 
on this mode we said that it was
typically<00:05:20.820> a<00:05:20.880> minor<00:05:21.150> chord<00:05:21.510> but<00:05:22.020> one<00:05:22.170> thing<00:05:22.320> I

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
typically a minor chord but one thing I

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.960 
typically a minor chord but one thing I
want<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.620> point<00:05:22.800> out<00:05:23.040> this<00:05:23.280> has<00:05:23.460> done<00:05:23.610> a<00:05:23.670> lot<00:05:23.880> in

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
want to point out this has done a lot in

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.000 
want to point out this has done a lot in
classical<00:05:24.480> music<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:25.020> you<00:05:25.200> can<00:05:25.350> substitute<00:05:25.740> a

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
classical music is you can substitute a

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.430 
classical music is you can substitute a
major<00:05:26.250> chord<00:05:26.610> here<00:05:26.940> so<00:05:27.330> we'd<00:05:27.510> make<00:05:27.690> B<00:05:27.900> minor<00:05:28.140> B

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
major chord here so we'd make B minor B

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.950 
major chord here so we'd make B minor B
major<00:05:28.680> which<00:05:29.430> would<00:05:29.640> mean<00:05:29.880> we<00:05:30.600> would<00:05:30.780> change

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
major which would mean we would change

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.320 
major which would mean we would change
the<00:05:31.110> D<00:05:31.440> note<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:32.820> D<00:05:33.000> sharp<00:05:34.400> make<00:05:35.400> B<00:05:35.610> major<00:05:35.850> so

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
the D note the D sharp make B major so

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.150 
the D note the D sharp make B major so
now<00:05:36.450> go<00:05:36.690> through<00:05:37.050> put<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.560> chord<00:05:37.800> on<00:05:37.920> tape

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
now go through put the chord on tape

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.730 
now go through put the chord on tape
again<00:05:38.520> play<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.450> scale<00:05:39.780> but<00:05:40.350> what<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.650> have

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
again play the scale but what you have

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.340 
again play the scale but what you have
to<00:05:40.830> do<00:05:41.040> is<00:05:41.250> since<00:05:41.460> we<00:05:41.610> made<00:05:41.820> D<00:05:42.120> D<00:05:42.510> sharp<00:05:42.840> we<00:05:43.230> have

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
to do is since we made D D sharp we have

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.230 
to do is since we made D D sharp we have
to<00:05:43.500> change<00:05:43.770> all<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.340> notes<00:05:44.580> in<00:05:44.910> the<00:05:45.120> scale

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
to change all the notes in the scale

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.020 
to change all the notes in the scale
from<00:05:45.630> D<00:05:45.870> to<00:05:45.930> D<00:05:46.140> sharp<00:05:46.560> okay<00:05:47.490> so<00:05:47.550> here's<00:05:47.850> what

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
from D to D sharp okay so here's what

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:56.159 
from D to D sharp okay so here's what
that<00:05:48.060> sounds<00:05:48.570> like

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:02.070 

Hey

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:16.740 

you

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.540 

alright<00:06:17.750> so<00:06:17.930> there's<00:06:18.140> the<00:06:18.860> other<00:06:19.040> way<00:06:19.250> we<00:06:19.400> can

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
alright so there's the other way we can

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.190 
alright so there's the other way we can
use<00:06:19.670> a<00:06:19.700> Phrygian<00:06:20.210> mode<00:06:20.240> again<00:06:20.750> that<00:06:20.930> reminds

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
use a Phrygian mode again that reminds

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.690 
use a Phrygian mode again that reminds
me<00:06:21.290> of<00:06:21.440> something<00:06:21.740> really<00:06:21.920> mysterious<00:06:22.400> and

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
me of something really mysterious and

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.880 
me of something really mysterious and
like<00:06:23.120> a<00:06:23.150> eerie<00:06:23.450> type<00:06:23.750> of<00:06:23.900> feel<00:06:24.140> almost<00:06:24.770> a

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
like a eerie type of feel almost a

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.160 
like a eerie type of feel almost a
little<00:06:25.130> bit<00:06:25.310> Egyptian<00:06:25.970> okay<00:06:26.570> so<00:06:26.630> our<00:06:26.870> next

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
little bit Egyptian okay so our next

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.990 
little bit Egyptian okay so our next
mode<00:06:27.410> and<00:06:27.680> line<00:06:27.950> is<00:06:28.160> Lydian<00:06:28.550> so<00:06:28.760> we're<00:06:28.880> going

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
mode and line is Lydian so we're going

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.810 
mode and line is Lydian so we're going
to<00:06:29.060> build<00:06:29.240> a<00:06:29.360> B<00:06:29.510> Lydian<00:06:29.900> B<00:06:30.830> Lydian<00:06:31.190> Lydian<00:06:31.670> is<00:06:31.790> a

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
to build a B Lydian B Lydian Lydian is a

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.820 
to build a B Lydian B Lydian Lydian is a
major<00:06:32.120> chord<00:06:32.750> so<00:06:32.990> it's<00:06:33.140> going<00:06:33.230> to<00:06:33.320> be<00:06:33.410> B<00:06:33.620> major

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
major chord so it's going to be B major

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.730 
major chord so it's going to be B major
and<00:06:34.360> Lydian<00:06:35.360> is<00:06:35.510> the<00:06:35.660> fourth<00:06:35.990> step<00:06:36.320> from<00:06:36.650> a

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
and Lydian is the fourth step from a

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.400 
and Lydian is the fourth step from a
major<00:06:36.980> scale<00:06:37.370> so<00:06:38.030> very<00:06:38.330> easily<00:06:38.540> we<00:06:38.990> can<00:06:39.020> find

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
major scale so very easily we can find

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.180 
major scale so very easily we can find
out<00:06:39.560> that<00:06:39.740> the<00:06:39.860> first<00:06:40.100> step<00:06:40.970> is<00:06:41.210> f<00:06:41.840> major<00:06:42.830> so<00:06:43.160> we

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
out that the first step is f major so we

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.010 
out that the first step is f major so we
know<00:06:43.430> we're<00:06:43.580> in<00:06:43.670> the<00:06:43.760> key<00:06:43.940> of<00:06:43.970> F<00:06:44.180> major<00:06:44.210> the

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
know we're in the key of F major the

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.410 
know we're in the key of F major the
relative<00:06:45.350> minor<00:06:45.560> would<00:06:45.800> be<00:06:45.980> e<00:06:46.190> flat<00:06:46.580> minor<00:06:46.850> so

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420
