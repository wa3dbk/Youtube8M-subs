00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.689
 still faith strange thing when 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.599
 around assert that all is lost 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.480
 Yes, we ourselves believe that the chances of success 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.750
 almost no anyway come back to 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.360
 stands just get used to someone 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.870
 and now you are in a T-shirt 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.230
 back 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.600
 you know him by skating then sure sure 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.320
 he is your new idol and even put 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.530
 example son and the next match suddenly 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.260
 see him in the opposing team 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.100
 it hurts you and it hurts and it seems 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.039
 betrayal is just life yesterday 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.879
 circumstances and someone else's actions 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.480
 including 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.920
 because you still come back here because 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.979
 that you believe the team 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.970
 every year every new season in front of us 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.820
 new faces but merged all the same to us 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.119
 promise a fight and hope for a cup of us 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.500
 convincing that all this is only for us, but once 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.680
 we always come back maybe it's true 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.759
 it's hard for us to please something we bought wrong 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.789
 and sold there 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.100
 we are rarely happy with the terms 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.880
 guide call on the barricades on 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.570
 forums 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.080
 Of course, the stands are so obvious 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.789
 where to give a pass and how to throw more precisely and 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.729
 can you live these endless 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:46.780
 and you can just come back to the stands 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.979
 just because you feel good here 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.080
 you see friends you give energy 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.900
 get in return 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.360
 emotions and impressions here they are real 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.320
 we each have our own lives and ours 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.920
 interests 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.370
 our character and temperament but when we 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.670
 in the stands when we celebrate victories when 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:15.590
 worried about the loss we are all like 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.130
 one person passionate loyal players 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.490
 go away and come replace replace 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.570
 victories but we are the same 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.260
 and so this is our game and the team too 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.860
 our 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.440
 we go mad with happiness the finale together 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.080
 and fight hysterical without getting into 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.470
 playoff we are ready to believe any 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.310
 promise just to come again 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.910
 tribunes because real atlas is 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.750
 stars on ice not hungry for victories 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.030
 youth and for sure and respectable people 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.320
 high chairs 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.320
 real atlas is us
