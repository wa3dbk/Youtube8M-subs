00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 good on September 16 but 1973 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.779
 hurricane won the metropolitan of that 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.370
 year that wonderful team led 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.450
 by Cesar Luis Menotti that for some 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.740
 it was the best team in the history of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.690
 Argentine soccer for some of being 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.849
 surely among the best for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.800
 people hurricane already argues and says so 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.650
 that stopped being the only championship by 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.170
 this kind of having I do not know if its 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.670
 officialization that is being about 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.410
 the amateur changes but there is a 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.760
 argument that does not say much that if one 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.650
 he thinks he has a certain grip 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.600
 A lot says of those who write to us 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.600
 obviously to planet goal.com as well as 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.600
 world 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:47.910
 the championships now rafa last name of 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.469
 racing hurricane mouth of central and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.760
 So many clubs seems to be asking 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.649
 official those championships for a 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.770
 cançó I do not know but we were left 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.660
 I remember that 73 where it seems that 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.160
 started that team led by that 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.199
 40 years ago the question is that hurricane 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.629
 besides thinking about winning the match 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.460
 I thought about how to win the game and in 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.930
 this generate a show that today is 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.270
 hard to see good girl 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.270
 some images of hurricane 73 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.560
 now he was making a goal against 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 racing defining with a double hitch 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.329
 of that team that showed something 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.759
 absolutely different from those that 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.920
 they saw say that he plays something else at 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.750
 million record of nabai to césar menotti 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.240
 of coaches come and this what 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.399
 catapulted in time after close to 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.469
 coach of the Argentine team in 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.299
 on 78 this moment we go over nations 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.030
 of the hurricane base team pretty much 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.490
 borrogán that threw googles basile drones 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.640
 Carrascosa toast and fatigue russo 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.599
 babington hauserman aballay and the rose the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.729
 rosa was the scorer of this team 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.069
 when one says good it will have been go and 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.479
 hug toast and kaka defines against 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.880
 river will have been babington a horacio 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.140
 house or was not the rosette is what they go 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.640
 also marking so that the great team 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.649
 quemero that broke it so that which the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.110
 first in the first round of that 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.750
 hurricane was super native that later on in 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.040
 the second round with the call for 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.380
 some players to the selection are 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.050
 It suffers a bit from the team and dreams but 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.640
 very good eliminator the 74 showed a 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.130
 good defensive facet and that's why 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.130
 ended up with a championship of 32 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.540
 wins 8 draws five losses 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.340
 tremendous to play Miguel with his head in 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.560
 this basil coconut case this is based 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.750
 from another long run marking by 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.510
 down below also here the team 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.430
 which also had stuck for example with 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.710
 the free throws with brindisi with 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.960
 babington with the rose that was the one 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.260
 gave the finals on the team because 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.600
 this is a goal against san lorenzo in 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.810
 court looking for this the pink look to see 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.250
 the participatory environment in the medium does not 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.010
 he thinks it's a girl that they threw 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.500
 Sawdust sawdust that was pulled when 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.510
 the court was muddy 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.740
 in this case we are talking about starting 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.940
 a park of the patricians with babington 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.770
 I think that marking the scope of the title 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.800
 carlos that the legacy of this team is 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.780
 the way in which totally the day that 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.940
 he leaves champion in front of the silver how well 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.530
 that he played what the forms looked after 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.460
 of the result think the result 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.370
 obviously everyone does it but also 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.840
 I adhered I put the additive of a game 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.430
 dapper a game that made it attractive and 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.490
 that not only the hurricane events 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.990
 it generated desire to go see the 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.100
 neutrals also told him the team of 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.080
 the three that win and like to beat 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.430
 think that was the premise I had 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.950
 to choose to known carrascosa 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.050
 that team led by Cesar Luis 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.180
 Menotti or many 40 years old 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.220
 fans asked us for this reminder 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.150
 well we have the possibility to show that 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.980
 some of the things 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.780
 what did he do inside the court 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.519
 wonderful team maybe we would have 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.319
 liked having much more but difficult 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.269
 get images of that team you 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.760
 We bring the festivities in the park of the 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:11.079
 patricians on September 16 just 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.459
 of 1973 with the return with effects 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:17.009
 shares with ringo bonavena on court 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:19.180
 one of the most famous is human 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.600
 these film images inside the 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.910
 court 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.530
 surely historical remembering was very 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.330
 near this instant also in some 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.699
 moment surely 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.400
 so good the emotion for the people 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.990
 hurricane 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.139
 it comes from having two consecutive defeats 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.320
 in the national tournament we saw another 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.090
 history very different from a past very 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.340
 very different in terms of 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:49.810
 consecration and football respect 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.810
 who won that stage of a toast 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.360
 fatigue russo good many of the great 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.360
 names of that team
