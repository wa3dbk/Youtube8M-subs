very<00:00:30.119> short<00:00:30.419> tutorial<00:00:31.820> so<00:00:32.820> let's<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.570> started

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
very short tutorial so let's get started

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.800 
very short tutorial so let's get started
I<00:00:34.230> created<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.950> test<00:00:35.190> windows<00:00:35.880> based<00:00:36.239> project

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
I created a test windows based project

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.150 
I created a test windows based project
here<00:00:36.960> however<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.470> will<00:00:37.530> work<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.950> whatever

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
here however it will work on whatever

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.300 
here however it will work on whatever
project<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.880> make<00:00:39.060> so<00:00:39.930> normally<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:41.130> in

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
project you make so normally like in

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.670 
project you make so normally like in
xcode<00:00:41.670> 3<00:00:41.970> you'd<00:00:42.149> go<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.420> your<00:00:42.570> frameworks<00:00:43.140> you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
xcode 3 you'd go to your frameworks you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.340 
xcode 3 you'd go to your frameworks you
go<00:00:43.920> showing<00:00:44.250> finder<00:00:44.880> you<00:00:45.059> click<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.809> you'll

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
go showing finder you click it you'll

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.980 
go showing finder you click it you'll
come<00:00:46.560> up<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:46.800> Finder<00:00:47.310> window<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.990> then

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
come up with your Finder window and then

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.870 
come up with your Finder window and then
you'd<00:00:49.320> be<00:00:49.590> able<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.830> drag<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.340> drop<00:00:50.400> your

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
you'd be able to drag and drop your

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.780 
you'd be able to drag and drop your
binary<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.570> now<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.860> doesn't<00:00:53.160> want<00:00:53.370> logo

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
binary in now it doesn't want logo

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.510 
binary in now it doesn't want logo
anymore<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.470> it's<00:00:55.740> here<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.310> if

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
anymore as you can see it's here but if

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.770 
anymore as you can see it's here but if
I<00:00:56.700> try<00:00:56.880> and<00:00:56.970> drag<00:00:57.060> and<00:00:57.210> drop<00:00:57.240> it<00:00:57.450> in<00:00:57.540> it<00:00:57.660> won't

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
I try and drag and drop it in it won't

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.270 
I try and drag and drop it in it won't
work<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.580> to<00:00:59.580> do<00:00:59.700> it<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.990> console<00:01:00.990> oops<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.220> to

I'm gonna go across to here to build
phases<00:01:17.840> you'll<00:01:18.840> see<00:01:19.109> a<00:01:19.319> couple<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.859> drop-down

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
phases you'll see a couple of drop-down

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.789 
phases you'll see a couple of drop-down
menus<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.749> interested<00:01:22.289> in<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> link

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
menus here we're interested in the link

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.279

one click the plus button and now you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.580 
one click the plus button and now you
have<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:37.889> your<00:01:38.189> frameworks<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.630> as<00:01:40.170> simple<00:01:40.530> as

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
have all your frameworks so as simple as

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.270 
have all your frameworks so as simple as
that<00:01:40.619> if<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.789> any<00:01:42.499> external<00:01:43.499> frameworks

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that if you have any external frameworks

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.399 
that if you have any external frameworks
you<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.329> select<00:01:45.509> add<00:01:45.810> other<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:48.020> now<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.079> can

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
you can select add other and now you can

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.550 
you can select add other and now you can
actually<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.880> find<00:01:51.479> your<00:01:51.810> external<00:01:52.229> frame

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
actually go and find your external frame

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.169 
actually go and find your external frame
of<00:01:52.709> DM<00:01:52.889> I<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.130> downloaded<00:01:53.549> from<00:01:53.819> somewhere

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
of DM I have downloaded from somewhere

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.199 
of DM I have downloaded from somewhere
else<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.840> go<00:01:55.499> and<00:01:55.799> find<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.459> by<00:01:56.819> you<00:01:56.880> know

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
else just you go and find it by you know

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.749 
else just you go and find it by you know
selecting<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.679> that's<00:01:59.279> another<00:01:59.520> way<00:01:59.700> you

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
selecting it so that's another way you

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.019 
selecting it so that's another way you
can<00:01:59.969> add<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> framework<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:01.700> now<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.759> new

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:03.029 
can add a framework that's now the new

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:04.550 
can add a framework that's now the new
way<00:02:03.179> of<00:02:03.299> adding<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.810> let<00:02:03.990> me<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.229> for

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
way of adding it so let me just for

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.740 
way of adding it so let me just for
example<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:05.569> message<00:02:07.069> message<00:02:08.069> UI<00:02:08.750> framework
