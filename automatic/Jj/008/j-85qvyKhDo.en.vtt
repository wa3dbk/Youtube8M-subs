00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.439 
very quick video on the cube 2014 and
basically<00:00:28.740> how<00:00:28.949> its<00:00:29.160> how<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:29.820> done<00:00:29.970> over<00:00:30.359> the

were<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.230> stock<00:00:58.230> tires<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.010> lasted<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.550> think

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
were the stock tires that lasted I think

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.360 
were the stock tires that lasted I think
only<00:01:00.090> two<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.449> three<00:01:00.480> commutes<00:01:01.050> before<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.829> had

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
only two or three commutes before I had

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.880 
only two or three commutes before I had
puncher<00:01:03.120> after<00:01:03.690> puncture<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> thought<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
puncher after puncture so I thought I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010 
puncher after puncture so I thought I
want<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.369> bite<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> bullet<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.659> some

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
want to bite the bullet and get some

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.820 
want to bite the bullet and get some

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and they've served me really well on the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.840 
and they've served me really well on the
bike<00:01:13.860> since<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:15.180> terms<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.810> pedals<00:01:16.619> I've<00:01:17.610> got

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
bike since in terms of pedals I've got

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.080 
bike since in terms of pedals I've got
the<00:01:17.970> Shimano<00:01:18.680> 540<00:01:21.770> mountain<00:01:22.770> bike<00:01:22.979> pedals<00:01:23.850> on

the Shimano 540 mountain bike pedals on
the<00:01:24.119> bike<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.860> because<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.159> quite<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the bike and because I do have quite a

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.910 
the bike and because I do have quite a
bit<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.640> walking<00:01:26.869> after<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> commute<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
bit of walking after the commute on the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.520 
bit of walking after the commute on the
way<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> work<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.850> got<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.990> got<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> mountain

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
way to work I got I got the mountain

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.410 
way to work I got I got the mountain
bike<00:01:31.680> shoes<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.700> mountain<00:01:32.939> bike<00:01:32.970> pedals

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
bike shoes and the mountain bike pedals

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420 
bike shoes and the mountain bike pedals
and<00:01:33.689> these<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.259> lasted<00:01:34.680> really<00:01:34.920> well<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and these have lasted really well and I

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.850 
and these have lasted really well and I
tend<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> clip<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.110> out<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> right

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
tend to clip in and out of the right

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.569 
tend to clip in and out of the right
pedal<00:01:38.250> first<00:01:38.780> which<00:01:39.780> seems<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.579> meant

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
pedal first which seems to have meant

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.819 
pedal first which seems to have meant
that<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.450> has<00:01:42.780> loosened<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.439> quite<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that that one has loosened up quite a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.280 
that that one has loosened up quite a
bit<00:01:44.130> compared<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> other<00:01:45.000> pedal<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.020> I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
bit compared to the other pedal so I

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.960 
bit compared to the other pedal so I
haven't<00:01:46.770> adjusted<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.280> yet<00:01:47.490> because<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.759> quite

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
haven't adjusted it yet because I quite

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.359 
haven't adjusted it yet because I quite
like<00:01:48.210> having<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.840> quite<00:01:49.560> easy<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
like having it quite easy to get in and

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.550 
like having it quite easy to get in and
out<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.810> yeah<00:01:52.439> that's

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
out of but I think that yeah that's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.820 
out of but I think that yeah that's
definitely<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.310> need<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.520> adjustment

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
definitely in need of adjustment

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.160 
definitely in need of adjustment
since<00:01:55.830> I<00:01:55.950> put<00:01:56.160> it<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.400> now<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.270> terms<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.870> brakes

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
since I put it on now in terms of brakes

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.840 
since I put it on now in terms of brakes
I've<00:01:58.830> got<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.340> Shimano<00:02:00.210> 105<00:02:01.070> brake<00:02:02.070> setup<00:02:02.550> on

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
I've got the Shimano 105 brake setup on

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.350 
I've got the Shimano 105 brake setup on
this<00:02:03.479> bike<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.080> that<00:02:04.110> hasn't<00:02:04.770> needed<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:06.180> be

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
this bike and that hasn't needed to be

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.590 
this bike and that hasn't needed to be
tweaked<00:02:06.810> at<00:02:07.080> all<00:02:07.399> apart<00:02:08.399> from<00:02:08.460> maybe<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.450> or

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
tweaked at all apart from maybe one or

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.949 
tweaked at all apart from maybe one or
two<00:02:09.630> turns<00:02:11.000> down<00:02:12.000> at<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.240> adjustment<00:02:12.750> lever

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
two turns down at the adjustment lever

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.140 
two turns down at the adjustment lever
on<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.380> brake<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.400> sort<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.670> tighten<00:02:15.030> it

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
on the brake just to sort of tighten it

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.540 
on the brake just to sort of tighten it
up<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.420> little<00:02:15.510> bit<00:02:15.720> from<00:02:16.020> when<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.040> first<00:02:17.280> got

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
up a little bit from when I first got

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.730 
up a little bit from when I first got
the<00:02:17.700> bottom<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.209> next<00:02:18.420> thing<00:02:18.810> as<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.290> can<00:02:19.320> see

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
the bottom the next thing as you can see

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.320 
the bottom the next thing as you can see
there<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.730> will<00:02:21.470> sort<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.530> need<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:23.090> change<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
there I will sort of need to change the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.420 
there I will sort of need to change the
bar<00:02:24.540> tape<00:02:24.870> position<00:02:25.410> get<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.740> in<00:02:25.860> focus<00:02:26.100> for

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
bar tape position get that in focus for

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.070 
bar tape position get that in focus for
you<00:02:26.550> there<00:02:26.760> it's<00:02:27.209> just<00:02:27.420> starting<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.780> wear

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
you there it's just starting to wear

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.620 
you there it's just starting to wear
through<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.920> top<00:02:29.160> layer<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.790> bar<00:02:30.360> tape

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
through the top layer of the bar tape

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.180 
through the top layer of the bar tape
underneath<00:02:31.050> there<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> sort<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.890> another<00:02:32.130> a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
underneath there is a sort of another a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.220 
underneath there is a sort of another a
plastic<00:02:32.640> layer<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> shouldn't<00:02:33.300> be<00:02:33.450> too

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
plastic layer so I shouldn't be too

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.750 
plastic layer so I shouldn't be too
uptight<00:02:34.620> about<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.130> but<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> probably<00:02:35.550> will

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
uptight about it but I probably will

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.160 
uptight about it but I probably will
change<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.570> just<00:02:36.690> because<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.900> don't<00:02:36.989> really

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
change it just because I don't really

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.710 
change it just because I don't really
like<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.560> Wyss<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:39.000> I'll<00:02:39.120> probably<00:02:39.239> sort<00:02:39.660> of

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
like the Wyss so I'll probably sort of

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.380 
like the Wyss so I'll probably sort of
put<00:02:39.930> put<00:02:40.260> black<00:02:40.500> bar<00:02:40.739> tape<00:02:41.040> on<00:02:41.220> there<00:02:41.430> as<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.209> bit

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.280 
put put black bar tape on there as a bit
