00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.740
 I present to you the bicycle and that 700 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.600
 in the back you can see its packaging 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.349
 This bicycle 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.389
 then issue of belt transmission by ibope magnetic brake system 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.389
 stainless steel in all moving parts 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:19.509
 prostatic ante 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.509
 how am I doing here 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.859
 detention system 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.109
 just emergency 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.710
 pipe hexagonal pipes to smoke 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.710
 it allowed us that the machine does not have any 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.990
 flywheel of inertia 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.940
 pushers 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.940
 in fact more 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.320
 now that it never breaks 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.900
 I have believed a neodymium magnet 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.750
 what is this here what is 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.070
 the one that is in charge of the braking is going to serve us for nothing to teach you 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.360
 something that is very obvious 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.700
 like these days 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.000
 the magnet and is not stalked by stainless steel if you 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 but yes me 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.810
 in 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.100
 flywheel 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.150
 consists 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.510
 nor three elements brake system that uses 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.640
 opinion you are not seeing if they are filed 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.480
 that go from the inside 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.610
 the prosecutor the aluminum the stop the brake 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.850
 i for good 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.560
 we use 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.560
 the inner palm that is iron 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.630
 mind 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.770
 in previous occasions 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.540
 we have made specified 3 in the key points that are 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.480
 the efe criminal experts 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.250
 as well as 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.360
 we used 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.860
 a perales berkman especially alderman the marquises the market 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.240
 that they can have an incredible talent that they suppose 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.880
 All these parts are made of steel 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.930
 reinforced 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.930
 hynix most important leaders the liege 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:10.999
 mccarthy 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.399
 I want it to be seen here 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.799
 this is not a market standard 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.929
 a cubanito 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.409
 specified that the automobile industry 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.739
 if I do not know if you can appreciate lg 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.479
 lg sun is a much more pancho axis than any other type of bicycle 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.049
 gaspin in traditional 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.049
 and it's the whole system 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.999
 his magnets and he teaches 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.799
 weight that has 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.799
 pinion visa and also the collapse 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.059
 I was here 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:51.589
 Luis the pinion and the island public mail 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:53.940
 starting this Atlantic strip 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.209
 which is the soul that is called 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.560
 that vilar that very resistant material with which the vests are made 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.369
 bulletproof 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.939
 the pension system if you had to think them very easy since removing 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.349
 this principle here 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.319
 it would give us direct access 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.879
 antonio that serve as adjustment 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.469
 the steering wheel 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.939
 access is very easy 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.499
 lizárraga 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.139
 has wheels for transport 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.759
 another detail that I would highlight 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.989
 6 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.450
 all of a sudden that in the montage extremely you ride the legs the pedals in 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.539
 certain hobbies 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:34.699
 another detail is that 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:39.500
 It is painted with corrosion production and with epoxy plastic paint 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.459
 of the details of the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.219
 maximum precision 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.159
 and perfectly made 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.659
 i such as the hardware 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.899
 Mérida - the plane I felt 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:53.299
 for example 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.299
 stupak 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.119
 but it does not work 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:00.659
 how am I doing around here 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.119
 way he sweat nolan 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:09.579
 this is the new demands on bicycle that 700 osasuna fast comparative 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.069
 a traditional bicycle dismiss 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.389
 traditional p 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.059
 we started with bad 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:18.139
 we no longer use beloved stainless 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.039
 the drawback that they are published 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.259
 the caterpillars these bicycles 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:25.599
 they usually have 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.599
 clearances that make your pedaling not so comfortable 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.509
 transmission systems 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.509
 once on top of the bicycle 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.969
 the smallest knobs 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:49.969
 the anchors round the hands slips 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.180
 I will quickly put 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.180
 How it feels 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:59.919
 small 700 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.919
 automatic hospitals 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:13.499
 what you want 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.499
 deputation 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.879
 I stand up 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.289
 the people very well 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:33.829
 the
