00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
with the next film then it was a little

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.450 
with the next film then it was a little
bit<00:01:00.989> better<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.160> bit<00:01:02.280> better

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
bit better and then a little bit better

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.979 
bit better and then a little bit better
and<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> very<00:01:03.180> gradual<00:01:03.960> process

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and it just was a very gradual process

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.710 
and it just was a very gradual process
so<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:05.610> everybody<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.119> one<00:01:06.299> moment

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
so there then everybody was one moment

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.000 
so there then everybody was one moment
where<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.960> was<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> sudden<00:01:07.890> I'm

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
where it was like all of a sudden I'm

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.830 
where it was like all of a sudden I'm
here<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.400> I'm<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.299> know<00:01:09.360> it's

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
here and I'm here you know it's

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539 
here and I'm here you know it's
interesting<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.320> said<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> gradual

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
interesting you said that but a gradual

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.910 
interesting you said that but a gradual
process<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:11.970> perhaps<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.689> may<00:01:12.900> makes<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.619> seem

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
process and perhaps it may makes it seem

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.410 
process and perhaps it may makes it seem
so<00:01:14.159> much<00:01:14.310> better<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:14.729> because<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
so much better now because it was that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.690 
so much better now because it was that
way<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.680> was<00:01:16.890> more<00:01:17.100> creditable<00:01:17.430> because

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
way but it was more creditable because

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.880 
way but it was more creditable because
you<00:01:17.939> were<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> complete<00:01:18.270> outsider<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.439> started

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you were a complete outsider you started

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.499 
you were a complete outsider you started
with<00:01:20.040> modeling<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.759> literally<00:01:21.090> came<00:01:21.360> into

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
with modeling you literally came into

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.929 
with modeling you literally came into
Bollywood<00:01:21.960> films<00:01:22.380> out<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.159> blue<00:01:23.369> how

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
Bollywood films out of the blue how

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.520 
Bollywood films out of the blue how
difficult<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.509> those<00:01:24.659> initial<00:01:24.990> days<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
difficult was those initial days for you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.140 
difficult was those initial days for you
see<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.909> done<00:01:27.090> my<00:01:27.240> fair<00:01:27.270> share<00:01:27.509> of

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
see I have done my fair share of

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.340 
see I have done my fair share of
groundwork<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.360> would<00:01:30.509> call<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> really

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
groundwork I would call it but I really

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.450 
groundwork I would call it but I really
did<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.619> more<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> modelling<00:01:32.340> industry

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
did that more in the modelling industry

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.480 
did that more in the modelling industry
