these<00:00:44.730> big<00:00:45.090> ROK's

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
these big ROK's

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.529 
these big ROK's
because<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.079> easier<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.539> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
because it's just easier to see and I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.959 
because it's just easier to see and I
also<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.469> don't<00:00:53.129> cut<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> rope<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.170> can

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
also I don't cut the rope so I can

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.660 
also I don't cut the rope so I can
unbraid<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.360> show<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> new<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
unbraid it and show you a new one so the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
unbraid it and show you a new one so the
way<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.329> wreath<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.930> know<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.590> not

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
way the wreath you know it's not

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.380 
way the wreath you know it's not
necessary<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.460> cut<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.609> rope<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.090> you're

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
necessary to cut the rope because you're

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.840 
necessary to cut the rope because you're
using<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.780> full<00:01:04.049> loop<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> did<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.700> like

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
using a full loop so all I did was like

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.359 
using a full loop so all I did was like
I<00:01:06.119> tied<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> knot<00:01:06.869> kind<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> middle<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
I tied a knot kind of in the middle of

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.690 
I tied a knot kind of in the middle of
the<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.820> rope<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:10.470> I'm<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.010> gonna<00:01:11.130> use<00:01:11.400> half

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the the rope and I'm just gonna use half

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.929 
the the rope and I'm just gonna use half
of<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.340> got<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> knot<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.420> course

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
of it and I got a knot in it of course

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.740 
of it and I got a knot in it of course
tie<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.000> knot<00:01:18.799> okay<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.490> how<00:01:20.700> I'm<00:01:20.850> gonna<00:01:20.970> set

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
tie this knot okay so how I'm gonna set

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.340 
tie this knot okay so how I'm gonna set
it<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:23.479> is<00:01:24.479> I'm<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.750> gonna<00:01:25.049> hook<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.950> over

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
it up is I'm just gonna hook it over

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
it up is I'm just gonna hook it over
this<00:01:28.790> okay

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
this okay

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
this okay
you<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.829> did<00:01:32.189> over<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.869> now<00:01:33.869> I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you see I just just did over that now I

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.300 
you see I just just did over that now I
have<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> make<00:01:35.930> five<00:01:36.930> loops<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.979> this

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
have to make five loops this is a this

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.480 
have to make five loops this is a this
is<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> 10<00:01:38.909> string<00:01:39.390> braid<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.650> need<00:01:40.860> 5<00:01:41.130> loops

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
is a 10 string braid so I need 5 loops

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.520 
is a 10 string braid so I need 5 loops
so<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.329> gonna<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.409> gonna

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
so what I'm gonna do is just just gonna

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.039 
so what I'm gonna do is just just gonna
hold<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.100> rope<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:44.430> hand<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.240> I'm

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
hold the rope in my hand here and I'm

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.880 
hold the rope in my hand here and I'm
gonna<00:01:46.170> wrap<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.310> around<00:01:48.409> until<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.560> five

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
gonna wrap it around until I get five

00:01:49.890 --> 00:02:00.149 
gonna wrap it around until I get five
loops

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.950 

okay<00:02:01.950> so

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
okay so

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.330 
okay so
this<00:02:04.620> is<00:02:04.970> another<00:02:05.970> advantage<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.930> not<00:02:07.800> cutting

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
this is another advantage to not cutting

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.290 
this is another advantage to not cutting
the<00:02:08.840> loops<00:02:10.039> but<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.280> keeping<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.760> continuous

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
the loops but just keeping a continuous

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.020 
the loops but just keeping a continuous
string<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.950> can<00:02:14.100> adjust<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.610> like<00:02:14.790> that

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
string is you can adjust it like that

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.290 
string is you can adjust it like that
and<00:02:15.660> get<00:02:15.870> them<00:02:16.020> all<00:02:16.200> perfectly<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:18.000> same

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
and get them all perfectly the same

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.990 
and get them all perfectly the same
length<00:02:18.710> being<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.950> same<00:02:20.190> length<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.640> really

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
length being the same length is really

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.030 
length being the same length is really
important<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:21.930> really<00:02:22.020> hard<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.740> do<00:02:22.860> this

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
important it's really hard to do this

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.530 
important it's really hard to do this
when<00:02:23.280> they're<00:02:23.400> when<00:02:23.910> they're<00:02:23.940> not<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.330> same

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
when they're when they're not the same

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.930 
when they're when they're not the same
length<00:02:25.430> okay<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> really<00:02:28.110> easy<00:02:28.140> braid

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
length okay this is a really easy braid

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.550 
length okay this is a really easy braid
but<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.120> gorgeous<00:02:32.240> if<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.330> do<00:02:33.480> say<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.020> myself

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
but it's gorgeous if I do say so myself

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.620 
but it's gorgeous if I do say so myself
of<00:02:35.190> course<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.459> didn't<00:02:35.700> invent<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.360> was<00:02:36.480> in

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
of course I didn't invent it it was in

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.479 
of course I didn't invent it it was in
Bentley<00:02:36.930> probably<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.440> 14th<00:02:37.920> century<00:02:38.459> or

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
Bentley probably in the 14th century or

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:47.030 
Bentley probably in the 14th century or
maybe<00:02:39.420> earlier<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.790> put<00:02:45.620> three<00:02:46.620> ropes<00:02:46.830> on

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
maybe earlier so you put three ropes on

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.540 
maybe earlier so you put three ropes on
one<00:02:47.220> hand<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:48.380> two<00:02:49.380> on<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.560> other<00:02:49.680> whoops

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
one hand and two on the other whoops

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.040 
one hand and two on the other whoops
come<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.690> these<00:02:51.840> fingers<00:02:52.050> okay<00:02:53.060> now<00:02:54.060> there's<00:02:54.989> a

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
come on these fingers okay now there's a

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.630 
come on these fingers okay now there's a
couple<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.500> different<00:02:55.830> passes<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.310> guess<00:02:56.489> I'll

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
couple of different passes I guess I'll

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.750 
couple of different passes I guess I'll
show<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.030> different<00:02:57.300> passes<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:58.800> you

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
show you the different passes you you

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.160 
show you the different passes you you
could<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.209> pass<00:03:00.720> straight<00:03:01.110> across<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:02.370> know

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
could just pass straight across you know

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.430 
could just pass straight across you know
and<00:03:04.170> there's<00:03:04.620> not<00:03:04.770> many<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.070> those<00:03:06.440> most

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
and there's not many of those most

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.710 
and there's not many of those most
commonly<00:03:07.739> you're<00:03:08.549> gonna<00:03:08.700> you're<00:03:09.060> gonna<00:03:09.150> grab

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
commonly you're gonna you're gonna grab

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.600 
commonly you're gonna you're gonna grab
another<00:03:10.380> rope<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:12.030> let's<00:03:12.690> see<00:03:13.370> can't<00:03:14.370> get<00:03:14.519> in

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
another rope so let's see can't get in

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.060 
another rope so let's see can't get in
the<00:03:14.670> angle<00:03:15.000> on<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.540> tough<00:03:15.780> okay<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:16.590> I'm

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
the angle on this is tough okay so I'm

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.930 
the angle on this is tough okay so I'm
gonna<00:03:17.310> grab<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.959> rope<00:03:19.260> here<00:03:19.700> with<00:03:20.700> this

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
gonna grab this rope here with this

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.729 
gonna grab this rope here with this
finger<00:03:21.209> see<00:03:21.930> I'm<00:03:22.019> going<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.200> transfer<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.680> over

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
finger see I'm going to transfer it over

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.350 
finger see I'm going to transfer it over
here<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:24.150> okay<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:26.989> was<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> straight

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
here so okay that was a straight

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.020 
here so okay that was a straight
exchange<00:03:31.459> there's<00:03:32.459> another<00:03:32.700> way<00:03:32.910> of

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
exchange there's another way of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.470 
exchange there's another way of
exchanging<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.870> that's<00:03:34.350> called<00:03:34.620> reversed

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
exchanging it and that's called reversed

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.590 
exchanging it and that's called reversed
in<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.540> reversed<00:03:37.100> I'm<00:03:38.100> gonna<00:03:38.340> draw<00:03:38.610> I'm<00:03:39.239> gonna

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
in the reversed I'm gonna draw I'm gonna

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.590 
in the reversed I'm gonna draw I'm gonna
grab<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.019> bottom<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.799> string<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.600> take

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
grab the bottom of the string and take

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.979 
grab the bottom of the string and take
it<00:03:42.720> over<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:44.370> straight<00:03:44.670> cross<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.690> grab

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
it over in the straight cross you grab

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.100 
it over in the straight cross you grab
the<00:03:46.739> top<00:03:47.340> string<00:03:48.380> okay<00:03:49.610> you<00:03:50.610> got<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.840> now<00:03:51.840> a

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
the top string okay you got that now a

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.479 
the top string okay you got that now a
lot<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:54.030> braids<00:03:54.560> involve<00:03:55.560> reaching

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
lot of the the braids involve reaching

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.590 
lot of the the braids involve reaching
through<00:03:57.380> one<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.590> loops<00:03:59.510> grabbing<00:04:00.510> a

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
through one of the loops grabbing a

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.360 
through one of the loops grabbing a
braid<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:02.870> okay<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:04.140> was<00:04:04.260> bad

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
braid and okay that was bad

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.130 
braid and okay that was bad
and<00:04:05.910> paying<00:04:06.180> attention<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.720> camera<00:04:06.930> and

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
and paying attention to the camera and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.630 
and paying attention to the camera and
celebrate<00:04:07.590> okay<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:09.060> in<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.140> one<00:04:10.640> you're

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
celebrate okay so in this one you're

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.830 
celebrate okay so in this one you're
gonna<00:04:11.760> reach<00:04:12.150> through<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.989> loop<00:04:13.400> see<00:04:14.840> it's

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
gonna reach through this loop see it's

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.420 
gonna reach through this loop see it's
the<00:04:16.109> loop<00:04:16.290> on<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.560> middle<00:04:16.799> finger<00:04:16.949> here<00:04:17.280> I'm

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
the loop on the middle finger here I'm

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.420 
the loop on the middle finger here I'm
gonna<00:04:17.609> reach<00:04:17.910> through<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.329> with<00:04:18.449> my<00:04:18.630> Pinker<00:04:19.109> I

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
gonna reach through it with my Pinker I

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.890 
gonna reach through it with my Pinker I
mean<00:04:20.430> my<00:04:20.579> pointy<00:04:21.030> corner

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
mean my pointy corner

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.710 
mean my pointy corner
you<00:04:22.019> might<00:04:22.199> thumb<00:04:22.560> my<00:04:22.830> index<00:04:23.160> finger<00:04:23.430> my<00:04:23.580> thumb

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
you might thumb my index finger my thumb

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.640 
you might thumb my index finger my thumb
I'm<00:04:24.720> gonna<00:04:24.930> grab<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:26.820> bottom<00:04:27.210> rope<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:28.410> third

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
I'm gonna grab the bottom rope the third

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.340 
I'm gonna grab the bottom rope the third
rope<00:04:28.949> on<00:04:29.160> this<00:04:29.370> hand<00:04:29.699> I'm<00:04:30.419> gonna<00:04:30.570> grab<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:30.870> on

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
rope on this hand I'm gonna grab it on

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.080 
rope on this hand I'm gonna grab it on
the<00:04:31.410> bottom<00:04:32.340> it's<00:04:32.490> called<00:04:32.729> a<00:04:32.790> reverse

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
the bottom it's called a reverse

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.439 
the bottom it's called a reverse
exchange<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:34.380> pull<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:34.889> through<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:36.150> ends

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
exchange you pull it through and it ends

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.950 
exchange you pull it through and it ends
up<00:04:36.510> on<00:04:36.690> my<00:04:36.840> index<00:04:37.169> finger<00:04:37.530> okay<00:04:38.630> now<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.720> next

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
up on my index finger okay now the next

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.930 
up on my index finger okay now the next
step<00:04:40.440> is<00:04:40.650> I'm<00:04:41.010> going<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.220> take<00:04:41.400> these<00:04:41.639> two

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
step is I'm going to take these two

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.480 
step is I'm going to take these two
loops<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.229> I'm<00:04:43.770> gonna<00:04:43.919> do<00:04:44.130> what's<00:04:44.310> called

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
loops and I'm gonna do what's called

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.520 
loops and I'm gonna do what's called
walk<00:04:44.850> them<00:04:45.150> down<00:04:47.090> okay<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.540> basically<00:04:49.440> just

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
walk them down okay I basically just

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.870 
walk them down okay I basically just
moved<00:04:49.979> them<00:04:50.190> down<00:04:50.220> with<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.639> lot<00:04:50.729> of<00:04:50.790> our

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
moved them down with a lot of our

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.940 
moved them down with a lot of our
fingers<00:04:51.240> this<00:04:51.780> is<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.080> same<00:04:52.320> setup<00:04:52.560> I<00:04:52.770> had

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
fingers this is the same setup I had

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.730 
fingers this is the same setup I had
before<00:04:53.130> it's<00:04:54.060> just<00:04:54.240> on<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.479> other<00:04:54.630> hand<00:04:54.900> so

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
before it's just on the other hand so

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.279 
before it's just on the other hand so
I'm<00:04:56.160> going<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.400> take<00:04:56.580> my<00:04:56.880> index<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:58.050> thumb

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
I'm going to take my index and thumb

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.060 
I'm going to take my index and thumb
again<00:04:58.620> reach<00:04:59.550> them<00:04:59.760> through<00:04:59.970> that<00:05:00.060> top<00:05:00.360> loop

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
again reach them through that top loop

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.029 
again reach them through that top loop
grab<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.370> bottom<00:05:02.729> one<00:05:02.880> here<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.919> pull<00:05:04.919> it

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
grab the bottom one here and pull it

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.129 
grab the bottom one here and pull it
through

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
through

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.900 
through
okay<00:05:07.139> walk<00:05:07.830> these<00:05:08.100> loops<00:05:09.020> reach<00:05:10.020> through<00:05:10.380> here

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
okay walk these loops reach through here

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.629 
okay walk these loops reach through here

as<00:05:14.910> you<00:05:15.090> go<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:16.260> have<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.440> tighten<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:16.950> up<00:05:17.120> and

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
as you go you have to tighten it up and

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.090 
as you go you have to tighten it up and
the<00:05:18.210> way<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.389> do<00:05:18.600> that<00:05:18.840> here<00:05:19.410> I'll<00:05:19.590> do<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.830> few

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
the way you do that here I'll do a few

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.060 
the way you do that here I'll do a few
more<00:05:20.419> okay<00:05:21.419> see<00:05:21.479> it<00:05:22.110> actually<00:05:22.470> goes<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.860> lot

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
more okay see it actually goes a lot

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:30.110 
more okay see it actually goes a lot
faster<00:05:23.370> than<00:05:23.700> it<00:05:23.849> looks<00:05:26.090> okay<00:05:27.090> so<00:05:28.520> okay<00:05:29.520> to

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
faster than it looks okay so okay to

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.940 
faster than it looks okay so okay to
tighten<00:05:30.539> up<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:30.690> braid<00:05:31.080> as<00:05:31.380> you're<00:05:31.620> doing<00:05:31.740> it

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
tighten up the braid as you're doing it

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.659 
tighten up the braid as you're doing it
you<00:05:32.460> just<00:05:32.669> clear<00:05:33.000> pull<00:05:33.720> your<00:05:33.900> arms<00:05:34.050> apart<00:05:34.669> okay

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
you just clear pull your arms apart okay

you just clear pull your arms apart okay
so<00:05:36.599> you<00:05:36.690> should<00:05:36.870> be<00:05:37.139> doing<00:05:37.410> that<00:05:37.440> constantly

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
so walk sorry walk through the top pull

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.770 
so walk sorry walk through the top pull
reversed<00:05:45.560> walk<00:05:47.000> through<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.120> top<00:05:48.389> or<00:05:48.750> the

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
reversed walk through the top or the

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.740 
reversed walk through the top or the
first<00:05:49.200> walk<00:05:50.060> go<00:05:51.060> to<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.240> top<00:05:51.510> reversed

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
first walk go to the top reversed

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.060 
first walk go to the top reversed

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:01.640 
put it on there okay see that's the

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.160 
put it on there okay see that's the
braid<00:07:01.880> I<00:07:03.430> I<00:07:04.430> think<00:07:04.970> they're<00:07:05.090> just<00:07:05.330> incredible

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.170 
braid I I think they're just incredible

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.990 
braid I I think they're just incredible
this<00:07:06.680> one<00:07:06.890> is<00:07:07.010> actually<00:07:07.220> different<00:07:07.580> on<00:07:07.850> both

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
this one is actually different on both

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.060 
this one is actually different on both
sides

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
sides

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.350 
sides
some<00:07:10.070> of<00:07:10.220> them<00:07:10.450> match<00:07:12.460> and<00:07:13.460> you<00:07:13.820> of<00:07:13.940> course<00:07:14.150> can

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
some of them match and you of course can

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.660 
some of them match and you of course can
use<00:07:14.420> different<00:07:14.750> colored<00:07:15.310> strings<00:07:16.310> and<00:07:16.580> when

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:16.670 
use different colored strings and when

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.760 
use different colored strings and when
you<00:07:16.790> do<00:07:16.970> you<00:07:17.630> get<00:07:17.810> different<00:07:17.990> patterns<00:07:18.350> that

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
you do you get different patterns that

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.880 
you do you get different patterns that
work<00:07:18.920> their<00:07:19.130> way<00:07:19.280> through<00:07:19.310> it<00:07:19.810> okay<00:07:20.810> so<00:07:21.680> that's

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:21.890 
work their way through it okay so that's

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.510 
work their way through it okay so that's
number<00:07:22.070> one<00:07:22.190> let's<00:07:23.030> do<00:07:23.210> another<00:07:23.300> one
