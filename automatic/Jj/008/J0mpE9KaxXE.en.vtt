 see how prepared the kids are 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.070
 let's give me 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.850
 andrea tell me what races postulated to 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.410
 human medicine and that is the exam 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.540
 which is the hardest part actually 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.670
 national because commission that part 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.460
 because it is an excellent university 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.890
 It has an excellent infrastructure and I 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.520
 have told that their education is very 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.680
 good 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.020
 the ways to postulate economics because 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.030
 these little things take that out because it's the 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.800
 only that involves enough numbers and 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.809
 letters and are sold both so 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.410
 I wanted that career because it conforms to what 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.730
 that I want 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.470
 what are the expectations you have 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.110
 for when you know in college 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.910
 working in a bank started with a 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.500
 normal post and then go up with 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.239
 my work costs magic the house 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.550
 consular to right that as is 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.680
 prepared all this time to my house 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.420
 reading books and looking for some things 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.210
 on the internet also the nervous 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.070
 quiet quiet because we are interested 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.800
 leave because it's a university of 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.960
 prestige and it's very good it's also 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.320
 animates Juan Carlos and why do you get 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.409
 engineering and construction good 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.479
 let's innovate 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.539
 have to meet the years of 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.520
 architects the possibilities here in 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.979
 chiclayo there are many free land here 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.390
 in chiclayo there are many spaces 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.009
 occupy what you think are the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.130
 opportunities that you have studying here 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.720
 for me it is an excellent university 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.010
 college 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.990
 I feel very comfortable because he conquered 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.940
 that race I like everything that has 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.260
 what to do with the design we are going to do with 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.670
 hands and I think the race more 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
 indicated as it prepares you for the exam 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.590
 of mission for tutors 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.210
 if I reading Maria Jose to stay 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.040
 let's apply to business 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.630
 international you chose this race 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.340
 well I liked everything you have to see 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.830
 with globalization and everything 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.110
 breakthrough but because it consists of san 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.250
 Martin because it is the best in business and 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.520

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.440
 entire you entered you celebrate 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.030
 other than that I was a little bit more outspoken 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.620
 what mathematical but if I solved it from 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.290
 medicine because they start and Garcia is 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.050
 accredited and apart that has good 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.620
 implements the structure is fine or 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.830
 I liked that part that if you think 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.420
 a little more mathematical area so that 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.880
 there will be more business administration 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.010

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.010
 guided by its values and by 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.580
 teachings that I saw teachers 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.540
 tell me what races to apply 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.910
 Why is that international 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.410

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.230
 what did you choose the university san martín 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.450
