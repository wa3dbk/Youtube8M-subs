00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.659
 two new editions so to needs 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.340

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:19.550

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.040
 some pokémon that no idea 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.910
 a completely different corner of the globe 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:31.840

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:02.050
 you can not do anything if you are not 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.220

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.960
 So you drive that pretty hard me 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.509
 all that is needed now is the spiritual 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:17.920
 support from a great play here 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:17.920

 By the way, very nice funny 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.680

00:03:49.640 --> 00:04:30.820

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:11.600
