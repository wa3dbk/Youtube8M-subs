00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 and guys here changes I bring a new 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.730
 video on zombies in dire is like 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.589
 the locations of the magic box that 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.000
 I think a lot of people know but like 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.410
 they ask me in other videos and since 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.240
 today is Sunday and usually not uploaded 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.340
 Sunday decided to climb today then 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.260
 they know that there are blue pillars of light 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.330
 in heaven they tell us in which side 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.430
 on the map is the box and in case of giving 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.230
 root there are three locations one in each 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.760
 building in this case is to aspire of what 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.340
 tells us that the house is in the but 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.529
 in the box is in the building that is 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.269
 head is the building that is where 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.880
 all the rooms are upside down 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.680
 where everything is upside down and Well 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.300
 then we will go to the lobby to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.800
 explain the way I guess this 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.969
 way it will be easier if we are 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.739
 in the lobby what we have to do is 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.149
 go so that back we throw ourselves for this 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.010
 hollow that in this door will always be 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.960
 let's say that broken and we have to go 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.940
 that room here is the door 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.410
 this is where the revalidated quiz will be 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.090
 w so that it is located a little more if not 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.379
 They know how to get to the room and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.520
 Well , we live around here 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.980
 hallway down these stairs 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.390
 electric cross here this edge 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.370
 of the map where everything can fall but 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.960
 what we have to go through carefully and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.000
 we slip around here and the box will be 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.619
 always the first location of the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.390
 box will always be in this room no 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.900
 will be upside down there is another way to 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.120
 get there 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.200
 using the trampoline that well 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.550
 I'm going to teach from the room 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.350
 control and trampoline so that it is located 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.730
 easier then and we are for example 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 in this room what we have to 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.990
 to do is go down to the floor there 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.520
 down or the crater this I do not know how 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.410
 call it what we have to do is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.290
 put a trampoline just in this 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.000
 point so that when we use it it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.560
 we throw the room is not the box 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.360
 that are the only two ways to get there 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.160
 sliding down the other building and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.810
 using trampoline and at this point 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.940
 there and when we get to the room 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.350
 there was the first box there are times that the 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.210
 trampoline like we do not put it well and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.830
 we hit the edge cited that already 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.970
 Sometimes we do well what we have to 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.800
 to do is to try again riding 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.090
 us from another angle of the trampoline or 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.670
 well putting it in another direction 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.020
 a little further away the second position of 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.060
 the box is going to be in the building of the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.320
 principle be we see that the pillar of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.119
 is a little more to the left than 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.440
 the previous location what we have 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.540
 what to do here is for example if we are 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.280
 in the lobby we are taught this easier 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.360
 way we have to go from following the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.830
 same way as the first box 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.170
 exactly the same go to the room 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.729
 from over there is the door of this one 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.890
 as I told them or if they do not know how to position themselves 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.209
 well on this map and well then we go down 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.370
 we continue to train the stairs corridors 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.350
 electrical again we follow the same 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.030
 corridor through the edge of the map 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.160
 the second location of the box is going to be 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.930
 here in just before we slip by 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.730
 beyond these two locations of the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.020
 house are like that connected if we 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.400
 we slide there we can not return 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.600
 our building if it is not giving the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.640
 turn around the map you will be the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.440
 trampoline so be very careful of 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.670
 fall over there but the second the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.740
 pressure of the box is going to be just 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.940
 at this point now for the last 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.500
 location of the box 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.820
 we will find in the building of let's say 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.710
 that the dragons are not up to the tower 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.270
 on the roof what we have to do is 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.860
 go up to where the tower is like 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.630
 we are here and the box the pillar of 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.610
 revolution we will find in this 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.080
 room that is in the hallway that 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.360
 that where many people cornered and 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.710
 where we are the elevators we fall 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.780
 precisely in this part and to the 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.040
 left is going to be the box in this 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.240
 room from here this room is 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.860
 specifically for the box there is no 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.870
 absolutely nothing more good a door 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.790
 where to be the zombies and nothing in this 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.230
 case I get the wef yesterday this much 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.180
 people do not know that the slip with fire comes out 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.740
 in the box after you lose it 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.560
 when you got it where the masters 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.910
 since they come out very serious but simply 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.160
 to teach them there that casually I 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.230
 applied and fire and that furnace pillar will 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.460
 he taught them very well that is not good 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.650
 far to show them but if they are 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.480
 from the point where they attend from 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.860
 the middle of the roof 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.480
 and look at the sky acidly this 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.280
 room tomorrow check that the pillar 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.349
 of light house will be in this 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.239
 room and in this area so these 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.709
 have been the three areas where the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.540
 house on this map are the only three 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.400
 places where you can go out will rotate in 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.080
 these three locations and as I already 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.370
 you know I already told them only building like this 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.200
 Well, I hope this helps you 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.580
 video you already know that your likes your vote 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.500
 they are never left over so nothing 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.830
 we see the 7 video a greeting to all up 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.830
 next
