00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
with the brilliant idea they asked a
bunch<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.840> people<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.230> they<00:02:22.319> thought<00:02:22.470> they

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
bunch of people what they thought they

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.900 
bunch of people what they thought they
should<00:02:22.830> do<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.040> try<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.250> correct<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.819> they

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
should do to try to correct it so they

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.250 
should do to try to correct it so they
came<00:02:24.030> up<00:02:24.209> with<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.360> brilliant<00:02:24.540> idea<00:02:24.780> of

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
came up with a brilliant idea of

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.350 
came up with a brilliant idea of
constructing<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.220> tower<00:02:26.459> with<00:02:26.700> one<00:02:27.030> less

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
constructing the tower with one less

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.110 
constructing the tower with one less
brick<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.560> side<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.370> was<00:02:29.610> leaning

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
brick on the side that that was leaning

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.960 
brick on the side that that was leaning
to<00:02:31.110> try<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.410> make<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.560> curved<00:02:31.920> back<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.820> if<00:02:32.910> you

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
to try and make it curved back so if you

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.130 
to try and make it curved back so if you
look<00:02:33.090> at<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.269> Leaning<00:02:33.480> Tower<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.690> Pisa<00:02:33.930> from

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
look at the Leaning Tower of Pisa from

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.360 
look at the Leaning Tower of Pisa from
Western<00:02:34.380> angle<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:34.830> kind<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.100> looks<00:02:35.250> like<00:02:35.280> a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
Western angle it kind of looks like a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.940 
Western angle it kind of looks like a
banana<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.510> it's<00:02:36.750> actually<00:02:37.110> leaning<00:02:37.380> four

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
banana and it's actually leaning four

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.090 
banana and it's actually leaning four
meters<00:02:38.959> from<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.320> way<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.680> where<00:02:40.950> it's

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
meters from the way it where it's

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.140 
meters from the way it where it's
supposed<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.340> be<00:02:41.459> leaning<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:41.850> something<00:02:42.120> like

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
supposed to be leaning so something like

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.949 
supposed to be leaning so something like
13<00:02:42.750> feet<00:02:43.050> 12<00:02:43.590> or<00:02:43.769> 13<00:02:44.100> feet<00:02:44.390> off-center<00:02:45.390> which

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
13 feet 12 or 13 feet off-center which

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.370 
13 feet 12 or 13 feet off-center which
is<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.380> lot<00:02:47.069> but<00:02:47.640> yeah<00:02:47.910> they<00:02:48.239> were<00:02:49.019> afraid<00:02:49.290> it

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
is a lot but yeah they were afraid it

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.949 
is a lot but yeah they were afraid it
wasn't<00:02:49.560> gonna<00:02:49.800> stay<00:02:50.340> up<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:50.959> stayed

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
wasn't gonna stay up but it's stayed

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.509 
wasn't gonna stay up but it's stayed
that<00:02:52.110> way<00:02:52.170> for<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.560> really<00:02:52.769> long<00:02:52.920> time<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.190> will

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
that way for a really long time and will

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.009 
that way for a really long time and will
probably<00:02:53.730> continue<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.300> do<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:54.630> for<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.870> very

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
probably continue to do so for a very

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.570 
probably continue to do so for a very
long<00:02:55.200> time<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:55.950> should<00:02:56.100> still<00:02:56.310> come<00:02:56.489> and

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
long time that you should still come and

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.120 
long time that you should still come and
see<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.850> it's<00:02:56.970> not<00:02:57.060> like<00:02:57.209> an<00:02:57.300> emergency<00:02:58.130> should

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
see it it's not like an emergency should

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.560 
see it it's not like an emergency should
still<00:02:59.340> try<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.550> come<00:02:59.730> see<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.030> it's<00:03:00.329> pretty
