00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.339
 Dr. José María Palacín is a surgeon 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.230
 plastic and belongs to the doctors the 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.900
 select circle of doctors closeup 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.120
 level of Spain as an expert in lifting 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.600
 Cervical will explain the details of 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.600
 this surgery 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.970
 with face lift surgery 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.520
 we try to mitigate the effects of time 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 in the face of people who so 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.550
 they want it is about 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.940
 improve the position of tissues and 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.329
 put them back where they were 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.609
 about 12-14 years ago 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.159
 The fundamental objective is the 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.859
 naturalness of the result does not create a 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.559
 Mask effect on the face but give 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:56.100
 a feeling of relaxation of well-being 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.379
 and certainly with that globality of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 result get a lasting effect 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.880
 for many years and an effect of which 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.970
 an improvement of the passage of the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.869
 time in the tissues it is clear that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.700
 to achieve what we intend 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.009
 we have to act that is, we can not 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.649
 do a minimal surgery to get 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.030
 a good result to get a good 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.289
 result we have to do surgery 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.650
 that acts on all the elements 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.740
 structural aspects of the facial anatomy 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.200
 however access yes always 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.050
 more limited as possible but it has to be 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.030
 broad enough to be able 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.540
 place as we said those tissues 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.730
 where they should be in their position 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.130
 natural in the position of were both 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.840
 years before but always trying 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.720
 make that surgery despite having 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.130
 that act that is achieved in the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.130
 recovery be as fast as possible 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.780
 in the lifting of the lower third of the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.410
 face and neck not only we 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.260
 we limited to stretch the skin that on the other 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.780
 side should not be thought in excess to 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.709
 avoid 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.900
 the evidence of that over stress the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.209
 Skin is not designed to be stretched 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.120
 instead the deep planes the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.730
 fascias and muscles if they are 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.270
 trained to withstand a stress is 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.340
 therefore where we must influence 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.060
 thinking properly these tissues and 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.819
 repositioning the skin afterwards 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.340
 soft without subjecting the tension of this 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.530
 way we get results not 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.730
 only much more permanent but 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.730
 much more natural 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.090
 the ideal candidates for this type of 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.040
 surgeries are usually people who want 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.830
 correct flaccidity in the third 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.590
 lower part of the face and neck is 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.110
 trafficking in persons who has 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.500
 disappeared or the oval has faded 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.240
 of the face 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.210
 in which what has appeared 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.730
 we call myself use of clusters in this 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.010
 jaw area as well as people 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:22.350
 that present to clumps of fat or 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:26.000
 flaccidity together with strings of the bands 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.000
 of platt isma in the neck 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.320
 We normally use a sedation 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.930
 deep associated with the use of 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.840
 local anesthesia that allows us to work 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.600
 with tranquility without discomfort for the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.350
 patient and with a quick recovery 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.790
 that allows the patient to return to his 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.790
 home the next day 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.660
 This is one of the questions that most 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.660
 often it is done to us and that is 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.220
 really difficult to achieve since 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.500
 that will depend on the evolution of 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.970
 postoperative there are people who 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.660
 They swell bad there are people who 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.520
 they swell less there are those who make purple 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.320
 after surgery and some people 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.280
 just presents this kind of 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.799
 problematic 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.870
 based on that the recovery will be 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.870
 between the week and the 15 days
