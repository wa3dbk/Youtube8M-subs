what<00:00:00.480> kind<00:00:00.719> of<00:00:00.840> chronograph<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.829> best<00:00:02.280> for<00:00:02.669> you

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
what kind of chronograph is best for you

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.030 
what kind of chronograph is best for you
well<00:00:03.360> that's<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.899> question<00:00:04.290> I<00:00:04.380> get<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.560> lot<00:00:04.799> so

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
well that's a question I get a lot so

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.289 
well that's a question I get a lot so
we're<00:00:05.190> going<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.339> go<00:00:05.520> into<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.759> little<00:00:05.970> bit<00:00:06.210> of

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
we're going to go into a little bit of

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.480 
we're going to go into a little bit of
detail<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.589> different<00:00:08.069> types<00:00:08.309> of

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
detail on the different types of

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.280 
detail on the different types of
coronagraphs<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.389> how<00:00:09.660> they<00:00:09.840> might<00:00:10.110> better

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
coronagraphs and how they might better

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.060 
coronagraphs and how they might better
suit<00:00:10.679> you

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
suit you

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.089 
suit you
now<00:00:11.639> people<00:00:12.450> generally<00:00:12.809> fall<00:00:13.139> into<00:00:13.170> one<00:00:13.920> of

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
now people generally fall into one of

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.060 
now people generally fall into one of
two<00:00:14.130> categories<00:00:14.780> primarily<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
two categories primarily one is the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.349 
two categories primarily one is the
person<00:00:17.400> that's<00:00:17.550> buying<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:18.000> chronograph

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
person that's buying a chronograph

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.240 
person that's buying a chronograph
because<00:00:18.869> they're<00:00:19.020> actually<00:00:19.470> going<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.770> use<00:00:20.220> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
because they're actually going to use a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.040 
because they're actually going to use a
chronograph<00:00:20.760> which<00:00:21.150> again<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> stopwatch

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
chronograph which again is a stopwatch

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.279 
chronograph which again is a stopwatch
to<00:00:22.590> time<00:00:23.039> certain<00:00:23.640> events<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.930> other

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
to time certain events and the other

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.470 
to time certain events and the other
segment<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.220> people<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
segment is people that just like a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.150 
segment is people that just like a
sporty<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.140> look<00:00:28.380> they<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> more

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
sporty or look they like the more

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.339 
sporty or look they like the more
complex<00:00:29.699> dial<00:00:30.090> layout<00:00:30.510> they<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
complex dial layout they like the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.290 
complex dial layout they like the
pushers<00:00:31.830> hanging<00:00:32.189> off<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.520> side<00:00:32.550> adding<00:00:33.210> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
pushers hanging off the side adding a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
pushers hanging off the side adding a
little<00:00:33.420> more<00:00:33.660> size<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> watch<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.739> giving

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
little more size to the watch and giving

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.100 
little more size to the watch and giving
it<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.730> more<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.000> beefy<00:00:36.420> sporty<00:00:36.780> or<00:00:36.809> look

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
it just more of a beefy sporty or look

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.229 
it just more of a beefy sporty or look
with<00:00:37.620> no<00:00:37.770> real<00:00:38.129> intention<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.700> actually<00:00:38.910> ever

with no real intention of actually ever

with no real intention of actually ever
using<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.840> chronograph<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:40.730> what<00:00:41.730> we've<00:00:41.879> done

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
using a chronograph well what we've done

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.970 
using a chronograph well what we've done
here<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.360> we've<00:00:42.510> set<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.140> couple<00:00:43.739> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
here is we've set out a couple of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.380 
here is we've set out a couple of
different<00:00:44.370> kind<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.610> coronagraphs<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.300> you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
different kind of coronagraphs for you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.000 
different kind of coronagraphs for you
to<00:00:45.450> look<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.780> we're<00:00:46.350> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.530> start<00:00:46.770> right

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
to look at we're going to start right

ice ax 81 72 now the way this is going
to<00:00:54.600> operate<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:56.039> large<00:00:56.460> hand<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.000> going

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
to operate is your large hand is going

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.540 
to operate is your large hand is going
to<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:58.109> cronograph<00:00:58.739> hands<00:00:59.399> that's

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
to be your cronograph hands that's

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.010 
to be your cronograph hands that's
actually<00:00:59.969> going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.210> calculating<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
actually going to be calculating the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.470 
actually going to be calculating the
coronagraph<00:01:01.379> seconds<00:01:02.129> now<00:01:02.789> remember<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> do

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
coronagraph seconds now remember you do

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.299 
coronagraph seconds now remember you do
not<00:01:03.510> leave<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> chronograph<00:01:04.559> running<00:01:05.129> at<00:01:05.220> all

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
not leave a chronograph running at all

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.130 
not leave a chronograph running at all
times<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.210> depletes<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.630> battery

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
times because it depletes your battery

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.410 
times because it depletes your battery
if<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.560> quartz<00:01:07.920> or<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.909> depletes<00:01:09.330> your

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
if it's a quartz or it depletes your

power Reserve on a mechanical or
automatic<00:01:11.729> much<00:01:12.450> more<00:01:13.020> quickly<00:01:13.500> because

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
automatic much more quickly because

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.340 
automatic much more quickly because
remember<00:01:14.760> that's<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.390> part<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.810> your<00:01:15.869> time<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
remember that's not part of your time of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380 
remember that's not part of your time of
day<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.770> seconds<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.549> time<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.939> day<00:01:18.119> on

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
day your seconds for the time of day on

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
day your seconds for the time of day on
this<00:01:19.080> particular<00:01:19.650> movement<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.310> be

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
this particular movement is going to be

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.460 
this particular movement is going to be
at<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> 2<00:01:20.939> o'clock<00:01:21.210> sub<00:01:21.630> dial<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
at the 2 o'clock sub dial that's the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.780 
at the 2 o'clock sub dial that's the
hand<00:01:22.680> that's<00:01:22.799> always<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.250> move<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
hand that's always going to move for the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.140 
hand that's always going to move for the
seconds<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.900> right<00:01:25.110> now<00:01:25.340> this<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.400> calculating

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
seconds so right now this is calculating

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.330 
seconds so right now this is calculating
the<00:01:27.270> running<00:01:27.869> seconds<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.070> stopwatch

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the running seconds for the stopwatch

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.270 
the running seconds for the stopwatch
and<00:01:29.880> over<00:01:30.840> at<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> 9<00:01:31.409> o'clock<00:01:31.590> position

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and over at the 9 o'clock position

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.350 
and over at the 9 o'clock position
that's<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> give<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> very

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that's just going to give you a very

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.170 
that's just going to give you a very
simple<00:01:33.860> 30-minute<00:01:34.860> totalizers<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.030> can

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
simple 30-minute totalizers so you can

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.690 
simple 30-minute totalizers so you can
time<00:01:36.479> an<00:01:36.630> event<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.770> 30<00:01:38.130> minutes<00:01:38.430> in

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
time an event for up to 30 minutes in

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and replaced it with something that's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.749

more<00:01:57.119> commonly<00:01:57.840> used<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.350> day<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> week<00:01:59.040> so

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
more commonly used a day of the week so

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.429 
more commonly used a day of the week so
for<00:02:00.030> most<00:02:00.149> people<00:02:00.299> they'd<00:02:00.719> rather<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.170> day

the chronograph complications this is a
movement<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.689> rely<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> brand<00:02:07.649> very

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
movement that we rely on as a brand very

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.070 
movement that we rely on as a brand very
very<00:02:08.250> often<00:02:08.459> because<00:02:09.270> we<00:02:09.300> found<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.720> people

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
very often because we found that people

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.350 
very often because we found that people
really<00:02:10.530> do<00:02:10.679> appreciate<00:02:10.920> having<00:02:11.550> that

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
really do appreciate having that

that operates a little bit differently

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.120 
that operates a little bit differently
you'll<00:02:24.390> notice<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.870> large<00:02:25.230> ticking<00:02:25.830> hand

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
you'll notice the large ticking hand

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.160 
you'll notice the large ticking hand
here<00:02:26.460> this<00:02:26.670> time<00:02:26.940> around<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.420> not<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
here this time around is not the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.440 
here this time around is not the
coronagraph<00:02:28.530> hand<00:02:29.010> instead<00:02:29.460> that's<00:02:30.030> going<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
coronagraph hand instead that's going to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.780 
coronagraph hand instead that's going to
be<00:02:30.540> your<00:02:30.660> oversized<00:02:31.260> seconds<00:02:31.890> hand<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.640> is

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
be your oversized seconds hand this is

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.640 
be your oversized seconds hand this is
particularly<00:02:33.330> useful<00:02:33.540> for<00:02:33.930> somebody<00:02:34.320> let's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
particularly useful for somebody let's

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.340 
particularly useful for somebody let's
say<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.890> nurse<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.580> needs<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.000> see<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.810> second

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
say a nurse that needs to see the second

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.199 
say a nurse that needs to see the second
hand<00:02:37.590> more<00:02:37.890> than<00:02:37.920> any<00:02:38.310> other<00:02:38.580> hand<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
hand more than any other hand on the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.880 
hand more than any other hand on the
dial<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.990> it's<00:02:40.170> going<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.680> biggest

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
dial so it's going to be the biggest

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.090 
dial so it's going to be the biggest
hand<00:02:41.600> now<00:02:42.600> they've<00:02:42.930> got<00:02:43.140> down<00:02:43.440> here<00:02:43.890> your

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
hand now they've got down here your

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.190 
hand now they've got down here your
cronograph<00:02:44.610> seconds<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.510> going<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.080> be

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
cronograph seconds is going to be

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.630 
cronograph seconds is going to be
running<00:02:46.380> there<00:02:46.709> when<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.010> chronograph<00:02:47.490> is

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
running there when the chronograph is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.360 
running there when the chronograph is
operational<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.540> still<00:02:49.350> again<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.890> minute's

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
operational and still again a minute's

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.460 
operational and still again a minute's
totalizer<00:02:50.850> but<00:02:51.150> now<00:02:51.360> we're<00:02:51.570> going<00:02:51.870> from<00:02:52.320> a

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
totalizer but now we're going from a

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.380 
totalizer but now we're going from a
30-minute<00:02:53.160> totalizer<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.880> we<00:02:53.970> saw<00:02:54.180> before

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
30-minute totalizer that we saw before

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.170 
30-minute totalizer that we saw before
to<00:02:54.989> now<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> full<00:02:55.709> hour<00:02:56.010> save<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.610> 60-minute

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
to now a full hour save a 60-minute

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.930 
to now a full hour save a 60-minute
totalizer<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.530> can<00:02:58.770> time<00:02:59.070> an<00:02:59.220> event<00:02:59.340> for

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
totalizer so you can time an event for

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.120 
totalizer so you can time an event for
up<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.150> 60<00:03:00.630> minutes<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:01.050> duration<00:03:01.200> before<00:03:02.040> it

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
up to 60 minutes in duration before it

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.280 
up to 60 minutes in duration before it
recounts<00:03:02.730> back<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.150> zero<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:04.260> other

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
recounts back to zero the other

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.140 
recounts back to zero the other
complication<00:03:05.220> you're<00:03:05.310> going<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.550> see<00:03:05.760> here<00:03:06.030> is

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
complication you're going to see here is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.500 
complication you're going to see here is
going<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.080> be<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.370> 24-hour<00:03:08.370> indicator<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.420> that

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
going to be a 24-hour indicator and that

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.960 
going to be a 24-hour indicator and that
gives<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.989> your<00:03:10.170> AM<00:03:10.950> PM<00:03:11.190> or<00:03:11.550> think<00:03:11.820> of

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
gives you your AM PM or think of

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.880 
gives you your AM PM or think of
military<00:03:12.239> time<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.020> that's<00:03:13.500> going<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.709> let

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
military time and that's going to let

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.740 
military time and that's going to let
you<00:03:14.130> know<00:03:14.310> if<00:03:14.550> your<00:03:14.820> watch<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:15.390> currently

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
you know if your watch is currently

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.530 
you know if your watch is currently
displaying<00:03:16.230> 10:00<00:03:16.590> p.m.<00:03:16.830> or<00:03:17.280> 10:00<00:03:17.790> a.m.<00:03:18.060> and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
displaying 10:00 p.m. or 10:00 a.m. and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.080 
displaying 10:00 p.m. or 10:00 a.m. and
as<00:03:18.900> we<00:03:19.110> see<00:03:19.320> down<00:03:19.500> there<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:20.519> would<00:03:20.670> be<00:03:20.760> 10:00

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
as we see down there it would be 10:00

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.990 
as we see down there it would be 10:00
a.m.<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:21.840> particular<00:03:22.440> instance<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.970> a

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
a unique one as I stop the chronograph

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.159 
a unique one as I stop the chronograph
look<00:04:16.979> what<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.250> does<00:04:17.479> it's<00:04:18.479> going<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.750> then

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
look what it does it's going to then

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.850 
look what it does it's going to then
stop<00:04:19.739> at<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.970> tenths<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.959> second<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:22.620> if<00:04:22.710> you

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
stop at the tenths of a second so if you

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.920 
stop at the tenths of a second so if you

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
be an automatic chronograph now I'd love

be an automatic chronograph now I'd love
to<00:04:38.160> show<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.640> mechanical<00:04:39.390> as<00:04:39.540> well<00:04:39.750> but

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
to show you a mechanical as well but

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.960 
to show you a mechanical as well but
mechanicals<00:04:40.530> are<00:04:40.650> much<00:04:41.010> more<00:04:41.310> difficult<00:04:41.520> to

mechanicals are much more difficult to
find<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.450> much<00:04:43.020> more<00:04:43.290> expensive<00:04:43.950> with<00:04:44.880> this

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
find and much more expensive with this

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.520 
find and much more expensive with this
you're<00:04:45.330> going<00:04:45.420> to<00:04:45.480> be<00:04:45.570> getting<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:46.230> full

mechanical automatic movement in this

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.700 
mechanical automatic movement in this
case<00:04:49.380> it's<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.770> value<00:04:50.280> 77<00:04:51.150> 50<00:04:51.600> for<00:04:51.960> that

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
case it's the value 77 50 for that

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.950 
case it's the value 77 50 for that
particular<00:04:53.250> movement<00:04:53.460> gives<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.000> 25<00:04:54.630> Joule

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
particular movement gives you a 25 Joule

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.210 
particular movement gives you a 25 Joule
and<00:04:57.960> also<00:04:58.470> it's<00:04:58.560> going<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.710> give<00:04:58.920> you<00:04:59.070> an

and also it's going to give you an
additional<00:05:00.030> complication<00:05:00.270> of<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:00.990> GMT<00:05:01.620> that's
