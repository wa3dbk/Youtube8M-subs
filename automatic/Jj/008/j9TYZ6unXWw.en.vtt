like<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.239> factor<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.719> stuff<00:00:55.110> into

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
like that if you factor that stuff into

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.189 
like that if you factor that stuff into
the<00:00:55.469> equation<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.480> mean<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the equation I mean if you have to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.750 
the equation I mean if you have to
appear<00:00:58.440> right<00:00:58.620> away<00:00:58.649> somewhere<00:00:59.280> else<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.640> if

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
appear right away somewhere else and if

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.000 
appear right away somewhere else and if
you<00:00:59.820> can't<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.120> too<00:01:00.180> far<00:01:00.629> maybe<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you can't go too far maybe if it's a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
you can't go too far maybe if it's a
jutsu<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.850> does<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.750> lot<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.080> damage

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
jutsu that just does a lot of damage

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.870 
jutsu that just does a lot of damage
over<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.450> pretty<00:01:06.450> wide<00:01:06.990> span<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.770> an<00:01:08.070> area<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
over a pretty wide span of an area it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.020 
over a pretty wide span of an area it
can<00:01:09.330> hurt<00:01:09.869> Toby<00:01:10.520> that's<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> thought

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
can hurt Toby that's just a thought

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.399 
can hurt Toby that's just a thought
probably<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.640> know<00:01:14.900> whatever<00:01:15.900> there
