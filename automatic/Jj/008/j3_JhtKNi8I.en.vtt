00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.090
 and then guys all right to welcome the most 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.330
 a video lesson and in today's video I 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.869
 I want to approach modal improvisation 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.330
 using pentatonic is cool as it goes 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.230
 being this I will take as a basis 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.670
 light progression of 12 with legal baton 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.540
 So it's looking like the progression to 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.300
 You there in the video in that progression have 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.790
 a sequence of 12 measures then 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:51.659
 starting here I have the first 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:54.449
 compass 2º 3º 4º 5º and 7º 8º 9º 10º 11º 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:58.260
 12th legal bar 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.989
 I already put it in the key there 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.870
 greater then the first four 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.799
 bars in the after two bars in 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.320
 re 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.170
 two more bars there and then 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.619
 last line and we have the 5th grade 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.070
 It's a misery there and then this is a 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.640
 and a base sequence to progression 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.670
 playing a blues is cool, then having 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.270
 base this blues progression 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.299
 What I'm going to do is something that gets 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.880
 very cool that this one was even embroidered in 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.320
 other and other video lessons there you are 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.570
 to apply to the pentatonic scale 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.770
 even though the first drawing is 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.170
 smaller on top of the bigger accord is cool 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.749
 so rolling the progression and voting 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.420
 using same as above as was of the accord 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:49.820
 bigger 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.869
 a scale smaller than the first deviation 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.869
 Catholic 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.440
 right and logically I have your 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.380
 your drawings should not be 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.880
 then the first drawing aquino there 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.920
 second drawing will be in the next 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.510
 note that the doyle note is like this 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.010
 successively 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.140
 we have those that five 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.560
 drawings of pentatonic inversions 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.010
 to use on top of that is cool idea 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.620
 make the modal application would change 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.040
 this first design in accordance with a 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.680
 chord of progression as well as the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.650
 chord of progression the base is being 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.980
 in there then first drawing will be 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.980
 up in the air 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.950
 the time the progression changes backwards 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.120
 I'm going to make my first official event 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.120
 from the rest 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.909
 and it looks that the progression of the prime and I 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.909
 do the first 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.450
 and their respective inversions there 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.250
 cool 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.650
 so let's follow the progression here 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:10.150
 are there 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:10.150
 the room is good for the defendant 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:27.739
 there the last line is m 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.920
 now let's go there first drawing of each 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.920
 one 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.760
 we are giving the first drawing equal 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.390
 is 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.960
 or in the air 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.790
 i 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.980
 is 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.760
 over there 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.790
 It's cool, then, this idea of ​​ours. 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.560
 modal improvisation to make the first 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.960
 drawing of each one respecting that the 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.450
 people have all the versions 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.430
 it is starting from this first drawing are 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.290
 Five drawings think it's worth it 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.450
 I always give the maximum of this type of 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.920
 Drawing is fine, there it is. 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.040
 Come on now, I'll try to use the maximum. 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.130
 of five drawings thinking about every 11 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.150
 Good second for me, right? 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.510
 then there's help from the event 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.510
 it was 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.160
 guaru 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.780
 I have right 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.440
 according to the drawing went back there not to have 14 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.440
 drawing of the 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:56.030
 and draws the second drawing is first 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.030
 3rd in the air 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.729
 in the air room 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.020
 according to morrell 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.710
 roberto engineer 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.000
 according to cell phone goulart 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.350
 the first defendant of the home 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.889
 four of the river 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:34.149
 The effect is really cool, huh? 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.889
 the effect is very cool something that 

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:37.989
 it's worth a try because 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.059
 they generate the very different sound for 

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:42.729
 It's legal improvisation. 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:45.159
 anyone who wants this playback along with 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.769
 five drawings of the pentatonic I 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:51.519
 I used it here just to get into Mauritius 

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:55.089
 alabama dotcom I do not have br and in the section 

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:59.769
 download the file there 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:01.959
 is to point out that you will have this lesson and 

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:05.379
 this compressed file will already be 

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:07.629
 playback with 15 pentatonic drawings 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:09.249
 A tonic for you guys, it's cool. 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.169
