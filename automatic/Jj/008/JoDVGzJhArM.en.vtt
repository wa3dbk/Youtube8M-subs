00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.039
 yes then we come slowly now 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.250
 time for the first with the maine show that 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.930
 was the rematch braithwaite won against 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.529
 We can kane in after the system gale ring of 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.410
 fire with 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.269
 you saw it was I do not know 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.050
 What a gas stove were it leds again 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.239
 are not flared up that one believe 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.620
 I already if proper flame on mountain 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.800
 In any case, they are always very strong 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.160
 braided every move should believe 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.620
 you be 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.789
 yes and you have the one with a cone 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.829
 lost 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.899
 why anytime nobody rings the ring 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.300
 should leave yes and the meaning of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.579
 matches have been ad absurdum as 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.930
 the wild family just take a blanket 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.109
 put the plants and the ring 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.600
 have risen any special 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.449
 opinion on the beginning of the match 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.820
 so i believe that the nun claudio 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.799
 verge, that was only there because 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 you actually think logically how you have 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.400
 this and face you will become me 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.130
 manage to intervene by the flames 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.170
 but no one is up to the idea 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.470
 come that you have a blanket next to it 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.710
 and yes someday on the net one too 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.780
 Fireman attacked and one stood 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.060
 just there and has just looked at the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.420
 taken blanket 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:36.840
 the match was not real now 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:40.470
 Worth seeing it was extremely weak 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.030
 represented and very well characterized 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.579
 The use blanket you have the wild 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.509
 family intelligent days pitch that 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.509
 at first glance the appearance 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.350
 closer with so I have to say so me 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.150
 thought it was absolutely grotty wyatt was allowed 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.490
 did not show I know've 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.590
 at nxp I have seen him as well 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.780
 husky harris earlier and he has one 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.330
 amount in the ring but now times 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.690
 you saw against aq two moves 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.860
 So finish it should be him finish 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.179
 show a bit more that and here 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.709
 has not a really dominated since the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.020
 he even had two cocktails 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.270
 clearly defeated where he wanted to stop too much 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.020
 really wanted to panic him like that 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.110
 beautiful says yes I would say 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.190
 push forward is reasonably good 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.200
 go on in his break is the 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.110
 attack after the match I found better 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.569
 as the whole match was before too though 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.140
 one has clearly not seen the head 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.450
 hit between the stairs but was 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:44.830
 just this time a suboptimal 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:46.299
 camera settings my eyes that 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.040
 slowest I found that only the 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:53.829
 Children have tried candlestick 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.540
 somehow and then through the ropes too 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.370
 bring and then it is in the flames 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.760
 landed that's just started to 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.370
 burn 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.790
 it is not correct but you have to 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.049
 also say so 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.220
 because they did not 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.420
 Now really go to the ropes 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.510
 so that could be yours 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.630
 freedom of movement was restricted 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.579
 I could say too 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.170
 So these two people he is 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.019
 a bit dry in those then 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.150
 even take the place away 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.650
 yes, actually know about it lives on 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.200
 climbing ropes or swing 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.269
 to pick up for his action and wait yes 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.190
 I too had in advance 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.320
 presented that the barrier around the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.000
 ring around and not right on the 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.109
 So that was the end of the ring 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.459
 really suboptimal solved and yes there 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:47.470
 actually you could have too 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.299
 So you can not burn now 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.600
 burn directly but catch fire 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:55.390
 can leave or something like a break 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.310
 just when you look at them 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.400
 against and behind the meier already 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.140
 harder also the attack 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.220
 after that it was already good for p &amp; g 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.590
 has executed or joined who now 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.319
 really you even have the fire department 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:19.430
 because even if it is not a real one now 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:22.160
 So, I would match that one up 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.509
 So a quarter of a star will give more 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.509
 really hard on the border 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.389
 ironic that the few days after 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.910
 the first active so what 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:41.360
 tells has that but scott the sky 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.070
 again, not the one who feels that way 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.020
 about the already excited completely 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.030
 That was right at the time with these 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.289
 anger management of this herald and 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.550
 group had on twitter against gay 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.139
 I did not know what it was and talked 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.410
 Wwe has a press release as well 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:09.080
 how does this is poorest 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:10.610
 I guess that's how I stand 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.800
 you just suspect that them 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.930
 california you just have the 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.300
 westler the inside aces we were then 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.539
 also the dramaturgy one they were yes 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.440
 then all the next choice between code 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:26.690
 can all be there from your environment and 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.639
 you should be right in front of everyone again 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.830
 Things like brian at the time 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:35.510
 Discharge is grass over the matter 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:39.080
 no luxury and yes so how 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:46.190
 you rated the first one with plug has yes 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:48.830
 also like to deal with the world okay 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.360
 still some anecdotes claudia 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.750
 maybe it was so relative again 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.060
 not much said actually not so 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.130
 Growing that was also old-age was easy 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.229
 just somehow the match would have been there 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.210
 you can actually get more out of it 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:05.370
 the station was ring of fire dettmann 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.030
 they did something different 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.030
 you have time
