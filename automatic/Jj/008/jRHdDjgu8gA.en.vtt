DIY garage for parts and I'm here to
show<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.210> how<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.660> level<00:00:13.230> up<00:00:13.320> your<00:00:13.380> garage

short<00:00:14.719> your<00:00:15.719> door<00:00:15.870> can<00:00:16.109> get<00:00:16.260> out<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.470> level<00:00:16.830> for

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
short your door can get out of level for

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.040 
short your door can get out of level for
several<00:00:17.520> reasons<00:00:18.000> sometimes<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.900> be<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
several reasons sometimes it can be the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.260 
several reasons sometimes it can be the
concrete<00:00:19.710> has<00:00:20.130> shifted<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.880> sort<00:00:21.210> of

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
concrete has shifted and that sort of

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.820 
concrete has shifted and that sort of
thing<00:00:21.480> there's<00:00:21.779> not<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> whole<00:00:22.199> lot<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.590> do

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
thing there's not a whole lot you can do

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.590 
thing there's not a whole lot you can do
about<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.609> if<00:00:23.939> your<00:00:24.090> concrete<00:00:24.449> is

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
about that but if your concrete is

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.279 
about that but if your concrete is
pretty<00:00:24.810> level<00:00:25.260> usually<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.689> reason<00:00:27.689> your

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
pretty level usually the reason your

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.380 
pretty level usually the reason your
door<00:00:28.529> gets<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.010> level<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> cable

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
door gets in level is one of the cable

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540 
door gets in level is one of the cable
drums<00:00:30.689> where<00:00:31.140> your<00:00:31.289> cables<00:00:31.740> attached<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.250> has

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
drums where your cables attached to has

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.389 
drums where your cables attached to has
slipped<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:34.230> side<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> same<00:00:35.190> as

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
slipped and that side it's the same as

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.000 
slipped and that side it's the same as
if<00:00:35.579> your<00:00:35.760> cable<00:00:36.180> had<00:00:36.420> gotten<00:00:36.719> longer<00:00:37.110> because

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
if your cable had gotten longer because

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.970 
if your cable had gotten longer because
whenever<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.969> cable<00:00:39.360> drum<00:00:39.510> slips<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.680> size

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
whenever the cable drum slips that size

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.040 
whenever the cable drum slips that size
longer<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.730> doors<00:00:41.940> not<00:00:42.180> pulling<00:00:42.540> up<00:00:42.629> equally

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
longer your doors not pulling up equally

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.940 
longer your doors not pulling up equally
so<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.860> case<00:00:44.450> we've<00:00:45.450> got<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:46.469> side<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
so in this case we've got this side is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.180 
so in this case we've got this side is
probably<00:00:47.370> good<00:00:47.579> half<00:00:47.820> inch<00:00:48.079> higher<00:00:49.079> than<00:00:49.620> this

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
probably good half inch higher than this

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.250 
probably good half inch higher than this
side<00:00:50.399> over<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.300> we're<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> we're

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
side over here so we're going to we're

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.650 
side over here so we're going to we're
going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> fix<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.550> quick<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.390> not

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
going to fix that really quick it's not

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.080 
going to fix that really quick it's not
a<00:00:54.690> hard<00:00:55.020> fix<00:00:55.640> probably<00:00:56.640> should<00:00:56.789> take<00:00:56.940> about

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
a hard fix probably should take about

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.900 
a hard fix probably should take about
five<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.870> ten<00:00:58.260> minutes<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.890> time<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
five to ten minutes of your time the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.849 
five to ten minutes of your time the
first<00:01:00.059> thing<00:01:00.180> we're<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.859> we're

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
first thing we're going to do we're

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.470 
first thing we're going to do we're
going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.100> need<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.489> set<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.760> watching<00:01:03.210> force

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
going to need a set of watching force

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.090 
going to need a set of watching force
and<00:01:04.199> we're<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> need<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.720> 7/16<00:01:06.720> wrench<00:01:07.650> or

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and we're going to need a 7/16 wrench or

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
and we're going to need a 7/16 wrench or
we're<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> need<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> socket<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.540> this

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
we're going to need a socket that this

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.520 
we're going to need a socket that this
one<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.470> 3/8<00:01:11.600> this<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.900> point<00:01:13.290> socket

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
one is 3/8 this is a point socket

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.440 
one is 3/8 this is a point socket
they're<00:01:13.890> kind<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.130> hard<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.310> come<00:01:14.520> by<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.330> then

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
they're kind of hard to come by and then

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.649 
they're kind of hard to come by and then
also<00:01:15.630> need<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> last<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> first<00:01:18.450> thing

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
also need to last so the first thing

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.649 
also need to last so the first thing
we're<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:20.330> we're<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.509> go

we're going to do is we're going to go

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.510 
we're going to do is we're going to go
over<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.700> we're<00:01:23.700> going<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> prop<00:01:24.150> up<00:01:25.520> top

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
over here and we're going to prop up top

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.859 
over here and we're going to prop up top
the<00:01:26.759> screen<00:01:27.000> solution<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the screen solution so we are going to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.130 
the screen solution so we are going to
stick<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> winding<00:01:31.860> bar<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:35.659> we're<00:01:36.659> loosen

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
stick the winding bar and we're loosen

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.580 
stick the winding bar and we're loosen
the<00:01:37.229> keys<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:38.310> your<00:01:38.759> friend<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.409> just

the keys up on your friend so we just

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.649 
the keys up on your friend so we just
cut<00:01:43.770> off<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> quarter<00:01:44.549> almost<00:01:45.000> quarter<00:01:45.299> turn

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
cut off a quarter almost quarter turn

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.560 
cut off a quarter almost quarter turn
room<00:01:45.930> put<00:01:46.140> that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
room put that

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.420 
room put that
on<00:01:47.010> football<00:01:48.010> in<00:01:48.280> there<00:01:49.650> now<00:01:50.650> very<00:01:51.190> high

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
on football in there now very high

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:05.550 
on football in there now very high
trapeze<00:01:51.940> day<00:02:03.150> okay<00:02:04.150> since<00:02:04.600> this<00:02:04.900> side<00:02:05.200> on<00:02:05.410> the

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
trapeze day okay since this side on the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
trapeze day okay since this side on the
left<00:02:05.590> was<00:02:06.130> higher<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.960> cable<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.740> shorter

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
left was higher that cable is shorter

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.320 
left was higher that cable is shorter
than<00:02:09.940> this<00:02:10.179> size<00:02:10.450> not<00:02:11.410> not<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:12.550> reality<00:02:13.150> but

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
than this size not not in reality but

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.900 
than this size not not in reality but
most<00:02:13.870> likely<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.530> girl<00:02:14.800> has<00:02:15.130> slipped<00:02:15.550> and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
most likely this girl has slipped and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.030 
most likely this girl has slipped and
caused<00:02:16.600> this<00:02:16.870> cable<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.320> act<00:02:17.590> like<00:02:17.830> it's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
caused this cable to act like it's

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.750 
caused this cable to act like it's
longer<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:19.060> most<00:02:19.270> likely<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.900> cable<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
longer so most likely this cable the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.270 
longer so most likely this cable the
drum<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.209> not<00:02:22.240> tight<00:02:22.630> enough<00:02:22.840> or<00:02:23.410> it's<00:02:23.680> or<00:02:23.920> half

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
drum is not tight enough or it's or half

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.580 
drum is not tight enough or it's or half
slips<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> best<00:02:25.270> thing<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.540> do<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:26.260> start

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
slips so the best thing to do is start

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.980 
slips so the best thing to do is start

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.130 
where it's got about the same amount of
tension<00:02:59.260> as<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.769> right<00:03:00.160> here<00:03:03.810> okay<00:03:04.810> as<00:03:05.019> you

can see this one's got a lot more

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.479 
can see this one's got a lot more
tension<00:03:08.019> on<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.440> than<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.650> one<00:03:08.980> does<00:03:09.190> right

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
tension on it than that one does right

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.720 
tension on it than that one does right
there<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:11.040> we're<00:03:12.040> going<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.190> loosen<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.700> up

and as you can see the door kind of

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:39.640 
and as you can see the door kind of
shifted<00:03:24.670> Snug<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.700> back<00:03:26.000> up<00:03:37.180> okay<00:03:38.180> now<00:03:38.530> all<00:03:39.530> we

shifted Snug it back up okay now all we

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.710 
shifted Snug it back up okay now all we
got<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:39.830> do<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.160> um<00:03:40.370> proper<00:03:40.400> winding<00:03:41.209> board<00:03:41.480> and

got to do is um proper winding board and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.470 
got to do is um proper winding board and
then<00:03:41.989> we'll<00:03:42.440> test<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.890> out<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:44.030> best<00:03:44.239> thing<00:03:44.450> to

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
then we'll test it out the best thing to

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.270 
then we'll test it out the best thing to
do<00:03:44.720> after<00:03:45.049> you<00:03:45.140> take<00:03:45.349> your<00:03:45.380> winding<00:03:45.860> bar<00:03:46.040> out

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
do after you take your winding bar out

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.699 
do after you take your winding bar out
is<00:03:46.489> raise<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.420> door<00:03:47.569> manually<00:03:48.379> and<00:03:48.680> then

can see it's pretty level all the way

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.180 
can see it's pretty level all the way
across<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:26.300> some<00:04:27.229> man<00:04:27.440> shouldn't<00:04:27.800> have<00:04:28.010> any
