 you can see the clinic road map 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.090
 but also not everything but therefore fine and that is all feeling it 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.550
 all easier 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.550
 in those same mars bars 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.090
 in more than a third place

 we investigated the qualities of the vehicle 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.310

 7 who made that knew tasty meals for four days was not it 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.440
 I think so 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.040
 critics think the cock 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.590
 agents involving multiple times in the debate 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.710
 to recharge later it turned out that the banks were already known 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.900
 hold the outside of the post later 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.900
 keep the right path 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.060
 we determined 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.650
 last week it is indirectly for the supervisory board or is mainly no meat 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.650

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:21.469
 Yes 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.329
 what i don't understand is that you would rather see all of this than that 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.549
 party ps 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.409
 the man has to bring that 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.759
 what is rss 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:33.549
 I wonder what the rest of the world can do with the opportunities that these countries offer 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.789
 the recipe 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.159
 my hands 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.540
 we can't do that 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.289
 a good cook has nothing to hide 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:45.680

 wim bakker I was not out cook says 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.479
 can be further refused 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.479
 So 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:03.699
 what me up 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:06.699
 all messages where the men really are 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:14.669
 a bit as a result is the chance that the boxes his home must come back tomorrow 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:22.010
 the next morning I discover in a well-known German magazine and that the 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:24.809
 nuisance from scooters boehner 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.849
 the midfielder 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.849
 standards and advises meijboom to visit him first 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:36.279
 brussels describes in his article how difficult the incident is to know such a thing 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:39.359
 to come across the contents of a can of beer before 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.410
 the same problem 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.410
 where he runs into 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.470
 why the waterfront 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.209
 9 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.249
 8 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:00.169
 that confirms the day 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.469
 can all found we have very hard next to the foot 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.139
 Gillard used to come 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.650
 so it is true that we were beautiful that I always wanted someone who could house it 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:15.649
 outgoing minister cramer has the phone 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:17.569
 in turin 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:22.369
 It is clearly a baby reds in his home marred by a police 

00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:24.090
 incident 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.090
 to see that there is a taste for the film 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.400
 then sees that they come again because their who fired the parking lot opposite 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.400
 state 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.780
 click here to pass on the costs we also make healthy meals 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.030
 quadruped know sinking him bothered this being smart of it 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.979
 feed professor anton legs ask where the course will be happy around 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:57.319
 lucky a healthy dog ​​known to the five brands before he tells that 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.810
 is the city we have if that has PVV of course that does not turn 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:03.059
 that is 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:06.969
 the turn strength potter yes 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.919
 not see the chance 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.159
 at the explosion 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.300
 he has a beer for the manufacturer 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.660
 the seller the manufacturer claims to sell more than his competitors 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.659
 competitor city and that is also his right and the manufacturer would like that too 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:21.289
 to do 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:22.560
 and in that process 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.180
 looking for manufacturer 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.520
 the borders 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.740
 There are also the limits when it comes to promoting its products 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.349
 and all the more beautiful the crisis 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:34.469
 the 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.969
 while they might not yet sound reliable, a title is the 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:41.289
 manufacturers is looking 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.219
 we have a strong preference for the same wrongdoing the issue 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:46.080
 fallen to earth 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.180
 tons of damen 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.990
 I actually don't know that's usually a matter of the 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.870
 fermentation but I think it has been firm in recent years, I still have it 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.550
 found a very nice plane later it turned out that 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.160
 are the directions for the manufacturer makes I still have the knowledge alone 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.589
 but based on chemical meeting 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:11.580
 the ns wants to do well you have to watch it 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.499
 with good digestion the party wants that so it gives 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:20.689
 nevertheless I think that there is a market value supply and demand to the crisis 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:24.319
 so apparently that is what both owners need 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.509
 to do something for that dog whose owner I think is doing something 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.629
 extras and now comes the question do you do something extra 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:34.650
 I think so 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:40.070
 this situation is in most cases not ser for my dog ​​is only it 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.949
 pretty good enough 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.750
 therefore try further 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.040
 peacock with first beef another advantage toppers 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.569
 According to the packaging, the dog is happy and healthy for life 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.289
 that's on it 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.899
 furthermore that does not want to prove 

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:00.899
 he wants to believe that was belga adv 

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:03.779
 belga tma 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:06.689
 herent 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:07.770
 according to kicker 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.360
 about us 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.819
 believe me for years 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:15.149
 that healthy and tasty meals are prepared 

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:17.669
 a delicious natural ingredients 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:19.310
 but what every room 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.590
 after years of research 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.860
 you just want to know things 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.059
 and who owns a church a separate smoking room 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.110
 every quarter 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.220
 r it is fine 

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:35.340
 that is difficult 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.690
 that strive to keep the animals it is an increasing number of strong portfolio 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.939
 and was last knowing per barrel that Sunday 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.710
 by playing then you can gather 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.180
 they were not surprised that much further than place in the roller coaster 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.180
 the question what can the record number of faces recognized 

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.930
 why 

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.930
 wouter vandenhaute nonsense 

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:05.740
 nielsen tuesday 

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.179
 arnhem 

00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:09.290
 a good idea 

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.629
 I can be picked up 

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:12.990
 as it should 

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.060
 that it gets less
