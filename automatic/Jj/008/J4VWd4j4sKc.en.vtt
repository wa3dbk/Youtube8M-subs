00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.830 
crocheted wigs and two packs from
smaller<00:02:47.709> half<00:02:48.130> wigs<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.610> here<00:02:52.150> are<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.660> two

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
smaller half wigs so here are the two

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.350 
smaller half wigs so here are the two
techniques<00:02:53.050> you<00:02:53.560> could<00:02:53.800> either<00:02:54.040> combined<00:02:54.880> or

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
techniques you could either combined or

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.340 
techniques you could either combined or
do<00:02:56.140> separately<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.940> first<00:02:58.180> one<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
do separately and the first one is the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.010 
do separately and the first one is the
loop<00:02:59.650> technique<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.910> where<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.810> can

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
loop technique this is where you can

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.710 
loop technique this is where you can
pull<00:03:02.350> your<00:03:02.650> loop<00:03:02.920> through<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.640> take<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.480> two

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
pull your loop through and take the two

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.229 
pull your loop through and take the two
ends<00:03:04.959> strands<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:05.830> are<00:03:05.950> left<00:03:06.220> out<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.760> pull

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
ends strands that are left out and pull

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.050 
ends strands that are left out and pull
them<00:03:07.450> through<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.650> loop<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.459> just<00:03:09.700> pull

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
them through the loop and you just pull

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.449 
them through the loop and you just pull
them<00:03:10.239> just<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.690> tighten<00:03:10.989> them<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:12.010> your

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
them just to tighten them to your

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.580 
them just to tighten them to your
desired<00:03:12.910> security<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:16.390> second<00:03:16.870> one<00:03:17.049> is<00:03:17.290> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
desired security the second one is the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.440 
desired security the second one is the
tie<00:03:17.860> knot<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:18.910> where<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.330> would

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
tie knot and this is where you would

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.420 
tie knot and this is where you would
pull<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.989> strand<00:03:20.320> of<00:03:20.440> hair<00:03:20.650> completely

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
pull the strand of hair completely

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.449 
pull the strand of hair completely
through<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.630> would<00:03:22.780> be<00:03:22.930> half<00:03:23.200> way<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.890> all

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
through and it would be half way and all

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.570 
through and it would be half way and all
you<00:03:24.610> need<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:24.940> do<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.450> tie<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.470> one<00:03:27.010> knot<00:03:27.280> or

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
you need to do is tie it in one knot or

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:38.400 
you need to do is tie it in one knot or
two<00:03:27.640> if<00:03:28.330> you<00:03:29.049> want<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.600> some<00:03:37.900> tips<00:03:38.080> that<00:03:38.320> I

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
two if you want to so some tips that I

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.940 
two if you want to so some tips that I
notice<00:03:38.860> that<00:03:39.130> may<00:03:39.459> help<00:03:40.470> grabbing<00:03:41.470> more<00:03:41.680> of

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
notice that may help grabbing more of

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.840 
notice that may help grabbing more of
the<00:03:42.160> net<00:03:42.519> makes<00:03:43.450> easy<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:44.170> pull<00:03:44.500> more<00:03:45.310> hair

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
the net makes easy to pull more hair

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.720 
the net makes easy to pull more hair
through<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:47.110> don't<00:03:47.320> try<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.650> just<00:03:47.980> grab<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.280> few

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
through so don't try to just grab a few

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.120 
through so don't try to just grab a few
strands<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.690> net<00:03:49.959> try<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.380> grab<00:03:50.920> about

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
strands of the net try to grab about

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.180 
strands of the net try to grab about
five<00:03:51.610> or<00:03:51.820> six<00:03:52.060> if<00:03:52.360> you<00:03:52.390> catch<00:03:53.260> my<00:03:53.530> drift<00:03:53.560> so

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
five or six if you catch my drift so

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.800 
five or six if you catch my drift so
that<00:03:54.340> it's<00:03:54.489> easier<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.000> pull<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.420> hair

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
that it's easier to pull the hair

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.810 
that it's easier to pull the hair
through<00:03:55.840> whether<00:03:56.799> you're<00:03:57.040> joining<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.459> loop

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
through whether you're joining the loop

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.800 
through whether you're joining the loop
or<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.120> knot<00:03:58.510> technique<00:04:03.000> second<00:04:04.000> stagger<00:04:04.510> the

your fullness at the top in the front of
the<00:04:26.680> crochet<00:04:26.979> tweak<00:04:28.919> now<00:04:29.919> once<00:04:30.190> you're<00:04:30.340> done

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
the crochet tweak now once you're done

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.430 
the crochet tweak now once you're done
you<00:04:30.759> will<00:04:30.970> notice<00:04:31.479> that<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.840> wigs<00:04:32.110> are

extremely full but they are very

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.010 
extremely full but they are very
lightweight<00:04:35.979> so<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:36.669> will<00:04:36.940> need<00:04:37.180> bobby<00:04:37.539> pins

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
lightweight so you will need bobby pins
