I don't really know too much about it at
this<00:02:53.400> point<00:02:53.640> but<00:02:53.760> I've<00:02:53.910> seen<00:02:54.180> some<00:02:54.420> pictures

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
this point but I've seen some pictures

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.270 
this point but I've seen some pictures
and<00:02:55.290> things<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.710> looks<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:56.190> gonna

be<00:02:56.340> one<00:02:56.550> giant<00:02:56.790> Ferris<00:02:57.240> wheel<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:58.230> guess

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
be one giant Ferris wheel and I guess

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.400 
be one giant Ferris wheel and I guess

the year it's it's pretty relaxed it's a

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.490 
the year it's it's pretty relaxed it's a
$5<00:03:28.860> for<00:03:29.010> single<00:03:29.310> ride<00:03:29.459> or<00:03:29.790> $12<00:03:30.630> for<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.930> 24-hour

$5 for single ride or $12 for a 24-hour
pass<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.430> think<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.760> they<00:03:32.910> have<00:03:33.120> deals<00:03:34.110> if

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
pass and I think that they have deals if

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.600 
pass and I think that they have deals if
you<00:03:34.380> want<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.620> stay<00:03:34.950> longer<00:03:35.160> than<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.430> with<00:03:35.490> a

you want to stay longer than that with a

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.670 
you want to stay longer than that with a
three-day<00:03:35.940> pass<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.510> kind<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.750> thing<00:03:36.930> so

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
three-day pass and that kind of thing so

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:47.560 
three-day pass and that kind of thing so
