forward and up and then we're going to
bring<00:06:33.639> the<00:06:33.819> little<00:06:34.499> antenna<00:06:35.499> up<00:06:51.210> now<00:06:52.210> we<00:06:52.270> have

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:52.539 
bring the little antenna up now we have

00:06:52.539 --> 00:07:02.580 
bring the little antenna up now we have
sonic<00:06:53.139> wave<00:06:53.289> oh<00:07:00.900> yes<00:07:01.900> for<00:07:02.110> this<00:07:02.229> one<00:07:02.439> you<00:07:02.500> can

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
sonic wave oh yes for this one you can

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:11.129 
sonic wave oh yes for this one you can
go<00:07:02.770> ahead<00:07:02.860> and<00:07:02.979> fold<00:07:03.310> this<00:07:03.460> down<00:07:03.520> I<00:07:10.020> love<00:07:11.020> the

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:11.139 
go ahead and fold this down I love the

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.159 
go ahead and fold this down I love the
way<00:07:11.229> shockwave<00:07:11.740> looks<00:07:12.009> he's<00:07:12.569> kind<00:07:13.569> of<00:07:13.629> freaky

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169 
way shockwave looks he's kind of freaky

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:19.800 
way shockwave looks he's kind of freaky
with<00:07:15.099> the<00:07:15.569> 1i<00:07:16.569> and<00:07:16.990> the<00:07:17.080> claws<00:07:17.379> and<00:07:18.629> would<00:07:19.629> have

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.810 
with the 1i and the claws and would have

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:27.179 
with the 1i and the claws and would have
not<00:07:22.860> now<00:07:23.860> for<00:07:24.099> him<00:07:24.279> you<00:07:24.699> want<00:07:24.879> to<00:07:24.939> take<00:07:25.089> this<00:07:26.189> go

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:27.189 
not now for him you want to take this go

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:29.100 
not now for him you want to take this go
ahead<00:07:27.400> and<00:07:27.490> pull<00:07:27.879> that<00:07:27.909> down<00:07:28.270> just<00:07:28.539> become<00:07:29.080> a

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110 
ahead and pull that down just become a

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.589 
ahead and pull that down just become a
gun<00:07:29.319> and<00:07:29.919> you<00:07:29.979> want<00:07:30.219> to<00:07:30.279> go<00:07:30.400> ahead<00:07:30.610> and<00:07:30.789> pull

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 
gun and you want to go ahead and pull

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:33.480 
gun and you want to go ahead and pull
these<00:07:31.750> down<00:07:31.860> add<00:07:32.860> a<00:07:32.919> little<00:07:33.039> bit<00:07:33.310> extra

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490 
these down add a little bit extra

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.990 
these down add a little bit extra
firepower<00:07:33.909> and<00:07:34.649> we'll<00:07:35.649> go<00:07:35.800> ahead<00:07:35.889> and<00:07:36.159> put<00:07:36.849> it

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 
firepower and we'll go ahead and put it

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.300 
firepower and we'll go ahead and put it
on<00:07:37.120> its<00:07:37.300> the<00:07:37.569> hole<00:07:38.529> it's<00:07:38.740> now<00:07:38.919> at<00:07:38.979> the<00:07:39.099> top<00:07:39.279> of

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.310 
on its the hole it's now at the top of

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.070 
on its the hole it's now at the top of
his<00:07:39.550> hand<00:07:40.800> and<00:07:42.000> I<00:07:43.000> don't<00:07:43.569> know<00:07:43.659> about<00:07:43.750> anybody

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 
his hand and I don't know about anybody

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.110 
his hand and I don't know about anybody
else's<00:07:44.469> the<00:07:44.649> mind<00:07:44.919> is<00:07:45.159> like<00:07:45.370> joints<00:07:45.879> are<00:07:45.969> kind

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 
else's the mind is like joints are kind

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.519 
else's the mind is like joints are kind
of<00:07:46.180> weak<00:07:46.330> so<00:07:46.509> I<00:07:46.569> gotta<00:07:46.750> use<00:07:46.930> gun<00:07:47.259> as<00:07:47.409> a<00:07:47.439> crutch

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:49.529 
of weak so I gotta use gun as a crutch

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:52.709 
of weak so I gotta use gun as a crutch
so<00:07:50.529> there<00:07:50.800> you<00:07:50.860> go<00:07:51.089> this<00:07:52.089> is<00:07:52.300> a<00:07:52.360> really<00:07:52.599> great

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:52.719 
so there you go this is a really great

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:54.240 
so there you go this is a really great

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.250 
figure if you happen to see them I

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.510 
figure if you happen to see them I
highly<00:07:54.669> recommend<00:07:54.789> you<00:07:55.060> pick<00:07:55.240> them<00:07:55.360> up<00:07:56.520> so

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 
highly recommend you pick them up so

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.839 
highly recommend you pick them up so
this<00:07:57.699> is<00:07:57.729> um<00:07:58.029> with<00:07:58.270> my<00:07:59.229> short<00:07:59.889> little<00:08:00.250> review

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:00.849 
this is um with my short little review

00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:02.939 
this is um with my short little review
which<00:08:01.089> I<00:08:01.270> hopefully<00:08:02.139> get<00:08:02.229> to<00:08:02.259> study<00:08:02.560> all<00:08:02.680> four

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:02.949 
which I hopefully get to study all four

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:06.240 
which I hopefully get to study all four
modes<00:08:03.159> of<00:08:03.460> shock<00:08:04.240> wave<00:08:04.830> you<00:08:05.830> guys<00:08:05.949> take<00:08:06.189> it

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:06.250 
modes of shock wave you guys take it

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.430 
modes of shock wave you guys take it
easy
