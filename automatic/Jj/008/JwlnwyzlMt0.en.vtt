00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
again it's not the worst either so there

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.370 
again it's not the worst either so there
you<00:02:18.970> have<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.840> do<00:02:19.930> have<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.110> few<00:02:20.230> other

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380

features you have the option to set the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.760 
features you have the option to set the
player<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.900> either<00:02:22.960> play<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.380> phrase<00:02:23.740> a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
fraid so if you'd like to have multiple

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.090 
fraid so if you'd like to have multiple
repetitions<00:02:28.030> there<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:28.960> do<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.440> you

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
repetitions there you can do that you

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.470 
repetitions there you can do that you
