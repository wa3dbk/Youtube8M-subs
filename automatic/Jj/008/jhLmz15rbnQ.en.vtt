superficial<00:01:41.700> Mirage<00:01:42.030> bronzer<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:44.100> what<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
superficial Mirage bronzer so what the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.760 
superficial Mirage bronzer so what the
packaging<00:01:44.520> looks<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.530> really

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
packaging looks like and it's really

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
packaging looks like and it's really
kind<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.159> cool<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.700> turns<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.420> spins

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
kind of cool because it turns and spins

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.539 
kind of cool because it turns and spins
and<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.829> when<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.009> saw<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> Bronze

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
and all that but when I saw the Bronze

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.590 
and all that but when I saw the Bronze
oh<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> thought<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.060> was<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.509> be

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
oh I thought it was just going to be

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.319 
oh I thought it was just going to be
like<00:01:51.840> any<00:01:52.110> other<00:01:52.200> bronzer<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.490> isn't<00:01:54.030> like

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
like any other bronzer and it isn't like

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.100 
like any other bronzer and it isn't like

have colors like this one which is
precious<00:05:00.790> which<00:05:01.790> I<00:05:02.120> mean<00:05:02.630> you<00:05:03.170> see<00:05:03.410> it<00:05:03.500> for

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
precious which I mean you see it for

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.980 
precious which I mean you see it for
what<00:05:03.710> it<00:05:03.830> is<00:05:03.950> it<00:05:04.310> doesn't<00:05:04.730> really<00:05:04.970> do<00:05:05.330> much<00:05:05.360> for

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
what it is it doesn't really do much for

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.380 
what it is it doesn't really do much for
you<00:05:06.320> can<00:05:07.220> see<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.460> swatch<00:05:07.760> so<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.060> can<00:05:08.180> barely

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
you can see the swatch so you can barely

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.080 
you can see the swatch so you can barely
see<00:05:08.660> this<00:05:08.780> watch<00:05:08.930> doesn't<00:05:09.440> do<00:05:10.430> much<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:10.910> it's

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
see this watch doesn't do much so it's

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.200 
see this watch doesn't do much so it's
not<00:05:11.270> really<00:05:11.330> going<00:05:11.780> to<00:05:11.870> stain<00:05:12.200> because<00:05:13.210> it's

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
not really going to stain because it's

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.910 
not really going to stain because it's
not<00:05:14.360> that<00:05:14.540> brighter<00:05:14.810> that<00:05:15.080> dark<00:05:15.380> so<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:15.740> makes

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
not that brighter that dark so it makes

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.940 
not that brighter that dark so it makes
sense<00:05:16.040> but<00:05:17.030> I<00:05:17.090> wish<00:05:17.420> their<00:05:17.870> color<00:05:18.350> line<00:05:18.680> was

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
sense but I wish their color line was

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.370 
sense but I wish their color line was
bigger<00:05:19.330> which<00:05:20.330> I<00:05:20.480> also<00:05:20.660> understand<00:05:21.200> because

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
bigger which I also understand because

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.350 
bigger which I also understand because
it's<00:05:21.530> difficult<00:05:21.920> to<00:05:22.250> make<00:05:22.400> colors<00:05:22.730> that<00:05:22.940> stain

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
it's difficult to make colors that stain

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.660 
it's difficult to make colors that stain
and<00:05:23.980> do<00:05:24.980> all<00:05:25.160> this<00:05:25.460> all<00:05:25.850> at<00:05:26.090> once<00:05:26.270> so<00:05:27.110> I<00:05:27.670> really

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
and do all this all at once so I really

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.480 
and do all this all at once so I really
like<00:05:28.910> them<00:05:29.120> but<00:05:29.330> I<00:05:29.390> think<00:05:29.750> you<00:05:29.930> have<00:05:30.230> to<00:05:30.530> think

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
like them but I think you have to think

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.090 
like them but I think you have to think
before<00:05:31.730> you<00:05:32.060> purchase<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.870> colors<00:05:33.260> i<00:05:33.470> think

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
before you purchase the colors i think

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.710 
before you purchase the colors i think
the<00:05:34.220> brighter<00:05:34.520> and<00:05:34.850> darker<00:05:35.060> ones<00:05:35.450> definitely

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
the brighter and darker ones definitely

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.050 
the brighter and darker ones definitely
