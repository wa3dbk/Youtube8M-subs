00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.380
 Welcome to the latest video of pressienst-fahrrad today 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.159
 in the category Trends and Techniques which did not reveal the paper 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:24.829
 For the first time, the European team autumn 2010 was dived by the manufacturer Buffalo MÃ¼ller 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.349
 modern after low-moos and billy the technology was presented 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.869
 allows now warned what the product of longest common 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.240
 we have not been back with that for 24 hours 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.370
 a so-called daytime running light now for the first time for the cyclist 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.810
 what does that mean 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.899
 once we have the normal headlight on the lamp 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.350
 Romain Guillaume operation 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.350
 and we have to second can the second light unit 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.060
 this lamp depicts the daytime running lights how does the whole thing work 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.150
 Daytime running light functions are in the founding of additional signal in the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.660
 Picture for it 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.550
 the driver does not notice this 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.370
 perceived much better in oncoming traffic 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.760
 the religious that does not send up and not only purposeful 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.760
 bundled on the street like the normal one 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.880
 Does not drive 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.940
 the system 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.240
 is also sensory takes on request at the request of the cyclist 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.790
 that means more around 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.970
 this does not automatically adjust to the wavy driving situation 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.750
 In practice, it looks like this 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.980
 I also hold sensor 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.070
 Driving for example calls or have that moment instantly bright 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.960
 full headlights so I see much better 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.410
 with full function with 40 and 60 Luxembourgs fight the Kulig to 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.550
 example 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.870
 and the daytime running lights would have dimmed that moment down 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.080
 I was out of the tunnel and then it is the other way around 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.079
 the daytime running lights become clear brighter the signals the PiS want clear 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.800
 Brighter 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 I'll be better again for the oncoming traffic 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.479
 and the headlights would be speaker for that moment 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.179
 as the system ultimately distributes 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.179
 do not keep his strength on the two 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.399
 the whole thing is very interesting for the countries higher number of 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:23.019
 fast the about 1 5 make classes 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.149
 because I believe 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.779
 many many motorists have not realized yet speak on the screen 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.529
 Cyclist the supposed cyclist comes to meet 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:37.149
 in itself a double he just looks like the cyclist from the front 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.349
 the driver will not realize too fast 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.539
 this cyclist could go with pace 40 o'clock from Fuzzi 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.539
 the fact that I drink, I think again a significant improvement 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.489
 safety 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.060
 absolutely
