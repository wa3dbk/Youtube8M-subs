probably<00:00:18.300> gonna<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.720> troubles<00:00:19.170> because

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
probably gonna have troubles because

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.450 
probably gonna have troubles because
you're<00:00:19.590> probably<00:00:19.680> have<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.070> redo<00:00:20.100> your

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460

character<00:00:20.760> because<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.000> don't<00:00:21.150> think<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.420> can

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
character because I don't think you can

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.750 
character because I don't think you can
switch<00:00:21.810> genders<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.650> either<00:00:22.830> way<00:00:23.039> let's<00:00:23.460> hop

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
switch genders but either way let's hop

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340 
switch genders but either way let's hop
right<00:00:23.789> into<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.750> now<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> first<00:00:25.199> thing<00:00:25.320> I

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
right into it so now the first thing I

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.689 
right into it so now the first thing I
want<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.710> guys<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> made<00:00:26.550> my

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
want to you guys is that I made my

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.700 
want to you guys is that I made my
character<00:00:26.760> brawling<00:00:27.599> obviously<00:00:28.380> because

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
character brawling obviously because

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.050 
character brawling obviously because
Clark<00:00:28.920> Kent<00:00:29.160> Braille<00:00:29.369> he<00:00:29.550> doesn't<00:00:29.820> use<00:00:29.910> any

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
Clark Kent Braille he doesn't use any

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.910 
Clark Kent Braille he doesn't use any
weapons<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.660> didn't<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.140> martial<00:00:31.500> arts<00:00:31.590> either

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
weapons I didn't do martial arts either

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.190 
weapons I didn't do martial arts either
because<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.489> that's<00:00:33.300> more<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.780> Superman

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
because like that's more like a Superman

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.479 
because like that's more like a Superman
thing<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.500> know<00:00:34.559> eventually<00:00:34.890> he<00:00:35.130> learns<00:00:35.370> like

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
thing I know eventually he learns like

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
thing I know eventually he learns like
Kryptonian<00:00:36.030> martial<00:00:36.390> arts<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.809> mean<00:00:36.989> I

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
Kryptonian martial arts but I mean I

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.020 
Kryptonian martial arts but I mean I
think<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:37.860> agree<00:00:37.980> super<00:00:38.460> punches<00:00:38.850> are

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
think we can all agree super punches are

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.360 
think we can all agree super punches are
Superman's<00:00:39.510> thing<00:00:39.870> because<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.010> Clark<00:00:41.309> Kent

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
Superman's thing because it's Clark Kent

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.280 
Superman's thing because it's Clark Kent
I<00:00:41.700> also<00:00:41.850> may<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.239> my<00:00:42.360> SuperSpeed<00:00:42.840> character

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
I also may have my SuperSpeed character

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.860 
I also may have my SuperSpeed character
not<00:00:43.500> flight<00:00:43.890> because<00:00:44.309> he<00:00:45.090> only<00:00:45.270> flies<00:00:45.539> really

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
not flight because he only flies really

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.600 
not flight because he only flies really
in<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> last<00:00:46.260> episode<00:00:46.710> or<00:00:46.890> when<00:00:47.070> he's<00:00:47.190> kal-el

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
in the last episode or when he's kal-el

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.279 
in the last episode or when he's kal-el
or<00:00:47.820> when<00:00:48.000> he's<00:00:48.120> sleeping<00:00:48.510> or<00:00:48.690> when<00:00:49.170> he's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
or when he's sleeping or when he's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.619 
or when he's sleeping or when he's
dancing<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:50.070> Lois<00:00:50.340> either<00:00:50.550> way<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.030> made<00:00:51.539> him

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
dancing with Lois either way I made him

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.660 
dancing with Lois either way I made him
SuperSpeed<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.739> see<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.980> even<00:00:53.550> got

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
SuperSpeed and as you can see I even got

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.729 
SuperSpeed and as you can see I even got
the<00:00:53.850> red-blue<00:00:54.329> blur<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.989> there<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.469> when<00:00:55.590> he

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the red-blue blur in there for when he

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.920 
the red-blue blur in there for when he
runs<00:00:55.920> which<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.610> really<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.660> for

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
runs which I really like and then for

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.470 
runs which I really like and then for
powers<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.649> he<00:00:59.039> he<00:00:59.399> has<00:00:59.489> Superman<00:00:59.940> powers<00:01:00.149> so

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
powers like he he has Superman powers so

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
powers like he he has Superman powers so
there<00:01:00.629> wasn't<00:01:01.170> really<00:01:01.320> much<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.710> could<00:01:01.859> do

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
there wasn't really much I could do

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.740 
there wasn't really much I could do
there<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.579> what<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> did<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.480> really

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
has mental powers so it's like a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.710

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
I believe when he just wears the red zip

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.879 
I believe when he just wears the red zip
up<00:05:21.460> with<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.789> red<00:05:22.060> s<00:05:22.270> on<00:05:22.510> it<00:05:22.690> aw<00:05:22.810> crap<00:05:23.320> oh<00:05:23.530> here

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
up with the red s on it aw crap oh here

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.520 
up with the red s on it aw crap oh here
we<00:05:23.979> go<00:05:24.010> their<00:05:24.490> urban<00:05:24.700> slick<00:05:25.360> now<00:05:25.960> this<00:05:26.349> one

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
doesn't really work as well because then

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.430
