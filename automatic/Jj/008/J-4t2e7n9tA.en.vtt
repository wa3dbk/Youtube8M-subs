think<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.540> television<00:03:31.230> has<00:03:31.380> been

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
think that television has been

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.680 
think that television has been
instrumental<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.640> changing<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:33.330> but<00:03:33.599> in

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
instrumental in changing that but in

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.690 
instrumental in changing that but in
feature<00:03:33.930> films<00:03:34.500> it's<00:03:34.739> it's<00:03:35.010> usually<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.670> know

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
feature films it's it's usually you know

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.630 
feature films it's it's usually you know
it's<00:03:35.819> still<00:03:36.209> it's<00:03:37.020> still<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.290> man's<00:03:37.560> game<00:03:37.830> he

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
it's still it's still a man's game he

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.670 
it's still it's still a man's game he
he's<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.360> older<00:03:39.780> guiding<00:03:40.140> has<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.380> younger

gal<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.060> think<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.720> gradually<00:03:43.470> starts<00:03:43.950> when

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
gal so I think it gradually starts when

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.670 
gal so I think it gradually starts when
you<00:03:44.459> when<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.700> get<00:03:44.819> 35<00:03:45.360> then<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.410> start

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
you when you get 35 then you start
