00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
think as well and that I think when you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.760 
think as well and that I think when you
make<00:03:03.120> an<00:03:03.270> account<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.810> really<00:03:04.320> really<00:03:04.530> fun

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
make an account it is really really fun

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.710 
make an account it is really really fun
to<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.190> like<00:03:05.430> have<00:03:05.880> everything<00:03:06.330> one<00:03:06.510> and

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
to just like have everything one and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.810 
to just like have everything one and
start<00:03:06.930> from<00:03:07.110> scratch<00:03:07.170> as<00:03:07.830> such<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.670> think

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
start from scratch as such and I think

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.800 
start from scratch as such and I think
that's<00:03:08.940> why<00:03:09.030> people<00:03:09.060> liked<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.720> know

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
that's why people liked it you know

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.270

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.130 
entertaining stuff so we figured we
would<00:03:49.019> do<00:03:49.200> this<00:03:49.560> because<00:03:50.720> people<00:03:51.720> wanted<00:03:51.989> to

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
would do this because people wanted to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.650 
would do this because people wanted to
see<00:03:52.350> us<00:03:52.380> boss<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.850> yeah<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.180> was<00:03:54.299> her<00:03:54.420> that

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
see us boss and yeah that was her that

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.960 
see us boss and yeah that was her that
was<00:03:54.750> her<00:03:54.780> overall<00:03:55.290> goal<00:03:55.530> for<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:55.980> year<00:03:56.519> comes

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
was her overall goal for the year comes

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.670 
was her overall goal for the year comes
to<00:03:57.209> kill<00:03:57.390> every<00:03:57.660> boss<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:58.049> runescape<00:03:58.500> which

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
to kill every boss in runescape which

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.289 
to kill every boss in runescape which
was<00:03:58.860> probably<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.370> little<00:03:59.850> bit<00:04:00.030> too<00:04:00.180> ambitious

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
was probably a little bit too ambitious

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.500 
was probably a little bit too ambitious
and<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.739> just<00:04:02.040> thought<00:04:02.130> for<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.549> series<00:04:02.760> and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and I just thought for this series and

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.880 
and I just thought for this series and
when<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.720> do<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.930> new<00:04:04.110> series<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.530> killing<00:04:04.829> the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
when I do a new series of killing the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:33.750 
when I do a new series of killing the
boss<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.459> remain<00:04:05.700> sister<00:04:06.060> had<00:04:06.989> milk<00:04:07.230> levels

me on the main accounts and stuff but

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.839 
me on the main accounts and stuff but
with<00:05:17.629> the<00:05:17.749> evolution<00:05:17.959> of<00:05:18.229> combat<00:05:18.589> as<00:05:19.039> well

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849

with the evolution of combat as well
we've<00:05:20.300> kind<00:05:20.779> of<00:05:20.899> realized<00:05:21.409> that<00:05:21.649> making<00:05:21.919> those

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:22.249 
we've kind of realized that making those

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:24.929 
we've kind of realized that making those
accounts<00:05:22.869> might<00:05:23.869> be<00:05:24.139> a<00:05:24.169> little<00:05:24.229> bit<00:05:24.679> pointless

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:24.939 
accounts might be a little bit pointless

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.769 
accounts might be a little bit pointless
because<00:05:27.249> if<00:05:28.249> you<00:05:28.369> guys<00:05:28.489> have<00:05:28.669> played<00:05:29.029> which<00:05:29.509> I

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
guys will know that defense kind of

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.879 
guys will know that defense kind of
hurts<00:05:42.319> you<00:05:42.619> now<00:05:43.689> so<00:05:44.689> if<00:05:44.839> we<00:05:44.990> were<00:05:45.079> to<00:05:45.139> have<00:05:45.349> 99

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
hurts you now so if we were to have 99

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.040 
hurts you now so if we were to have 99
range<00:05:46.099> 99<00:05:46.579> hit<00:05:46.879> points<00:05:47.209> we'd<00:05:47.360> be<00:05:47.539> like<00:05:47.749> level

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
range 99 hit points we'd be like level

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.589 
range 99 hit points we'd be like level
201<00:05:48.529> way<00:05:48.800> we'd<00:05:49.369> be<00:05:49.490> pretty<00:05:49.699> much<00:05:49.879> maxed<00:05:50.209> or

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
201 way we'd be pretty much maxed or

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.439 
201 way we'd be pretty much maxed or
something<00:05:50.929> yeah<00:05:51.289> I<00:05:51.679> mean<00:05:52.009> I<00:05:52.249> think<00:05:52.279> defense<00:05:53.209> is

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
something yeah I mean I think defense is

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.689 
something yeah I mean I think defense is
ghetto<00:05:53.629> pee<00:05:54.019> in<00:05:54.259> the<00:05:54.379> bay<00:05:54.499> are<00:05:54.709> going<00:05:55.159> to<00:05:55.339> defer

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
ghetto pee in the bay are going to defer

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.459 
ghetto pee in the bay are going to defer
the<00:05:55.879> bit<00:05:56.029> defense<00:05:56.329> abilities<00:05:56.779> are<00:05:56.990> really<00:05:57.289> I

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:57.469 
the bit defense abilities are really I

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:01.449 
the bit defense abilities are really I
mean<00:05:57.740> they're<00:05:57.919> kick<00:05:58.069> ass<00:05:58.509> yeah<00:05:59.509> and<00:05:59.839> so<00:06:00.649> we

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:43.939 
yeah if you thought maybe we could do

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:45.669

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:45.679 
the bosses in their real runescape and I

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:47.049 
the bosses in their real runescape and I
maybe<00:06:45.860> when<00:06:46.009> the<00:06:46.099> but<00:06:46.249> better<00:06:46.519> comes<00:06:46.729> out<00:06:46.939> and

00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:47.059 
maybe when the but better comes out and

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:49.149 
maybe when the but better comes out and
everything's<00:06:47.619> changed<00:06:48.619> with<00:06:48.769> that<00:06:48.919> we<00:06:49.039> could

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:49.159 
everything's changed with that we could

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.319 
everything's changed with that we could
try<00:06:49.309> doing<00:06:49.490> again<00:06:49.759> and<00:06:49.909> just<00:06:49.999> see<00:06:50.149> how<00:06:50.180> the

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:50.329 
try doing again and just see how the

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:52.370 
try doing again and just see how the
changes<00:06:50.719> that<00:06:50.779> were<00:06:51.019> quite<00:06:51.169> interesting

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
changes that were quite interesting

changes that were quite interesting
yeah<00:06:52.620> and<00:06:53.360> by<00:06:54.360> the<00:06:54.420> way<00:06:54.600> it<00:06:54.810> might<00:06:54.930> be<00:06:55.110> a<00:06:55.140> good

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
yeah and by the way it might be a good

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.370 
yeah and by the way it might be a good
idea<00:06:55.410> to<00:06:55.970> start<00:06:56.970> buying<00:06:57.210> some<00:06:57.540> birds<00:06:57.840> nests<00:06:58.140> as
