00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 We had started very well through 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.180
 dale jennings four very good 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.620
 possibilities 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.679
 I am already getting started 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.940
 get used to the goalkeepers against us 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.730
 stand out and so you have to say that 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.130
 He has blissful II in the game 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.810
 held 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.410
 Come on, we'll come out after the break 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.939
 go in guidance and by post so can 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.500
 It certainly before then flies me here 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.539
 wine from the place object entitled or 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.910
 does not play any role now we have 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.180
 Ten minutes needed to us 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.910
 Shake us again to sort and 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.059
 then we have our game that good 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.309
 went to the tenth big draw 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.710
 Compliments to the jennings of the front 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.140
 no ball was lost that was 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.820
 yes I already wrote off 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.789
 see many good things in him 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.160
 I believe he will soon be the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.510
 the knot will burst 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.500
 I cheered the team in 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.739
 halftime 0 0 is the best result 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.270
 what we can have now to that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.270
 time at bayern must come that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.210
 then the place reference or the yellow-red 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.729
 card us in the cards played no im 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.810
 eye I still have offensive fast 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.030
 can bring people 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.040
 and then she has already shot the game 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.509
 but we are proud that we 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.979
 bavaria in the lineup and after the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.909
 all play a hot fight 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.159
 Have been delivered 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.530
 yes, last but not least what easy 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.770
 annoying that we are looking for a very good one 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.619
 first half then not so 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.079
 reward us that we will be here then 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.700
 keep three points and that has me 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.100
 then in one situation or another 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.290
 a bit annoyed but there is nothing left 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.520
 hang and is already forgotten 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.619
 I think I have one here 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.479
 role model function and that I try on 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.000
 the place my whole experience with 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.170
 to involve and help the boys 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.909
 sometimes that kind of thing happens too 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.469
 but a little bit hurt 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.149
 the boys cope and will 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.770
 learn from it and it will continue to us 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.869
 can develop important good at ball 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.340
 There was a lot of movement in there 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.929
 It 's hard for us to get possession of the ball 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.360
 and if you then hit the ball 200 times 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.069
 way too fast away so it was good 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.200
 that you start with 0 0 at half past one 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.940
 are at and dig free kick goal and yes 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.830
 the yellow red card was for our game 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.200
 very important and then the compensation 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.470
 But I'm so happy 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.180
 Not 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.209
 I 'm already gonna gate it actually is 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.790
 it is enough leads for the chic but 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.410
 yes, we are also against a good one 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.079
 Team a team that too 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.319
 play forwards and we are also ten 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:40.739
 man are very young but okay it is 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.019
 no apology but yes yes we 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.599
 Had our chance we have to go to that 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.500
 work and then I think that's it 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.500
 everything will be fine
