which I still haven't found yet but I

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.240

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
did find the new ice a new kind of

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.040 
did find the new ice a new kind of
weirdly<00:00:29.550> because<00:00:30.029> these<00:00:30.330> are<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.570> l'oreal

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
weirdly because these are the l'oreal

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.400 
weirdly because these are the l'oreal
LeMat<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.859> low<00:00:32.340> lacquer<00:00:32.669> lip<00:00:33.270> pencils<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.989> I

LeMat and low lacquer lip pencils and I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.870 
LeMat and low lacquer lip pencils and I
guess<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.800> call<00:00:34.920> these<00:00:35.130> pencils<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.730> mean

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
guess you can call these pencils I mean

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.610 
guess you can call these pencils I mean
they're<00:00:36.000> kind<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.600> style<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.380> these

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
they're kind of in that style but these

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860 
they're kind of in that style but these
are<00:00:37.860> new<00:00:38.160> because<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.730> guess<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.480> ones<00:00:39.690> that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
fidgety but we might as well start I

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.090 
fidgety but we might as well start I
don't<00:01:43.140> know<00:01:43.200> which<00:01:43.380> one<00:01:43.560> should<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:43.829> start

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
don't know which one should we start

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.410 
don't know which one should we start
with<00:01:44.280> let's<00:01:44.579> start<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.909> lacquer<00:01:45.149> one

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
with let's start with a lacquer one

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.690 
with let's start with a lacquer one
because<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.840> seems<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:47.009> bit<00:01:47.340> less

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
because it seems to be a little bit less

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.550 
because it seems to be a little bit less
like<00:01:48.119> bright<00:01:48.479> maybe<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.990> don't<00:01:49.200> know<00:01:49.409> that's

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
like bright maybe I don't know that's

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.230 
like bright maybe I don't know that's
just<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:49.950> my<00:01:50.070> first<00:01:50.310> guesses<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.149> do

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
just one of my first guesses but I do

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.969 
just one of my first guesses but I do
like<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> packaging<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.770> is

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
like the packaging I think that this is

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.310 
like the packaging I think that this is
super<00:01:53.250> pretty<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.030> seems<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.509> super<00:01:54.930> super

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
super pretty and it seems a super super

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.380 
super pretty and it seems a super super
easy<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.680> travel<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.759> love<00:01:57.030> how<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
easy to travel with and I love how the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.149 
easy to travel with and I love how the
whole<00:01:57.810> packaging<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.590> color<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.890> it's

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
whole packaging is the color that it's

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.429 
whole packaging is the color that it's
supposed<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.759> as<00:02:00.390> far<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.810> sanitary

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
supposed to be as far as like sanitary

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.080 
supposed to be as far as like sanitary
things<00:02:01.770> there<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.670> tiny<00:02:02.909> little

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
things there is just a tiny little

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.940 
things there is just a tiny little
sticker<00:02:03.570> these<00:02:03.810> aren't<00:02:04.079> covered<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.560> total

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
sticker these aren't covered in total

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.160 
sticker these aren't covered in total
plastic<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.939> let<00:02:06.149> me<00:02:06.180> take<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.479> off<00:02:06.810> really

and<00:02:59.220> it<00:03:00.060> does<00:03:00.240> have<00:03:00.570> like<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> floral<00:03:01.530> scent<00:03:01.890> I

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
and it does have like a floral scent I

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.710 
and it does have like a floral scent I
really<00:03:02.340> like<00:03:02.460> that<00:03:02.640> that's<00:03:03.180> really<00:03:03.540> nice

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
really like that that's really nice

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.140 
really like that that's really nice
though<00:03:03.960> I<00:03:04.110> mean<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.410> color<00:03:04.710> I<00:03:05.130> don't<00:03:05.640> think<00:03:05.730> is

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
though I mean the color I don't think is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.750 
though I mean the color I don't think is
as<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.480> pink<00:03:07.320> as<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.190> coming<00:03:08.460> off<00:03:08.580> it's

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
as a pink as this is coming off it's

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.590 
as a pink as this is coming off it's
coming<00:03:09.030> off<00:03:09.150> almost<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.750> little<00:03:09.900> bit<00:03:10.200> more<00:03:10.710> I

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
coming off almost a little bit more I

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.940 
coming off almost a little bit more I
don't<00:03:12.600> know<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:12.810> there<00:03:12.900> some<00:03:13.080> coral<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.710> there

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
don't know is there some coral in there

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.400 
don't know is there some coral in there
it's<00:03:14.610> hard<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.940> tell<00:03:15.150> but<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.570> really<00:03:15.960> like<00:03:16.200> the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
it's hard to tell but I really like the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.260 
it's hard to tell but I really like the
way<00:03:16.440> this<00:03:16.770> acts<00:03:17.070> on<00:03:17.340> my<00:03:17.459> lips<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.820> goes<00:03:17.970> on<00:03:18.120> very

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
way this acts on my lips it goes on very

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.229 
way this acts on my lips it goes on very
nicely<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.959> feels<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:20.220> tiniest<00:03:20.670> bit

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
nicely it feels just the tiniest bit

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.050 
nicely it feels just the tiniest bit
tacky<00:03:21.560> like<00:03:22.560> just<00:03:22.980> very<00:03:23.430> slightly<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:23.910> I

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
tacky like just very slightly and I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.729 
tacky like just very slightly and I
don't<00:03:24.239> really<00:03:24.360> mind<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:24.900> because<00:03:25.380> maybe

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
don't really mind that because maybe

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.350 
don't really mind that because maybe
it'll<00:03:25.980> last<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.340> little<00:03:26.459> bit<00:03:26.550> longer<00:03:26.730> but

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
it'll last a little bit longer but

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.000 
it'll last a little bit longer but
because<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.020> angle<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.860> don't

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
because of the angle of this I don't

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.410 
because of the angle of this I don't
know<00:03:29.100> if<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.280> can<00:03:29.430> tell<00:03:29.610> it's<00:03:29.820> all<00:03:29.910> changed<00:03:30.330> a

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
know if you can tell it's all changed a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.580 
know if you can tell it's all changed a
little<00:03:30.570> bit<00:03:30.720> now<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:30.930> I've<00:03:31.170> actually<00:03:31.350> used

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
little bit now that I've actually used

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.070 
little bit now that I've actually used
it<00:03:32.010> but<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.580> has<00:03:32.760> almost<00:03:33.180> like<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.480> point<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.050> it

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
it but it has almost like a point to it

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.660 
it but it has almost like a point to it
which<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.380> found<00:03:34.560> really<00:03:34.770> helpful<00:03:35.130> around<00:03:35.459> the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
which I found really helpful around the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.490 
which I found really helpful around the
lift<00:03:35.880> line<00:03:36.060> as<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.570> compare<00:03:36.989> though<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.350> keep

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
lift line as I compare though and keep

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.199 
lift line as I compare though and keep
looking<00:03:37.830> at<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.489> definitely<00:03:39.180> a

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
looking at it this is definitely a

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.720 
looking at it this is definitely a
little<00:03:39.570> more<00:03:39.959> redder<00:03:40.350> or<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.770> little<00:03:41.430> bit<00:03:41.550> more

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
little more redder or a little bit more

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.630 
little more redder or a little bit more
berry<00:03:42.120> than<00:03:42.540> this<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.170> me<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:44.130> looks<00:03:44.190> like

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
berry than this to me this looks like

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.520 
berry than this to me this looks like
any<00:03:44.820> typical<00:03:45.120> fuchsia<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:45.989> I'm<00:03:46.080> used<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.410> and

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
any typical fuchsia that I'm used to and

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.900 
any typical fuchsia that I'm used to and
I<00:03:46.590> don't<00:03:46.800> feel<00:03:46.950> like<00:03:47.130> it's<00:03:47.280> coming<00:03:47.610> off<00:03:47.730> like

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
I don't feel like it's coming off like

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.940 
I don't feel like it's coming off like
that<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.510> lips<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:48.900> there<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
that on the lips but there is the

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.290 
that on the lips but there is the
overall<00:03:50.250> look<00:03:50.489> with<00:03:50.670> this<00:03:50.820> color<00:03:51.030> it's

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
overall look with this color it's

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.030 
overall look with this color it's
something<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.870> like<00:03:52.230> I'm<00:03:52.530> just<00:03:52.770> a<00:03:52.920> little

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
something I like I'm just a little

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.229 
something I like I'm just a little
thrown<00:03:53.370> off<00:03:53.489> because<00:03:53.670> i<00:03:53.820> feel<00:03:53.910> like<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
thrown off because i feel like the

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.850 
thrown off because i feel like the
colors<00:03:54.570> just<00:03:54.750> slightly<00:03:54.989> different<00:03:55.440> but<00:03:55.680> let's

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
colors just slightly different but let's

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.410 
colors just slightly different but let's
go<00:03:56.010> ahead<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.190> move<00:03:56.520> on<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.820> mat<00:03:57.030> version

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
go ahead and move on to the mat version

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.910 
go ahead and move on to the mat version
so<00:03:57.720> i<00:03:57.780> don't<00:03:57.959> think<00:03:58.140> they<00:03:58.290> stay<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.739> lips

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
so i don't think they stay in the lips

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.680 
so i don't think they stay in the lips
very<00:03:59.100> much<00:03:59.340> either<00:03:59.580> i<00:03:59.730> mean<00:04:00.030> my<00:04:00.180> lips<00:04:00.420> are<00:04:00.600> you

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
very much either i mean my lips are you

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.090 
very much either i mean my lips are you
looking<00:04:01.050> a<00:04:01.110> little<00:04:01.260> bit<00:04:01.440> more<00:04:01.620> red<00:04:01.800> but<00:04:01.950> that's

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
looking a little bit more red but that's

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.590 
looking a little bit more red but that's
probably<00:04:02.340> because<00:04:02.550> i<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:02.910> wipe<00:04:03.209> them<00:04:03.450> off

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
probably because i just wipe them off

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.000 
probably because i just wipe them off
with<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.780> wife<00:04:04.020> but<00:04:04.350> they<00:04:04.470> did<00:04:04.590> notice<00:04:04.890> an

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
with a wife but they did notice an

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.560 
with a wife but they did notice an
easier<00:04:05.340> way<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.520> open<00:04:05.730> this<00:04:05.910> before<00:04:06.420> i<00:04:06.450> was

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
easier way to open this before i was

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.060 
easier way to open this before i was
like<00:04:06.750> trying<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.050> peel<00:04:07.290> off<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.650> sticker<00:04:07.860> but

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
like trying to peel off the sticker but

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.740 
like trying to peel off the sticker but
if<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.250> just<00:04:08.459> twist<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:09.030> lightly<00:04:09.420> it

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
if you just twist this lightly it

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.270 
if you just twist this lightly it
actually<00:04:10.110> breaks<00:04:10.380> at<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.800> point<00:04:11.040> where<00:04:11.190> the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
actually breaks at the point where the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.710 
actually breaks at the point where the
lid<00:04:11.430> comes<00:04:11.640> off<00:04:11.850> so<00:04:12.090> that's<00:04:12.239> really<00:04:12.390> helpful

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
lid comes off so that's really helpful

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.590 
lid comes off so that's really helpful
but<00:04:13.320> this<00:04:13.500> one<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:14.040> was<00:04:14.310> really<00:04:14.640> caught<00:04:15.120> by<00:04:15.360> this

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
but this one I was really caught by this

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.030 
but this one I was really caught by this
one<00:04:15.810> when<00:04:15.959> i<00:04:15.989> looked<00:04:16.230> at<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.380> display<00:04:16.769> this<00:04:16.890> is

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
one when i looked at the display this is

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.530 
one when i looked at the display this is
probably<00:04:17.250> my<00:04:17.459> favorite<00:04:17.820> one<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.090> saw<00:04:18.330> of

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
probably my favorite one that I saw of

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.150 
probably my favorite one that I saw of
the<00:04:18.750> whole<00:04:18.930> line<00:04:19.200> because<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.709> almost<00:04:19.859> has

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
the whole line because it almost has

more creamy as anvil lacquer wanda the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.350 
more creamy as anvil lacquer wanda the
lacquer<00:04:38.050> one<00:04:38.349> was<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:38.860> little<00:04:38.979> bit<00:04:39.460> sticky<00:04:39.819> and

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
lacquer one was a little bit sticky and

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.850 
lacquer one was a little bit sticky and
i<00:04:40.449> don't<00:04:40.629> mean<00:04:40.689> sticking<00:04:41.080> a<00:04:41.319> bad<00:04:41.469> thing<00:04:41.710> but

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
i don't mean sticking a bad thing but

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.140 
i don't mean sticking a bad thing but
comparing<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.400> two<00:04:42.550> of<00:04:42.699> this<00:04:42.789> one<00:04:42.969> was

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
comparing the two of this one was

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.300 
comparing the two of this one was
definitely<00:04:43.659> creamier<00:04:44.169> this<00:04:44.379> formula<00:04:44.919> but<00:04:45.219> you

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
definitely creamier this formula but you

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.619 
definitely creamier this formula but you
can't<00:04:45.520> tell<00:04:45.699> that<00:04:45.879> there<00:04:46.030> is<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.210> little<00:04:46.509> bit

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
can't tell that there is a little bit

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.390 
can't tell that there is a little bit
more<00:04:46.750> purple<00:04:47.139> in<00:04:47.259> that<00:04:47.439> one<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:47.979> let's<00:04:48.189> go

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
more purple in that one so let's go

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.159 
more purple in that one so let's go
ahead<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.669> get<00:04:48.879> it<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.240> lips<00:04:49.419> this<00:04:49.930> is

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
ahead and get it on the lips this is

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.309 
ahead and get it on the lips this is
like<00:04:50.409> velvet<00:04:50.889> like<00:04:51.490> seriously<00:04:52.090> when<00:04:52.930> I<00:04:52.960> put<00:04:53.229> it

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
like velvet like seriously when I put it

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.260 
like velvet like seriously when I put it
on<00:04:53.349> my<00:04:53.409> hand<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.860> like<00:04:53.889> glided<00:04:54.580> across<00:04:54.699> my<00:04:55.090> leg

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
on my hand it like glided across my leg

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.730 
on my hand it like glided across my leg
whoa<00:04:55.449> like<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:55.840> wasn't<00:04:55.990> expecting<00:04:56.259> that<00:04:56.500> at<00:04:56.680> all

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
whoa like I wasn't expecting that at all

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.529 
whoa like I wasn't expecting that at all
so<00:04:57.159> far<00:04:57.189> I<00:04:57.400> think<00:04:57.610> I'm<00:04:57.909> liking<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:58.300> one<00:04:58.509> a

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
so far I think I'm liking this one a

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.420 
so far I think I'm liking this one a
little<00:04:58.659> better<00:04:58.810> so<00:04:59.349> there<00:04:59.620> is<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.099> mat

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
little better so there is the mat

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.790 
little better so there is the mat
version<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.360> think<00:05:01.780> looking<00:05:02.110> at<00:05:02.319> them<00:05:02.530> as

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
version and I think looking at them as

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.580 
version and I think looking at them as
far<00:05:03.340> as<00:05:03.460> packaging<00:05:04.090> goes<00:05:04.360> yeah<00:05:05.080> it's<00:05:05.349> just

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
far as packaging goes yeah it's just

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.350 
far as packaging goes yeah it's just
totally<00:05:06.039> like<00:05:06.280> I<00:05:06.490> don't<00:05:06.610> know<00:05:06.789> not<00:05:07.090> on<00:05:07.240> the

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
totally like I don't know not on the

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.330 
totally like I don't know not on the
mark<00:05:07.599> completely<00:05:07.900> like<00:05:08.560> I<00:05:08.680> feel<00:05:08.860> like<00:05:08.949> this<00:05:09.190> is

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
mark completely like I feel like this is

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.369 
mark completely like I feel like this is
a<00:05:09.370> bit<00:05:09.639> deeper<00:05:10.150> let<00:05:10.629> me<00:05:10.719> look<00:05:10.870> in<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.110> mirror
