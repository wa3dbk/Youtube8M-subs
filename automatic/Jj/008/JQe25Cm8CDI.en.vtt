00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello and welcome to delicious 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.990
 In everyday life my name is Thomas Berger 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.559
 and today it's about the perfect one 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.300
 cut while the meat sausage 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.030
 needs for the perfect cut so 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.310
 which tools and which I use 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.619
 These tools then cut like that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.869
 I the meat right 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.730
 most important, it is a good knife 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.789
 To have the knife must be good in the hand 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.619
 that means a balance must be 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.090
 it must prevail about the same way 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.160
 be heavy as it has to be good in the back 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.989
 hand and of course it has to be 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.180
 be sharp the knife because only with 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.890
 a blunt knife is cut 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.590
 and hurt the dumb dance around 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.920
 and already it happens, sometimes it slides down 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.360
 and the finger is injured we have 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.210
 now a nice piece of meat that is 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.360
 Depended on the butcher and you see 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.539
 here already the meat father runs in 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.129
 this direction and tender meat now 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.859
 to get already with the cutting technique 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.870
 from the very first step is to 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.859
 important this phase as short as possible 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.780
 to keep 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.270
 long phase you have to imagine how 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.250
 a chewing gum it is around on them without 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.130
 At the end you can have the best meat 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.460
 always on long fibers around always biting 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.970
 against the fiber then the fibers remain 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.970
 nice and short 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.690
 and now I make for them a 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.860
 theater that means the meat stays 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:32.260
 pipe and does not end up in the pan 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.470
 For that we have to be like the classic one 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.590
 theater does not go through the meat 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.500
 to turn a meat grinder but very 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.070
 cut very small in very very small 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.610
 cube 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.000
 that has the advantage that it does not like 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.130
 but it will only be mince 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.640
 keeps its own structure and up 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.640
 reserves 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:13.580
 comedy by dux had the same 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:26.960
 season with a little salt and salt 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:28.520
 pepper short not by some people 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.080
 give it lemon is now 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.580
 I would not do that because the lemon 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.480
 the garden meat and it turns white 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.989
 then we ask for a nice one now 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.989
 cam 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.870
 and give our about on the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.489
 preparations 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.739
 that 's it for today delicious in everyday life 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.120
 is looking forward to the next one 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.000
 when they turn on 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.959
 until then have fun cooking 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.959
 bye servus
