00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.609
 let's start this point again 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.529
 jealousy 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.200
 as you can see they are all the name of 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.250
 all your mounts from the first se 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.970
 mount the first pin a pair the last 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.560
 pin a couple and then two pairs sometimes up 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.090
 each pin would briefly be 2 4 6 8 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.920
 10 12 13 16 18 20 22 are 24 vaio in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.890
 all with so much counting even the odd ones 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.160
 this and third fund we do the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.250
 point jealousy of you two that I did 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.860
 astrid point and says as if the 20 points 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.530
 background work diagonally and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.969
 this one works equally always in 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.469
 diagonal here we go to put the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.610
 pins 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:59.760
 let's put the first pin in here 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:04.110
 and here it is the second pin of water is 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.619
 third spiked the water now we put the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:19.280
 pays in our couple of the first bobbin 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:19.280
 in the 1st 2a in the year 21 I already told you 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:33.100
 1 and 2 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.630
 now get to work first triangle 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.270
 as you see heaven some corner of 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.400
 march water this stops here not 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:46.280
 we form with this pair and this pair 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:49.310
 we do it so I wanted to tell you this is it 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.040
 which is always done in the same way with le 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.740
 twisted is the half point 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.380
 it is always practically always done 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.770
 that is always diagonally then if it is 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.410
 I always get twisted towards 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.320
 left cross we have mine 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.450
 win that will cross with 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.580
 perpendicular and with what goes to 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.260
 diagonal then we do one with 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.150
 twists reasons never understand where 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.390
 if at the beginning then they must stay in the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.820
 when you wanted to put yours 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.280
 copies life cycle as much as possible 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.880
 because if you don't pull it is not good 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.049
 now however see that I here christ of 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.049
 then work again 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.980
 look now we have that pair that don't 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.660
 we could work remembered 12 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.459
 but we are working to figure 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.299
 see I'm walking diagonally man 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.920
 hand an exchange of birds we have 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.290
 also I did this as I am going to say 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:59.019
 yet always this comfortable diagonal 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.019
 I call this pin here it is 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:12.400
 pin in the middle here here then 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:15.140
 let us take the right equal but as you 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.660
 you have not or have not done it not 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.760
 you know other times I don't know 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.470
 who will buy this DVD but why 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.380
 committing from my couples so see 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:30.200
 how they are placed and how they are arranged 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.239
 here is that I'm all ordinary small 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.300
 so working parents then had to 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.390
 his business 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.890
 and to put it well you have to work on it 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.170
 above for the text 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.560
 here and put the pair in place with the pair 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.930
 the other is also very pair 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.820
 here is how much I am putting verbal now 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.740
 then we continue to do these 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:58.800
 paolucci triangular square should us 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:04.080
 get paid but decided to see how they are 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.610
 made all 123456 hexagons of the little ones 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.280
 hexagons that divide into ortÃ¬ 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.950
 rectangles in small triangles 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:22.200
 let's say rectangles to god you are e 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:28.530
 I leave now we are here at the bordeaux here we are 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:31.290
 here so 12 scanned the couples now at 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.870
 advanced work went ahead and I'll do it for you 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.320
 see how you come with some pins 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.320
 injustice
