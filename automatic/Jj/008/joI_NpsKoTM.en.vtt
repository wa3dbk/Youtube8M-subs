although the poem neon she does play a
pretty<00:00:48.809> aggressive<00:00:48.930> line<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.770> these<00:00:49.860> are

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
pretty aggressive line so these are

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
is trying to develop and fight for the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.160 
is trying to develop and fight for the
center<00:00:54.890> now<00:00:55.890> Bishop<00:00:56.219> g5<00:00:56.610> sona<00:00:57.570> pony<00:00:57.750> actually

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
center now Bishop g5 sona pony actually
declares<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.859> bit<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> aggression<00:00:59.550> in

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789

declares a little bit of aggression in
age<00:00:59.940> 4<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.520> eh<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.969> move<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
age 4 so I like eh for move like the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.580 
age 4 so I like eh for move like the
idea<00:01:04.339> just<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.119> trying<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.780> play<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
idea just you know trying to play for a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.250 
idea just you know trying to play for a
direct<00:01:07.890> attack<00:01:07.979> as<00:01:08.460> much<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.820> possible<00:01:09.260> but

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
direct attack as much as possible but

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.710 
direct attack as much as possible but
the<00:01:10.439> position<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.159> kind<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.119> mean<00:01:12.390> white

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the position is kind of I mean white

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.020 
the position is kind of I mean white
doesn't<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.920> much<00:01:14.250> much<00:01:17.030> much

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
doesn't really have like much much much

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.240 
doesn't really have like much much much
potential<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.689> an<00:01:18.930> attack<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.100> this

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
potential for an attack in this in this

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.520 
potential for an attack in this in this
position<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.850> h4<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.479> really<00:01:21.780> more<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.110> kind

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
position so h4 is really more just kind

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.399 
position so h4 is really more just kind
of<00:01:22.560> anchoring<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> bishop<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.909> g5<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.720> now

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
of anchoring the bishop on on g5 and now

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.160 
of anchoring the bishop on on g5 and now
very<00:01:25.619> accurate<00:01:26.220> move<00:01:26.430> from<00:01:27.150> drills<00:01:27.630> dose<00:01:27.869> key

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
very accurate move from drills dose key

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.730 
very accurate move from drills dose key
he<00:01:28.380> plays<00:01:28.650> Queen<00:01:29.130> a5<00:01:29.490> check<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.509> first<00:01:30.900> he's

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
he plays Queen a5 check so first he's

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.740 
he plays Queen a5 check so first he's
getting<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> pin<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:33.390> no<00:01:33.600> longer

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
getting out of the pin that's no longer

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.859 
getting out of the pin that's no longer
problem<00:01:34.640> second<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.700> all<00:01:36.049> he's<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> pawn

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
problem second of all he's I'm a to pawn

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
problem second of all he's I'm a to pawn
so<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.259> whites<00:01:40.470> played<00:01:40.710> age<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.159> he<00:01:41.250> doesn't

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
so if whites played age for he doesn't

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.090 
so if whites played age for he doesn't
want<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.640> Castle<00:01:42.000> kingside<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.689> now<00:01:43.439> by<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
want to Castle kingside and now by the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
Queen eyeing a two it's going to be

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.969

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
difficult for white to Castle Queen side

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.280

the only moved to stop the mate pretty
much<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:22.120> now<00:02:23.120> h5<00:02:23.799> sona<00:02:24.799> probably<00:02:25.069> out<00:02:25.159> you're

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
much and now h5 sona probably out you're

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.039 
much and now h5 sona probably out you're
doing<00:02:25.519> anything<00:02:25.879> you<00:02:26.150> can<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.659> open<00:02:27.049> the<00:02:27.140> h5

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
doing anything you can to open the h5

after<00:02:30.049> Bishop<00:02:30.230> takes<00:02:30.560> pawn<00:02:31.090> takes<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.420> now<00:02:32.720> f5

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
after Bishop takes pawn takes and now f5

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.119 
after Bishop takes pawn takes and now f5
definitely<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.519> best<00:02:34.700> move<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.150> position

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
definitely the best move in the position

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.360 
definitely the best move in the position
maybe<00:02:37.689> maybe<00:02:38.689> I<00:02:38.840> think<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.769> nipun<00:02:40.129> we

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
maybe maybe I think this is nipun we

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.220 
maybe maybe I think this is nipun we
actually<00:02:40.640> miscalculated<00:02:41.420> in<00:02:41.540> his<00:02:41.900> attack

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
actually miscalculated in his attack

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.099 
actually miscalculated in his attack
here<00:02:42.470> because<00:02:42.799> after<00:02:43.040> check<00:02:43.480> King<00:02:44.480> up<00:02:44.659> and<00:02:44.900> now

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
here because after check King up and now

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.259 
here because after check King up and now
Bishop<00:02:45.650> takes<00:02:45.859> if<00:02:46.099> black<00:02:46.609> does<00:02:46.849> play<00:02:47.030> Knight

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
Bishop takes if black does play Knight

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.180 
Bishop takes if black does play Knight
takes<00:02:48.310> then<00:02:49.310> yes<00:02:49.340> why<00:02:50.090> why<00:02:50.659> would<00:02:50.720> have<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.620> very

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
takes then yes why why would have a very

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.789 
takes then yes why why would have a very
strong<00:02:52.670> attack<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.500> don't<00:02:54.500> know<00:02:54.590> if<00:02:54.680> it's

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
strong attack I don't know if it's

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.119 
strong attack I don't know if it's
winning<00:02:55.659> but<00:02:56.659> it's<00:02:56.870> it's<00:02:57.409> certainly<00:02:57.590> very

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
winning but it's it's certainly very

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.199 
winning but it's it's certainly very
strong<00:02:59.709> so<00:03:00.709> that's<00:03:01.430> one<00:03:01.730> thing<00:03:01.849> to<00:03:01.940> keep<00:03:02.060> them

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
strong so that's one thing to keep them

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.149 
strong so that's one thing to keep them
on<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.450> as<00:03:02.629> rook<00:03:02.900> h8<00:03:03.319> would<00:03:03.500> fall<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:04.060> 27<00:03:06.159> but

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
on it as rook h8 would fall to 27 but

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.599 
on it as rook h8 would fall to 27 but
instead<00:03:08.000> droves<00:03:08.629> dose<00:03:08.930> key<00:03:09.260> play<00:03:09.829> King<00:03:10.370> takes

king is perfectly safe and whites king
is<00:04:07.310> actually<00:04:07.579> more<00:04:07.760> trouble<00:04:08.120> than<00:04:08.180> blacks<00:04:08.680> so

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
is actually more trouble than blacks so

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.559 
is actually more trouble than blacks so
in<00:04:09.919> light<00:04:10.310> of<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:10.489> variation<00:04:11.120> after<00:04:11.419> Bishop
