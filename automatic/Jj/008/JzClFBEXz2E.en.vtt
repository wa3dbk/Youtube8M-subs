00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.930
 Let's make a little video here and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.670
 Let's get out of here as a tool and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.089
 But you got a place to put 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:18.420
 the rate will also there is gear here 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.590
 responsible for the change of four per 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.590
 two to four by four 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:32.550
 this gear in this position 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:36.000
 she is in another she has another that if she 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.710
 I swirled chuck O will not draw for 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.250
 neither of them hides the tip of the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.829
 striated at the front is the tip of the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.390
 striking the wheel because of the lack of 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.610
 interference in which we have people 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.219
 can catch with the hand that ottawa 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.590
 gear wheel alone there or 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.989
 opinion, secure by my finger here and 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.750
 this Sunday is not running on 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.699
 opinion of the rear here than the one 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.180
 is in the bottom court of the video 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:08.729
 Now, if we put it straight, it's over. 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.960
 to set up the team in another team that has 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.180
 change to the direct is not neutral 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.140
 if that 's when we'll use reduced 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.270
 to someone Chinese in using attraction 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.270
 only one winch and has this option 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.479
 there okay so what we are 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.900
 We see people running here. 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.700
 is the car part is what comes and comes to 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.200
 transmission of drive housing 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.710
 house comes from a gearing that splits 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.590
 hence the box without talking here is direct and the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.290
 No rotation for our relationship I do not know 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.380
 Which one do you want to consult but is it direct? 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:51.590
 and here are four by four case 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.990
 then we are now reduced to people 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.600
 was returned to neutral and beauty that 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.890
 came back in another edict is running here 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.170
 nothing in the right wheel 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.799
 We 're going to cut down on people. 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.740
 takes a larger engine speed and plays 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.869
 by a larger rotation crown with the crown 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:15.019
 small with color or smaller 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:18.980
 there you can see that now they have reduced 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:23.900
 here I will hold against 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:27.530
 I'm going to soil my field but anyway 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.370
 here option 4 by 2 4 by 4 neutral 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:36.640
 Now we're going to increase this. 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:41.720
 is reduced and direct and indirect reduced 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.780
 transmitting a larger gear 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.700
 ie rotation here in lower quotation 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:53.930
 here the difference of the ac metal neutral 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.560
 direct change from 42 to 44 is done 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.430
 here o 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.769
 in this glove or now now cup 2 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.120
 She'll just slide in here. 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.019
 the reel why when people 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.060
 turn the rear flash here some 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.859
 and exchanging event snapped 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.690
 Sometimes the front man takes a little 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:18.950
 may be even normal because of the 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.859
 The interference is absent in my 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.370
 case by case my jeep has a 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:29.600
 considerable radial clearance here 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.600
 here inside here is a buchinha 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:38.590
 inside the shaft and cast and not 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.590
 fits the shoulder of this piece here 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:50.780
 here's the front flash that rice 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:56.810
 rice work rolling door 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:04:01.630
 supported this way you change 4 to 21 4 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.630
 by 4 to 2 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.390
 Now I've been wondering is what the 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:14.349
 any reason you can not walk with the 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:17.560
 car in the room by two direct 42 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.359
 neither direct nor trace is four by four 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.540
 direct route because you can not 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.970
 pass 40 is imagined because we 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.160
 you can see here the gear was milled 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.940
 I'll try to light a flashlight that stops 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.810
 can show this 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.340
 it was nice, gear was milled 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.820
 then it is a sign that the whole already 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.590
 can give problem once to bad luck ifr 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.600
 nor gear in now is working 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.030
 standard that I will not even wiggled in 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.270
 beginning of October just to check it out 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:53.790
 There's something worse here and here. 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.990
 We have a little kick of the 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.200
 The whiner's opinion that they say that 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.820
 weeping do not know how the name of that 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.590
 but the main thing I would go back to here 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.530
 I think one of the reasons why people 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.160
 can not ride with it at high speed 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:13.600
 that is why there is a greater effort 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.430
 for a greater effort for two axes and 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.539
 the contact area being small 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:23.220
 so it's explained contact is only 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:26.970
 then surpluses in milling 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:31.060
 so that's why we should not 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:33.880
 play four by four and not turn the 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:38.350
 To say that was very interesting. 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:42.580
 so I will not go I will avoid using 4 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.580
 for 2 direct now only 42 reduced 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.610
 because the contact area here with 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.350
 the gear in the case is much bigger 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.510
 we see the displacement of even the 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:57.430
 even greater displacement here 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:59.680
 This part here is the part here or 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:04.860
 be reduced 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:07.090
 this part here the reduced it has 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.080
 always compare with the area 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.900
 he has these teeth here that this 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.470
 new phase change here 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:25.150
 after about they have been there ten times 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:33.789
 area area giving 18 times the area of the 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:36.370
 here is this pawn of itaÃ­ the reason 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:40.449
 why you should avoid walking with the 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:43.360
 vehicle at high speeds and four per 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.759
 also due to the weakening of this 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.130
 aquino set that in the case is the support 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:51.840
 or have no bearing will have the support of 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:55.270
 then maybe one of the reasons 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.970
 has support even right winding only 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.509
 on one side because here what is in this 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.509
 part here 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:07.900
 as we increase in the 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:09.729
 diameter tire or tire right weight 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.659
 screen is going to force all this 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:15.220
 set 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:19.570
 I think for a layman who never had 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:22.110
 disassembled a reduced rate 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:24.250
 kandy ney future mechanical engineer 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.990
 so I think it's interesting to know 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.380
 these details also details 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:33.880
 constructive it is all well and good that this is a 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:35.710
 very archaic system nor do you have today 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.830
 in today's market you have much 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:41.130
 a much more advanced form and said 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:45.610
 do that this situation 

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:48.430
 finally is nothing like in Tokyo to 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:55.060
 learn to like the gears here 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:59.580
 It's cool, there's not much wheel. 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.580
 long time without without problem 

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:06.560
 that's it, that's ok
