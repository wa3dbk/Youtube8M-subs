00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.750 
you can see the tips are actually still
growing<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.470> down<00:02:25.470> at<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> base<00:02:25.950> it's

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
growing and down at the base it's

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.140 
growing and down at the base it's
encrusted<00:02:27.150> on<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.080> actual<00:02:28.440> frag<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.640> I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
encrusted on to the actual frag so I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150 
encrusted on to the actual frag so I
mean<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.810> isn't<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> wild-caught<00:02:31.560> specimen

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
mean this isn't a wild-caught specimen

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.080 
mean this isn't a wild-caught specimen
this<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.520> something<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.000> was<00:02:33.330> aquacultured

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
this is something that was aquacultured

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.000 
this is something that was aquacultured
sustainably<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.840> what<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.530> want<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.770> look<00:02:37.830> for

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
sustainably so what you want to look for

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.990 
sustainably so what you want to look for
in<00:02:38.160> things<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.459> this

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
in things like this

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.240 
in things like this
is<00:02:39.060> are<00:02:39.510> they<00:02:39.720> healed<00:02:40.050> on<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.500> what<00:02:40.650> they<00:02:40.830> were

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
is are they healed on to what they were

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.240 
is are they healed on to what they were
attached<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.760> if<00:02:42.720> they<00:02:42.930> are<00:02:43.080> then<00:02:43.500> they're

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
attached to if they are then they're

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.059 
attached to if they are then they're
obviously<00:02:44.700> growing<00:02:45.060> doing<00:02:45.660> well<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.140> it's

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
obviously growing doing well and it's

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.890 
obviously growing doing well and it's
probably<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> safe<00:02:47.730> bet<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:48.780> good<00:02:49.530> way<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.709> go
