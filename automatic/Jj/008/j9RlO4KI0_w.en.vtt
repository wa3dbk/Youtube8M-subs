00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.080
 hello to everyone who watches me wish 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.670
 have a good start or end of the day 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:25.859
 whichever when you look 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 this video and start want to tell you 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.189
 about the game on creative thinking which 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.250
 can be called 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.230
 equality this game is quite fun and 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.170
 can be used to warm up the group 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.140
 people and so do not put off a long box 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.540
 move immediately to the rules it is desirable that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.239
 you had a colorful piece of paper 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.800
 red and green on one piece of paper on 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.620
 red you write simple 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.750
 noun word for example apples on 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.320
 another piece of paper you write some 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.020
 abstract concept for example socialism 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.059
 after that all papers are dumped into 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.329
 one big pile in the center of the circle 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.330
 everyone is sitting in a circle 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.540
 then each pulls two pieces of paper 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.060
 different color if you got a piece of paper 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.909
 with your own words nothing wrong 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.560
 now you need to prove the most basic 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.659
 what two words you got 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.439
 written on different pieces of paper and that is 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.710
 same thing 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.770
 for example the apple and socialism are one and 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.100
 the same reason why apple has 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.880
 yourself a lot of bones it's like 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.570
 people are cohesive 1 idea pulp something in 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.780
 that kind of 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.630
 further video will be an example playing live 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.880
 this way each participant explain 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.509
 why words on different pieces of paper are one thing 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.090
 and also 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.280
 if at the moment you have no papers 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.200
 different colors you can write for everything 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.179
 on some pieces of paper and then just 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.250
 decompose the numbers into 3 bunches and each 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.560
 a person will draft one piece of paper with 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.929
 different to teach a little advice is better not 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.850
 speak all the rules immediately declare them 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.310
 gradually hike how will 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.289
 participants perform why because 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.240
 they will know in advance what they need 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.399
 do and will think through how 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.590
 way you can say certain words 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.590
 and now as promised examples 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.409
 May 2 body cooking this understanding and such 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:38.730
 understanding ax is the same why 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.329
 same most scientific understanding is something 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.730
 very firm and clear and clear 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:49.739
 this hormone is very clear solid clear 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:56.459
 the subject of his understanding when I understood 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:58.560
 and let me don't you understand something 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:07.620
 can too
