00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.069
 very good to all kids welcome 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.069
 one more time to my channel tyc sp 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.809
 julius I bring a new video I think it's 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.250
 the first video that you're good I think no 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.160
 It is effectively the first video that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.609
 I go to see advance commenting warfare 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.680
 what I think and those things since in 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.109
 this channel because I have not uploaded anything 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.640
 zilch of warfare apace and good 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.710
 because today I come to do a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.109
 comparative of good things and 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.420
 bad things that this new call of 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.050
 duty that will arrive very soon 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.630
 both for play 3 and team 360 and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.000
 for the new generation and well then 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.040
 said this tell you what are you seeing from 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.770
 background a little game that has taken me 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.989
 this morning in raid concretely 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.539
 playing with the scorpion and well then 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.180
 let's let's start with things 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.670
 good what this call of duty has 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.520
 new and the first is that there will be two 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.940
 types of game is worth a type of game 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.070
 will be with exo suit that is that kind of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.079
 costume that 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.640
 that if I 'm not wrong since there is a 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.170
 little lost in this issue of the new 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.270
 call of duty with that I'm not wrong 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.690
 you can have the layer that 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.390
 invisibility and have your jump and other 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.700
 another type of game another list of 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.770
 game can be if next other players 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.860
 Well, I 'm wearing a suit because obviously 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.080
 you are left without the cloak that invisibility and 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.759
 without the super jump that's one thing the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.130
 true that it has been very, very, very 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.380
 well that they have done this that for the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.630
 people who want to continue with the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.850
 essence of call of duty of all life 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.160
 in no call of duty has there been super 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.399
 jump unless obviously there 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.380
 hacker but there has not been exo suit 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.789
 that and then for the people who want 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.550
 continue you have 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.009
 having that essence, they can play 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.909
 the list of games without made suit and 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.090
 for people who 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.460
 that wants to play then innovating a little 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.640
 they have the game with that suit and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.280
 is a very good fact that has made 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.770
 made the breakthrough creator which 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.929
 missing and we're going to move on to the second 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.509
 good feature that is has innovated 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.910
 with a lot of good because they have innovated 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.690
 quite even it gives a little bit of fear 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.680
 that for the innovated so much futuristic 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.299
 so futuristic game because the truth is 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.720
 that is scary and everything that loses 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:28.010
 essence of call of duty is that each 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.680
 time it seems the more they look more like 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.500
 Well, more tourists, as you already know , 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.659
 white was quite futuristic but it has not 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.810
 still lost the essence but is that 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:41.480
 he appears warfare this is very yes 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.959
 futuristic according to the trailers and that but 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.819
 let's hope it's not like us and 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.519
 give us 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.049
 Well, a good surprise and well, that's 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.430
 they have innovated a lot and we are going to 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.980
 move to the third and last 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.010
 good feature is that we can 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.319
 combine the gusts worth if I do not 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.530
 wrong we can put different solids 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.000
 or different things to the same streak is worth 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.329
 solar since the truth is that it is a 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.760
 very good thing that the truth is that 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.829
 Well, at the time they changed a little bit 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.569
 the things of the gusts and all that and 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.540
 well basically this is now we are going to 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.919
 move on to the bad characteristics that 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.629
 It's finishing me and someone is going to you 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.700
 give them a little bit of haste let's be able to 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.439
 play on the bad features do not 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.199
 there's cinema mode worth kids that's a 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.689
 of the bad characteristics that for 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.040
 you maybe do not care 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:34.189
 no cinema mode but for the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.019
 youtubers like in my case because we can 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.469
 previous to cinema mode because if we take 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.569
 a very good game and we are not 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.419
 recording then we have to fuck and 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.250
 we were without temper and well it is 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.599
 that to you maybe affects us 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.879
 a lot but to us because the truth is 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:53.380
 that gives us a lot of anger let's hope that 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.390
 they put it in a next dlc 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.250
 well let's move on and the last 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.640
 bad characteristic that is so unique 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.140
 that I could find and what I think 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.270
 It is that you can get to lose already 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.310
 call of duty as I said before to 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.080
 innovate as many as you can lose 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.850
 the essence of call of duty and good 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.650
 guys, this is the comparison of 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.290
 the good things and the bad things of 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.910
 call of duty advanced warfare you know 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.760
 that if you liked it you can leave a 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.890
 comment and a like in this video and 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.450
 leave me then in a comment see what 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.340
 it's the good and bad things you think 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.660
 who has this call of duty said this 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.640
 I'm going to say goodbye I'm going to go 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.640
 saying goodbye and until next time
