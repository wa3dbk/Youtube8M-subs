00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello viewers followers of my 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.600
 channel with you this 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.700
 and today would like to talk about recently 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.809
 transmitted by hi-tech of all time peoples 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.920
 heroes of might &amp; magic 3 hd versions 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.839
 thought about the merits of the original 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.580
 grimoire speaks endlessly while 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.630
 new release is exposed 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.119
 harsh criticism 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.300
 these negative reviews have firm 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.430
 soil existence first namely 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.179
 high system requirements 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.090
 you will need a minimum and gave core2 with 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.050
 and a frequency of 2.4 gigahertz or 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.870
 similar md frequency of 2010 gigahertz 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.700
 for a comfortable game also 3 gigabytes 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.120
 ram and spiders gb 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.039
 video memory which is quite a lot since 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.340
 don't forget that we have everything 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.350
 only 3 heroes which are the original versions 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.520
 by modern standards does not require 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.199
 practically nothing second absence 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.390
 random card generator 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.390
 this is a very big disadvantage which 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.110
 worth the game on the net there is no game 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.600
 offers 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.920
 only 40 pathetic cards that already 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.570
 thoroughly studied by players in the third 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.970
 lack of supplement support to have with 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.100
 they lock mates as justified 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.729
 developers source code on the blade 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.520
 armageddon 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.700
 and others in the house were lost however 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.840
 most likely if the West lives juice 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.780
 all this quickly there are fourths 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.229
 lack of support for steam workshop and 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.810
 fifth extremely overpriced 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.710
 however despite all the flaws 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.259
 reprints from the game has and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.750
 the positive side namely the appearance 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.610
 in the appstore and play market 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.590
 I personally will be happy to play 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.409
 third heroes tablet 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.830
 I have been waiting for this for a long time 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.400
 appearances are great joy 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.080
 as well as on the ios and android platforms 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.530
 there is no worthy competitor third 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.990
 the hero is a good analog game 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.360
 heroes made almost a carbon copy 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.560
 called Poltina mts but still 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.960
 3 heroes he does not reach the conclusion 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.850
 I would like to note that a long time ago 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.970
 An amateur mod turns out 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.090
 third heroes in hd allowing 5 up 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.580
 up to 4k resolution of everything to study and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.410
 megabyte save all game features 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.020
 adds a convenient max for control 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.410
 creatures allows you to skip that very 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.810
 play the melody before the battle 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.190
 is it worth buying heroes of sword and magic 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.510
 hd resolution 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:44.160
 my answer is no you can see it 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:47.040
 comparison of characters in hd graphics leaders 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.560
 graphics with amateur ode and in 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.690
 standard graphics and this is all for today 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.790
