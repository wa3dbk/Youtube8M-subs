00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.250
 hallok people and welcome 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.730
 to the first unboxing video on this 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.650
 channel 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.279
 it's about a new graphics card and 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.820
 Although the geforce gtx 670 from the 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:32.119
 company palette with the jetstream design 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:34.790
 the whole thing looks so out of the box at the beginning 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.130
 offers us a small flap the us 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.090
 see the map and on the 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.180
 there are a few on the right side 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:48.640
 dates 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:51.800
 You can read it now 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.010
 What you see is yes 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.930
 turbo technology and the dual fan 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.000
 technology that is just in 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:04.549
 opposite directions run that 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.590
 you see here and there again 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.820
 the construction of the card with the double 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.310
 cool the cooling ribs and then the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.039
 card on the bottom left you can still see 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.700
 times the three screen connection 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.920
 stays blue as it should be with me 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.920
 and that means we do that now 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.840
 cards up 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.880
 I could not wait and got it 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.729
 itself already opened but only to 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.450
 to stop the other short one 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:39.550
 have gone 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.820
 the box is to be done to us now 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.880
 shortly afterwards what we see when we see the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:56.560
 open box that is here and that 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:57.940
 the card in plastic box jo has to 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.750
 map we'll get to that I do that 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:06.460
 times to the side which is to find all of us 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:16.750
 under this cardboard cover and a dvi 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:21.240
 to vga adapter and a vga to new hdmi 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.240
 vga dvi vga 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.650
 the next one here is the driver cd the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.090
 you should definitely not use - 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.530
 without a card generally buys from everyone 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.470
 You should just click on the graphics card 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.820
 side of the manufacturer or just go 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.330
 on the side of amd or as well 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.230
 always this whole red card there 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.470
 processed or whatever I know 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.790
 or just on the nvidia side and you 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.470
 the latest drivers for this 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.900
 Download graphics card generation 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.510
 That should be your system automatically 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.989
 recognize and there is still a small one 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:00.430
 stickers you can see here 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:06.520
 so that's it with the accessories and now 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:09.370
 two card in itself that's the card the 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.470
 Fans are lit with LEDs 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.410
 Being really cool means being transparent 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.330
 You can also go through that too 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.980
 see if there are now dust cool ribs 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.769
 it is or not so I think so 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.269
 quite useful the part in the middle 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.250
 Look at all the pictures on the internet 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.709
 a little bit more golden than it is 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.989
 Actually that's why he is bronze 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.050
 colors and up here you can see again 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.870
 that pellet logo if you recognize that 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.420
 could and only leaves a small sticker 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.660
 on it so sticker dingsbums that one 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.609
 because not scratched so the map of 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.440
 behind 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.630
 you see a relatively short pcb in here 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.440
 black 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:54.800
 lynas brown gray pcb or something like that 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:59.360
 mixture of brown black moment here 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.840
 above it is black and from these pins 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.680
 for the double for the double 6 pin 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.360
 Connecting the led pcb becomes brown 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.520
 is relatively short as it is with the 670 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.040
 Of course, there is also longer 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.680
 pcbs with registered cards just for 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.160
 for example by the gigabyte here 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.160
 has only such a plastic adapter that 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.570
 just the cooling fins are protected and 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.760
 the air well through there 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.210
 can escape 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.780
 two sli fingers for the fourfold sli 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.680
 business 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:37.850
 These are the connections once 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:43.040
 hdmi port a displayport and two dvi 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:46.030
 ports and the dvi and in dvi d the 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.419
 is the digital and that is the normal one 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:53.150
 dvd with this cross live in the middle 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.419
 There is more to the graphics card 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.950
 not to say thank you 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.360
 I've looked at I hope that 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.650
 Do you like it if you have any questions? 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.760
 Of course you are welcome to ask 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.800
 I would like to help you write me the 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.340
 comments as found thank you to 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.340
 next time
