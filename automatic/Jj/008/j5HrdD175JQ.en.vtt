00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.179 
photography wise for the most part one
of<00:01:40.719> the<00:01:40.810> biggest<00:01:41.110> reasons<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.500> chose<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:42.009> do

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
of the biggest reasons I chose to do

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.789 
of the biggest reasons I chose to do
that<00:01:42.219> the<00:01:43.000> next<00:01:43.270> thing<00:01:43.450> it's<00:01:43.630> very<00:01:43.719> light<00:01:44.170> it's

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
that the next thing it's very light it's

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.190 
that the next thing it's very light it's
very<00:01:45.039> very<00:01:45.250> small<00:01:45.759> and<00:01:45.909> compact<00:01:46.090> folding<00:01:46.780> it's

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
very very small and compact folding it's

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.560 
very very small and compact folding it's
about<00:01:47.350> 28<00:01:47.770> inches<00:01:47.799> but<00:01:48.700> expand<00:01:49.180> it<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.509> I'll

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
about 28 inches but expand it and I'll

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.779 
about 28 inches but expand it and I'll
show<00:01:49.719> you<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:49.930> video<00:01:50.020> now<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.549> expanded<00:01:51.549> its

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
show you that video now to expanded its

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.510 
show you that video now to expanded its
taller<00:01:52.149> than<00:01:52.450> me<00:01:52.689> it's<00:01:52.960> about<00:01:53.079> 70<00:01:53.890> inches<00:01:54.340> in

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
taller than me it's about 70 inches in

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.789 
taller than me it's about 70 inches in
height<00:01:54.759> so<00:01:55.390> it's<00:01:55.570> got<00:01:55.719> some<00:01:55.750> height<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.469> it<00:01:56.500> so

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
height so it's got some height to it so

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.099 
height so it's got some height to it so
I<00:01:56.829> really<00:01:57.100> wanted<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.430> twist<00:01:57.789> legs<00:01:58.240> because

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
I really wanted the twist legs because

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.959 
I really wanted the twist legs because
they<00:01:59.289> are<00:01:59.469> more<00:01:59.740> reliable<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.549> they<00:02:00.729> have<00:02:00.939> a

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
they are more reliable and they have a

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.990 
they are more reliable and they have a
an<00:02:01.329> easier<00:02:01.810> time<00:02:02.049> of<00:02:02.320> not<00:02:02.560> wearing<00:02:03.250> out<00:02:03.460> like

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
an easier time of not wearing out like

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.849 
an easier time of not wearing out like
my<00:02:04.149> clip<00:02:04.420> ones<00:02:04.630> I've<00:02:04.840> had<00:02:04.990> this<00:02:05.109> Manfrotto<00:02:05.619> for

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
my clip ones I've had this Manfrotto for

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.310 
my clip ones I've had this Manfrotto for
three<00:02:06.100> almost<00:02:06.250> four<00:02:06.399> years<00:02:06.820> now<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:08.050> legs

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
three almost four years now and the legs

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.889 
three almost four years now and the legs
are<00:02:08.560> already<00:02:08.800> really<00:02:09.340> starting<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:09.970> not<00:02:10.509> catch

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
are already really starting to not catch

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.020 
are already really starting to not catch
in<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.470> slip<00:02:12.070> and<00:02:12.250> everything<00:02:12.580> like<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.760> and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
in and slip and everything like that and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.670 
in and slip and everything like that and
I<00:02:13.060> can't<00:02:13.330> have<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:13.630> on<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.020> shoot<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.320> that's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
I can't have that on a shoot so that's

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.440 
I can't have that on a shoot so that's
why<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:14.920> wanted<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.280> upgrade<00:02:15.460> so<00:02:15.880> bad<00:02:16.150> and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
why I wanted to upgrade so bad and

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.670 
why I wanted to upgrade so bad and
that's<00:02:16.840> why<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.110> did<00:02:17.380> it

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
that's why I did it

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.190 
that's why I did it
so<00:02:17.980> price<00:02:18.370> point

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so price point

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.860 
so price point
portability<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.670> wingspan<00:02:21.090> as<00:02:21.540> you'll<00:02:21.690> see

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
portability the wingspan as you'll see

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.270 
portability the wingspan as you'll see
even<00:02:22.110> though<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.440> sounds<00:02:22.590> standing<00:02:23.010> next<00:02:23.160> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
even though it sounds standing next to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.250 
even though it sounds standing next to
it<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.819> doesn't<00:02:24.150> take<00:02:24.330> up<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.720> whole<00:02:24.989> lot<00:02:25.230> of

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
it it doesn't take up a whole lot of

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.960 
it it doesn't take up a whole lot of
space<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.190> one<00:02:26.370> thing<00:02:26.550> with<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> lot<00:02:26.910> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
space the one thing with a lot of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.570 
space the one thing with a lot of
tripods<00:02:27.540> now<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.959> they<00:02:28.140> will<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:28.590> huge<00:02:29.190> wing

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
tripods now is they will have huge wing

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.280 
tripods now is they will have huge wing
spans<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.450> know<00:02:30.569> taller

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290

you know wider than your shoulder is
wider<00:02:33.480> than<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.930> feet<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.260> your<00:02:34.349> body<00:02:34.560> spread

out and everything like that so be

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.780 
out and everything like that so be
careful<00:02:37.140> about<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.349> when<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.739> buy<00:02:37.950> them<00:02:38.250> do

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
careful about that when you buy them do

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.070 
careful about that when you buy them do
it<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.060> way<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.660> Doral<00:02:39.930> has<00:02:40.050> a

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
it that way but this in Doral has a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.339 
it that way but this in Doral has a
great<00:02:41.000> wingspan<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.599> know<00:02:42.720> when<00:02:43.050> it's<00:02:43.200> put<00:02:43.290> on

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
great wingspan you know when it's put on

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
the floor and everything like that so

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.850 
the floor and everything like that so
it's<00:02:45.330> that's<00:02:45.630> another<00:02:45.989> reason<00:02:46.230> why<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.500> wanted

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
it's that's another reason why I wanted

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.949

to go down route and even just the

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.780 
to go down route and even just the
maneuvering<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> head<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.400> extend<00:02:50.700> the

maneuvering of the head to extend the

middle column to get more height to get

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.170 
middle column to get more height to get
less<00:02:52.590> height<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.099> just<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.310> simple<00:02:53.640> twist<00:02:53.940> and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
less height it's just a simple twist and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.770 
less height it's just a simple twist and
it's<00:02:54.299> easy
