00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.420
 for this video lesson we come back with the 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.590
 more classic and more transcendental grunge 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.140
 from the hand of Nirvana 7 maryuris theme 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.880
 based on the relationship he had with 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:24.570
 your email a music or california 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.210
 speaks of the disease of love and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.070
 way of nirvana the standard tuning 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.170
 let's start with 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.310
 Nirvana rhythm is worth four chords 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.310
 power chords 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.210
 you have seen it very simple a 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.090
 progression two hits back t2 of the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.300
 rope 6 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.790
 in the air to make the transition to 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.320
 fret 3 of steam to 5 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.610
 three hits 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.710
 three strokes fret 2 of agreement 5 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.990
 and rope 5th law of storage rooms of the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.870
 rope 4 this you have already seen that it is very 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.720
 of nirvana four-stroke four ritz 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.520
 chords of power and alternating chords 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.520
 Six string or rope 5 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.540
 and that scares us 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.700
 so I always say put your 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.470
 accent to put your style with this 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.470
 kind of subjects because they leave a lot 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.300
 ok for the next part we make a 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.590
 progression we start on the 3rd fret of 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.590
 the rope 3 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.750
 6 vice ubierna valero makes a couple of 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.490
 times in the both two varies is very 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.350
 simple 'the weird with the times but 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.810
 I recommend that when being treated again 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.729
 it was about nirvana you know what was your 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.800
 how to play very personal worship 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.960
 well that you have the same thing 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.960
 then you should try to put 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.420
 a bit of dirt a little bit of style 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.420
 OK 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.690
 and look for noises you do not have where you are 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.870
 there are the tortures you can lengthen a 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.730
 little more 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.390
 do other techniques do a little bit of 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.950
 noise that is very large 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.950
 for the next river 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.960
 Have you seen 7th fret agreement 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.960
 power of the rope 6 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.620
 You see how the strumming is 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.200
 but that is two strokes from below 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.010
 vary what a forgiveness is to someone if 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.490
 so this topic is borrowed 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.380
 then those couple very cool theme very 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.300
 different because you can alternate 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.710
 different parts of the subject with 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.710
 different ways of touching it 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.240
 will go here we would go to the 5th fret 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.240
 of power of the rope 5 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.550
 you have seen 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.210
 in the heights it may seem 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.630
 slightly different may seem 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.380
 like what to let go with the 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.380
 slow music 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.530
 because that which makes it so you can 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.530
 do you 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.540
 I like the end of this part of the 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.819
 River 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.709
 four times in a row the fret 5 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.250
 of the agreement to 5 ok I would not do it then to 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.250
 I like to do 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.860
 5 air 5 air 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.319
 you have seen is that it lends itself very much 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.319
 for a change 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.980
 you know, I always put the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.770
 original and guitar pro files 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.440
 so you have it all complete not you 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.150
 you can leave after this riff 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.750
 that we have seen there is nothing left of the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.959
 topic 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.959
 one last read is very simple 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.009
 several seen is a regression progression 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:35.379
 we started on the fret two strings 6 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:41.649
 two hits to 3 or 4 3 we skipped 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:45.869
 the 5 to the 5 are 3 blows 6 765 3 blows 

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:45.869
 you see that is a regression progression 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.320
 as you see very simple and you take everything 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.330
 it fits and you make a little ball and 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.270
 we check that the topic 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.670
 of nirvana I hope you have served 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.010
 that you have liked nothing to practice and 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.780
 health that is needed in these times 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.370
 so difficult since we do not have pasta 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.370
 at least we have salt
