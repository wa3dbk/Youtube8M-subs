00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.250

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.030
 coming to the best I have left I think that 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.739
 five days for me to arrive 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.929

 This is a free playstation with the 4th 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.950
 and well, here is the command that 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.869
 has done the boy since you have the 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.270

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.470
 I command whatever and return today to open it 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.759
 and we should know that it's good, I'm going to 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.259
 have to cut because the camera is 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.000
 holds Gothic around here is this epic 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.539
 team and as I'm seeing has some 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.700
 rombos a read- and objective 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.890
 of diamonds with hexagons except they are not 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.649
 savings if it looks good because this 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.479
 focuses like a fucking shit and the 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.399
 screen that I have to see what I'm 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.940
 recording looks like the gt or is it a 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:44.020
 combo a fucking combo has also 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.479
 the blank tips these buttons on 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.120
 white but the buttons are I think I 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.390
 he said he put them on three precision 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.400
 because of 4 there were no colors yet and if 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.440
 I would have to paint the paint 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.590
 were these these the controllers and the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.440
 arrows are from play 3 also as I am 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.300
 seeing of the 64's are bigger but 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.850
 me he has since seen the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.170
 holes there has put us play 3 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.420
 because there were no whites then I 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.030
 I wanted with white buttons and if not 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.000
 were cited because it would look bad to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.510
 end you would end up watching it would end 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.550
 seeing the black and it would be a store 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.090
 basically 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.740
 I also wanted to put the buttons you're 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.090
 Well, that was blank, but since there was not 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.910
 studies and that could not be changed 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.340

 I see well, but the camera does not 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.640
