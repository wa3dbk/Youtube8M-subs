00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
truck it gets loaded from that point on

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:09.999 
truck it gets loaded from that point on
to<00:01:08.359> the<00:01:08.390> truck<00:01:08.749> and<00:01:09.020> it<00:01:09.289> gets<00:01:09.469> hooked<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.890> the

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
to the truck and it gets hooked to the

to the truck and it gets hooked to the
dairy<00:01:10.249> to<00:01:10.549> where<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.909> dairy<00:01:11.179> at<00:01:11.359> that<00:01:11.570> time

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
dairy to where the dairy at that time

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.950 
dairy to where the dairy at that time
they<00:01:12.200> pasteurize<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.549> they<00:01:13.759> put<00:01:14.359> it<00:01:14.509> in

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
they pasteurize it and they put it in

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.529 
they pasteurize it and they put it in
gallons<00:01:15.560> or<00:01:15.920> they<00:01:16.159> possibly<00:01:16.670> make<00:01:16.759> cheese<00:01:17.270> out

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
gallons or they possibly make cheese out

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.179 
gallons or they possibly make cheese out
of<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.929> or<00:01:18.200> they<00:01:18.409> send<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:18.920> different

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
of it or they send it to different

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.230 
of it or they send it to different
plants<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:19.939> make<00:01:20.270> also<00:01:20.719> ice<00:01:20.929> cream<00:01:21.319> yogurt

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
plants that make also ice cream yogurt

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.550 
plants that make also ice cream yogurt
different<00:01:23.240> things<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:23.749> there's<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.289> long

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
different things so there's a long

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.330 
different things so there's a long
process<00:01:25.630> from<00:01:26.630> where<00:01:27.350> milk<00:01:27.920> comes<00:01:28.009> from

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
process from where milk comes from

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.370 
process from where milk comes from
because<00:01:28.969> it<00:01:29.090> all<00:01:29.210> starts<00:01:29.600> really<00:01:29.990> in<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
because it all starts really in the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.879 
because it all starts really in the
field<00:01:30.759> with<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:31.939> crops<00:01:32.210> it<00:01:32.990> goes<00:01:33.170> into<00:01:33.469> the

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:33.889 
field with the crops it goes into the

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:37.480 
field with the crops it goes into the
the<00:01:33.999> ration<00:01:34.999> that<00:01:35.590> ration<00:01:36.590> goes<00:01:36.770> into<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.310> cow

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
the ration that ration goes into the cow

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.270 
the ration that ration goes into the cow
the<00:01:38.179> cow<00:01:38.389> makes<00:01:38.659> milk<00:01:38.929> out<00:01:39.170> of<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:39.469> and<00:01:39.979> then

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
the cow makes milk out of it and then

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.459 
the cow makes milk out of it and then
she<00:01:40.310> goes<00:01:40.789> into<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.270> parlour<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.689> we<00:01:42.049> harvest

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
she goes into the parlour and we harvest

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.949 
she goes into the parlour and we harvest

it proper nutrition for a cow is
