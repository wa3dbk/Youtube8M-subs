the<00:01:31.350> men's<00:01:31.530> pool<00:01:31.860> was<00:01:32.520> very<00:01:32.790> strong<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.690> really

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the men's pool was very strong I really

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.500 
the men's pool was very strong I really
think<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.280> depth<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.909> most<00:01:36.120> important

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
think the depth is the most important

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.800 
think the depth is the most important
part<00:01:36.690> especially<00:01:37.620> Big<00:01:38.130> Ten's<00:01:38.430> too<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.450> mean

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
part especially Big Ten's too but I mean

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.100 
part especially Big Ten's too but I mean
NCS<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.799> need<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.220> depth<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:42.120> win<00:01:42.330> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
NCS you really need the depth to win and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.649 
NCS you really need the depth to win and
I<00:01:43.409> mean<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.920> mean<00:01:44.190> having<00:01:44.490> champions<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.420> good

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
I mean I mean having champions is a good

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.780 
I mean I mean having champions is a good
thing<00:01:45.870> but<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:47.040> long<00:01:47.190> as<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.580> depth

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
thing but as long as you have the depth

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.399 
thing but as long as you have the depth
you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.090> still<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.960> there

a<00:05:28.500> while<00:05:28.650> just<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.070> get<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.730> spirit<00:05:30.240> generated

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
a while just to get the spirit generated

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.050 
a while just to get the spirit generated
between<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.500> two<00:05:31.590> teams<00:05:31.950> and<00:05:32.430> we<00:05:32.610> have<00:05:32.730> five

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
between the two teams and we have five

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.380

encouraging<00:05:36.390> both<00:05:36.510> teams<00:05:36.810> so<00:05:37.020> no<00:05:37.230> one<00:05:37.380> has

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
encouraging both teams so no one has

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.270 
encouraging both teams so no one has
lost<00:05:37.710> anything

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
lost anything

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.740 
lost anything
we've<00:05:38.550> all<00:05:38.760> gained<00:05:39.060> in<00:05:39.240> this<00:05:39.360> in<00:05:39.600> this
