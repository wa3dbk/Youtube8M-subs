and a larger size measuring cup and I've
used<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.680> before<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> my<00:00:51.149> measurements<00:00:51.750> may

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
used this before so my measurements may

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.029 
used this before so my measurements may
not<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.199> exact<00:00:54.199> but<00:00:55.199> I'm<00:00:55.350> starting<00:00:55.739> off<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:55.890> a

not be exact but I'm starting off with a
1/8<00:00:59.039> cup<00:00:59.280> measuring<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.949> tresorit

creations measurements I don't do

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.039 
creations measurements I don't do
precise<00:01:04.979> measurements<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.450> generally<00:01:06.840> might

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
precise measurements but generally might

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.420 
precise measurements but generally might
make<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.380> mixture<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:09.720> enough<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:10.650> hair

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.200 

so<00:01:14.430> again<00:01:15.979> roughly<00:01:16.979> anywhere<00:01:17.430> from<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.939> half<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
so again roughly anywhere from a half a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.390 
so again roughly anywhere from a half a
cup<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> cup<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:21.350> mixture<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
cup to a cup of the mixture or the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.789 
cup to a cup of the mixture or the
powder<00:01:23.759> rather<00:01:24.119> than<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> red<00:01:24.689> powder<00:01:25.439> I

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
powder rather than in a red powder I

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.710 
powder rather than in a red powder I
will<00:01:26.009> mix<00:01:26.750> together<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:28.530> my<00:01:28.950> bowl<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.880> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
will mix together in my bowl and it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.999 
will mix together in my bowl and it
works<00:01:30.900> best<00:01:31.170> if<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:34.009> disposable

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
works best if you do have a disposable

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.520 
works best if you do have a disposable
Bowl<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.530> disposable

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
Bowl so that you know and disposable

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.140 
Bowl so that you know and disposable
plastic<00:01:38.009> bowl<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.460> when<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.670> get<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
plastic bowl so that when you get you

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.910 
plastic bowl so that when you get you
know<00:01:39.180> completed<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.869> process<00:01:40.350> it's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
know completed with the process it's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.130 
know completed with the process it's
just<00:01:41.189> easier<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.549> rinse<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.970> out<00:01:42.150> or<00:01:42.930> if<00:01:43.049> you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
just easier to rinse it out or if you

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.929 
just easier to rinse it out or if you
chose<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.710> know<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.640> bowl<00:01:44.790> away

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
chose you know for the the bowl away

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539 
chose you know for the the bowl away
when<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.299> were<00:01:45.420> through<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.220> throw<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
when you were through you can throw the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.139 
when you were through you can throw the
bowl<00:01:47.729> away<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.280> roughly<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> take<00:01:50.939> my

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
bowl away so that roughly then I take my

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.679 
bowl away so that roughly then I take my
measurements<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.369> roughly<00:01:53.369> half<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.700> cup<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.420> a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.830 
just started go ahead and get that done
and<00:02:41.260> then<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.860> next<00:02:42.280> I'm<00:02:43.090> going<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.420> gradually

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
and then the next I'm going to gradually

peppermint burdock roots Lord rosemary I

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.300 
peppermint burdock roots Lord rosemary I
think<00:02:58.270> two<00:02:58.540> other<00:02:58.780> different<00:02:59.590> herbs<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.160> I

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
think two other different herbs that I

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.160 
think two other different herbs that I
used<00:03:00.610> I'll<00:03:01.150> try<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.510> put<00:03:01.690> those<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:02.050> my

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
used I'll try to put those in my

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:19.789 
used I'll try to put those in my
description<00:03:03.690> I'm<00:03:04.690> slowly

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.759 

and<00:03:20.799> this<00:03:20.950> is<00:03:21.129> actually<00:03:21.840> warm<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:23.170> did<00:03:23.440> steep

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
and this is actually warm I did steep

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.119 
and this is actually warm I did steep
the<00:03:23.950> herbs<00:03:24.099> for<00:03:24.580> about<00:03:25.090> an<00:03:25.330> hour<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:26.769> make<00:03:26.799> the

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
the herbs for about an hour to make the

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.369 
the herbs for about an hour to make the
tea<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.670> then<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.480> drained<00:03:28.780> them<00:03:29.049> because<00:03:29.290> I

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
tea and then I drained them because I

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:41.309 
tea and then I drained them because I
did<00:03:29.530> actually<00:03:29.680> use<00:03:29.980> dried<00:03:30.340> herbs<00:03:40.319> your

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
did actually use dried herbs your

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.180 
did actually use dried herbs your
mixture<00:03:41.709> should<00:03:41.739> turn<00:03:42.040> into<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.400> paste<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:45.069> if

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
mixture should turn into a paste and if

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.640 
mixture should turn into a paste and if
I<00:03:45.310> actually<00:03:45.430> do<00:03:45.760> not<00:03:45.879> have<00:03:46.260> enough<00:03:47.260> moisture

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
I actually do not have enough moisture

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.440 
I actually do not have enough moisture
I'll<00:03:48.129> actually<00:03:48.340> just<00:03:48.610> pour<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:49.000> little<00:03:49.150> bit<00:03:49.329> of

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
I'll actually just pour a little bit of

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.740 
I'll actually just pour a little bit of
the<00:03:49.959> still<00:03:50.170> water<00:03:50.470> in<00:03:50.650> here<00:03:50.799> as<00:03:50.920> well<00:03:51.599> just<00:03:52.599> to

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
the still water in here as well just to

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:03.420 
the still water in here as well just to
kind<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:52.930> work<00:03:53.079> out<00:03:53.349> my<00:03:53.560> face<00:04:01.829> it's<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:03.010> greenish

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.830 
tone this Benham and didn't color it
much<00:04:07.650> again<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.739> use<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.069> cinnamon<00:04:09.629> to<00:04:10.629> kind<00:04:10.810> of

much again I use the cinnamon to kind of

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.420 
much again I use the cinnamon to kind of
help<00:04:11.019> with<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.260> effects<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:11.739> red<00:04:11.980> because<00:04:12.340> I

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
help with the effects of red because I

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.259 
help with the effects of red because I
do<00:04:12.489> actually<00:04:12.970> like<00:04:14.010> adding<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.099> red<00:04:15.280> tone<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:16.120> my

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
hair and the cinnamon I should just

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:26.610 
hair and the cinnamon I should just
intensify<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:24.780> as<00:04:25.780> you<00:04:25.960> see<00:04:26.139> it<00:04:26.260> starting<00:04:26.590> to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
intensify that as you see it starting to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.659 
intensify that as you see it starting to
turn<00:04:26.830> into<00:04:27.039> a<00:04:27.130> paste<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:29.220> may<00:04:30.220> actually<00:04:30.340> add<00:04:30.520> a

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
turn into a paste I may actually add a

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.330 
turn into a paste I may actually add a
little<00:04:30.880> bit<00:04:31.060> more<00:04:31.560> still<00:04:32.560> water<00:04:32.830> just<00:04:33.070> so<00:04:33.190> it's

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
little bit more still water just so it's

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.980 
little bit more still water just so it's
a<00:04:33.370> little<00:04:33.400> bit<00:04:33.700> looser<00:04:34.060> than<00:04:34.180> it<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:34.450> currently

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.850 

but<00:04:37.990> so<00:04:38.200> let<00:04:38.320> me<00:04:38.380> go<00:04:38.500> ahead<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.680> add<00:04:38.830> some

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
but so let me go ahead and add some

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.909 
but so let me go ahead and add some
other<00:04:39.250> products<00:04:39.729> and<00:04:40.539> I<00:04:40.810> just<00:04:40.990> had<00:04:41.110> my<00:04:41.139> radical

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
other products and I just had my radical

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.129 
other products and I just had my radical
oil<00:04:42.990> setting<00:04:43.990> in<00:04:44.110> warm<00:04:44.349> water<00:04:45.810> go<00:04:46.810> ahead<00:04:47.050> and

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
oil setting in warm water go ahead and

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.450 
oil setting in warm water go ahead and
add<00:04:47.289> a<00:04:47.320> little<00:04:47.440> bit<00:04:47.710> of<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:47.979> that's<00:04:48.250> probably

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
add a little bit of that that's probably

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.710 
add a little bit of that that's probably
about<00:04:48.820> half<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.090> tablespoon<00:04:54.419> not<00:04:55.419> doing<00:04:55.660> a

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
about half a tablespoon not doing a

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.620 
about half a tablespoon not doing a
measurement<00:04:56.139> just<00:04:56.169> kind<00:04:56.410> of<00:04:56.440> eyeballing

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
measurement just kind of eyeballing

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.279 
measurement just kind of eyeballing
that's<00:04:58.630> probably<00:04:58.990> about<00:05:00.840> two<00:05:01.840> tablespoons

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
that's probably about two tablespoons

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:18.369 
that's probably about two tablespoons
but<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:03.310> do<00:05:03.370> my<00:05:03.610> thing<00:05:03.820> for<00:05:03.849> the<00:05:04.030> moisture<00:05:04.510> so

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:18.379 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.580 

and<00:05:19.379> that's<00:05:19.560> saying<00:05:19.710> other<00:05:19.979> people<00:05:20.009> use<00:05:21.590> auto

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
and that's saying other people use auto

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.969 
and that's saying other people use auto
powder<00:05:23.009> or<00:05:23.909> olive<00:05:24.449> oil<00:05:24.719> in<00:05:25.080> their<00:05:25.289> mixtures<00:05:25.770> I

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
powder or olive oil in their mixtures I

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.010 
powder or olive oil in their mixtures I
don't<00:05:26.580> believe<00:05:26.789> I'm<00:05:26.939> going<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.120> use<00:05:27.360> either<00:05:27.599> of

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
don't believe I'm going to use either of

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:36.920 
don't believe I'm going to use either of
those<00:05:28.439> today<00:05:34.310> but<00:05:35.310> I'm<00:05:35.430> continuing<00:05:35.879> to<00:05:35.909> mix<00:05:36.210> my

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
those today but I'm continuing to mix my

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:45.200

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
treatment I mean a lot of people just

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.249 
treatment I mean a lot of people just
add<00:05:47.849> water<00:05:48.120> some<00:05:48.509> people<00:05:48.750> add<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:48.900> little<00:05:49.139> bit
