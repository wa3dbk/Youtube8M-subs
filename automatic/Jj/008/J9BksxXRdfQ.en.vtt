love<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> thing<00:00:56.820> okay<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.600> do<00:00:57.660> we

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
love here is the thing okay so how do we

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.869 
love here is the thing okay so how do we
hang<00:00:58.079> out<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.859> theory<00:00:59.070> behind<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
hang out the the theory behind this is

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.299 
hang out the the theory behind this is
when<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.449> activate<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.559> don't<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.160> when

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
when we activate this I don't do it when

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.070 
when we activate this I don't do it when
they<00:01:02.489> torch<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.239> say<00:01:03.420> that's<00:01:03.660> probably<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
they torch I say that's probably the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.070 
they torch I say that's probably the
best<00:01:04.260> way<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:05.400> activate<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.900> thing's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
best way we activate this this thing's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.350 
best way we activate this this thing's
gonna<00:01:07.260> blow<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.520> theory<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.030> he

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
gonna blow up and the theory is that he

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
gonna blow up and the theory is that he
will<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.900> spawn<00:01:10.320> somewhere<00:01:10.619> now<00:01:10.860> I

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
will actually spawn somewhere now I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.960 
will actually spawn somewhere now I
personally<00:01:11.159> don't<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.760> gonna

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
personally don't think this is gonna

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.580 
personally don't think this is gonna
work<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.330> all<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:13.110> um<00:01:13.380> oh<00:01:14.220> man<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.060> go<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.590> here
