 Claude - Oscar Monet was born in Paris on 14 November 1840, his father Adolph Monet and his mother 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.033
 Louise - Justine Aubry. When he was five years old, the family moved to Le Havre and started schooling here. 

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:48.000
 everyone knew it. In 1856, he met a painter Eugene Boudin, who pretended to abandon him 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 making caricatures and landscaping landscapes. Monet then decided to take this kind of painting 

00:00:56.033 --> 00:01:04.066
 represented his future. Boudin learned to paint him in nature. This has also become one of the main 

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:12.066
 the characteristics of impressionism. In 1859 and 1860 he studied art in Paris, although he was the father of this 

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:20.066
 opposed. He was serving his military service in Algeria, where he was taken over by the colors of Africa. Because of the disease it could be 

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:28.066
 he returned home. In 1862 he was again in Paris. He worked in the studio of the painter Charles Gleyre who was 

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:36.066
 then very well known. He also met other painters, Pierre - Augusta Renoir, Alfredo Sisley and Frederica 

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:44.100
 Bazilla. In 1869 he lived with Renoir, they painted together, and his paintings were repeatedly rejected in Salon. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.066
 In 1870 he married Camille Doncieux, with whom he also had one son, Jeana. To avoid it 

00:01:52.066 --> 00:02:00.133
 he joined the army, he moved to London, where he spent a year. 

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:08.133
 He returned to France in 1871, and moved to Argentuil, near Paris. In 1874 they had impressionists 

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:16.133
 exhibition Salon des RefusÃ©s (salon rejected). Some critics called them Impresionist, po 

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:24.133
 Monet's image Impression, Soleil levant or Impression, sunrise. The name of the image was created 

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:32.133
 the name of the impressionistic movement, which was also used by Monet and others since 1877, simultaneously with 

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:35.133
 their third exhibition. 

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:43.133
 Monet's wife died in 1872, leaving him with two children, Michel was born only a few 

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:51.100
 months before mother's death. In 1883, she was accompanied by a new companion Alice Hoscheda and her children 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:03:00.200
 moved to Giverny. Alice's husband economically helped Monet before his death. In 1892 Alice married. 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 Monet became a famous and consequently a wealthy painter. He could buy a house with a garden in Giverny. Years 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.200
 In 1899 he started painting Nymphs, although his vision was greatly worsened. He traveled a lot with the escort 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:24.200
 new women (London, Venice, Spain, Norway). When Alice died in 1911, she decided not to 

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:32.200
 he will leave the house and will not take pictures anymore. He died of cancer, December 6, 1926. They are buried 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:40.200
 among others, Clemenceau, Bonnard, Vuillard and Roussel also attended. His house in Giverny, in 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 who did not have his paintings but his exceptional collection of Japanese woodcutters, was opened in 1981. 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:56.200
 Most visitors view both parts of the garden, which are reconstructed as they were planted at the time 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:04.233
 Monet's life. A memorial house attracts a large number of tourists. 

00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:12.266
 Monet painted above all "one plein air" (on the beaches of Normandy and along the banks of the Seine). That's it 

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:20.266
 aware that objects often change colors. They say that he painted the same image at the same time and only at 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:28.266
 certain weather conditions, so that the continuation of the work would be as close to the beginning as possible, since 

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:36.300
 different color conditions change. He searched for new ways of painting, his moves being short and 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:44.266
 relaxed. In 1871 he visited an exhibition of paintings by William Turner in London. Temporary color tones 

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:52.266
 The English were greatly surprised. He began to paint a series of paintings with similar motifs, but in different parts 

00:04:52.266 --> 00:05:00.333
 day. In the early years of the 20th century, he dedicated himself especially to the symbol of London (Parliament, Waterloo Bridge 

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:08.366
 and the Charing Cross Bridge in the fog). He also painted ninfe from his garden, but because he needed more for painting 

00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:16.333
 of the space, he painted on ever larger canvases, so that the viewer had a bigger angle.
