using the tender with this recycler you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.850 
using the tender with this recycler you
can<00:01:02.280> also<00:01:02.489> increase<00:01:03.420> your<00:01:03.750> recovery<00:01:04.289> rate<00:01:04.649> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
can also increase your recovery rate to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.440 
can also increase your recovery rate to
a<00:01:04.890> level<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.670> never<00:01:05.789> experienced

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
a level that you have never experienced

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.900 
a level that you have never experienced
before<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.930> there's<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.160> quality<00:01:08.789> of

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
before and there's more the quality of

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.540 
before and there's more the quality of
the<00:01:09.180> fractions<00:01:09.690> separated<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:10.950> way

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
the fractions separated that's way

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.490 
the fractions separated that's way
better<00:01:11.940> than<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.509> have<00:01:12.630> seen<00:01:12.840> an<00:01:12.990> experienced

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
better than you have seen an experienced

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.139 
better than you have seen an experienced
before<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.190> means<00:01:14.399> money<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.789> can<00:01:14.940> sell

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
before and that means money you can sell

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.390 
before and that means money you can sell
the<00:01:15.270> fractions<00:01:15.660> for<00:01:15.840> way<00:01:16.619> higher<00:01:16.890> prices<00:01:17.369> than

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the fractions for way higher prices than

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.910 
the fractions for way higher prices than
before<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.750> make<00:01:18.930> truckloads<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.650> money

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
before so you make truckloads of money

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.490 
before so you make truckloads of money
and<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.909> payback<00:01:21.299> time<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.900> short<00:01:21.930> that

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and the payback time is so short that

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.090 
and the payback time is so short that
sounds<00:01:23.490> very<00:01:23.729> very<00:01:24.360> cool<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.710> tell<00:01:25.950> me

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
sounds very very cool can you tell me

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.830 
sounds very very cool can you tell me
more<00:01:26.250> about<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.640> payback<00:01:27.030> time<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.420> Zen

more about the payback time of Zen
robotics<00:01:28.350> recycler<00:01:28.950> yes<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.820> short

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
robotics recycler yes it's so short

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.899 
robotics recycler yes it's so short

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
they do in the other maybe more

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.310 
they do in the other maybe more
established<00:01:38.250> industries<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.200> how

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
established industries and that is how

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.230

robotics researcher and install it along
your<00:03:44.129> hand<00:03:44.400> sorting<00:03:44.609> line<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.569> will<00:03:45.720> be

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
your hand sorting line you will be

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.679 
your hand sorting line you will be
replacing<00:03:46.229> four<00:03:46.919> to<00:03:47.220> six<00:03:47.459> humans<00:03:47.879> per<00:03:48.419> shift

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:48.689 
replacing four to six humans per shift

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.039 
replacing four to six humans per shift
so<00:03:49.680> if<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.579> operate<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:51.090> two<00:03:51.269> shifts<00:03:51.449> you<00:03:51.930> are

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
so if you operate in two shifts you are

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.140 
so if you operate in two shifts you are
actually<00:03:52.199> with<00:03:52.620> one<00:03:52.849> robot<00:03:53.849> you<00:03:54.060> are

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
actually with one robot you are

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.479 
actually with one robot you are
replacing<00:03:54.389> eight<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.169> twelve<00:03:55.439> humans<00:03:55.919> that's

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
replacing eight to twelve humans that's

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.640 
replacing eight to twelve humans that's
a<00:03:56.639> lot<00:03:56.819> yes<00:03:57.389> and<00:03:57.689> you<00:03:57.810> can<00:03:57.989> do<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.199> rest<00:03:58.319> of<00:03:58.530> the

a lot yes and you can do the rest of the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.099 
a lot yes and you can do the rest of the
map<00:03:58.829> so<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.759> is<00:03:59.790> serious<00:04:00.599> money<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:01.079> are
