00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
spoke a little bit about him in the past

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.310 
spoke a little bit about him in the past
but<00:03:18.240> what<00:03:18.630> are<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.750> guys<00:03:18.870> showing<00:03:19.080> off<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.630 
but what are you guys showing off the
new<00:03:19.350> here<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.710> then<00:03:19.860> maybe<00:03:20.010> refresh<00:03:20.310> people

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
new here and then maybe refresh people

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.130 
new here and then maybe refresh people
as<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.820> what<00:03:20.970> they<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.240> expect<00:03:21.360> if<00:03:21.930> they've

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
as to what they can expect if they've

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.440 
as to what they can expect if they've
heard<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.380> already<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.370> know<00:03:23.490> their<00:03:24.180> whole

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
heard it already so you know their whole

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.750 
heard it already so you know their whole
entire<00:03:24.720> arm<00:03:25.200> transforms<00:03:26.040> into<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.430> weapon

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
entire arm transforms into the weapon

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.120 
entire arm transforms into the weapon
and<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:27.390> we<00:03:27.660> really<00:03:27.900> wanted<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.320> what<00:03:29.040> that

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
really attracted to and was that

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.460 
really attracted to and was that
surprising<00:05:01.090> when<00:05:01.210> you<00:05:01.240> got<00:05:01.450> here<00:05:01.600> at<00:05:01.720> e3<00:05:01.810> uh

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
surprising when you got here at e3 uh

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.290 
surprising when you got here at e3 uh
you<00:05:03.010> know<00:05:03.130> I<00:05:03.160> think<00:05:03.550> as<00:05:03.880> you<00:05:03.910> mentioned

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
you know I think as you mentioned

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.150 
you know I think as you mentioned
there's<00:05:04.690> quite<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:04.990> bit<00:05:05.050> more<00:05:05.380> expectation

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
there's quite a bit more expectation

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.410 
there's quite a bit more expectation
which<00:05:06.280> frankly<00:05:06.640> for<00:05:06.760> us<00:05:06.850> is<00:05:07.000> not<00:05:07.150> something

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
which frankly for us is not something

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.270 
which frankly for us is not something
we're<00:05:07.630> entirely<00:05:07.900> used<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.500> so<00:05:08.710> it's<00:05:08.740> kind<00:05:09.220> of

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
we're entirely used to so it's kind of

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.590 
we're entirely used to so it's kind of
fresh<00:05:09.520> for<00:05:09.730> us<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:10.750> really<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:13.090> isn't<00:05:13.240> and<00:05:13.570> I

transforming say that that makes a lot

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.450 
transforming say that that makes a lot
of<00:05:44.500> sense<00:05:44.590> actually<00:05:44.830> is<00:05:45.040> gonna<00:05:45.190> be<00:05:45.280> easy<00:05:45.400> to

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
of sense actually is gonna be easy to

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.710 
of sense actually is gonna be easy to
market<00:05:45.790> that<00:05:45.910> I<00:05:45.940> think<00:05:46.210> a<00:05:46.270> very<00:05:46.480> specific

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
market that I think a very specific

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.900 
market that I think a very specific
message<00:05:47.230> so<00:05:47.650> when<00:05:47.980> can<00:05:48.010> people<00:05:48.190> expect<00:05:48.550> to<00:05:48.760> get
