00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 at the news also this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.279
 evening the cry of alarmed firefighters our 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.500
 rescue system is threatened and 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.880
 distilled because the volunteers are missing 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.950
 the call they are less and less 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.509
 many barracks lived a few 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.530
 numbers before going further to 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.070
 better understand look 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.730
 nearly 80% of firefighters in France are 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.220
 today 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.550
 volunteers they are 195 miles on a 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.359
 total of 250 miles and in six years their 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.039
 number has dropped 6000 illustrations of 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.779
 this disaffection with a clear 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.500
 julien dagger bape that and our office 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.460
 in Bordeaux they go into intervention 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.530
 every seven seconds on average 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.100
 and when the beeper goes off each 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.100
 minute count 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 I think that a year ago we had 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.309
 followed this team of firefighters 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.100
 volunteers on an intervention 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.360
 that day they are called for a 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.440
 suicide attempt 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.760
 we do not have it for your advice sir lâm 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.760
 is drunk injured it will take thirty long 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.460
 minutes to the firefighters to master it 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.990
 ladies that fire gas leaks 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.940
 most serious injuries to small 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.470
 bobos day and night volunteers get 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.240
 take turns to wear the first 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.130
 sometimes decisive relief jérémy froissart 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.560
 committed six years ago he is chief 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.500
 company and its guards are in 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.300
 more than his activity for 8 euros of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.100
 time 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.320
 the day actually I'm going to do my 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.740
 usual work and evening from 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.150
 19 hours until 6am we are 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.550
 at home and we are on call what we 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.030
 call stran compared you understand 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.870
 that some may be discouraged yes 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.990
 I think that my waiting a little 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.450
 highest level of compensation this 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.520
 discouragement in his barracks he gets 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.160
 notes daily and the captain does 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.320
 the cache not some interventions get 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.820
 make in its workforce the minimum of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.360
 staff that must be provided to ensure 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.760
 by law an ambulance is 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.830
 three people so he comes the 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.390
 day where we are only one or two 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.950
 people 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.470
 sometimes there is even nobody on the spot 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.360
 in this barracks for example a 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.280
 emergency has just fallen but it takes 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.950
 wait for the nurse who live in 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.040
 more than 10 km for the truck then this 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.400
 left precious time it takes 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.739
 then caught up this time the truck 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.570
 by but that's not always the case 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.670
 it is then another barracks that takes 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.650
 relay because in France the number 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.170
 interventions is increasing every year 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.720
 ten years it went from 3 million and 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.150
 half to over 4 million 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.640
 conversely the number of barracks decreases 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.810
 nearly 600 relief centers had to 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.810
 close these last five years
