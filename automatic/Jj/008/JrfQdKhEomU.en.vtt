00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.640 

first<00:00:19.130> off<00:00:19.370> we<00:00:19.700> have<00:00:19.880> the<00:00:20.000> throw<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:21.290> throw<00:00:21.320> is

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
first off we have the throw the throw is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.420 
first off we have the throw the throw is
the<00:00:21.770> custom<00:00:22.160> zombie<00:00:22.640> with<00:00:22.970> a<00:00:23.000> special<00:00:23.480> attack

sometimes<00:00:25.430> the<00:00:25.820> throw<00:00:26.029> will<00:00:26.180> throw<00:00:26.360> its<00:00:26.540> head

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
sometimes the throw will throw its head

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.119 
sometimes the throw will throw its head
at<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:26.900> a<00:00:27.290> very<00:00:27.860> difficult<00:00:28.430> attack<00:00:29.029> to<00:00:29.360> dodge

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.979 

the<00:00:34.129> throw<00:00:34.340> operates<00:00:34.910> on<00:00:35.059> only<00:00:35.300> three<00:00:35.420> command

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
the throw operates on only three command

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.410 
the throw operates on only three command
blocks<00:00:36.260> on<00:00:36.470> a<00:00:36.500> clock<00:00:36.830> the<00:00:37.790> first<00:00:38.030> command

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
blocks on a clock the first command

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.360 
blocks on a clock the first command
block<00:00:38.660> will<00:00:38.870> give<00:00:39.020> him<00:00:39.170> invisibility<00:00:39.710> in<00:00:40.129> the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
block will give him invisibility in the

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.750 
block will give him invisibility in the
second<00:00:40.700> one<00:00:40.790> speed<00:00:41.860> two<00:00:42.860> ticks<00:00:43.100> later<00:00:43.280> it<00:00:43.670> will

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
second one speed two ticks later it will

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.460 
second one speed two ticks later it will
teleport<00:00:44.180> in<00:00:44.480> three<00:00:44.720> blocks<00:00:44.989> in<00:00:45.199> the<00:00:45.230> air

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
teleport in three blocks in the air

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.250 
teleport in three blocks in the air
creating<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.190> jumping<00:00:46.550> effect<00:00:46.879> to<00:00:47.870> actually

make the throw it's just a zombie with a
zombie<00:00:50.540> head<00:00:50.750> this<00:00:51.589> is<00:00:51.769> why<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:51.980> head<00:00:52.309> stays

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
zombie head this is why the head stays

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.310 
zombie head this is why the head stays
while<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.420> rest<00:00:53.629> of<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.839> body<00:00:54.019> turns
