 hello everyone with you lab test 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 Oldi computer and Vladimir Smirnov 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.700
 today we will test another 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.380
 budget tablet is a 7-inch iconbit 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.389
 nettab matrix dx 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.490
 possessing excellent for its price 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.100
 characteristics of great design and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.080
 surprisingly light weight kit 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.330
 tablet supplies 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.029
 power supply with an output current 2 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.180

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.290
 there is a camera with a resolution of 2 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.239
 megapixels 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.399
 the panel itself is made of grated 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.920
 aluminum which is very pleasant to the touch 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.180
 at the top there is a connector for 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.829
 power supply connections 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.780
 although the device supports charging and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.410
 on yusb mini hdmi micro usb connector for 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.300
 headphone 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.219
 on the right side is a button 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.320

 micro sd front panel 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.170
 there is another camera with resolution 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.310
 0 3 megapixels under it a screen with 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.590
 7 inches 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.320
 the matrix is â€‹â€‹made by technology dogs and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.869
 1280 by 800 pixels resolution 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.920
 which gives us a pixel density of 216 on 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.979
 inch below is stereo speakers 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.930
 the dimensions of the tablet are 190 by 113 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.810
 only 8 millimeters and weight at all 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.220
 small 270 grams 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 processor specifications 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.790
 quad-core actor and 7029 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.700
 with a clock frequency of 1 2 gigahertz 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.040
 video chip vivante gc1000 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.049
 RAM 1 gigabyte internal 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.930
 the memory has a capacity of 8 gigabytes of which 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.450
 549 available to user 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.850
 wireless interfaces Wi-Fi sensors 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.270
 g-sensor battery lithium polymer 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.980
 capacity of 3000 milliampere hours 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.590
 operating system android 4 1 1 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.190
 Let's start with the screen color and angles 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.800
 review 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.340
 just great brightness and dad more 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.330
 it would be even better to work the interface 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.420
 quite smoothly and although sometimes 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.640
 slow down still slightly noticeable 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.580
 let's go testing for start square 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.080
 for now there is a test I will tell about results 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.120
 battery life testing 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.230
 for this test we turned off everything 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.700
 wireless interfaces 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.040
 set the screen brightness to medium 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.800
 position and started the movie in this mode 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.600
 the tablet lasted and a good hours 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.090
 the result t is completed and the system 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.880
 got it quite modest 2019 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.850
 points next synthetic test 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.670
 antutu benchmark in this test system 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.580
 already got quite decent 7190 7 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.170
 points processor on those slim pack when 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.650
 single stream average amount mega 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.250
 the flop was 31 multiline mode 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.700
 the average gave out 70 megaforce graphic 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.380
 test not on mark 2 with this test tablet 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.360
 coped quite decently average 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:11.300
 frames per second was 45 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.510
 and family test multitouch devices 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.160
 simultaneously recognizes 5 touch 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.020
 we end up with a good budget device 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.270
 Suitable for reading watching videos 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.830
 quite powerful filling combined with 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.170
 nice design and good time 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.209
 autonomous work he would still multitouch to 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.890
 rather got forgotten absolutely beautiful 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.890
 apparatus bye
