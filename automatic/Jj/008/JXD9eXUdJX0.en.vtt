pushpin<00:00:51.510> right<00:00:51.840> above<00:00:52.110> ground<00:00:52.350> specific<00:00:52.949> in

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
pushpin right above ground specific in

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.680 
pushpin right above ground specific in
my<00:00:53.129> video<00:00:53.370> cameras<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.000> there's<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.210> pushpin<00:00:54.539> or

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
my video cameras so there's a pushpin or

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.569 
my video cameras so there's a pushpin or
it<00:00:54.750> goes<00:00:54.899> right<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.530> there's<00:00:56.340> only<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
it goes right here and there's only a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.619 
it goes right here and there's only a
bolt<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.210> goes<00:00:57.270> right<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:59.120> then<00:01:00.120> most

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
bolt that goes right here and then most

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.580 
bolt that goes right here and then most
of<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.809> stuff<00:01:01.020> right<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.170> we'll<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.440> come

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
of this stuff right here we'll just come

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.619 
of this stuff right here we'll just come
right<00:01:01.739> off<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.879> basically<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.239> did<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.539> is

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
right off so basically I did that is

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.500 
right off so basically I did that is
peeled<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.080> right<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.470> badge<00:01:05.360> right<00:01:06.360> here

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
peeled this right here badge right here

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.090 
peeled this right here badge right here
just<00:01:06.890> detaches<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.049> where<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.500> why

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
just detaches you can see where that why

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.490 
just detaches you can see where that why
it's<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.400> important<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.500> one

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
it's so important to have that one

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.140 
it's so important to have that one
underneath<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.580> that's<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.000> holds

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
underneath out because that's what holds

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.469 
underneath out because that's what holds
this<00:01:15.360> piece<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:16.909> again<00:01:17.909> how<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.240> that's

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
this piece in again how do I know that's

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.469 
this piece in again how do I know that's
trial<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.110> error<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.530> did<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.890> once<00:01:20.100> before

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
trial and error I did this once before

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.850 
trial and error I did this once before
so<00:01:21.479> which<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:21.869> kind<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.200> giving<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> a
