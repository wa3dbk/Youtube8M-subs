00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
partings down the side you see close

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.589 
partings down the side you see close
together<00:00:18.259> in<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:18.619> top<00:00:19.060> so<00:00:20.060> have<00:00:20.329> a<00:00:20.360> little

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
together in the top so have a little

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.230 
together in the top so have a little
slant<00:00:20.869> to<00:00:21.080> it<00:00:21.109> when<00:00:21.500> my<00:00:21.760> part<00:00:22.760> that<00:00:22.970> I'm<00:00:23.060> going

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
slant to it when my part that I'm going

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.210 
slant to it when my part that I'm going
to<00:00:23.269> have<00:00:23.449> invisible<00:00:23.869> I'll<00:00:24.679> put<00:00:24.859> my<00:00:24.949> closure

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
to have invisible I'll put my closure

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.749 
to have invisible I'll put my closure
right<00:00:25.460> here<00:00:25.640> at<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:25.820> top<00:00:30.130> spread<00:00:31.130> out<00:00:31.279> on<00:00:31.550> down

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
right here at the top spread out on down

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:51.869 
right here at the top spread out on down
to<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.089> back<00:00:32.300> go<00:00:33.260> back<00:00:33.589> up

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.990 

okay<00:00:53.020> getting<00:00:54.020> closer<00:00:54.199> to<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.559> top<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:55.670> start

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
okay getting closer to the top to start

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.259 
okay getting closer to the top to start
closing<00:00:56.270> it<00:00:56.660> off<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:58.250> my<00:00:58.399> visible<00:00:58.879> part<00:01:01.269> bring

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
closing it off to my visible part bring

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:10.390 
closing it off to my visible part bring
my<00:01:02.420> next<00:01:02.870> trick<00:01:04.659> around<00:01:05.659> from<00:01:05.930> here<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.350> there

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.340 

and<00:01:10.490> once<00:01:11.210> I<00:01:11.300> get<00:01:11.360> in<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:11.540> top<00:01:11.780> I<00:01:11.990> split<00:01:12.320> my

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
and once I get in the top I split my

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.950 
and once I get in the top I split my
tracks<00:01:12.800> in<00:01:12.950> half<00:01:13.370> so<00:01:14.060> there'll<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.420> lot<00:01:14.660> flatter

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
tracks in half so there'll a lot flatter

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.810 
tracks in half so there'll a lot flatter
than<00:01:15.350> if<00:01:15.470> you<00:01:15.590> would<00:01:15.770> have<00:01:16.070> them<00:01:16.220> normally

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
than if you would have them normally

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.410 
than if you would have them normally
they<00:01:17.600> sort<00:01:17.900> of<00:01:17.960> they<00:01:18.230> look<00:01:18.380> like<00:01:18.560> this<00:01:19.420> once

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
they sort of they look like this once

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.570 
they sort of they look like this once
you<00:01:20.510> split<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.900> in<00:01:21.020> half

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.960 

so<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.120> just<00:01:25.330> thing<00:01:25.690> up<00:01:26.050> on<00:01:26.340> top<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.670> braids

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
so I just thing up on top of the braids

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.390 
so I just thing up on top of the braids
closes<00:01:28.660> apart<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.350> part<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:29.710> can<00:01:29.980> I

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
closes apart to the part of the can I

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.800 
closes apart to the part of the can I
was<00:01:33.400> so<00:01:33.640> long<00:01:33.910> like<00:01:34.150> so
