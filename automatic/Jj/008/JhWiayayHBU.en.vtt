00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.230
 hi everyone these young people I hope 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.360
 that you're good friends today 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.120
 I present you the news 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.490
 most important features 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.830
 of ayew and follows the new apple ios which 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.050
 was presented on June 2, 2014 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.910
 then this ios does not have real 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.230
 changes regarding the design on 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.290
 rather new features 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.419
 rather practical you will see it with 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.939
 ayo then you can now 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.309
 respond quickly to messages 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.200
 look at me that I get a sms I 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.420
 slide down and we'll go 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.980
 display a keyboard as well as a part 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.170
 dedicated to writing your answer 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.370
 whether you are on the springboard or 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.230
 still in an application 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.420
 I write my answer and I can send 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.670
 super fast and that was missing 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.130
 actually on the iphone know that this 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.750
 principle of fast response works for 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.310
 future applications like for 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.350
 facebook for example where are you going 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.050
 can comment or like a status 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.300
 quickly we are entitled to a 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.400
 novelty with ayew and next level 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.530
 multitasking the display is the same 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.020
 that of ios is but there you have a 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.359
 little more indeed we are shown 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.280
 now our contacts to recent all 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:14.840
 at the top as you notice what 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.679
 allows you to have quick access to 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.229
 his contacts 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.969
 we press the contact of your choice 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.810
 and you have this menu there that goes 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.729
 to see who will allow you 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.619
 to call to send messages 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.799
 make a facetime call all with 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.999
 simplicity and speed 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.740
 at the research share level 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.659
 spotlight no change in appearance 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.069
 we always show by doing a slide 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.049
 down on any page of the 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.819
 sprint bounds so what is changing 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.709
 well he became smarter 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.240
 the results are more accurate it can 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.819
 do research on safari on 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.329
 itunes on the app store on movies on 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.950
 restaurants or places 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.749
 we have a change regarding the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.179
 keyboard under ios fit with the 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:55.219
 quicktype feature that offers 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.079
 automatically words that you have 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.359
 intending to type you write your 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.639
 sentence is at the very top of the keyboard 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.079
 show you word suggestions on 

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.849
 press the word of his choice for 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.920
 integrate it directly into your heart of 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.229
 messages the goal here is to make 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.750
 faster and easier writing 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.100
 the keyboard learns your habits and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.710
 automatically saves 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.430
 nothing is going on the apple server I 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.500
 reassures you 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.450
 something else that was taken 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.150
 taylor of the apple event of June 2 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.950
 2014 is the possibility in the future 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.470
 to install new keyboards and that 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.790
 it's pretty cool 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.860
 the messages application has the right to 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.660
 some novelties are more 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.730
 indeed it is possible by going in 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.790
 your contact information from 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.500
 to know the position of your contact at 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.820
 condition that it is accepted 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.400
 to activate the localization 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.010
 but here the big change is rather 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.350
 the tap to talk feature that you 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.550
 displays a quick menu that allows you 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.810
 for example to take photos 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.380
 quickly or videos 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.630
 quickly 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.660
 you see I just slip there 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.940
 I can film myself I record I 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.070
 can just cancel by sliding to the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.170
 little cross there I make a picture here 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.150
 the photo is super fast and right 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.640
 you can send audio messages 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.380
 to the recipient it's all new and 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.000
 it can please a lot of people 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.920
 what is practical is that you 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.739
 can listen or respond 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.660
 directly to these voice messages on 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.780
 the screen simply locked in 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.940
 approaching the iphone to the ears 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.500
 the camera under ios suite you 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.470
 now proposes to activate a 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.900
 self - timer of three or ten seconds 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.940
 I run for example 3 seconds and my 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.200
 photo will be taken after three 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.720
 seconds simply 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.630
 otherwise the novelty is that you can 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.519
 adjust yourself the brightness you 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.500
 slip like those wanted sand and 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.820
 to blame the bottom c went up 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.230
 to make it clearer in 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.900
 the application photos you have a 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.790
 new age reny system you can 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.320
 add filtrations can already the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.570
 do it before but where it becomes 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.880
 interesting is that you can 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.690
 change the brightness level or 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.310
 still the color level on your 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.950
 photos you have everything right 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.110
 brightness color example brightness 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.410
 japy on it and I'm sliding right and 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.820
 left 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.310
 and when something pleases me 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.690
 can automatically save this 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.519
 photo there for example it's for the 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.030
 color so that can be really 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.140
 not bad for photographers in particular 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.180
 apple has also proposed some 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.100
 changes with syria under ios 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.020
 your voice assistant who responds to 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.490
 all your questions before to launch 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.710
 Syria, it was necessary to 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.700
 pressed the home button and well 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.890
 there apple 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.250
 pause when you're going to hook up your 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.020
 syria launch device without support 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.070
 on this button it is enough simply 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.080
 to say 10 syria and they then launch themselves 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.170
 it makes me think of google hockey but 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.030
 good if not the big novelty here is 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.560
 rather the integration of shazam and 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.360
 which is a just magic tool 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.860
 since they find all the names of your 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.170
 music just by listening to them 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.700
 and integrating two bases on 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.350
 the iphone and so on syria it's 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.210
 really not stupid at all and like you 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.370
 can you notice it works very well 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.770
 you just have to tell him 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.510
 tell me just what is this 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.170
 music please and he will you 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.670
 give the answer pretty quickly the 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.530
 notification center in terms of 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.140
 functionality was rather poor on 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.210
 we post on ios is the stock exchange the 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.400
 weather the date the calendar is fine 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.560
 now under highway suite your 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.790
 applications can add their 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.070
 own widgets in the center of 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.710
 notifications for example with ib I 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.480
 can bid directly in 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.880
 the notification center without making me 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.960
 in the app 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.130
 we will finish this video by the 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.380
 presentation of the app store that 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.720
 some news in ranking you 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.100
 have the applications of the moment the 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.470
 paid and free applications 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.840
 the presentation of applications is the 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.780
 even when you get in 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.120
 however know that normally he will 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.230
 have in the future the integration of 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.300
 videos in description 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.040
 if not where it becomes interesting 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.600
 that you can explore more easily 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.070
 categories of the app store 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.320
 the video is over now you in 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.230
 know more about ios then i 'm waiting so 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.400
 your opinion on this new ios via the 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.140
 comments from this video 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.060
 on this we end up in a next 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.190
 video highway sound wind on my page 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:20.230
