00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
slowly so it would definitely be a

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
work on how that's going to be worked

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.869 
work on how that's going to be worked
out<00:03:43.209> between<00:03:43.479> them<00:03:43.900> who<00:03:44.590> has<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.979> ball<00:03:45.220> who

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
out between them who has the ball who

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.719 
out between them who has the ball who
has<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.269> ball<00:03:46.479> more<00:03:46.690> how<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.620> play<00:03:48.099> off<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.430> the

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:48.729 
has the ball more how to play off of the

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.180 
has the ball more how to play off of the
ball<00:03:48.909> I<00:03:49.209> think<00:03:50.079> James<00:03:50.349> Harden's<00:03:50.739> better<00:03:50.949> off

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
ball I think James Harden's better off

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.670 
ball I think James Harden's better off
of<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.430> ball<00:03:51.639> then<00:03:52.359> Jeremy<00:03:53.019> Lin<00:03:53.229> is<00:03:53.379> at<00:03:53.560> this

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
of the ball then Jeremy Lin is at this

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.140 
of the ball then Jeremy Lin is at this
point<00:03:53.889> in<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.099> career<00:03:54.430> because<00:03:54.549> hardens<00:03:55.030> a

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
point in a career because hardens a

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.390 
point in a career because hardens a
better<00:03:55.329> shooter<00:03:55.659> and<00:03:56.379> he's<00:03:56.500> more<00:03:56.680> explosive

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
better shooter and he's more explosive

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.339 
better shooter and he's more explosive
you<00:03:57.699> know<00:03:57.790> he<00:03:57.909> can<00:03:58.060> get<00:03:58.209> cuts<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:58.810> get<00:03:58.930> dunks

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
you know he can get cuts and get dunks

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.800 
you know he can get cuts and get dunks
in<00:03:59.470> this<00:03:59.590> type<00:03:59.799> of<00:03:59.829> thing<00:04:00.220> but<00:04:00.729> I'm<00:04:01.449> sure

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
in this type of thing but I'm sure

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.420 
in this type of thing but I'm sure
they'll<00:04:02.019> work<00:04:02.169> it<00:04:02.349> out<00:04:02.500> it's<00:04:03.159> just<00:04:03.370> like

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
they'll work it out it's just like

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.699 
they'll work it out it's just like
LeBron<00:04:03.909> and<00:04:04.090> Dwyane<00:04:04.239> Wade<00:04:04.569> they<00:04:05.169> both<00:04:05.379> needed

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
LeBron and Dwyane Wade they both needed

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.619 
LeBron and Dwyane Wade they both needed
the<00:04:05.889> ball<00:04:06.069> in<00:04:06.189> their<00:04:06.340> hand<00:04:06.609> and<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:07.299> took<00:04:07.329> them

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
the ball in their hand and it took them

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.929 
the ball in their hand and it took them
a<00:04:07.720> year<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:08.349> start<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.739> figure<00:04:09.040> out<00:04:09.220> how<00:04:09.579> to<00:04:09.639> do

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
a year to start to figure out how to do

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.240 
a year to start to figure out how to do
it<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:10.239> how<00:04:10.840> one<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.319> them<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.829> both<00:04:11.979> of<00:04:12.010> them

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
it and how one of them and both of them

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.789 
it and how one of them and both of them
can<00:04:12.459> do<00:04:12.609> better<00:04:12.790> off<00:04:13.060> of<00:04:13.329> the<00:04:13.449> ball<00:04:13.629> so<00:04:14.349> what

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
can do better off of the ball so what

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.399 
can do better off of the ball so what
we're<00:04:14.949> looking<00:04:15.400> for<00:04:15.430> is<00:04:15.909> a<00:04:16.229> combination<00:04:17.229> of

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
we're looking for is a combination of

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.129 
we're looking for is a combination of
linsanity<00:04:18.310> 2<00:04:18.489> point<00:04:18.820> 0<00:04:18.940> plus<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.239> beard<00:04:19.690> sanity

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
linsanity 2 point 0 plus a beard sanity

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.620 
linsanity 2 point 0 plus a beard sanity
I<00:04:20.289> think<00:04:20.949> plane<00:04:21.400> see<00:04:21.639> me<00:04:21.699> 2<00:04:21.970> point<00:04:22.270> 0<00:04:22.389> plus

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
I think plane see me 2 point 0 plus

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.230 
I think plane see me 2 point 0 plus
beard<00:04:22.930> sanity<00:04:23.440> equals<00:04:23.830> playoffs<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:24.970> if<00:04:25.120> these

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
beard sanity equals playoffs so if these

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.140 
beard sanity equals playoffs so if these
guys<00:04:25.479> can<00:04:25.539> figure<00:04:26.080> it<00:04:26.289> out<00:04:26.470> this<00:04:26.770> year<00:04:27.000> then<00:04:28.000> I

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
guys can figure it out this year then I

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.820 
guys can figure it out this year then I
definitely<00:04:28.510> think<00:04:28.810> you<00:04:28.990> could<00:04:29.200> see<00:04:29.409> Houston

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
definitely think you could see Houston

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.830 
definitely think you could see Houston
really<00:04:30.460> make<00:04:30.849> a<00:04:30.880> serious<00:04:31.360> run<00:04:31.419> at<00:04:31.630> the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
really make a serious run at the

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.360 
really make a serious run at the
playoffs<00:04:32.110> but<00:04:32.979> it's

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
playoffs but it's

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.100 
playoffs but it's
take<00:04:33.639> ton<00:04:33.880> it's<00:04:34.300> going<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.630> take<00:04:34.810> time<00:04:35.050> and

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
take ton it's going to take time and

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.129 
take ton it's going to take time and
quite<00:04:35.680> honestly<00:04:35.970> if<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.300> was<00:04:37.449> the<00:04:37.570> coach<00:04:37.810> I

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
quite honestly if I was the coach I

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.189 
quite honestly if I was the coach I
would<00:04:38.500> probably<00:04:38.710> put<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.400> ball<00:04:39.639> in<00:04:40.270> Jeremy's

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
would probably put the ball in Jeremy's

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.710 
would probably put the ball in Jeremy's
hands<00:04:41.530> more<00:04:41.830> than<00:04:42.040> 10<00:04:42.400> hardens<00:04:42.850> for<00:04:43.600> the

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
hands more than 10 hardens for the

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.990 
hands more than 10 hardens for the
simple<00:04:44.110> fact<00:04:44.139> that<00:04:44.620> hardens<00:04:45.400> better<00:04:45.639> off<00:04:45.820> the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
simple fact that hardens better off the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.610 
simple fact that hardens better off the
ball<00:04:46.150> right<00:04:46.330> now<00:04:46.360> Jeremy<00:04:47.169> needs<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.440> get<00:04:47.590> a

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
ball right now Jeremy needs to get a

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.100 
ball right now Jeremy needs to get a
shot<00:04:47.949> together<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.330> might<00:04:49.479> just<00:04:49.630> work<00:04:49.720> best

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
shot together so it might just work best

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.110 
shot together so it might just work best
in<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.380> short<00:04:50.650> term<00:04:50.830> for<00:04:51.010> Jeremy<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.639> have<00:04:52.090> a

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
in the short term for Jeremy to have a

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.820 
in the short term for Jeremy to have a
little<00:04:52.570> bit<00:04:52.780> more<00:04:52.930> control<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.500> ball<00:04:53.680> but

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
little bit more control the ball but

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.980 
little bit more control the ball but
we'll<00:04:54.040> see<00:04:54.310> look<00:04:54.880> that's<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.330> update<00:04:55.780> for
