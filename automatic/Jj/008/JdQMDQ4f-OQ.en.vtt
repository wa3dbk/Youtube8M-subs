ventricular septal defect it is the

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.259 
ventricular septal defect it is the
Communist<00:00:07.189> congenital<00:00:08.189> heart<00:00:08.490> disease<00:00:08.940> and

Communist congenital heart disease and

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.530 
Communist congenital heart disease and
it<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.380> hole<00:00:11.160> between<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.849> two<00:00:12.030> pumping

it is a hole between the two pumping

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.499 
it is a hole between the two pumping
chambers<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.200> heart<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.769> heart<00:00:14.490> has<00:00:14.700> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
basically two sides to it one side that

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.630 
basically two sides to it one side that
