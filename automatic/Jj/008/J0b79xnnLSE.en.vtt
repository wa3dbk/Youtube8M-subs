00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.370 
building a trail in Florida in fact
we've<00:00:11.910> had<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.150> problem<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.900> finding

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
we've had a problem in finding

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.160 
we've had a problem in finding
remoteness<00:00:14.089> because<00:00:15.089> Florida<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.570> flat<00:00:15.900> so

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
remoteness because Florida is flat so

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.760 
remoteness because Florida is flat so
much<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.800> be<00:00:16.830> built<00:00:17.160> on<00:00:17.960> but<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.020> would

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
much of it can be built on but I would

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.220 
much of it can be built on but I would
assure<00:00:19.890> everybody<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.760> hiking<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.720> Florida

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
