hi<00:00:19.820> guys<00:00:20.030> thanks<00:00:20.450> for<00:00:20.480> tuning<00:00:20.600> in<00:00:20.960> today<00:00:21.590> we're

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
hi guys thanks for tuning in today we're

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.109 
hi guys thanks for tuning in today we're
taking<00:00:21.950> a<00:00:22.190> look<00:00:22.310> at<00:00:22.490> something<00:00:22.880> that<00:00:23.000> is

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
taking a look at something that is

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.640 
taking a look at something that is
normally<00:00:23.570> considered<00:00:23.900> a<00:00:24.140> total<00:00:24.320> piece<00:00:24.619> of

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
normally considered a total piece of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.250 
normally considered a total piece of
junk<00:00:24.950> which<00:00:25.340> is<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:25.730> ANU<00:00:26.060> 94<00:00:26.720> bullpup

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
junk which is the ANU 94 bullpup

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.510 
junk which is the ANU 94 bullpup
conversion<00:00:27.500> kit<00:00:28.010> for<00:00:28.040> the<00:00:28.910> a.k<00:00:29.500> rifle<00:00:30.520> however

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
conversion kit for the a.k rifle however

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.340 
conversion kit for the a.k rifle however
it<00:00:32.150> turns<00:00:32.360> out<00:00:32.510> with<00:00:32.660> a<00:00:32.690> little<00:00:32.930> bit<00:00:33.080> of<00:00:33.199> work

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
it turns out with a little bit of work

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.540 
it turns out with a little bit of work
you<00:00:33.500> can<00:00:33.650> actually<00:00:33.949> turn<00:00:34.100> one<00:00:34.309> of<00:00:34.340> these<00:00:34.489> into

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
you can actually turn one of these into

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.160 
you can actually turn one of these into
something<00:00:35.330> reasonably<00:00:36.140> decent<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:38.050> just<00:00:39.050> a

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
something reasonably decent so just a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.080 
something reasonably decent so just a
quick<00:00:39.530> overview<00:00:39.710> of<00:00:40.070> how<00:00:40.280> this<00:00:40.460> thing<00:00:40.520> goes

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
quick overview of how this thing goes

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.360 
quick overview of how this thing goes
together<00:00:41.360> we<00:00:42.199> have<00:00:42.320> our<00:00:42.440> normal<00:00:42.590> aka<00:00:43.010> receiver

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
together we have our normal aka receiver

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.610 
together we have our normal aka receiver
back<00:00:43.640> here<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.030> instead<00:00:44.989> of<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.350> typical

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
back here and instead of a typical

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.130 
back here and instead of a typical
buttstock<00:00:46.220> there<00:00:46.879> is<00:00:47.090> this<00:00:47.390> piece<00:00:47.690> that<00:00:47.960> just

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
buttstock there is this piece that just

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.080 
buttstock there is this piece that just
gives<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:48.470> a<00:00:48.710> little<00:00:49.309> butt<00:00:49.610> plate<00:00:49.820> there<00:00:50.000> at

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
gives you a little butt plate there at

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.560 
gives you a little butt plate there at
the<00:00:50.180> back

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
the back

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.530

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
these come with in addition a like a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.219 
these come with in addition a like a
block<00:01:04.879> on<00:01:05.119> top<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.540> front<00:01:05.750> sight<00:01:05.960> that

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
block on top of the front sight that

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.770 
block on top of the front sight that
holds<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.560> front<00:01:06.740> side<00:01:06.920> up<00:01:07.100> even<00:01:07.580> higher<00:01:07.780> to

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
holds the front side up even higher to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.779 
holds the front side up even higher to
go<00:01:08.930> with<00:01:09.170> an<00:01:09.350> elevated<00:01:09.950> rear<00:01:10.190> sight<00:01:10.460> so<00:01:10.759> that

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
go with an elevated rear sight so that

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:12.430 
go with an elevated rear sight so that
you<00:01:11.060> can<00:01:11.240> put<00:01:11.600> your<00:01:11.720> cheek<00:01:11.899> on<00:01:11.990> top<00:01:12.259> of<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
you can put your cheek on top of the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.230 
you can put your cheek on top of the
receiver<00:01:12.800> here<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.280> still<00:01:13.850> get<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.030> sight

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
receiver here and still get a sight

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.749 
receiver here and still get a sight
picture<00:01:14.560> out<00:01:15.560> of<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.800> box<00:01:16.009> those<00:01:16.340> are<00:01:16.520> pretty

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
picture out of the box those are pretty

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.020 
picture out of the box those are pretty
flimsy<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.390> wobbly<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:17.960> well<00:01:18.590> crappy<00:01:19.030> the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
flimsy and wobbly and well crappy the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.779 
flimsy and wobbly and well crappy the
trigger<00:01:20.330> pull<00:01:20.830> we'll<00:01:21.830> take<00:01:22.009> a<00:01:22.039> look<00:01:22.280> at<00:01:22.399> inside

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
trigger pull we'll take a look at inside

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.550 
trigger pull we'll take a look at inside
in<00:01:22.970> just<00:01:23.149> a<00:01:23.270> sec<00:01:23.450> there's<00:01:23.959> actually<00:01:24.319> a<00:01:24.350> long

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
in just a sec there's actually a long

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.040 
in just a sec there's actually a long
connecting<00:01:25.069> wire<00:01:25.220> running<00:01:25.520> down<00:01:25.899> along<00:01:26.899> the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
connecting wire running down along the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.690 
connecting wire running down along the
handguard<00:01:27.410> inside<00:01:28.069> the<00:01:28.190> corner<00:01:28.490> of<00:01:28.580> the

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
handguard inside the corner of the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.389 
handguard inside the corner of the
receiver<00:01:29.090> back<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.020> hole<00:01:30.289> drilled<00:01:30.619> in<00:01:31.069> the

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
receiver back to a hole drilled in the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.850 
receiver back to a hole drilled in the
trigger<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.119> that<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.259> original<00:01:33.440> trigger

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
trigger so that the the original trigger

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.740 
trigger so that the the original trigger
so<00:01:34.399> when<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.610> pull<00:01:34.819> this<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.209> pulls<00:01:35.450> on<00:01:35.630> this

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
so when you pull this it pulls on this

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.520 
so when you pull this it pulls on this
wire<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:37.360> releases<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.750> firing<00:01:39.080> mechanism

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
wire and releases the firing mechanism

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.180 
wire and releases the firing mechanism
and<00:01:39.709> that's<00:01:40.399> generally<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:41.030> very<00:01:41.509> stiff

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
and that's generally a very stiff

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.719 
and that's generally a very stiff
springy<00:01:43.190> crappy<00:01:43.940> long<00:01:44.509> heavy<00:01:44.840> trigger<00:01:45.200> pull

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
springy crappy long heavy trigger pull

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.820 
springy crappy long heavy trigger pull
so<00:01:46.729> let's<00:01:47.209> take<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.390> look<00:01:47.539> inside<00:01:47.720> this<00:01:48.080> and

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
so let's take a look inside this and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.010 
so let's take a look inside this and
take<00:01:49.190> a<00:01:49.220> look<00:01:49.399> at<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.580> changes<00:01:50.119> I<00:01:50.360> thought<00:01:50.929> he

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
take a look at the changes I thought he

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.589 
take a look at the changes I thought he
made<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.410> this<00:01:51.590> one<00:01:52.330> disassembly<00:01:53.330> is<00:01:53.360> just

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
made to this one disassembly is just

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.930 
made to this one disassembly is just
like<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.750> normal<00:01:53.929> like<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.459> pull<00:01:55.459> off<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.759> top

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
like a normal like a pull off the top

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.660 
like a normal like a pull off the top
cover<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.539> see<00:01:56.690> there<00:01:56.810> are<00:01:56.869> a<00:01:56.899> couple<00:01:57.020> little

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
cover and see there are a couple little

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.479 
cover and see there are a couple little
attachments<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:58.759> there<00:01:58.910> for<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.420> cheek<00:01:59.630> piece

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:00.489 
attachments in there for the cheek piece

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:06.669 
attachments in there for the cheek piece
and<00:02:02.679> pull<00:02:03.679> out<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.860> recoil<00:02:04.280> spring<00:02:05.560> pull<00:02:06.560> out

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
and pull out the recoil spring pull out

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.370 
and pull out the recoil spring pull out
the<00:02:06.800> bolt<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.190> carrier<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:08.810> our<00:02:08.899> connecting

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
the bolt and carrier so our connecting

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.600 
the bolt and carrier so our connecting
wire<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.800> right<00:02:09.979> down<00:02:10.130> here<00:02:10.340> at<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.520> bottom

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
wire is right down here at the bottom

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.880 
wire is right down here at the bottom
when<00:02:11.599> I<00:02:11.630> pull<00:02:11.900> on<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.140> trigger<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.560> can<00:02:12.590> see

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
when I pull on the trigger you can see

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
it moves bit and what it connects to is

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.699

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
dremel marks this was not a hugely

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.729 
dremel marks this was not a hugely
professional<00:02:39.770> type<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.130> operation<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.739> it

surface<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.560> trigger<00:02:45.739> pole<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.160> shorter

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
surface so the trigger pole is shorter

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.940 
surface so the trigger pole is shorter
and<00:02:46.670> lighter<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.870> little<00:02:48.380> more<00:02:48.500> work<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.830> could

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
and lighter a little more work it could

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.590 
and lighter a little more work it could
actually<00:02:49.100> be<00:02:49.280> improved<00:02:49.670> even<00:02:50.030> more<00:02:50.360> than<00:02:50.510> it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600
