else did I notice yeah i think the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.340 
else did I notice yeah i think the
Sailor<00:01:21.030> Moon<00:01:21.210> thing<00:01:21.420> was<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> big<00:01:22.049> part

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
Sailor Moon thing was like the big part

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.810 
Sailor Moon thing was like the big part
that<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.560> thought<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.189> show<00:01:23.369> was<00:01:23.549> really

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that I thought the show was really

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.170 
that I thought the show was really
similar<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:26.520> know<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.850> you've<00:01:27.060> ever

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
similar to and you know if you've ever

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.670 
similar to and you know if you've ever
seen<00:01:27.479> Sailor<00:01:27.780> Moon<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.500> that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
seen Sailor Moon you would have that

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.890 
seen Sailor Moon you would have that
really<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.670> piano<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> background

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
really the piano in the background

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.560 
really the piano in the background
during<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.579> Steven<00:01:32.970> universe<00:01:33.000> episode

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
during this the Steven universe episode

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.859

of the theme song and in Sailor Moon

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.969 
of the theme song and in Sailor Moon
episodes<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> would<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> piano

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
episodes you would have the piano

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.010 
episodes you would have the piano
version<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.939> Sailor<00:01:42.150> Moon<00:01:42.360> theme<00:01:42.600> song<00:01:42.840> in

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.499 
version of the Sailor Moon theme song in
it<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.920> was<00:01:44.220> kind<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.520> similar<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.090> way

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
it so it was kind of similar in that way

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.429 
it so it was kind of similar in that way
and<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.530> general<00:01:46.710> idea<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.399> there<00:01:48.439> you

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
and just the general idea that there you
