00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello your love here is kathrin again 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.719
 of 9999 things the children's channel and me 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.509
 have another product from violetta 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.199
 bought and this is here 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.260
 around the netbook and I have it over 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.180
 Amazon ordered the price was about 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.570
 so six euros and I have somehow 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.890
 to read something about this 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.110
 but a book in french is fortunate 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.820
 are the description in there like that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.190
 beautifully figuratively explains that one is 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.940
 can actually think what you do 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.100
 must and who knows as one hundred percent 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.870
 would like to give the French text 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.840
 stop at the google translator 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.840
 and then something comes out what 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.190
 So I'll find it written in it 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.559
 That's really nice if you violetta 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.000
 falls and I say there is yes 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.369
 on the whole I find on the internet 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.500
 nail designs everywhere so that's why 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.670
 you would not need to buy the book 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.650
 but as it is so if you bio 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.869
 liter content is then you want on 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.090
 dearest have everything and I say so 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:25.500
 a small little plus point has that 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.869
 book and indeed are stickers 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.090
 contain 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:37.560
 you see here is full or 132 pages 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.119
 with stickers with nail design and me 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.540
 Show you what it's good for 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.540
 is 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.509
 here still begins quite normally 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.439
 and then the drama just started in everything 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.439
 French 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.670
 so here is a bit like that 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.290
 explains but that knows everything and everything 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.409
 Then there are the nails here 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.450
 cleans and cleans up before going with the 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.329
 painting starts is very important 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.009
 and also that you drag them in shape 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.330
 and not easy due to ships nails 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.300
 it does not look all that 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.370
 nice and then show step 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.150
 step by step how to make the nails 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.489
 should 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.170
 I show the book has exactly because 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.730
 I do not know how that behaves when 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.459
 I leaf through the whole book 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.760
 if that is allowed and I'll show you 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:34.569
 now just here you see so short 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.970
 then nail 1 nail before painting too 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.489
 so sponge what make pluck then 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.650
 and then finally see the nails like that 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.940
 out and that are different 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.599
 instructions on how to do that 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.739
 can and at the very back 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:55.810
 Do you have teacher's hands and come here 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.820

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.380
 So now you can do your hand here 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:05.019

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.150
 nice gift idea for a friend 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.109
 There were also birthday parties 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.269
 not too expensive 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:14.950
 6 euro yes is okay and yes as I said 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.390

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.650

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.470
 time the nail design so in the hammer 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.230
