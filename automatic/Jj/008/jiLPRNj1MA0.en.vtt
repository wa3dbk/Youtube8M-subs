00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.430
 hi how about 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.259
 Today we are going to explain to you what it consists of 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.260
 this to synchronize the flash to high 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.929
 speeds that is how it is done and 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.150
 We will try to explain some doubts that 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.430
 they raise us with some frequency in 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.220
 first place I would like to define two 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.279
 concepts that are confused many times 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.930
 is the difference between the speed of 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.910
 flash and the speed of 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.189
 synchronization today we're going to see how it 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.349
 it produces the synchronization of a flash 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.420
 with the camera shutter to see it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.540
 more clearly we are going to resort to a 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.360
 analog film camera because of 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.530
 this way we can see the shutter 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.850
 directly said by the way- 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.789
 Exactly 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.800
 the same in a digital camera although all 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.570
 It happens very quickly when 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.700
 we press the firing button 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.610
 from one camera the following occurs 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.129
 sequence mirror rises opens 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.660
 the first shutter curtain 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.489
 elapses timer times 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.340
 closes the second shutter curtain 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.470
 lower the mirror then in the cameras 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.790
 digital a motorized mechanism is 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.280
 handles drag 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.350
 the shutter arm it for the next 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.990
 take something that in this camera we do 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.970
 manually when we use a flash the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.130
 system is responsible for jumping the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.290
 flash just at the moment when the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.210
 Shutter is completely open 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.100
 as we increase the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.660
 shutter speed time 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.820
 during which the shutter is 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.160
 completely open is increasingly 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.320
 short but there comes a time when the 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.480
 curtains can no longer be accelerated anymore 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.150
 from this moment if we continue 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.580
 increasing the shutter speed the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.590
 second curtain comes a moment in 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.110
 that starts moving before the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.910
 first you have finished your tour of 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.830
 this way the time of 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.630
 exposure at the expense of that in no 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.660
 moment the shutter is completely 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.340
 open in fact it transforms into a 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.200
 sort of slit that moves to 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.479
 all along the frame if 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.210
 we try to take a picture with flash in 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.310
 this speed will appear the second 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.350
 curtain on the frame in the form of 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.970
 a dark band although to many it has 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.530
 gone something like this sometime for 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.270
 avoid this problem the cameras 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.430
 digital when they mount a flash 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.350
 dedicated do not allow input anymore 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.610
 set a shutter speed 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.020
 faster than 1 200 or 1 250 second 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.730
 depending on the brand 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.440
 this can bring us some 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.260
 inconveniences when it comes to wanting 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.310
 use the flash outdoors 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.170
 suppose we want to make a 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.060
 photography in broad daylight with a 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.910
 very open diaphragm to get a 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.470
 nice defocused background and use the 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.750
 flash to compensate for a possible 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.520
 backlight as well the speed of 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.070
 shutter we need to work 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.610
 with this open fragma day is very 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.590
 over these 1,200 are about 250 of 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.390
 second that allow us to use the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.610
 flash in most cameras a 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.490
 some level unfortunately not in the 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.680
 basic there is the way to skip this 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.490
 problem is about synchronization 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.040
 high speed hs s in canon or auto 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.140
 fp in icon let's see how 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.480
 we found how we adjusted it and how 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.030
 we can adjust it 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.250
 from the flash itself through this 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.120
 button that is already marked with lightning and 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.740
 the letter h when pressing it appears that 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.350
 the flash is ready for 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.330
 synchronize at high speed so what 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.820
 we can do through the menu of the 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.790
 camera we turn on the menu in the first 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:32.650
 screen flash control 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.670
 and adjust external flash functions 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.400
 sealing synchro 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.349
 high speed he or with instead what 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.700
 we have to always do from the menu 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.069
 of the camera 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.210
 we go 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:51.840
 to the custom configuration menu 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.350
 section and why speed flash side 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:00.480
 flash sync and we adjust 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:03.120
 auto fp and so far we can adjust 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.690
 any shutter speed by 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.120
 over about 250 seconds in both 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.730
 cases the flash at the time of shooting 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.740
 instead of making a single flash what 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.739
 what it will do will be multiple flashes 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.960
 repeated very quickly that for 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.450
 understand each other in a simple way 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.220
 they would emulate a continuous light we just 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.530
 let's see a single flash of flash 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.050
 but in reality it will have fired 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.120
 many times all the time in 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.460
 that the slit of the shutter is gone 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.220
 moving very quickly by 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.140
 in front of the frame obviously this 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.900
 requires much more effort than flash 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.790
 in such a way that the scope is seen 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.710
 significantly reduced hence the 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.680
 need to use a flash as much 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.920
 powerful possible then what does it mean 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.690
 than a flash according to the specifications 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.880
 can crash a 5000 ago of 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.550
 second or even more 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.560
 because advertising tells us that in 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.270
 these cases we can freeze until the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.250
 move faster what in reality 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.590
 is telling us is that the duration of 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.000
 flash is 15 thousand I do second no 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.910
 let this be the shutter speed 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.070
 it is very different in a situation where 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.350
 the speed of a 200 to vore second and 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.180
 the chosen diaphragm do not allow us 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.000
 Take the picture due to lack of light 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.630
 the time during which it will be 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.790
 exposed the reason will be the same as the 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.190
 duration of flash flash if this one 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.890
 it is very short it will allow us to freeze 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.410
 until the fastest movement let's see a 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.270
 example if with the light that I have in this 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.670
 room I intend to take a picture 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.160
 to a 200 second water and a diaphragm 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.490
 11 the result that I'm going to get is 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.490
 this 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.000
 nothing absolute black if I use the flash 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:51.129
 this will be the only light that will illuminate the 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.840
 subject that will fit me correctly 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:55.740
 exposed as long as it's okay 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.740
 clear adjusted is 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.980
 now with a studio flash 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.890
 conventional the duration of the flash 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.080
 it can be excessively long in the case 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.880
 that the subject moves quickly and 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.409
 the photograph may appear moved in 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.300
 some point 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:18.300
 1 2 3 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.800
 if instead he used a flash 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.540
 able to provide a flash of 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.240
 high speed or what is the same as 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.830
 very short duration the subject does not 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.830
 will be moved at all 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.440
 the data referring to the duration of the 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.300
 flash of the flashes should 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.760
 always appear in the specifications 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.800
 techniques of them and it is important 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.510
 that we look at it next 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.780
 chapter we do it in the street of 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.780
 agreement
