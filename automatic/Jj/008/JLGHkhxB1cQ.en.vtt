said that it would improve the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.300 
said that it would improve the
performance<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> game<00:00:18.800> now<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.980> also

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
performance of the game now it also

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.490

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
aimed to fix control issues some bugs

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.310 
aimed to fix control issues some bugs
and<00:00:22.800> crashes<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.869> honestly<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.990> actually

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and crashes but honestly I actually

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.620 
and crashes but honestly I actually
don't<00:00:25.619> think<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:25.890> done<00:00:26.099> much<00:00:26.369> at<00:00:26.580> all<00:00:26.910> in

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
don't think it's done much at all in

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
don't think it's done much at all in
terms<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.230> controls<00:00:28.650> all<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.220> done<00:00:29.400> is

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
terms of the controls all it's done is

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.980 
terms of the controls all it's done is
giving<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> ability<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.480> change<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
giving you the ability to change the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.780 
giving you the ability to change the
size<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> bat<00:00:31.590> touchpad<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.489> me<00:00:32.610> that

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
size of the bat touchpad but for me that

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.639 
size of the bat touchpad but for me that
was<00:00:32.880> never<00:00:33.030> really<00:00:33.420> an<00:00:33.510> issue<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.530> obviously

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
was never really an issue but obviously

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.250 
was never really an issue but obviously
that<00:00:34.920> has<00:00:35.130> helped<00:00:35.430> some<00:00:35.579> people<00:00:35.719> it<00:00:36.719> also<00:00:36.899> said

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
that has helped some people it also said

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
that has helped some people it also said
it<00:00:37.380> was<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> fix<00:00:37.980> audio<00:00:38.219> issues<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:39.000> I'm

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
it was going to fix audio issues but I'm

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150

disappearing and you know a couple of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.090 
disappearing and you know a couple of
other<00:00:45.480> weird<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.170> peculiarities<00:00:46.710> which

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
other weird you know peculiarities which

other weird you know peculiarities which
on<00:00:47.670> by<00:00:48.420> no<00:00:48.480> means<00:00:48.750> sort<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.110> game<00:00:49.829> changing<00:00:49.860> but

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
on by no means sort of game changing but

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.580 
on by no means sort of game changing but
they<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:51.059> add<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.600> make<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.379> bit

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
they do just add up to make a little bit

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.029 
they do just add up to make a little bit
of<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> broken<00:00:53.129> experience<00:00:54.590> but<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.710> mean<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
of a broken experience but I mean the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.529 
of a broken experience but I mean the
main<00:00:56.190> thing<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.460> really<00:00:56.699> want<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.239> how<00:00:57.300> this

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
main thing I really want to see how this

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.029 
main thing I really want to see how this
patch<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.469> performance<00:00:58.949> improvements

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
patch was some performance improvements

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.060

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
say that actually runs quite well and I

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.570 
say that actually runs quite well and I
stand<00:01:07.020> by<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> mean<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:08.070> Borderlands<00:01:08.400> 2

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580

stand by that I mean for Borderlands 2
on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> Vita<00:01:09.030> most<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> time<00:01:09.930> you'll

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
on the Vita most of the time you'll

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.719 
on the Vita most of the time you'll
actually<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.920> all<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.490> game

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
actually just be in all that this game

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.910 
actually just be in all that this game
runs<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.299> well<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.750> looks<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.439> great<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.770> mean

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
runs so well and looks so great I mean

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.830 
runs so well and looks so great I mean
compared<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.880> console<00:01:15.270> versions<00:01:15.630> it's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
compared to the console versions it's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.230 
compared to the console versions it's
obviously<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.340> good<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.729> you'll<00:01:18.090> only

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
obviously not as good and you'll only

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.030 
obviously not as good and you'll only
notice<00:01:18.689> what's<00:01:18.869> missing<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.920> you

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
notice what's missing but if you

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.560 
notice what's missing but if you
actually<00:01:20.340> put<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.640> side<00:01:20.820> by<00:01:21.030> side<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.450> all

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
actually put this side by side with all

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
actually put this side by side with all
the<00:01:21.689> other<00:01:21.810> Vita<00:01:22.049> games<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:23.159> actually<00:01:23.520> one

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the other Vita games it's actually one

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700 
the other Vita games it's actually one
of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> best<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.299> terms<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> visuals<00:01:25.110> so

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
of the best in terms of the visuals so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.170 
of the best in terms of the visuals so
if<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.920> take<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.310> along<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.970> fact

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
if you take that along with the fact

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.240 
if you take that along with the fact
that<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.630> fully<00:01:27.930> open<00:01:28.170> world<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:29.040> no

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that it's a fully open world it's no

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
that it's a fully open world it's no
surprise<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.909> doesn't<00:01:30.150> run<00:01:30.299> well<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
surprise that it doesn't run well and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.990 
surprise that it doesn't run well and
that<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> problem<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.280> mean<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.729> honest

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that is a problem I mean to be honest

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.490 
that is a problem I mean to be honest
I'd<00:01:33.119> actually<00:01:33.420> rather<00:01:33.540> they<00:01:33.960> toned<00:01:34.229> down<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
I'd actually rather they toned down the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.830 
I'd actually rather they toned down the
graphics<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.040> bit<00:01:35.189> more<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.000> accommodate

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
graphics a bit more just to accommodate

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
graphics a bit more just to accommodate
a<00:01:37.380> smoother<00:01:37.950> framerate<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.579> mean<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.850> don't<00:01:39.030> even

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
a smoother framerate I mean I don't even

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.870 
a smoother framerate I mean I don't even
mind<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.659> runs<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.049> lower<00:01:40.259> resolution

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
mind if it runs a lower resolution

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.580 
mind if it runs a lower resolution
anything<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.509> running<00:01:43.229> better

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
anything just to get it running better

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.789 
anything just to get it running better
and<00:01:44.299> I<00:01:45.299> mean<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> lot<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.810> people<00:01:45.899> suggested<00:01:46.680> if

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and I mean a lot of people suggested if

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.319 
and I mean a lot of people suggested if
they<00:01:47.009> remove<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> black<00:01:47.640> outlines<00:01:48.090> out<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
they remove the black outlines out of

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.030 
they remove the black outlines out of
the<00:01:48.450> objects<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.200> will<00:01:49.320> also<00:01:49.470> help<00:01:49.799> and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the objects then that will also help and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.100 
the objects then that will also help and
that<00:01:50.250> was<00:01:50.399> something<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.570> lot<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.780> people

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
that was something that a lot of people

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.080 
that was something that a lot of people
did<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> PC<00:01:52.890> version<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.909> run

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
did on the PC version to get that to run

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.730 
did on the PC version to get that to run
better<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.630> should<00:01:54.810> really<00:01:55.079> help<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.470> -

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
better so it should really help here -

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.190 
better so it should really help here -
and<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.939> read<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.299> hope<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.600> fix<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and I read you hope they fix this in the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.380 
and I read you hope they fix this in the
future<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.590> I've<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.340> got<00:01:59.549> no<00:01:59.850> high<00:02:00.149> hopes

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
future but I've now got no high hopes

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.990 
future but I've now got no high hopes
because<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.829> know<00:02:01.979> they<00:02:02.100> did<00:02:02.280> actually<00:02:02.490> claim

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
because you know they did actually claim

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.520 
because you know they did actually claim
that<00:02:03.030> they<00:02:03.329> were<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.719> fix<00:02:03.990> performance

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
that they were going to fix performance

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.740 
that they were going to fix performance
issues<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.100> honestly<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:05.640> happen<00:02:05.969> having

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
issues and honestly they happen having

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.150 
issues and honestly they happen having
said<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:06.960> though<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.770> some<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
said that though this is some of the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.850 
said that though this is some of the
most<00:02:08.399> fun<00:02:08.789> I've<00:02:09.030> had<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.569> Vita<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
most fun I've had on the Vita and the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.020 
most fun I've had on the Vita and the
fact<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.250> there<00:02:11.400> are<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> few<00:02:11.640> framerate

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
fact that there are a few framerate

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.970 
fact that there are a few framerate
drops<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.720> annoying

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
drops is annoying

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.589 
drops is annoying
and<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.250> does<00:02:14.489> interrupt<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.209> little<00:02:15.390> bit

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
and it does interrupt it a little bit

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.229 
and it does interrupt it a little bit
but<00:02:15.930> honestly<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:17.069> actually<00:02:17.430> still<00:02:17.819> am<00:02:18.090> having

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
but honestly I actually still am having

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.960 
but honestly I actually still am having
loads<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.930> fun<00:02:18.989> with<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.379> game<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.849> only

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
loads of fun with this game so it's only

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.660 
loads of fun with this game so it's only

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
know I'm a good way through the game

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.229 
know I'm a good way through the game
I've<00:02:25.200> played<00:02:25.230> for<00:02:25.549> probably<00:02:26.549> 10<00:02:26.790> hours<00:02:26.970> or<00:02:27.180> so

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
I've played for probably 10 hours or so

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.960 
I've played for probably 10 hours or so
and<00:02:27.690> that's<00:02:28.530> alright<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:28.980> mean<00:02:29.310> both<00:02:29.459> times<00:02:29.819> it

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
and that's alright I mean both times it

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.190 
and that's alright I mean both times it
crashed<00:02:30.209> from<00:02:30.360> me<00:02:30.510> was<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.019> birdshot

stronghold<00:02:32.069> which<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.489> where<00:02:32.670> most<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
stronghold which is where most of the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.300 
stronghold which is where most of the
bug<00:02:33.720> fixing<00:02:34.170> has<00:02:34.290> actually<00:02:34.590> been<00:02:34.709> targeted

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
bug fixing has actually been targeted

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.900 
bug fixing has actually been targeted
and<00:02:35.790> some<00:02:36.150> reason<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.750> performance

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
and some reason in the performance

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.550 
and some reason in the performance
category<00:02:38.910> they've<00:02:39.480> actually<00:02:39.629> only<00:02:39.959> improved

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
category they've actually only improved

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.770 
category they've actually only improved
performance<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.579> one<00:02:41.790> location<00:02:42.569> which

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
performance in that one location which

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.839 
performance in that one location which
is<00:02:42.930> very<00:02:43.650> unusual<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.310> can't<00:02:44.549> think<00:02:44.730> what

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
is very unusual and I can't think what

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.130 
is very unusual and I can't think what
they<00:02:44.970> would<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.150> done<00:02:45.269> just<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.840> improve

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
they would have done just to improve

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.229 
they would have done just to improve
performance<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.709> one<00:02:46.860> place<00:02:47.129> but<00:02:47.489> that's<00:02:48.030> what

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
performance in one place but that's what

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.670 
performance in one place but that's what
they<00:02:48.360> claim<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.629> do<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.200> that's<00:02:49.349> what<00:02:49.530> they

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
they claim to do and that's what they

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.150 
they claim to do and that's what they
have<00:02:49.709> done<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.510> be<00:02:51.629> honest<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:52.170> not<00:02:52.590> overly

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
have done so to be honest I'm not overly

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.099 
have done so to be honest I'm not overly
impressed<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.940> still<00:02:54.329> really<00:02:54.720> really

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
impressed but I still really really

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.539 
impressed but I still really really
recommend<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.680> game<00:02:55.920> if<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.340> like

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
recommend this game if you like
