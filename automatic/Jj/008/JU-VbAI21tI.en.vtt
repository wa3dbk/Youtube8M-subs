00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.630
 or security today is origami Monday 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.730
 but first do not forget to go and see 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.710
 the Thursday video of craft what 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.220
 I want to show them how to make a payment 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.439
 real and in Japanese it is said that 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.750
 you can make blank and then decorate it 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.760
 and it will be great for you to make 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.470
 this real game we keep the base of the 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.599
 tsuru that by the way I leave by 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.699
 here we will make a couple of modifications 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.129
 as I had told you in videos 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.729
 previous but same is super easy to 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.710
 do so let's see how it's done 

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:43.129
 We will use a square format sheet 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.870
 of the size that you prefer we will double 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.879
 in half 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.660
 then we will fold in half but 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.300
 opposite side 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.580
 we will open we will turn around so that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.410
 folds are up and now 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.540
 we will bend diagonally 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.030
 we will open and double 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.860
 diagonal but on the opposite side 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.220
 then we will raise and talk about this 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.220
 way 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.760
 it should be something like that the part that 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.890
 it opens we leave it down 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.170
 eloy took the lower left edge 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.170
 towards the center in this way 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.539
 and we will repeat this with the right edge 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.369
 on the top there will be formed a 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.180
 triangle we will bend by the line 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.490
 lower in this way then unfold 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.110
 we have and we will take the tip up 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.560
 and we'll send the flaps in 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.610
 you should have something like this we will give the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.050
 back and we'll take the top edge 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.110
 left towards the center in this way 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.760
 unfold we have opened in the center 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.760
 and we will push 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.200
 we will close again and repeat this 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.200
 with the opposite side 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.049
 now we go again the edge 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.170
 top left and we take it from 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.640
 new to the center we open we push 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.640
 and we close again 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.780
 and we will do the same with the other flap 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.780
 what's left of the same side 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.790
 you will return all your place and repeat 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.790
 sixth with the right side 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.930
 look, this should have something like that 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.820
 we take this point down 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.270
 and we fold in half 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.340
 now follow me in these folds we fold 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.340
 and then we invert the fold 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.680
 and we repeat this we doubled and then 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.680
 we invert the fold 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.290
 and finally we will have to do the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.800
 head for that we'll just push a 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.050
 little bit and we'll reverse the fold 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.060
 and you're done, you're done to erase 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.060
 now you only have to decorate it 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.019
 and as you saw it is super easy to do 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.959
 you can do it with smaller leaves 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.030
 they are bigger and it can be super cool 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.769
 and do not forget to send me photos and 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.660
 perform this craft on the networks 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.540

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.270

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.560
 forget to imagine create and learn 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.560
