protection<00:00:44.930> from<00:00:45.530> I<00:00:45.859> don't<00:00:46.370> know<00:00:46.550> probably

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
protection from I don't know probably

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.130 
protection from I don't know probably
not<00:00:47.059> thieves<00:00:47.329> but<00:00:47.719> your<00:00:47.960> friends<00:00:48.350> I<00:00:48.440> guess<00:00:48.649> so

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
not thieves but your friends I guess so

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.450 
not thieves but your friends I guess so
basically<00:00:51.140> this<00:00:51.530> has<00:00:51.710> nothing<00:00:51.979> to<00:00:52.010> do<00:00:52.190> with<00:00:52.219> it

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
basically this has nothing to do with it

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.670 
basically this has nothing to do with it
so<00:00:52.789> when<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:53.299> lock<00:00:53.510> your<00:00:53.690> device<00:00:53.809> instead<00:00:54.619> of

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
so when you lock your device instead of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.469 
so when you lock your device instead of
having<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.100> average<00:00:55.399> passcode<00:00:55.909> where<00:00:56.269> you

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
having the average passcode where you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.689 
having the average passcode where you
put<00:00:56.659> in<00:00:56.780> one<00:00:56.989> two<00:00:57.140> three<00:00:57.320> four<00:00:57.619> or<00:00:57.890> zero<00:00:58.369> zero

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
put in one two three four or zero zero

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.160 
put in one two three four or zero zero
zero<00:00:58.789> or<00:00:59.030> whatever<00:00:59.420> your<00:00:59.600> password<00:00:59.989> is

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
zero or whatever your password is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.880 
zero or whatever your password is
instead<00:01:00.949> of<00:01:01.010> that<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.960> can<00:01:03.379> draw<00:01:03.680> your

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
instead of that you can draw your

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.630 
instead of that you can draw your
password<00:01:04.960> whe<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.440> is<00:01:06.770> not<00:01:07.009> my<00:01:07.130> password<00:01:07.520> by

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
password whe that is not my password by

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.520 
password whe that is not my password by
the<00:01:07.700> way<00:01:07.850> mine<00:01:08.509> is<00:01:08.690> something<00:01:09.050> nice<00:01:09.229> and

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
the way mine is something nice and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.570 
the way mine is something nice and
simple<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:10.780> smiley<00:01:11.780> face<00:01:12.069> no<00:01:13.069> I'm<00:01:13.190> kidding

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
simple a smiley face no I'm kidding

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.990 
simple a smiley face no I'm kidding
mine's<00:01:14.240> just<00:01:14.569> a<00:01:14.810> line<00:01:15.740> that's<00:01:16.039> it<00:01:16.280> I<00:01:16.429> keep<00:01:16.880> it

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
mine's just a line that's it I keep it

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.120 
mine's just a line that's it I keep it
simple<00:01:17.299> but<00:01:18.289> if<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:18.619> want<00:01:18.799> to<00:01:18.890> get<00:01:18.979> more

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
simple but if you want to get more

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.899 
simple but if you want to get more
complicated<00:01:19.459> that's<00:01:19.909> here<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:25.640> find

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
complicated that's here and you find

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.730 
complicated that's here and you find
where<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.390> says<00:01:26.600> stride<00:01:26.899> has<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.380> cool<00:01:27.619> little

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
where it says stride has a cool little

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.639 
where it says stride has a cool little
icon<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:28.640> it<00:01:28.940> gives<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:29.149> a<00:01:29.179> bunch<00:01:29.360> of<00:01:29.450> options

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
icon and it gives you a bunch of options

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.559 
icon and it gives you a bunch of options
enable<00:01:30.649> stride<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.159> obvious<00:01:31.549> if<00:01:31.789> you<00:01:32.060> want<00:01:32.299> to

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
enable stride is obvious if you want to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.529 
enable stride is obvious if you want to
disable<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.409> won't<00:01:33.649> have<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:33.920> passcode

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
disable it you won't have a passcode

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.880 
disable it you won't have a passcode
well<00:01:35.539> at<00:01:35.720> least<00:01:35.840> not<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:36.200> type<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.409> passcode

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
well at least not this type of passcode

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.690 
well at least not this type of passcode
enable<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.819> skip<00:01:38.659> pin<00:01:38.899> entry<00:01:39.079> so<00:01:39.829> that's<00:01:40.520> not

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
enable it skip pin entry so that's not

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.069 
enable it skip pin entry so that's not
my<00:01:40.820> problem<00:01:41.030> whether<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:41.479> want<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.719> type<00:01:41.869> in

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
my problem whether you want to type in

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.319 
my problem whether you want to type in
or<00:01:42.500> put<00:01:43.159> in<00:01:43.280> two<00:01:43.490> different<00:01:43.850> types<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.180> pass

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
or put in two different types of pass

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.749 
or put in two different types of pass
codes<00:01:44.630> which<00:01:44.930> if<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:45.469> were<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:45.770> disable<00:01:46.609> this

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
codes which if you were to disable this

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.690 
codes which if you were to disable this
I<00:01:47.030> would<00:01:47.750> have<00:01:47.930> to<00:01:48.079> type<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:48.500> my<00:01:48.799> pin<00:01:49.189> passcode

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
I would have to type in my pin passcode

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.830 
I would have to type in my pin passcode
along<00:01:50.509> with<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.939> strike<00:01:52.939> passcode<00:01:53.420> which<00:01:53.450> is

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
along with the strike passcode which is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.260 
along with the strike passcode which is
whatever<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:54.649> want<00:01:54.799> to<00:01:54.890> put<00:01:55.090> multi<00:01:56.090> shape

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
whatever you want to put multi shape

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.419 
whatever you want to put multi shape
passcode<00:01:56.810> basically<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:57.500> means<00:01:57.799> that<00:01:58.159> if

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
passcode basically just means that if

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.060 
passcode basically just means that if
you<00:01:58.579> want<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.090> make<00:01:59.899> it<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.109> house<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:00.679> will<00:02:00.890> let

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
you want to make it a house it will let

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.749 
you want to make it a house it will let
you<00:02:01.189> do<00:02:01.340> that

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
you do that

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.849 
you do that
but<00:02:02.630> if<00:02:02.719> you<00:02:02.810> want<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.020> keep<00:02:03.109> it<00:02:03.289> simple<00:02:03.679> and

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
but if you want to keep it simple and

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.669 
but if you want to keep it simple and
put<00:02:04.070> like<00:02:04.249> dots<00:02:04.520> or<00:02:04.759> something<00:02:05.119> that's<00:02:05.960> also

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
put like dots or something that's also

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.969 
put like dots or something that's also
possible<00:02:08.079> recognition<00:02:09.079> strictness<00:02:09.410> put<00:02:09.890> it

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
possible recognition strictness put it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.310 
possible recognition strictness put it
all<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.220> way<00:02:10.340> up<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:11.239> will<00:02:11.510> barely<00:02:11.989> be<00:02:12.170> able

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
all the way up you will barely be able

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.009 
all the way up you will barely be able
to<00:02:12.620> guess<00:02:13.160> your<00:02:13.340> own<00:02:13.430> passcode<00:02:13.970> keep<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.930> in

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
to guess your own passcode keep it in

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.660 
to guess your own passcode keep it in
the<00:02:15.079> middle<00:02:15.140> that's<00:02:15.859> where<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.130> like<00:02:16.400> it

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
the middle that's where I like it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.449 
the middle that's where I like it
it's<00:02:16.940> not<00:02:17.090> too<00:02:17.650> complicated<00:02:18.650> cuz<00:02:19.340> your

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
it's not too complicated cuz your

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.890 
it's not too complicated cuz your
fingers<00:02:19.819> will<00:02:20.030> like<00:02:20.209> move<00:02:20.420> around<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.780> little

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
fingers will like move around a little

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.380 
fingers will like move around a little
bit<00:02:21.109> and<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.500> won't<00:02:21.739> get<00:02:22.010> your<00:02:22.430> passcode<00:02:23.090> if

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
bit and you won't get your passcode if

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.569 
bit and you won't get your passcode if
it's<00:02:23.540> like<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:24.079> line<00:02:24.500> then<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.130> can<00:02:25.280> do<00:02:25.400> that

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
it's like a line then you can do that

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.430 
it's like a line then you can do that
but<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:26.030> won't<00:02:26.150> get<00:02:26.329> your<00:02:26.390> passcode<00:02:26.870> exactly

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
but you won't get your passcode exactly

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.099 
but you won't get your passcode exactly
every<00:02:27.650> single<00:02:27.890> time<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.420> mine's<00:02:29.780> was<00:02:29.959> right

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
every single time so mine's was right

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.390 
every single time so mine's was right
here<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.680> will<00:02:30.829> keep<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.100> there

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
here and I will keep it there

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.500 
here and I will keep it there
and<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.870> change<00:02:33.079> passcode<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:34.150> have<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.329> draw

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
and to change passcode you have to draw

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.880 
and to change passcode you have to draw
it<00:02:35.569> three<00:02:35.780> times<00:02:35.989> so<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.709> is<00:02:36.829> mine

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.570 

and<00:02:41.150> my<00:02:42.150> passcode<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.810> set<00:02:43.020> then<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:44.310> test

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
and my passcode is set then you can test

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.610 
and my passcode is set then you can test
your<00:02:44.760> passcode<00:02:45.210> before<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.930> use<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.500> case

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
your passcode before you use it in case

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.260 
your passcode before you use it in case
you<00:02:46.680> get<00:02:46.890> locked<00:02:47.130> out<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.340> your<00:02:47.520> device<00:02:47.670> that

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
you get locked out of your device that

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.770 
you get locked out of your device that
would<00:02:48.390> suck<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.760> works<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:52.860> works

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
would suck and that works that works

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.170 
would suck and that works that works
that<00:02:54.780> works<00:02:55.550> but<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.730> can<00:02:56.880> go<00:02:57.030> into

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
that works but you can go into

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.090 
that works but you can go into
recognition<00:02:57.750> strictness<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.560> all<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.040> a

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
recognition strictness and all of a

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.490 
recognition strictness and all of a
sudden<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:03.150> have<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.420> get<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.260> if

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
sudden you have to get it like that if

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.440 
sudden you have to get it like that if
you<00:03:04.650> were<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.890> put<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.100> nope

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
you were to put that nope

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.900 
you were to put that nope
if<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.900> were<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.050> put<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.350> nope<00:03:08.040> sure<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.760> put

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
if you were to put that nope sure to put

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.890 
if you were to put that nope sure to put
that<00:03:08.940> nope<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:10.890> get<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.100> point<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.780> keep<00:03:12.780> it

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
that nope so you get the point I keep it

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.260 
that nope so you get the point I keep it
there<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:14.010> couple<00:03:14.190> more<00:03:14.430> things<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.970> hide

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
there and a couple more things is hide

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.449 
there and a couple more things is hide
passcode<00:03:15.720> override<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.100> were<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.310> keep

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
passcode override so if I were to keep

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.710 
passcode override so if I were to keep
this<00:03:17.640> off<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:19.310> would<00:03:20.310> find<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:20.940> when<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.420> slid

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
this off I would find that when I slid

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.229 
this off I would find that when I slid
this<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.230> would<00:03:23.100> have<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.340> slow<00:03:23.550> keypad<00:03:24.000> here

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
this I would have the slow keypad here

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.570 
this I would have the slow keypad here
most<00:03:25.020> people<00:03:25.320> wouldn't<00:03:25.500> see<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.680> but<00:03:26.310> if

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
most people wouldn't see that but if

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.640 
most people wouldn't see that but if
they<00:03:26.850> were<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.000> press<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.450> all<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.380> sudden<00:03:28.590> my

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
they were to press it all of a sudden my

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.580 
they were to press it all of a sudden my
just<00:03:28.830> device<00:03:29.280> unlocks<00:03:30.180> by<00:03:30.360> itself<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.930> don't

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
just device unlocks by itself I don't

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.340 
just device unlocks by itself I don't
know<00:03:31.830> why<00:03:31.980> they<00:03:32.190> put<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.930> skip<00:03:33.930> slide<00:03:34.170> to

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
know why they put that in skip slide to

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.970 
know why they put that in skip slide to
unlock<00:03:34.380> is<00:03:34.980> basically<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:36.870> find<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:37.950> very

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
unlock is basically this I find it very

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.410 
unlock is basically this I find it very
annoying<00:03:38.400> but<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.760> might<00:03:39.030> like<00:03:39.180> it

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
annoying but you might like it

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.090 
annoying but you might like it
there's<00:03:39.989> no<00:03:40.140> psyche<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.470> unlock<00:03:40.709> unless<00:03:41.010> you

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
there's no psyche to unlock unless you

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.280 
there's no psyche to unlock unless you
go<00:03:41.250> back<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:44.100> yeah<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.750> last<00:03:45.900> thing<00:03:46.049> is

yeah that is my video for today and the
thing<00:04:15.540> is<00:04:15.660> called<00:04:15.900> stride<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:17.010> probably

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
thing is called stride you probably

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.219 
thing is called stride you probably
already<00:04:17.729> know<00:04:17.970> how<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.180> install<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:18.780> just<00:04:18.810> go

already know how to install it just go

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.560 
already know how to install it just go
in<00:04:19.320> Cydia<00:04:19.650> type<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.130> stride<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:21.120> on<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.419> so

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
in Cydia type in stride and so on and so

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.290 
in Cydia type in stride and so on and so
forth<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.530> I'm<00:04:23.400> not<00:04:23.580> gonna<00:04:23.700> do<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.120> cuz
