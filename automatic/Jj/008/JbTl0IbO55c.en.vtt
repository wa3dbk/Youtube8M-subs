00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:04.339 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.349 

putting<00:00:05.339> bits<00:00:05.549> in<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.940> other<00:00:06.089> thing

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
putting bits in is the other thing

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.410 
putting bits in is the other thing
though<00:00:06.480> you'll<00:00:06.660> want<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.930> know<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:08.150> if<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.269> were

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
though you'll want to know and if I were

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.990 
though you'll want to know and if I were
going<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.570> put<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:10.190> one<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.219> these<00:00:11.400> router<00:00:11.730> bits

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
going to put in one of these router bits

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.020 
going to put in one of these router bits
this<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.110> how<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.679> basically<00:00:14.519> feeding

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
this is how you do it basically feeding

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.109 
this is how you do it basically feeding
it<00:00:15.240> into<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.960> collet<00:00:16.760> you'll<00:00:17.760> feel<00:00:17.970> it

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
it into the collet you'll feel it

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.420 
it into the collet you'll feel it
bottomed<00:00:18.449> out<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:19.680> what<00:00:19.890> you'll<00:00:20.010> want<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.250> do

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
bottomed out and what you'll want to do

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.330 
bottomed out and what you'll want to do
is<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:21.359> tighten<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.439> up<00:00:22.560> slightly<00:00:23.100> at<00:00:23.189> that

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
is just tighten it up slightly at that

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.480 
is just tighten it up slightly at that
point<00:00:23.580> but<00:00:23.760> then<00:00:23.880> pull<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.269> out<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.600> slightly

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
point but then pull it out of slightly

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.710 
point but then pull it out of slightly
you<00:00:26.490> don't<00:00:26.670> want<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.849> making<00:00:27.090> contact<00:00:27.119> with

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
you don't want it making contact with

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.099 
you don't want it making contact with
the<00:00:27.810> bottom<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> base<00:00:29.189> there<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
the bottom of the of the base there and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.900 
the bottom of the of the base there and
then<00:00:31.109> tightening<00:00:32.099> these<00:00:32.309> up<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.850> pretty

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
then tightening these up this is pretty

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.880 
then tightening these up this is pretty
typical<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.480> most<00:00:33.690> routers<00:00:33.899> use<00:00:34.200> two<00:00:34.440> wrenches

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
typical of most routers use two wrenches

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.370 
typical of most routers use two wrenches
because<00:00:35.610> there's<00:00:35.760> two<00:00:35.969> nuts<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.719> turn

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
because there's two nuts here that turn

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
because there's two nuts here that turn
against<00:00:37.770> each<00:00:37.890> other<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.910> what<00:00:39.239> we're<00:00:39.360> gonna

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
against each other so what we're gonna

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.200 
against each other so what we're gonna
do<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:42.170> get<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.200> wrenches<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:44.210> tighten

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
do is just get the wrenches on tighten

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.510 
do is just get the wrenches on tighten
the<00:00:45.300> bit<00:00:45.800> this<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.340> pretty

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
the bit this you want to do pretty

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.660 
the bit this you want to do pretty
firmly<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.590> most<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.980> by<00:00:50.160> hand<00:00:50.399> and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
firmly you can do most of it by hand and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.250 
firmly you can do most of it by hand and
then<00:00:50.760> use<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> rip<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> then<00:00:51.960> use<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
then use the rip and then use the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.810 
then use the rip and then use the
wrenches<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:53.660> bit<00:00:54.660> tightened<00:00:57.590> okay<00:00:58.820> now

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
wrenches a bit tightened okay now

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.130 
wrenches a bit tightened okay now
depending<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.390> whether<00:01:00.600> you're<00:01:00.780> using<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
depending on whether you're using a

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.720 
depending on whether you're using a
plunger<00:01:01.350> or<00:01:01.649> stationary<00:01:02.039> router<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> next

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
plunger or stationary router the next

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
plunger or stationary router the next
step<00:01:02.940> involves<00:01:03.359> adjusting<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.229> heights<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
step involves adjusting the heights and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.890 
step involves adjusting the heights and
that's<00:01:05.339> different<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.850> each<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.180> these<00:01:06.299> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that's different on each of these this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.740 
that's different on each of these this
is<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.140> more<00:01:07.320> complicated<00:01:07.619> machine<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.750> what

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
is the more complicated machine and what

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.600 
is the more complicated machine and what
the<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.500> would<00:01:10.590> set<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> height<00:01:11.460> on

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the way that you would set the height on

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.160 
the way that you would set the height on
this<00:01:11.820> machine<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.810> use<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
this machine is that you can use this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.950 
this machine is that you can use this

width in depth at any one time so for a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.120 
width in depth at any one time so for a
3/4<00:01:51.360> inch<00:01:51.390> bit<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.049> means<00:01:52.229> my<00:01:52.409> upper<00:01:52.829> limit

inch<00:01:57.300> at<00:01:57.480> a<00:01:57.510> time<00:01:57.600> how<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.230> you<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.880> that's

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
inch at a time how do you do that that's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.540 
inch at a time how do you do that that's
what<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.120> turret<00:02:00.480> system<00:02:00.660> is<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:02.310> lets

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
what this turret system is for it lets

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.530 
what this turret system is for it lets
you<00:02:02.790> plunge<00:02:03.540> down<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.530> an<00:02:04.650> initial<00:02:05.040> height

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
you plunge down to an initial height

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.690 
you plunge down to an initial height
when<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.660> hit<00:02:06.900> this<00:02:07.080> um<00:02:07.440> when<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.490> hit<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
when you hit this um when you hit the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.910 
when you hit this um when you hit the
top<00:02:08.910> turret<00:02:09.180> and<00:02:09.690> then<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.320> can<00:02:10.470> rotate<00:02:10.590> over

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
top turret and then you can rotate over

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.230 
top turret and then you can rotate over
to<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.220> other<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.670> your<00:02:11.790> next<00:02:12.030> pass

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
to the other one for your next pass

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.200 
to the other one for your next pass
plunge<00:02:13.140> down<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.410> little<00:02:13.620> more<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.190> these<00:02:14.970> are

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
plunge down a little more and these are

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.720 
plunge down a little more and these are
graduated<00:02:15.840> at<00:02:15.990> different<00:02:16.290> heights<00:02:16.730> depending

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
graduated at different heights depending

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.550 
graduated at different heights depending
it<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.330> can<00:02:18.360> customize<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
it in and you can customize it but the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.200 
it in and you can customize it but the
ones<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.830> have<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.100> set<00:02:20.250> at<00:02:20.280> or<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.790> know<00:02:20.910> this

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
ones I have it set at or you know this

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.750 
ones I have it set at or you know this
these<00:02:21.930> are<00:02:22.050> offset<00:02:22.440> by<00:02:22.470> quarter<00:02:22.920> inches<00:02:23.250> and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
these are offset by quarter inches and

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.040 
these are offset by quarter inches and
then<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.000> goes<00:02:24.120> down<00:02:24.150> an<00:02:24.420> eighth<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.540> another

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
then it goes down an eighth and another

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.080 
then it goes down an eighth and another
quarter<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.950> depending<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.490> how<00:02:26.670> deep<00:02:26.880> you're

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
quarter so depending on how deep you're

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.910 
quarter so depending on how deep you're
going<00:02:27.300> into<00:02:27.480> your<00:02:27.660> would<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.710> keep

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
going into your would you just keep

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.160 
going into your would you just keep
going<00:02:29.220> down<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.550> successive<00:02:29.910> rotations<00:02:30.660> of

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
going down in successive rotations of

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.470 
going down in successive rotations of
this<00:02:31.350> turret<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.520> only<00:02:32.730> work<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.150> do<00:02:33.300> at

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
this turret so the only work to do at

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.000 
this turret so the only work to do at
the<00:02:33.510> beginning<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:34.110> setting<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.709> initial

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the beginning is setting the initial

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.910 
the beginning is setting the initial
height<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.730> that's<00:02:36.180> basically<00:02:36.920> involves

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
height and that's basically involves

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.660 
height and that's basically involves
loosening<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:40.170> bar<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:41.430> move

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
loosening that bar so that it can move

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.360 
loosening that bar so that it can move
freely<00:02:42.110> I'll<00:02:43.110> plunge<00:02:43.410> down<00:02:43.680> until<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.100> hit<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
freely I'll plunge down until I hit the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.300 
freely I'll plunge down until I hit the
wood<00:02:44.720> that's<00:02:45.720> my<00:02:46.020> zero<00:02:46.350> because<00:02:46.980> I'm<00:02:47.100> at<00:02:47.280> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
wood that's my zero because I'm at the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.280 
wood that's my zero because I'm at the
level<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.910> wood<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.540> what<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.840> want<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.110> do

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
level of the wood so what I want to do

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.160 
level of the wood so what I want to do
is<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.370> set<00:02:50.550> my<00:02:50.700> zeros<00:02:51.030> beyond<00:02:51.360> I'll<00:02:51.750> be<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.050> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
is to set my zeros beyond I'll be on the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.550 
is to set my zeros beyond I'll be on the
top<00:02:52.410> turret<00:02:53.340> for<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.970> one<00:02:54.230> that's<00:02:55.230> gonna<00:02:55.380> be

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
top turret for that one that's gonna be

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.940 
top turret for that one that's gonna be
my<00:02:55.680> zero<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.670> I'll<00:02:57.420> let<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.600> sit<00:02:57.990> there<00:02:58.020> lock

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
my zero so I'll let that sit there lock

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.479 
my zero so I'll let that sit there lock
the<00:02:59.130> bar<00:02:59.690> pop<00:03:00.690> back<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:01.080> now<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.739> know<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.310> go

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
the bar pop back up now I know if I go

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.560 
the bar pop back up now I know if I go
from<00:03:02.700> there<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.410> turret<00:03:04.410> number<00:03:04.650> two<00:03:05.540> when<00:03:06.540> I

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
from there to turret number two when I

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.750 
from there to turret number two when I
make<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:06.959> plunge<00:03:07.290> I'm<00:03:07.709> gonna<00:03:08.010> be<00:03:08.250> going<00:03:08.580> down

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
make this plunge I'm gonna be going down

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.940 
make this plunge I'm gonna be going down
a<00:03:08.790> quarter<00:03:09.209> inch<00:03:09.390> from<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.200> top<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.590> this<00:03:10.709> wood

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
a quarter inch from the top of this wood

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.280 
a quarter inch from the top of this wood
and<00:03:11.220> only<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> quarter<00:03:12.330> inch<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:13.080> that's

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
and only a quarter inch and so that's

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.440 
and only a quarter inch and so that's
the<00:03:13.470> goal<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.160> plunge<00:03:14.400> router<00:03:14.760> turret

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
the goal of the plunge router turret

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.570 
the goal of the plunge router turret
mechanism<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.019> just<00:03:16.170> controls<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:17.070> depth<00:03:17.280> of

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
mechanism it just controls the depth of

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.420 
mechanism it just controls the depth of
how<00:03:17.850> much<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.180> can<00:03:18.269> go<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.600> he<00:03:18.660> needs<00:03:18.870> pass

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
how much you can go and he needs pass

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.770 
how much you can go and he needs pass
now<00:03:20.430> actually<00:03:20.820> operating<00:03:21.300> this<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.600> very

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
now actually operating this is very

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.780 
now actually operating this is very
simple<00:03:22.170> there's<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:22.890> power<00:03:23.100> switch<00:03:23.250> up<00:03:23.519> here

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
simple there's a power switch up here

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.040 
simple there's a power switch up here
and<00:03:24.030> all<00:03:24.269> these<00:03:24.390> routers<00:03:24.720> are<00:03:24.840> slightly

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
and all these routers are slightly

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.479 
and all these routers are slightly
different<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.650> model<00:03:26.010> has<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.280> power

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
different but this model has the power

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.800 
different but this model has the power
switch<00:03:26.790> in<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.090> top<00:03:27.320> it<00:03:28.320> has<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.530> lever<00:03:28.890> which

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
switch in the top it has a lever which

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.030 
switch in the top it has a lever which
enables<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.989> plunge<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.440> happen<00:03:31.739> but<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:31.950> can

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
enables the plunge to happen but you can

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.400 
enables the plunge to happen but you can
see<00:03:32.280> it's<00:03:32.430> spring-loaded<00:03:33.110> so<00:03:34.110> while<00:03:34.290> this

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
see it's spring-loaded so while this

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.370 
see it's spring-loaded so while this
lever<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.890> out<00:03:35.570> it'll<00:03:36.570> just<00:03:36.810> spring<00:03:37.050> back<00:03:37.230> up

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
lever is out it'll just spring back up

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.530 
lever is out it'll just spring back up
if<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.650> don't<00:03:37.860> let<00:03:38.070> go<00:03:38.100> if<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.850> let<00:03:39.000> go<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.360> lever

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
if I don't let go if I let go the lever

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.970 
if I don't let go if I let go the lever
down<00:03:39.690> here<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.170> stays<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:43.290> typical<00:03:43.769> way<00:03:43.800> of

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
down here it stays so the typical way of

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.729 
down here it stays so the typical way of
operating<00:03:44.310> this<00:03:44.550> is<00:03:44.760> turning<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.269> on<00:03:45.739> and

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
operating this is turning it on and

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.280 
operating this is turning it on and
always<00:03:47.160> had<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.370> face<00:03:47.550> shield<00:03:47.790> towards<00:03:48.330> you

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
always had the face shield towards you

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.670 
always had the face shield towards you
turn<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.409> on<00:03:50.859> plunge<00:03:51.730> down<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.420> your<00:03:52.569> cut<00:03:52.780> let

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
turn it on plunge down to your cut let

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.410 
turn it on plunge down to your cut let
go<00:03:53.799> of<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:53.980> lever<00:03:54.159> so<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.489> stays<00:03:54.790> down<00:03:55.150> there

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
go of the lever so it stays down there

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.660 
go of the lever so it stays down there
make<00:03:56.319> your<00:03:56.439> cut<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:57.719> then<00:03:58.719> plunge<00:03:58.989> back<00:03:59.170> up

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
make your cut and then plunge back up

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.380 
make your cut and then plunge back up
now<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.730> fixed<00:04:01.299> router<00:04:02.730> is<00:04:03.730> even<00:04:04.090> simpler

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
now the fixed router is even simpler

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.190 
now the fixed router is even simpler
because<00:04:04.810> we<00:04:04.930> don't<00:04:05.079> have<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.290> do<00:04:05.379> any<00:04:05.560> plunging

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
because we don't have to do any plunging

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.170 
because we don't have to do any plunging
it's<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.290> same<00:04:08.530> principles<00:04:09.189> apply<00:04:09.250> with

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
it's the same principles apply with

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.149 
it's the same principles apply with
regard<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.540> putting<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.019> bits<00:04:11.200> you<00:04:11.650> get<00:04:12.010> it

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
regard to putting in the bits you get it

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.690 
regard to putting in the bits you get it
in<00:04:12.250> there

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
in there

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.869 
in there
you<00:04:13.599> feel<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:13.989> bottomed<00:04:14.409> out<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:15.010> you<00:04:15.670> want<00:04:15.819> to

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
you feel it bottomed out and you want to

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.599 
you feel it bottomed out and you want to
pull<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.150> up<00:04:16.269> slightly<00:04:16.690> from<00:04:17.049> there<00:04:17.400> not<00:04:18.400> very

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
pull it up slightly from there not very

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.370 
pull it up slightly from there not very
much<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:18.850> want<00:04:19.180> as<00:04:19.269> much<00:04:19.419> as<00:04:19.600> that<00:04:19.720> shaft<00:04:20.139> to

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
much you want as much as that shaft to

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.539 
much you want as much as that shaft to
be<00:04:20.500> in<00:04:20.590> there<00:04:20.739> as<00:04:20.829> possible<00:04:21.009> to<00:04:21.400> reduce

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
be in there as possible to reduce

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.610 
be in there as possible to reduce
vibration<00:04:21.960> but<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.050> just<00:04:23.199> don't<00:04:23.380> want<00:04:23.560> to

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
vibration but you just don't want to

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.600 
vibration but you just don't want to
bottom<00:04:23.919> down<00:04:24.630> okay<00:04:25.630> we<00:04:25.720> tighten<00:04:26.050> that<00:04:26.169> up<00:04:29.610> now

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
bottom down okay we tighten that up now

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.610 
bottom down okay we tighten that up now
with<00:04:31.300> with<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.810> stationary<00:04:32.320> router

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
with with the stationary router

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.890 
with with the stationary router
situation<00:04:33.400> we<00:04:34.180> don't<00:04:34.270> have<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:34.599> option<00:04:34.750> of

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
situation we don't have the option of

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.140 
situation we don't have the option of
plunging<00:04:35.139> we<00:04:35.560> have<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.860> just<00:04:36.070> set<00:04:36.280> this<00:04:36.490> at<00:04:36.789> a

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
plunging we have to just set this at a

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.510 
plunging we have to just set this at a
height<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:38.169> in<00:04:38.680> this<00:04:38.800> case<00:04:39.009> if<00:04:39.130> I'm<00:04:39.250> trying<00:04:39.430> to

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
height and in this case if I'm trying to

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.249 
height and in this case if I'm trying to
do<00:04:39.699> what<00:04:39.880> this<00:04:40.030> router<00:04:40.270> is<00:04:40.419> doing<00:04:40.690> I'm<00:04:41.110> gonna

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
do what this router is doing I'm gonna

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.580 
do what this router is doing I'm gonna
have<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.620> set<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:43.270> exposed<00:04:43.720> amount<00:04:44.199> of<00:04:44.410> this

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
have to set the exposed amount of this

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.400 
have to set the exposed amount of this
bit<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.880> be<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.210> quarter-inch<00:04:46.660> because<00:04:47.229> that's

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
bit to be a quarter-inch because that's

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.110 
bit to be a quarter-inch because that's
the<00:04:47.560> maximum<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:48.009> want<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.280> go<00:04:48.370> in<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.550> pass<00:04:48.729> right

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
the maximum I want to go in a pass right

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.879 
the maximum I want to go in a pass right
so<00:04:49.750> I'll<00:04:49.870> set<00:04:50.080> this<00:04:50.199> to<00:04:50.259> be<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.530> quarter-inch

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
so I'll set this to be a quarter-inch

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.810 
so I'll set this to be a quarter-inch
it's<00:04:51.699> very<00:04:52.030> hard<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.449> set<00:04:52.630> these<00:04:52.750> just<00:04:53.139> by<00:04:53.289> eye

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
it's very hard to set these just by eye

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.310 
it's very hard to set these just by eye
with<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:54.849> ruler<00:04:55.210> or<00:04:55.240> some<00:04:55.539> other<00:04:55.720> there's<00:04:56.110> a<00:04:56.169> lot

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
with a ruler or some other there's a lot

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.200 
with a ruler or some other there's a lot
of<00:04:56.409> other<00:04:56.530> jigs<00:04:56.830> you<00:04:56.949> can<00:04:57.099> use<00:04:57.220> but<00:04:57.460> always

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
of other jigs you can use but always

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.240 
of other jigs you can use but always
always<00:04:58.870> test<00:04:59.139> on<00:04:59.289> a<00:04:59.320> scrap<00:04:59.590> piece<00:04:59.740> before<00:05:00.159> you

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
always test on a scrap piece before you

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.159 
always test on a scrap piece before you
go<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.430> your<00:05:00.550> final<00:05:00.789> piece<00:05:01.030> all<00:05:01.960> right<00:05:01.990> so

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
go to your final piece all right so

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.659 
go to your final piece all right so
let's<00:05:02.380> see<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.500> think<00:05:02.590> I<00:05:03.010> have<00:05:03.159> it<00:05:03.280> about<00:05:03.370> right

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
let's see I think I have it about right

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.629 
let's see I think I have it about right
a<00:05:03.729> quarter-inch<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:04.659> now<00:05:05.620> I<00:05:05.650> can<00:05:06.130> do<00:05:06.610> my

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
a quarter-inch and now I can do my

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.550 
a quarter-inch and now I can do my
routing<00:05:07.000> so<00:05:07.479> if<00:05:07.630> I<00:05:07.720> wanted<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:07.990> make<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.199> slot

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
routing so if I wanted to make a slot

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.290 
routing so if I wanted to make a slot
starting<00:05:09.159> from<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.460> end<00:05:09.580> of<00:05:09.699> a<00:05:09.789> piece<00:05:10.000> of<00:05:10.150> wood

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
starting from the end of a piece of wood

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.379 
starting from the end of a piece of wood
and<00:05:10.630> going<00:05:11.199> in<00:05:11.520> I'm<00:05:12.520> all<00:05:12.699> set<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:13.380> do<00:05:14.380> my<00:05:14.650> slot

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
and going in I'm all set I do my slot

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.480 
and going in I'm all set I do my slot
then<00:05:16.389> I<00:05:16.510> have<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.810> go<00:05:16.900> back<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:17.979> then<00:05:18.130> in<00:05:18.370> order

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
then I have to go back and then in order

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.149 
then I have to go back and then in order
to<00:05:18.610> go<00:05:18.759> deeper<00:05:19.169> expose<00:05:20.169> more<00:05:20.409> of<00:05:20.560> this<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:21.039> do

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
to go deeper expose more of this and do

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.270 
to go deeper expose more of this and do
another<00:05:21.340> pass<00:05:22.080> so<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.409> only<00:05:23.530> other<00:05:23.710> thing<00:05:23.949> to

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
another pass so the only other thing to

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.089 
another pass so the only other thing to
be<00:05:24.699> concerned<00:05:25.419> about<00:05:25.570> with<00:05:25.900> routers<00:05:26.139> is<00:05:26.470> you

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
be concerned about with routers is you

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.620 
be concerned about with routers is you
need<00:05:27.280> to<00:05:27.370> understand<00:05:27.759> the<00:05:27.909> rotation<00:05:28.389> of<00:05:28.479> the

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
need to understand the rotation of the

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.140 
need to understand the rotation of the
bit<00:05:28.780> this<00:05:29.490> determines<00:05:30.490> which<00:05:31.090> direction

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
bit this determines which direction

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.360 
bit this determines which direction
you're<00:05:31.960> going<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.110> push<00:05:32.349> or<00:05:32.650> pull<00:05:32.889> the<00:05:33.159> router

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
you're going to push or pull the router

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.129 
you're going to push or pull the router
and<00:05:33.759> it<00:05:34.000> has<00:05:34.120> a<00:05:34.150> big<00:05:34.419> impact<00:05:34.720> on<00:05:35.020> the

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
and it has a big impact on the

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.839 
and it has a big impact on the
performance<00:05:35.620> of<00:05:35.710> the<00:05:35.770> router<00:05:36.009> and<00:05:36.370> the

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
performance of the router and the

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.300 
performance of the router and the
quality<00:05:37.180> of<00:05:37.210> your<00:05:37.360> cut<00:05:38.039> basically<00:05:39.039> what's

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
quality of your cut basically what's

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.640 
quality of your cut basically what's
happening<00:05:39.759> here<00:05:39.970> is<00:05:40.180> in<00:05:40.599> the<00:05:40.720> router<00:05:40.930> we've

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
happening here is in the router we've

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.800 
happening here is in the router we've
got<00:05:41.860> a<00:05:41.889> bit<00:05:42.130> spinning<00:05:42.699> clockwise<00:05:43.180> as<00:05:43.690> you're

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
got a bit spinning clockwise as you're

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.830 
got a bit spinning clockwise as you're
looking<00:05:44.080> down<00:05:44.229> on<00:05:44.470> it<00:05:44.620> so<00:05:45.180> what<00:05:46.180> this<00:05:46.330> means<00:05:46.599> in

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
looking down on it so what this means in

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.900 
looking down on it so what this means in
terms<00:05:47.169> of<00:05:47.590> cutting<00:05:47.800> wood<00:05:48.099> is<00:05:48.370> that

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
terms of cutting wood is that

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.880 
terms of cutting wood is that
when<00:05:49.600> what<00:05:49.750> is<00:05:49.870> making<00:05:50.170> contact<00:05:50.620> with<00:05:50.680> this

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
when what is making contact with this

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.220 
when what is making contact with this
router<00:05:51.130> bit<00:05:51.340> as<00:05:51.490> it's<00:05:51.670> spinning<00:05:52.090> if<00:05:52.870> I<00:05:52.990> bring

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
router bit as it's spinning if I bring

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.170 
router bit as it's spinning if I bring
the<00:05:53.380> wood<00:05:53.530> in<00:05:53.710> or<00:05:54.340> if<00:05:54.430> I<00:05:54.520> bring<00:05:54.700> the<00:05:54.850> router<00:05:55.030> bit

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
the wood in or if I bring the router bit

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.430 
the wood in or if I bring the router bit
into<00:05:55.450> the<00:05:55.540> wood<00:05:55.720> rather<00:05:55.960> because<00:05:56.170> we're<00:05:56.290> using

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
into the wood rather because we're using

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.060 
into the wood rather because we're using
handheld<00:05:57.360> I'm<00:05:58.360> gonna<00:05:58.930> be<00:05:59.140> one<00:05:59.320> I'm<00:05:59.680> gonna<00:05:59.800> want

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
handheld I'm gonna be one I'm gonna want

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.430 
handheld I'm gonna be one I'm gonna want
to<00:06:00.160> have<00:06:00.310> some<00:06:00.580> pushback<00:06:01.030> from<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:01.900> wood<00:06:02.080> onto

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
to have some pushback from the wood onto

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.060 
to have some pushback from the wood onto
the<00:06:02.710> router<00:06:02.890> bit<00:06:03.130> so<00:06:04.290> if<00:06:05.290> I'm<00:06:05.500> spinning<00:06:05.950> this

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
the router bit so if I'm spinning this

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.870 
the router bit so if I'm spinning this
way<00:06:06.600> and<00:06:07.600> I<00:06:07.720> come<00:06:07.930> into<00:06:08.110> the<00:06:08.290> wood<00:06:08.730> from<00:06:09.730> the

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
way and I come into the wood from the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.090 
way and I come into the wood from the
left<00:06:10.120> the<00:06:11.110> wood<00:06:11.290> is<00:06:11.410> actually<00:06:11.560> going<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:11.890> push

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
left the wood is actually going to push

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.650 
left the wood is actually going to push
back<00:06:12.370> because<00:06:13.030> as<00:06:13.180> you<00:06:13.270> can<00:06:13.390> see<00:06:13.540> these

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
back because as you can see these

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.270 
back because as you can see these
cutting<00:06:14.020> edges<00:06:14.290> the<00:06:14.410> silver<00:06:14.800> part<00:06:15.010> here<00:06:15.130> the

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
cutting edges the silver part here the

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.310 
cutting edges the silver part here the
cutting<00:06:15.520> edge<00:06:15.640> are<00:06:16.210> actually<00:06:16.750> digging<00:06:17.050> out

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
cutting edge are actually digging out

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.680 
cutting edge are actually digging out
the<00:06:17.560> wood<00:06:17.740> and<00:06:18.040> the<00:06:18.310> wood<00:06:18.340> is<00:06:18.880> going<00:06:19.420> to<00:06:19.510> push

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
the wood and the wood is going to push

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.030 
the wood and the wood is going to push
back<00:06:19.900> on<00:06:20.200> the<00:06:20.380> bit<00:06:20.560> now<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:22.150> opposite<00:06:23.140> if

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
back on the bit now the opposite if

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.080 
back on the bit now the opposite if
you're<00:06:24.220> coming<00:06:24.370> from<00:06:24.490> the<00:06:24.700> opposite

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
you're coming from the opposite

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.050 
you're coming from the opposite
direction<00:06:25.210> which<00:06:25.900> is<00:06:26.020> this<00:06:26.170> way<00:06:27.060> what's

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
direction which is this way what's

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.850 
direction which is this way what's
happening<00:06:28.480> is<00:06:28.630> I'm<00:06:28.870> pushing<00:06:29.320> the<00:06:29.440> router<00:06:29.620> this

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
happening is I'm pushing the router this

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.990 
happening is I'm pushing the router this
way<00:06:30.070> and<00:06:30.930> if<00:06:31.930> the<00:06:32.260> bit<00:06:33.040> is<00:06:33.070> actually<00:06:33.700> pulling

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
way and if the bit is actually pulling

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.750 
way and if the bit is actually pulling
the<00:06:34.270> wood<00:06:34.420> into<00:06:34.930> the<00:06:35.020> cut<00:06:35.260> so<00:06:36.190> it's<00:06:36.520> grabbing

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
the wood into the cut so it's grabbing

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.460 
the wood into the cut so it's grabbing
the<00:06:37.030> wood<00:06:37.180> and<00:06:37.330> pushing<00:06:37.690> it<00:06:37.810> in<00:06:37.960> the<00:06:38.080> same<00:06:38.290> way

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
the wood and pushing it in the same way

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.450 
the wood and pushing it in the same way
that<00:06:38.620> I'm<00:06:38.770> going<00:06:39.000> it<00:06:40.000> creates<00:06:40.360> a<00:06:40.450> very

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
that I'm going it creates a very

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.860 
that I'm going it creates a very
unstable<00:06:42.460> kind<00:06:42.910> of<00:06:43.000> cut<00:06:43.180> it<00:06:43.360> can<00:06:43.450> catch<00:06:43.660> the

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
unstable kind of cut it can catch the

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.140 
unstable kind of cut it can catch the
wood<00:06:44.020> in<00:06:44.170> weird<00:06:44.380> ways<00:06:44.440> and<00:06:44.860> so<00:06:45.610> when<00:06:46.000> you're

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
wood in weird ways and so when you're

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.430 
wood in weird ways and so when you're
doing<00:06:46.240> this<00:06:46.480> kind<00:06:46.750> of<00:06:46.810> cut<00:06:47.020> in<00:06:47.200> the<00:06:47.290> wrong

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
doing this kind of cut in the wrong

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.830 
doing this kind of cut in the wrong
direction<00:06:48.060> sometimes<00:06:49.060> you<00:06:49.330> can't<00:06:49.540> avoid<00:06:49.660> it

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
direction sometimes you can't avoid it

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.480 
direction sometimes you can't avoid it
depending<00:06:50.440> on<00:06:50.500> the<00:06:50.620> orientation<00:06:50.770> of<00:06:51.190> the<00:06:51.340> wood

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
depending on the orientation of the wood

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.570 
depending on the orientation of the wood
but<00:06:51.700> you<00:06:52.270> generally<00:06:52.480> want<00:06:52.900> to<00:06:53.160> be<00:06:54.160> coming<00:06:54.460> from

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
but you generally want to be coming from

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.390 
but you generally want to be coming from
the<00:06:54.700> other<00:06:54.820> direction<00:06:54.910> so<00:06:55.810> you<00:06:56.380> always<00:06:56.710> think

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
the other direction so you always think

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.830 
the other direction so you always think
of<00:06:57.490> it<00:06:57.610> this<00:06:57.730> way<00:06:57.790> you're<00:06:58.480> going<00:06:58.570> to<00:06:58.660> always

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
of it this way you're going to always

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.709 
of it this way you're going to always
want<00:06:58.990> to<00:06:59.230> be<00:06:59.320> going<00:06:59.500> from<00:06:59.620> left<00:06:59.920> to<00:07:00.010> right

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:01.719 
want to be going from left to right

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:05.609 
want to be going from left to right
on<00:07:02.679> the<00:07:02.830> wood<00:07:03.039> so<00:07:04.199> the<00:07:05.199> router<00:07:05.409> bit

00:07:05.609 --> 00:07:05.619 
on the wood so the router bit

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:07.139 
on the wood so the router bit
orientation<00:07:06.309> in<00:07:06.399> the<00:07:06.489> way<00:07:06.580> it's<00:07:06.729> spinning<00:07:07.059> are

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:07.149 
orientation in the way it's spinning are

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:08.939 
orientation in the way it's spinning are
important<00:07:07.599> with<00:07:07.929> routers<00:07:08.169> and<00:07:08.559> we'll<00:07:08.799> see

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:08.949 
important with routers and we'll see

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:10.430 
important with routers and we'll see
that<00:07:08.979> on<00:07:09.189> the<00:07:09.309> router<00:07:09.489> table<00:07:09.729> as<00:07:09.999> well

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
that on the router table as well

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.170 
that on the router table as well
