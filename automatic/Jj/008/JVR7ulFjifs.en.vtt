00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.639
 it's the first hunting opening for August 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.680
 he just got his license 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.139
 a document that must not leave it must have your license to eat 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:13.999
 the hunting federation italy 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.109
 so here we have the new ones 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.349
 new license formats 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.829
 these deputies bruno walks the field in search of hunters 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.429
 a dozen technicians of the Sarthe federation assures the role 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.359
 of hunting police on this opening day but sometimes it is 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.820
 necessary to recall the safety rules 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.969
 so mister smes or air hostesses france with for the first time 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.149
 we are for the device the recent leap for money used to pay to the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.479
 hunting small game today we lend you we wanted the 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:48.790
 next time for the araf in the head we will see the course of brent so 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.289
 today we do prevention and for the cause not more rare this hunter 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.559
 has just escaped a fine of 18 euros the five men had become 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.490
 much more 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.030
 in case of non-presentation of the insurance 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.260
 the permit or its validation 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.879
 the total amount reach 1500 euro I am rather dissuasive 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.189
 you arrive you are the controls is surrounded by levesque stone never 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.439
 the game is still in front of it's why even so why 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.270
 vigilant about taxis and other technical modes are also 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.770
 his club gave him three 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.220
 to his paw% 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.790
 prove fight 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.920
 we did it well and then 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.980
 we must put the date of the day 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.120
 a way to control the number of animals killed in the territory 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.060
 because each hunting society this vote attributed a limited number of 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.190
 bracelets for some species not for the partridge but for the hare by 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.780
 example 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.220
 interested in managing the population and we arrive at this team that we 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.920
 interested 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.110
 so those studies that have patterns 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.580
 if we are enough 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.120
 and that the population has not done too much 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.840
 sunday the renault team have tried about forty controls 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.350
 closing of the hunting season on February 28
