00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
made while filing the blade to fit up

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.980 
made while filing the blade to fit up
with<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.389> handle<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.500> inadvertently<00:00:11.990> over

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
with the handle I inadvertently over

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.609 
with the handle I inadvertently over
filed<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:14.509> open<00:00:15.509> stop<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.170> when<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> blade<00:00:16.590> is

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
filed the open stop so when the blade is

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.790 
filed the open stop so when the blade is
open<00:00:17.570> what<00:00:18.570> was<00:00:18.690> doing<00:00:19.050> what<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.619> was<00:00:19.680> doing

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
open what was doing what it was doing

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.279 
open what was doing what it was doing
was<00:00:20.100> actually<00:00:20.250> going<00:00:20.670> into<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.779> knife<00:00:21.930> handle

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
was actually going into the knife handle

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.080 
was actually going into the knife handle
it<00:00:22.470> was<00:00:22.560> over<00:00:22.859> traveling<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:25.849> I've<00:00:26.849> heard

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it was over traveling and I've heard

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.029 
it was over traveling and I've heard
time<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.269> time<00:00:27.449> again<00:00:27.570> don't<00:00:28.320> over<00:00:28.410> file<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
time and time again don't over file you

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.939 
time and time again don't over file you
can't<00:00:29.250> replace<00:00:29.460> metal<00:00:29.939> well<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> welder

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
can't replace metal well I have a welder

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.060 
can't replace metal well I have a welder
so<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> figured<00:00:33.030> I'll<00:00:33.899> give<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.290> shot<00:00:34.500> so

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
so I figured I'll give it a shot so

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.280 
so I figured I'll give it a shot so
here's<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> video<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.820> me<00:00:36.090> making<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:37.110> well

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
here's the video of me making a well

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.100 
here's the video of me making a well
repair<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.070> blade<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.489> refining<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
repair on the blade and refining it to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:58.479 
repair on the blade and refining it to
make<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.379> fit<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.760> where<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.149> right<00:00:42.300> now

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.880 

here<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.520> used<00:00:59.879> two<00:01:00.090> copper<00:01:00.570> as<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:01.050> heatsink<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
here I used two copper as a heatsink to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.740 
here I used two copper as a heatsink to
minimize<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.820> heat<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.480> into<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.989> blade

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.109 

and<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.840> end<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.470> nice<00:01:11.040> little<00:01:11.070> weld<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
and you end up a nice little weld and a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.719 
and you end up a nice little weld and a
little<00:01:12.360> fill

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.760 

and<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> fill<00:01:18.960> right<00:01:19.110> there<00:01:19.289> I'll

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and that's the fill right there I'll

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.870 
and that's the fill right there I'll
grind<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.100> down<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.399> should<00:01:20.579> be<00:01:20.670> good

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
grind it down it should be good

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.889 
grind it down it should be good
hopefully<00:01:21.149> it<00:01:21.420> doesn't<00:01:21.600> mess<00:01:21.719> with<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
hopefully it doesn't mess with the

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.810 
hopefully it doesn't mess with the
heat-treat<00:01:22.289> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.399> they<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.579> have<00:01:23.700> my

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
heat-treat and then they can have my

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.620 
heat-treat and then they can have my
stop<00:01:24.090> exactly<00:01:24.390> where<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> need<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:26.539> here's<00:01:27.539> my

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
stop exactly where I need it here's my

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.690 
stop exactly where I need it here's my
sanding<00:01:28.170> block<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.340> little<00:01:29.549> piece

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
sanding block it's just a little piece

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.499

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
rotted out of the little channel right

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.279 
rotted out of the little channel right
there<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.429> put<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.569> couple<00:01:36.630> magnets<00:01:37.229> I

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
where it stops but it's not flushed not

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.770 
where it stops but it's not flushed not
anywhere<00:03:43.010> near<00:03:43.209> just<00:03:44.209> have<00:03:44.299> to<00:03:44.390> keep<00:03:44.510> doing<00:03:44.750> a

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
anywhere near just have to keep doing a

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.490 
anywhere near just have to keep doing a
little<00:03:44.930> more<00:03:45.079> filing<00:03:46.720> slowly<00:03:47.720> this<00:03:47.989> time<00:03:48.200> and

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
little more filing slowly this time and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.039 
little more filing slowly this time and
I<00:03:49.040> should<00:03:49.220> be<00:03:49.310> able<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.489> just<00:03:49.640> creep<00:03:50.090> up<00:03:50.269> on<00:03:50.450> the

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
I should be able to just creep up on the

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.440 
I should be able to just creep up on the
exact<00:03:51.440> stop<00:03:51.769> we're<00:03:52.370> close<00:03:52.639> enough<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:53.030> can<00:03:53.209> file

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
exact stop we're close enough I can file

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.770 
exact stop we're close enough I can file
