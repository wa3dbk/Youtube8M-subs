00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.330
 the work has not stopped buying importance to travel know more 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.330
 on the preparation of a book 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.719
 Thrilled published books threatened 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.789
 this is how many publications are found because of so many public 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.269
 or private 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.199
 and often students are not alone even unintentionally 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.039
 I've tried several times 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:27.939
 elderly with 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.739
 1 states do not know if the person screams why 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:32.909
 portrait of 

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:34.680
 it's bad but it's not that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.340
 I always say that I have 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.179
 all are my hands 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.540
 so this I think makes it very difficult 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.700
 I think we had a lot of people so we see who does not want 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.160
 the pet bottles 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.040
 but the person because she 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.010
 in the debate she pick up something that I think will get more of those country and can 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.180
 pay dearly said he tried then interview given by him 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.460
 responsible for restoring the services of this educational institution 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.360
 besides the kings I explain work that has to put the publications 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.010
 damaged in use 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.090
 therefore most common are 20 years of home 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 the letters that are often the rest on the bookshelf that the student sector 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.439
 are limited and end the life of that part the buyer part of the ip book the part of the 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.939
 front of the house also that with the passage of time she will psychologist in the session 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.390
 this cat is also the main cover model 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.920
 other means attempt to stop predation that are sexist cherish 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.960
 The pen marks the text bald green blue metallic black there is no way to 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.750
 People were going to take away, unfortunately the book is marked 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.750
 there's a table missing a book that was all destroyed 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.190
 carney hospitalized in spite of the collective beyond this marked date 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.090
 but it is very difficult there was some prepayment payment of the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.520
 plots everything does cleaning him and there we 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.920
 makes a new posture again 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.100
 if he needs historical humans and ends up being here I have been in terrible shape 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.120
 conditions we can 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.919
 through meeting the printing system 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.889
 one that new cover to do this substitution 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.209
 The book restoration work also 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.319
