00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
also for a size comparison let's turn

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.420 
also for a size comparison let's turn
this<00:01:44.780> on<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.170> meantime<00:01:45.350> on<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.770> top<00:01:45.980> here<00:01:46.310> we

we go look at that no tiny it is and
again<00:02:10.310> i'll<00:02:10.460> be<00:02:10.550> doing<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.850> size<00:02:11.090> comparison

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
again i'll be doing a size comparison

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.199 
again i'll be doing a size comparison
between<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.380> normal<00:02:12.860> ipad<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.670> ipad<00:02:13.970> mini

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
later there's a size comparison between

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:27.339 
later there's a size comparison between
these<00:02:18.170> two

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:34.690
