incoherent it was basically like I drank
an<00:02:31.940> entire<00:02:32.060> fifth<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.660> alcohol<00:02:33.020> in<00:02:33.319> a<00:02:33.980> matter

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
an entire fifth of alcohol in a matter

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.610 
an entire fifth of alcohol in a matter
of<00:02:34.310> an<00:02:34.520> hour<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:36.819> why<00:02:37.819> I'm<00:02:38.390> saying<00:02:39.020> this<00:02:39.319> is<00:02:39.380> an

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
of an hour and why I'm saying this is an

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.220 
of an hour and why I'm saying this is an
OD<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:40.400> because<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.420> was<00:02:41.540> very<00:02:41.870> dangerous

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
OD it's because it was very dangerous

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.630 
OD it's because it was very dangerous
and<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.910> was<00:02:43.970> an<00:02:44.560> overdose<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.980> didn't<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.489> don't

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
and it was an overdose I didn't I don't

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.270 
and it was an overdose I didn't I don't
think<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:46.940> puked<00:02:47.300> I<00:02:47.750> don't<00:02:48.560> think<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.800> puked<00:02:49.130> or

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
think I puked I don't think I puked or

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.600 
think I puked I don't think I puked or
anything<00:02:49.810> but<00:02:50.810> then<00:02:51.140> again<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.890> was<00:02:52.010> very

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
anything but then again it was very

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.229 
anything but then again it was very
blurry<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.540> my<00:02:54.110> imagination<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:55.130> mean<00:02:55.910> in<00:02:56.090> my

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
blurry in my imagination I mean in my

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.729 
blurry in my imagination I mean in my
brain<00:02:56.450> about<00:02:56.660> what<00:02:56.959> actually<00:02:57.110> happened<00:02:57.680> that

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
brain about what actually happened that

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.400 
brain about what actually happened that
day<00:02:58.120> because<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.330> next<00:02:59.600> day<00:02:59.750> I<00:02:59.780> woke<00:03:00.110> up

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
day because the next day I woke up

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.620 
day because the next day I woke up
didn't<00:03:01.250> remember<00:03:01.489> anything<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.299> happened

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
didn't remember anything that happened

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.470 
didn't remember anything that happened
that<00:03:02.690> day<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.319> I<00:03:03.680> actually<00:03:04.010> lost<00:03:04.640> an<00:03:05.060> entire

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
that day and I actually lost an entire

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.550 
that day and I actually lost an entire
week<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.470> memory<00:03:07.250> out<00:03:07.880> of<00:03:08.209> my<00:03:08.450> head<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.019> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
week of memory out of my head and the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.960 
week of memory out of my head and the
reason<00:03:09.920> why<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.040> didn't<00:03:10.430> tell<00:03:10.549> this<00:03:10.700> story

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
reason why I didn't tell this story

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.110 
reason why I didn't tell this story
before<00:03:11.239> is<00:03:11.750> because<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.709> lost<00:03:13.060> memory<00:03:14.060> from<00:03:16.120> my

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
before is because I lost memory from my

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.479 
before is because I lost memory from my
short-term<00:03:17.989> memory<00:03:18.350> is<00:03:18.410> bad<00:03:18.650> now<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.220> really

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
short-term memory is bad now it really

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.280 
short-term memory is bad now it really
fucked<00:03:19.760> him<00:03:19.880> up<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.180> fucked<00:03:20.510> up<00:03:20.630> my<00:03:20.780> brain<00:03:20.989> my

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
fucked him up it fucked up my brain my

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.199 
fucked him up it fucked up my brain my
short-term<00:03:21.560> memory<00:03:21.680> pretty<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:22.670> pretty<00:03:22.850> bad

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
short-term memory pretty is pretty bad

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.009 
short-term memory pretty is pretty bad
and<00:03:23.570> it<00:03:24.230> goes<00:03:24.410> all<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.739> way<00:03:24.890> back<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:26.019> not

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
and it goes all the way back to not

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.960 
and it goes all the way back to not
remembering<00:03:27.560> really<00:03:28.220> anything<00:03:28.579> that

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
remembering really anything that

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.220 
remembering really anything that
happened<00:03:29.329> before<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.690> age<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:30.970> 1012<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:33.200> I

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
happened before the age of 1012 so I

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.420 
happened before the age of 1012 so I
don't<00:03:33.470> remember<00:03:33.680> anything<00:03:34.040> from<00:03:34.190> my

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430
