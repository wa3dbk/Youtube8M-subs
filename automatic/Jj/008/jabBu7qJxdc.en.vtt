00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
this light would just flash and the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.460 
this light would just flash and the
computer<00:01:13.479> said<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:13.900> there<00:01:14.020> was<00:01:14.140> wrong

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470

people<00:01:14.830> attached<00:01:16.110> basically<00:01:17.110> I<00:01:17.140> thought

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
people attached basically I thought

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.130 
people attached basically I thought
there<00:01:17.530> was<00:01:17.650> paper<00:01:17.860> in<00:01:18.100> there<00:01:18.250> parently<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:20.110> I

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
there was paper in there parently what I

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.390 
there was paper in there parently what I
found<00:01:20.700> was<00:01:21.700> this<00:01:21.970> little<00:01:22.299> arm<00:01:22.510> here<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:26.400> when

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
found was this little arm here this when

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.620 
found was this little arm here this when
you<00:01:27.490> feed<00:01:27.729> paper<00:01:28.000> in<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.270> back<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.570> the

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
you feed paper in the back of the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.969 
you feed paper in the back of the
printer<00:01:30.270> whose<00:01:31.270> back<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.940> that<00:01:34.979> interrupts

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
printer whose back and that interrupts

this<00:01:36.159> little<00:01:36.460> photo<00:01:36.670> sensor

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.240 

and<00:01:40.670> I've<00:01:41.670> unjammed<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.770> put<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.950> all<00:01:44.070> back

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and I've unjammed it and put it all back

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.460 
and I've unjammed it and put it all back
together<00:01:44.400> and<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.940> quite<00:01:45.120> fiddly<00:01:45.420> I've<00:01:46.320> got

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
together and it's quite fiddly I've got

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.550 
together and it's quite fiddly I've got
the<00:01:46.560> entire<00:01:47.090> paper<00:01:48.090> feeding<00:01:48.930> mechanism<00:01:49.440> out

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the entire paper feeding mechanism out

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.750 
the entire paper feeding mechanism out
with<00:01:49.770> all<00:01:49.860> these<00:01:49.980> wires<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> stuff

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
with all these wires and stuff

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.190 
with all these wires and stuff
everywhere<00:01:51.980> this<00:01:52.980> is<00:01:53.070> gonna<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.340> fun<00:01:54.200> but

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
everywhere this is gonna be fun but

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.400 
everywhere this is gonna be fun but
we'll<00:01:55.710> see<00:01:55.830> how<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.010> goes<00:01:56.040> okay<00:01:56.220> I<00:01:57.170> think<00:01:58.170> we've

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
we'll see how it goes okay I think we've

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.990 
we'll see how it goes okay I think we've
got<00:01:58.440> somewhere<00:01:58.890> no<00:02:01.100> it's<00:02:02.100> completely<00:02:02.220> English

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
low but don't worry about la right if

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.290 
low but don't worry about la right if
this<00:02:06.030> up<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.840> light's<00:02:10.050> not<00:02:10.200> flashing<00:02:11.300> that's

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
this up that light's not flashing that's

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.150 
this up that light's not flashing that's
what<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.480> should<00:02:12.660> do<00:02:12.840> should<00:02:13.080> flash<00:02:13.320> once<00:02:16.160> and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
what I should do should flash once and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.090 
what I should do should flash once and
that's<00:02:17.340> what<00:02:18.230> brilliant<00:02:19.230> let's<00:02:19.620> not<00:02:19.770> do<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.890> up

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
that's what brilliant let's not do it up

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.650 
that's what brilliant let's not do it up
right

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
right

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:43.880 
right
let's<00:02:22.140> see<00:02:22.320> if<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.500> works

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:57.750 

check<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.010> out

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:47.780 

Happy<00:02:58.760> Days<00:02:59.439> let's<00:03:00.439> try<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:00.769> DVD
