well<00:00:00.870> as<00:00:00.989> I<00:00:01.140> was<00:00:01.170> saying<00:00:01.909> pepsin<00:00:03.319> custom

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
well as I was saying pepsin custom

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.730 
well as I was saying pepsin custom
antibody<00:00:04.920> molecule<00:00:05.430> into<00:00:05.910> two<00:00:06.120> portions

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
antibody molecule into two portions

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.540 
antibody molecule into two portions
sub-portion<00:00:07.849> in<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.030> bottom<00:00:09.389> portion

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
sub-portion in the bottom portion

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.629 
sub-portion in the bottom portion
another<00:00:11.550> very<00:00:12.389> important<00:00:12.900> think<00:00:13.110> about<00:00:13.639> igg

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
another very important think about igg

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.410 
another very important think about igg
is<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.199> only<00:00:16.410> antibody<00:00:17.400> molecule<00:00:17.970> it

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
is that is the only antibody molecule it

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.279 
is that is the only antibody molecule it
contains<00:00:18.990> MHC<00:00:19.740> restriction<00:00:20.689> which<00:00:21.689> will<00:00:22.170> be

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
contains MHC restriction which will be

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:30.130 
contains MHC restriction which will be
shown<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.920> next<00:00:23.160> diagram

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.180 

this<00:00:30.769> is<00:00:31.130> what<00:00:31.310> MHC<00:00:31.849> restriction<00:00:32.180> looks<00:00:32.540> like

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
this is what MHC restriction looks like

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.049 
this is what MHC restriction looks like
starting<00:00:34.190> from<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.520> FC<00:00:35.000> gamma<00:00:35.149> receptor

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
starting from the FC gamma receptor

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.950 
starting from the FC gamma receptor
going<00:00:38.059> down<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:39.020> contains<00:00:39.699> four<00:00:40.699> cells<00:00:41.000> but<00:00:41.720> we

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
going down it contains four cells but we

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.819 
going down it contains four cells but we
are<00:00:42.110> visible<00:00:42.559> I<00:00:42.770> will<00:00:43.760> explain<00:00:44.120> how<00:00:44.739> there's<00:00:45.739> a

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
are visible I will explain how there's a

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.479 
are visible I will explain how there's a
CC<00:00:46.250> cell<00:00:47.110> CH<00:00:48.110> sir<00:00:48.489> two<00:00:49.489> cells<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.629> CC<00:00:50.900> sir<00:00:51.489> is

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
CC cell CH sir two cells the CC sir is

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.040 
CC cell CH sir two cells the CC sir is
expressed<00:00:53.420> by<00:00:53.739> cd8<00:00:54.739> which<00:00:55.190> is<00:00:55.339> the<00:00:55.460> salamanca

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
expressed by cd8 which is the salamanca

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.770 
expressed by cd8 which is the salamanca
which<00:00:57.050> are<00:00:57.260> in<00:00:57.379> check<00:00:57.589> interacts<00:00:58.250> with<00:00:58.780> MHC

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
which are in check interacts with MHC

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.350 
which are in check interacts with MHC
class<00:01:00.680> 1<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.989> is<00:01:02.989> it<00:01:03.140> expressed<00:01:04.070> by<00:01:04.360> nucleated

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
class 1 and is it expressed by nucleated

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.460 
class 1 and is it expressed by nucleated
cells<00:01:06.250> then<00:01:07.250> there<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.729> that<00:01:07.940> CH<00:01:08.270> sir<00:01:08.570> let's

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
cells then there is that CH sir let's

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.290 
cells then there is that CH sir let's
see<00:01:09.619> egg<00:01:09.740> cell<00:01:10.100> is<00:01:10.759> expressed<00:01:11.360> by<00:01:11.740> cd4<00:01:13.300> which

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
see egg cell is expressed by cd4 which

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.960 
see egg cell is expressed by cd4 which
is<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.570> Salamanca<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.340> interacts<00:01:16.340> with<00:01:16.460> m<00:01:16.789> ec

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
is the Salamanca and interacts with m ec

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.350 
is the Salamanca and interacts with m ec
plus<00:01:17.630> 2<00:01:18.970> which<00:01:19.970> expresses<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:21.050> pcs<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.820> this

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
plus 2 which expresses a pcs so this

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.400 
plus 2 which expresses a pcs so this
cell<00:01:23.830> expresses<00:01:24.830> both<00:01:25.960> nucleated<00:01:26.960> cells<00:01:27.200> and

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
cell expresses both nucleated cells and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.889 
cell expresses both nucleated cells and
eight<00:01:27.950> pcs<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:30.740> that's<00:01:31.070> why<00:01:31.360> three<00:01:32.360> cells<00:01:32.720> are

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
eight pcs so that's why three cells are

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:41.260 
eight pcs so that's why three cells are
visible<00:01:36.909> just<00:01:37.909> to<00:01:38.299> recap<00:01:38.720> on<00:01:39.020> what<00:01:40.119> we<00:01:41.119> will

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
visible just to recap on what we will

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.660 
visible just to recap on what we will
just<00:01:41.450> explain

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
just explain

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.660 
just explain

that<00:02:47.269> was<00:02:47.480> my<00:02:47.630> whole<00:02:47.750> explanation<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:49.430> IgG

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
that was my whole explanation of the IgG

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.599 
that was my whole explanation of the IgG
structure<00:02:50.359> and<00:02:50.769> so<00:02:51.769> every<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.250> going<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.519> be

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
structure and so every is going to be

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.800 
structure and so every is going to be
watching<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:54.010> first<00:02:55.010> times<00:02:55.310> are<00:02:55.609> not<00:02:56.120> always

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
watching this first times are not always

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.490 
watching this first times are not always
good<00:02:57.079> as<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.859> said<00:02:58.100> in<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.459> beginning<00:02:59.230> this<00:03:00.230> is

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
good as I said in the beginning this is

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.710 
good as I said in the beginning this is
and<00:03:01.160> was<00:03:01.640> my<00:03:02.150> first<00:03:02.450> time<00:03:03.220> doing<00:03:04.220> an<00:03:04.430> online

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
and was my first time doing an online

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.740 
and was my first time doing an online
presentation<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.980> please<00:03:08.140> try<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.200> believe
