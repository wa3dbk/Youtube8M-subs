poor toothless has broke his back here
now<00:01:40.950> let's<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.549> maybe<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:42.329> more<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.720> feel

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
now let's do maybe one more you can feel

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.719 
now let's do maybe one more you can feel
it<00:01:43.140> kind<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.409> get<00:01:43.560> tighter<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.220> well<00:01:44.399> there

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it kind of get tighter as well there

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
it kind of get tighter as well there
click<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.509> probably<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:46.049> far<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.380> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
click so that's probably as far as you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.649 
click so that's probably as far as you
want<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> go<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.119> want<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.420> give<00:01:48.540> it

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
want to go then when you want to give it

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.780 
want to go then when you want to give it
a<00:01:48.750> nice<00:01:48.930> spin<00:01:49.140> there's<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.009> little<00:01:50.549> button

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
a nice spin there's a little button

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.080 
a nice spin there's a little button
embedded<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.930> his<00:01:52.290> back<00:01:52.920> spikes<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.820> you're

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
embedded in his back spikes and you're

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.639 
embedded in his back spikes and you're
just<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> simply<00:01:54.960> give<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> quick

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
just going to simply give that a quick

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.819 
just going to simply give that a quick
push<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.369> he's<00:01:57.360> going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.719> start<00:01:57.960> spinning

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
push and he's going to start spinning

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.480 
push and he's going to start spinning
it's<00:01:59.490> kind<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.850> difficult<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> good

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
it's kind of difficult to get a good

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.249 
it's kind of difficult to get a good
good<00:02:04.880> attack<00:02:05.990> on<00:02:06.990> him<00:02:08.630> as<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.899> see<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.170> in

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
good attack on him as you can see it in

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.260 
good attack on him as you can see it in
the<00:02:10.380> last<00:02:10.619> one<00:02:10.890> didn't<00:02:11.130> go<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.670> too<00:02:11.849> bad<00:02:12.060> they

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the last one didn't go it's too bad they

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.640 
the last one didn't go it's too bad they
didn't<00:02:12.480> put<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.690> button<00:02:13.140> where<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.380> on<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
didn't put the button where you on the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.589 
didn't put the button where you on the
side<00:02:13.890> here<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.819> could<00:02:15.000> get<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.209> full

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
side here so that you could get a full

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.170 
side here so that you could get a full
super<00:02:16.170> spin<00:02:16.470> attack<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:17.430> maybe<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.819> goal<00:02:18.000> was

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
super spin attack but maybe the goal was

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.110 
super spin attack but maybe the goal was
just<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.480> do<00:02:18.690> one<00:02:19.260> kick<00:02:19.620> at<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.890> time<00:02:20.160> maybe<00:02:20.910> it's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
just to do one kick at a time maybe it's

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.120 
just to do one kick at a time maybe it's
a<00:02:21.360> little<00:02:21.480> more<00:02:21.630> realistic<00:02:22.110> than<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.769> port

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
a little more realistic than the port
