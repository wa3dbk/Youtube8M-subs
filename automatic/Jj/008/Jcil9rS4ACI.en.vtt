of<00:00:29.369> pressure<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:31.019> know<00:00:31.140> this

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
of pressure on this is you know this

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.560 
of pressure on this is you know this
plastic<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.430> zing<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.090> tight<00:00:33.270> at<00:00:33.450> the

ball you can tell there's a super duper
amount<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:36.300> pressure<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:38.070> does<00:00:38.280> seem<00:00:38.520> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
amount of pressure but it does seem to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.799 
amount of pressure but it does seem to
be<00:00:38.670> holding<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> only<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.510> got<00:00:39.600> the

little under twenty or a little over
twenty<00:01:41.100> watts<00:01:41.250> each<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.630> I've<00:01:42.810> got<00:01:42.990> an

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
twenty watts each and then I've got an

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.219 
twenty watts each and then I've got an
air<00:01:43.560> pump<00:01:43.799> down<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.280> other<00:01:44.430> side<00:01:44.720> that<00:01:45.720> feeds

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
air pump down the other side that feeds

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.850 
air pump down the other side that feeds
air<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:48.479> bottom<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.229> tube<00:01:49.619> right

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
air to the bottom of this tube right

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.910 
air to the bottom of this tube right
here<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.549> if<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:52.140> anybody<00:01:52.560> knows

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
here and if you know anybody knows

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.130 
here and if you know anybody knows
anything<00:01:53.250> about<00:01:53.460> pumping<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.270> by<00:01:54.630> putting<00:01:54.990> an

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
anything about pumping if by putting an

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.830 
anything about pumping if by putting an
air<00:01:55.320> hose<00:01:55.560> down<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.250> tube<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.880> pumping

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
air hose down in this tube and pumping

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.219 
air hose down in this tube and pumping
air<00:01:58.079> there's<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> there's<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.630> way<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.810> works<00:02:00.990> is

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
air there's a there's a way it works is

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.020 
air there's a there's a way it works is
when<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.619> air<00:02:01.799> comes<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.460> also<00:02:02.610> draws

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
when the air comes up it also draws

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.090 
when the air comes up it also draws
water<00:02:03.450> with<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.079> that's<00:02:04.649> what's<00:02:04.890> bringing

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
water with it and that's what's bringing

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.190 
water with it and that's what's bringing
it<00:02:05.369> into<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.729> barrel<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
it into this barrel and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.830 
it into this barrel and
and<00:02:07.340> what<00:02:08.340> will<00:02:08.429> happen<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.390> solids

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and what will happen is is the solids

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.630 
and what will happen is is the solids
will<00:02:09.989> settle<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.709> barrel<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.310> then<00:02:11.459> in

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
will settle in this barrel and then in

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.220 
will settle in this barrel and then in
the<00:02:11.730> bottom<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.180> barrel<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.599> have<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> drain

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
the bottom of the barrel I have a drain

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.199 
the bottom of the barrel I have a drain
that<00:02:13.500> I'll<00:02:13.739> just<00:02:13.950> open<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.580> drain<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
that I'll just open it and drain the

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.199 
that I'll just open it and drain the
water<00:02:15.390> out<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:17.250> then<00:02:17.400> all<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.700> crap<00:02:17.940> goes

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
water out and and then all the crap goes

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.740 
water out and and then all the crap goes
with<00:02:18.450> it

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
with it

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.559 
with it
and<00:02:18.840> then<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.650> my<00:02:19.830> return<00:02:20.190> back<00:02:21.120> into<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
and then this is my return back into the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.630 
and then this is my return back into the
tank<00:02:21.930> right<00:02:22.200> here<00:02:22.379> you<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.190> see<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.459> there's

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
tank right here you can see so there's

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.890 
tank right here you can see so there's
so<00:02:23.760> much<00:02:23.880> water's<00:02:24.269> coming<00:02:24.569> out<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.780> that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
so much water's coming out of that

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.600 
so much water's coming out of that
that's<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.340> being<00:02:26.340> drawn<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:27.030> just<00:02:27.330> by<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
that's just being drawn in just by the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.430 
that's just being drawn in just by the
air<00:02:29.819> being<00:02:30.390> pumped<00:02:30.569> up<00:02:30.810> through<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.200> tube

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
air being pumped up through that tube

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.320 
air being pumped up through that tube
and<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.709> is<00:02:31.860> just<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> filters<00:02:32.550> off<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.970> can

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
and this is just the filters off you can

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.330 
and this is just the filters off you can
see<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:35.930> have<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> neat<00:02:37.170> little<00:02:37.319> setup<00:02:37.680> I'm

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
see so I have a neat little setup I'm

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.710 
see so I have a neat little setup I'm
pretty<00:02:38.610> happy<00:02:38.790> with<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.060> way<00:02:39.090> it's<00:02:39.360> working

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
pretty happy with the way it's working

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.500
