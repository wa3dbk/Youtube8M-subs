block band and then we form the oh the
age<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:45.899> lied<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:47.129> then<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.640> culmination

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
age then lied and then the culmination

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.479 
age then lied and then the culmination

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
I as well little lower step cuz this

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.010 
I as well little lower step cuz this
isn't<00:00:55.800> exactly<00:00:55.980> grass<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.390> don't<00:00:57.840> want

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
isn't exactly grass this I so don't want

isn't exactly grass this I so don't want
to<00:00:58.079> fall<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.500> everyone's<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.890> little<00:00:58.949> bit

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
to fall and so everyone's a little bit

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.630 
to fall and so everyone's a little bit
lower<00:01:00.329> not<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> swing<00:01:01.199> banish<00:01:01.680> I'll<00:01:01.829> say<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.250> we

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
lower not a swing banish I'll say is we

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.690 
lower not a swing banish I'll say is we
normally<00:01:02.969> are<00:01:04.189> well<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> band

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
normally are well that's the band

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
is just the same except the only

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.640 
is just the same except the only
difference<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.170> don't<00:01:10.260> want<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> do

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
ah you don't want to do something like
that<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.090> far<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.350> know<00:01:16.409> there's<00:01:16.890> never<00:01:17.130> been

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that as far as I know there's never been

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190 
that as far as I know there's never been
anyone<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> slip<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> fall<00:01:18.330> during<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
anyone to slip and fall during the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.140 
anyone to slip and fall during the
performances<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.310> sure<00:01:20.490> about<00:01:20.520> practice

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
performances I'm not sure about practice

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.550 
performances I'm not sure about practice
but<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.479> far<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.840> know<00:01:21.900> no<00:01:22.170> one's<00:01:22.350> following

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
but as far as I know no one's following

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.140 
but as far as I know no one's following
performance<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.060> these

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
performance but there are these

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.820 
performance but there are these
wonderful<00:01:24.630> little<00:01:24.720> devices<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.439> put<00:01:25.740> on

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
wonderful little devices you can put on

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.190 
wonderful little devices you can put on
their<00:01:26.009> feet<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:27.030> little<00:01:27.330> metal<00:01:27.659> spikes<00:01:27.990> in

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
their feet with little metal spikes in

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.840 
their feet with little metal spikes in
them<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.680> keeps<00:01:28.950> them<00:01:29.130> from<00:01:29.310> falling<00:01:29.369> on

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
them and that keeps them from falling on

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
them and that keeps them from falling on
the<00:01:30.000> ice<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.750> got<00:01:30.960> about<00:01:31.079> 200<00:01:31.650> pairs<00:01:31.890> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
the ice and so we got about 200 pairs of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.249 
the ice and so we got about 200 pairs of
those<00:01:32.250> things<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:33.090> almost<00:01:33.360> lost<00:01:33.840> an<00:01:34.140> eye

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
those things we almost lost an eye

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.010 
those things we almost lost an eye
daughter<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.680> year<00:01:35.040> ago<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.549> he<00:01:36.119> stuck<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
daughter a year ago but he stuck the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.640 
daughter a year ago but he stuck the
landing<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> speak<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:39.290> could<00:01:40.290> actually<00:01:40.439> do

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
landing so to speak I could actually do

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.460 
landing so to speak I could actually do
better<00:01:40.920> than<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.189> thought<00:01:41.509> so<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
better than I thought so like with the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.870 
better than I thought so like with the
with<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> little<00:01:44.189> thing<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.520> our<00:01:44.640> flight<00:01:44.820> was

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
with the little thing on our flight was

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.850 
with the little thing on our flight was
much<00:01:45.270> easier<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.380> exactly<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> same

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
