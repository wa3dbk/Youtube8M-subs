really cool and crafting recipe is

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.490 
really cool and crafting recipe is
pricey<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.730> when<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.390> spawn<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.019> instant

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
pricey but when you spawn in the instant

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.390 
pricey but when you spawn in the instant
castle<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.789> get<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.619> lot<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> items<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.279> you

castle you get a lot of items and you

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.720 
castle you get a lot of items and you
just<00:00:29.580> crafted<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.570> actually<00:00:31.520> plus<00:00:32.520> side

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
just crafted so it's actually plus side

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.530

corners and a diamond right there and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.790 
corners and a diamond right there and
that<00:00:54.090> gives<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.629> instant<00:00:55.079> large<00:00:55.469> castle

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
now take a look at these textures this

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.340 
now take a look at these textures this
is<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.670> cool<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:01.199> you

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
is really cool as you can see if you

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.759 
is really cool as you can see if you
look<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.770> close<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.239> very<00:01:03.899> very<00:01:04.320> very

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
look really close this is very very very

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.570 
look really close this is very very very
HD<00:01:05.549> texture<00:01:06.380> not<00:01:07.380> sure<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:08.189> texture<00:01:08.430> would

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
HD texture not sure what texture would

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.120 
HD texture not sure what texture would
be<00:01:08.640> probably<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.030> I'd<00:01:09.180> say<00:01:09.479> 500<00:01:10.200> by<00:01:10.290> 500<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
be probably but I'd say 500 by 500 and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.070 
be probably but I'd say 500 by 500 and
I'm<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.760> even<00:01:11.939> using<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> texture<00:01:12.540> pack<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
I'm not even using the texture pack and

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.480 
I'm not even using the texture pack and
that<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.689> cool<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:17.100> love

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that is just really cool and I just love

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.700 
that is just really cool and I just love
it<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.119> shows<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.540> exactly<00:01:19.049> how<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.380> how

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
it and it shows like exactly how the how

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.719 
it and it shows like exactly how the how
it<00:01:19.860> looks<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.780> which<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.229> cool<00:01:22.439> and

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
it looks like which is really cool and

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
it looks like which is really cool and
yeah<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.630> let's<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.020> spawn<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.590> in

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
yeah so let's just spawn it in

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
yeah so let's just spawn it in
I<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.220> remember<00:01:26.580> doing<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> better

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
I actually remember doing like a better

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.990 
I actually remember doing like a better
few<00:01:28.280> modern<00:01:29.280> views<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.520> these<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:29.820> these

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
few modern views of these because these

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.910 
few modern views of these because these
are<00:01:30.060> probably<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> best<00:01:31.380> mods<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.799> I

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
are probably one of the best mods that I

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.850 
are probably one of the best mods that I
like<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.310> guess<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.680> don't

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
like I guess so what you do is you don't

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.429 
like I guess so what you do is you don't
left-click<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.540> right<00:01:36.990> click<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.350> you

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
left-click but you right click and you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.429 
left-click but you right click and you
will<00:01:37.920> experience<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.000> ginormous<00:01:39.570> leg<00:01:39.750> since<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
will experience a ginormous leg since it

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.840 
will experience a ginormous leg since it
is<00:01:40.680> quite<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.640> big<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.700> can

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
is quite the big one and then as you can

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.300 
is quite the big one and then as you can
see<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.270> spawned<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:47.509> huge<00:01:48.509> castle<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.680> it's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
see it spawned this huge castle and it's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.710 
see it spawned this huge castle and it's
really<00:01:50.729> really<00:01:51.060> cool

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
really really cool

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.679 
really really cool
and<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.740> believe<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.880> deletes<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> other

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
and I believe it deletes the other

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.429 
and I believe it deletes the other
blocks<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:58.110> as<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.350> can

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
blocks that you get so but as you can

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.670 
blocks that you get so but as you can
see<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.070> ton<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.759> stone<00:02:00.119> bricks<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> we

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
see you get a ton of stone bricks and we

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.550 
see you get a ton of stone bricks and we
only<00:02:01.860> use<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.189> too<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:03.090> got<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.930> lot

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
only use it too and we got like a lot

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.960 
only use it too and we got like a lot
and<00:02:04.860> then<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.729> used<00:02:06.270> one<00:02:06.570> one<00:02:07.429> stone<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.759> it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
and then we used one one stone and it

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.170 
and then we used one one stone and it
was<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> lot<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.349> we<00:02:10.649> didn't<00:02:10.890> even<00:02:10.979> use<00:02:11.069> well<00:02:12.060> we

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
was a lot and we didn't even use well we

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.360 
was a lot and we didn't even use well we
used<00:02:12.390> an<00:02:12.870> oak<00:02:13.620> or

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
used an oak or

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.790 
used an oak or
yeah<00:02:14.849> no<00:02:15.060> prank<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:16.280> made<00:02:17.330> wood<00:02:18.330> and

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
yeah no prank and it made wood and

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
and you just get an incredible house and

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.140 
and you just get an incredible house and
it'd<00:02:56.190> be<00:02:56.220> very<00:02:56.340> good<00:02:56.760> for<00:02:56.970> protecting

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
it'd be very good for protecting

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.470 
it'd be very good for protecting
yourself<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.220> it's<00:02:59.220> conceited<00:02:59.700> torches<00:03:00.269> and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
yourself and it's conceited torches and

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.839 
yourself and it's conceited torches and
we<00:03:00.599> didn't<00:03:00.810> use<00:03:01.110> any<00:03:01.140> torches<00:03:01.650> plus<00:03:02.549> I

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
we didn't use any torches plus I

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.390 
we didn't use any torches plus I
actually<00:03:03.060> did<00:03:03.390> not<00:03:03.420> even<00:03:03.599> all<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.110> a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
actually did not even all this a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.759 
actually did not even all this a
crafting<00:03:05.400> table<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.989> think<00:03:07.379> that<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.739> just

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
crafting table and I think that is just

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:08.900 
crafting table and I think that is just
really<00:03:08.430> cool

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
really cool

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.170 
really cool
since<00:03:09.510> there's<00:03:09.720> like<00:03:10.340> books<00:03:11.340> owned<00:03:11.910> if<00:03:12.060> you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
since there's like books owned if you

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.720 
since there's like books owned if you
can<00:03:12.360> get<00:03:12.540> like<00:03:12.660> high<00:03:12.870> enchantments<00:03:13.590> yes<00:03:14.579> you
