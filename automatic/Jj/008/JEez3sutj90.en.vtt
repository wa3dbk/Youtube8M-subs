back inside here we go with the box out

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.040 
back inside here we go with the box out
of<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.170> way<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.210> will<00:02:55.360> have<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.750> look<00:02:55.930> at

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.430 
of the way and we will have a look at
the<00:02:56.200> smart<00:02:56.650> cover<00:02:57.930> move<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.110> just<00:02:59.320> off

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
the smart cover move that just off

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.310 
the smart cover move that just off
screen<00:02:59.800> there<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:01.540> how<00:03:01.690> much<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.080> sir

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
screen there and how much is this sir

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.320 
screen there and how much is this sir
you<00:03:02.620> can<00:03:02.770> see<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:03.520> where<00:03:03.880> did<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.120> put<00:03:04.270> my

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
you can see so where did I put my

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.420 
you can see so where did I put my
scissors<00:03:04.870> oh<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.620> don't<00:03:05.800> need<00:03:05.890> scissors<00:03:06.100> it

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
scissors oh you don't need scissors it

scissors oh you don't need scissors it
is<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:07.020> little<00:03:08.020> tab<00:03:08.290> on<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.620> back<00:03:08.830> here<00:03:09.330> you

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
is a little tab on the back here you

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.910 
is a little tab on the back here you
pull<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.590> then<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.980> just<00:03:12.160> says<00:03:12.340> push<00:03:12.640> in<00:03:13.920> like

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
pull and then it just says push in like

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.880 
pull and then it just says push in like
that<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.130> guess<00:03:15.370> that's<00:03:15.520> coming<00:03:15.760> off<00:03:16.770> there<00:03:17.770> we

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
that I guess that's coming off there we

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:25.350 
that I guess that's coming off there we
go<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:20.430> take<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:21.580> off<00:03:21.790> here<00:03:24.000> you've<00:03:25.000> got<00:03:25.180> like

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
go so take this off here you've got like

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.850 
go so take this off here you've got like
a<00:03:25.420> backing<00:03:26.200> on<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.520> take<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.640> backing<00:03:27.970> off<00:03:28.120> and

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
a backing on it take the backing off and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.760 
a backing on it take the backing off and
then<00:03:29.860> I<00:03:30.340> clips<00:03:31.239> on<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.450> side<00:03:31.660> like<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:32.020> and

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
then I clips on the side like that and

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.240 
then I clips on the side like that and
that<00:03:32.890> is<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.970> on<00:03:34.180> there<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.750> can<00:03:35.070> fool<00:03:36.070> them

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
that is it on there and it can fool them

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.770 
that is it on there and it can fool them
I<00:03:36.459> mean<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.640> can<00:03:36.760> do<00:03:36.880> it<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.060> few<00:03:37.239> different

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
I mean you can do it a few different

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.610 
I mean you can do it a few different
ways<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.400> fold<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.820> mean<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.540> can<00:03:40.690> do<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:40.959> not

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
ways to fold it I mean you can do it not

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.830 
ways to fold it I mean you can do it not
right<00:03:41.769> that<00:03:41.830> clearly<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:43.450> can<00:03:43.600> do<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.750> like

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
right that clearly you can do it like

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.550 
right that clearly you can do it like
that<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:45.310> is<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.690> rested<00:03:46.690> up<00:03:46.810> one<00:03:47.019> or<00:03:47.260> you

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
that and that is it rested up one or you

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.140 
that and that is it rested up one or you
can<00:03:47.830> flip<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.550> around<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:51.130> although<00:03:52.090> I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
can flip it around like that although I

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.490 
can flip it around like that although I
folded<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:52.750> incorrectly<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.850> yeah<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:56.080> if<00:03:56.350> we

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
folded it incorrectly so yeah and if we

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.890 
folded it incorrectly so yeah and if we
fold<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.130> other<00:03:57.280> way<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:58.420> proper<00:03:58.750> way<00:03:58.870> is

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
fold it the other way the proper way is

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.190 
fold it the other way the proper way is
supposed<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.350> do<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.590> which<00:04:00.370> is<00:04:00.489> this<00:04:00.670> way<00:04:01.890> and

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
supposed to do it which is this way and

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.440 
supposed to do it which is this way and
there<00:04:05.200> we<00:04:05.290> go<00:04:05.320> I<00:04:05.760> try<00:04:06.760> folding<00:04:06.940> in<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.300> other

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
there we go I try folding in the other

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.699 
there we go I try folding in the other
way<00:04:07.570> because<00:04:07.780> some<00:04:07.959> people<00:04:08.230> suggested

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
way because some people suggested

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.690 
way because some people suggested
folding<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.850> with<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.530> outside<00:04:11.530> part<00:04:11.920> on<00:04:12.250> the

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
folding it with the outside part on the

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.390 
folding it with the outside part on the
outside<00:04:12.730> of<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.239> fold<00:04:13.480> so<00:04:14.019> that<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.410> actual

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
outside of the fold so that the actual

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.920 
outside of the fold so that the actual
site<00:04:15.610> that's<00:04:15.790> touching<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.330> screen<00:04:16.600> if<00:04:16.840> the

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
site that's touching the screen if the

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.990 
site that's touching the screen if the
ipad<00:04:17.230> doesn't<00:04:17.380> get<00:04:17.650> day<00:04:17.859> but<00:04:18.669> it<00:04:18.760> doesn't

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
ipad doesn't get day but it doesn't

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.969 
ipad doesn't get day but it doesn't
matter<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.419> mean<00:04:20.200> you<00:04:20.289> can<00:04:20.380> fold<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:20.650> either<00:04:20.770> way

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
matter I mean you can fold it either way

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.230 
matter I mean you can fold it either way
if<00:04:21.190> you're<00:04:21.280> not<00:04:21.370> going<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.549> use<00:04:21.700> in<00:04:21.850> grimy

if you're not going to use in grimy
environments<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.900> doesn't<00:04:23.229> really<00:04:23.380> matter

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
environments it doesn't really matter
