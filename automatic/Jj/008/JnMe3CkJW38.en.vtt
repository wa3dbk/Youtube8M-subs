00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 the thing is that I'm on a diet and the other 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.580
 day I passed in front of a kebab 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.289
 and the whiff came and I said I felt 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.049
 very sad I could not access that kebab 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.650
 no and then I wrote him a song that 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.350
 I'm going to sing to you 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.080
 and here prepared the song the written 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.850
 with the heart 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.250
 with the word 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.890

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.670

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.020

 prime characteristics the first 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.390
