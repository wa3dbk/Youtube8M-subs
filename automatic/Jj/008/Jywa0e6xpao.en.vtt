00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
of that we have now 31 degrees 25

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.200 
of that we have now 31 degrees 25
approached<00:01:18.200> 24<00:01:19.200> degrees<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.460> break<00:01:20.850> over

vehicle that gets into a situation like
this<00:02:45.019> they<00:02:45.319> would<00:02:45.440> just<00:02:45.650> plain<00:02:45.860> stop<00:02:46.190> but<00:02:47.150> not

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
this they would just plain stop but not

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.550 
this they would just plain stop but not
in<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.450> Jeep<00:02:47.660> we<00:02:47.810> need<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.019> make<00:02:48.140> sure<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.380> Jeep

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
in a Jeep we need to make sure the Jeep

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.340 
in a Jeep we need to make sure the Jeep
stays<00:02:48.970> moving<00:02:49.970> forward<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.540> that's<00:02:51.110> what<00:02:51.260> the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
stays moving forward and that's what the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.870 
stays moving forward and that's what the
four-wheel<00:02:51.620> drive<00:02:51.650> system<00:02:51.860> can<00:02:52.400> do<00:02:52.550> that's

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
four-wheel drive system can do that's

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.460 
four-wheel drive system can do that's
why<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:53.120> go<00:02:53.239> an<00:02:53.390> active<00:02:53.810> drive<00:02:54.019> because<00:02:54.319> it's

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
why we go an active drive because it's

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.650 
why we go an active drive because it's
actively<00:02:54.890> transferring<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> torque<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.630> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
actively transferring the torque to the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.199 
actively transferring the torque to the
system<00:02:57.350> is<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.800> oh<00:02:57.980> one<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.730> other<00:02:58.819> cool

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
system is it oh one of the other cool

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.640 
system is it oh one of the other cool
things<00:02:59.510> about<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.989> renegade<00:03:00.319> which<00:03:00.530> we're
