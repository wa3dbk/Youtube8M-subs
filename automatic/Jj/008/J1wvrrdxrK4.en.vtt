00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 then the 75th it influenced and much the 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.910
 New Testament writers 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.240
 Some people say that this 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.139
 page then doctor she did not exist 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.310
 here comes the question if a is the myth if it is a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.289
 myth 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.240
 how can there be so much 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.490
 similarity to her work and 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.369
 New Testament Consensus 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.360
 This one is always straightening did not exist 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.700
 what about the origins stage 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.730
 is always with the agenda did not exist 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.620
 so why did you hurt yourself? 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.870
 heterodox review on the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.820
 what if it did not exist because 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.280
 the book some books mention 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.129
 books considered apocryphal like us 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.379
 we saw from tobias a good question 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.480
 a question which those who ignore the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.510
 existence of cpj 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.990
 There is no explanation so I prefer it. 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.100
 stay with what there is temptation 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.570
 than what has no explanation 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.640
 So far so good, gentlemen. 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.840
 Are you sure? 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.990
 here we were already close beauty 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:31.110
 slide this is here to see there yes 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.509
 they then saw seven angels making themselves 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.970
 stand before God 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.799
 so I'm doing what he sees the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:44.100
 that 77 angels which implies 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.950
 Gentlemen the writer that people 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.280
 understands that the writer really was 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.329
 raptured second book of the apocalypse 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.329
 he left the earth and there in the sky in the 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.790
 eternity, I do not know where he went 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.960
 he saw seven who standeth 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.110
 before God 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.649
 So far so good, but beauty is what he 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.030
 Greek text will correspond there. 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.870
 also fell points 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:22.660
 anders ro and at point and mister k yes 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:25.540
 then lv seven epic tones aap Ã¢ngelo 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.489
 seven angels and that's what you're saying 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.520
 also the Greek text 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:35.970
 here comes the question of this comrade took 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:39.090
 this question of seven angels the person 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.090
 divine revelation 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:50.170
 he went to the skies of God 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:54.280
 he saw will be the following is we have 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:03:00.580
 here now that we have here now and 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:06.510
 Raphael who is the chapter 25 15 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:10.230
 rafael or the seven angels of the 700 angels 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:15.760
 I presence with grandpa as v 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:21.670
 we also have here tobias here in 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:26.860
 bible that people do not like the month 12 15 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:32.489
 I discovered the 12 15 says the following 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:36.190
 Gentlemen, I am Raphael, one of the seven angels 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:39.450
 who are always present and have access 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.370
 together with the glory of the Lord 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.799
 here comes the question then it means that 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.420
 John took away this ideology of seven angels 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:53.530
 by a divine revelation and more 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:57.940
 interesting is that the Hebrew text in 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:01.870
 no time makes mention of quantity 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.370
 of 7- number angels in the way you are 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.959
 seven years ago 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:13.410
 there is no such thing as the Hebrew text 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:16.350
 no such thing does not have 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.019
 and now I do not know if it exists in any 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.280
 place of the Hebrew text will exist this 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.740
 information of seven angels 5 angels 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.040
 so what's in the book of the apocalypse 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:32.340
 when the writer uses this 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.610
 expression then there was the set then I saw 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.890
 I heard and offset angels 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:47.370
 he came seven years from where he took 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:50.070
 This information from the cpee with the 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.760
 then he extracted the information to 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.760
 septuagenarian
