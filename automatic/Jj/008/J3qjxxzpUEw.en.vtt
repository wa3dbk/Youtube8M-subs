00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to go back for her next checkup they

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.440 
to go back for her next checkup they
wanted<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> check<00:01:16.650> her<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.210> but<00:01:18.210> she<00:01:18.330> was<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
wanted to check her right but she was a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.149 
wanted to check her right but she was a
little<00:01:18.630> bit<00:01:18.720> small<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:19.680> she<00:01:19.920> has

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
day I was doing her laundry and I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.380 
day I was doing her laundry and I
realized<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.380> next<00:02:01.740> age<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.369> 24<00:02:03.149> months

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
realized that the next age is 24 months

realized that the next age is 24 months
like<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.770> know<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.070> 2018<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.149> it's

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
like you know it's 2018 and then it's

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.080

sometimes<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.590> see<00:02:07.740> 18<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.220> 24<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.789> usually

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
sometimes you see 18 to 24 but usually

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.670 
sometimes you see 18 to 24 but usually
it's<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.390> 24<00:02:09.950> which<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.129> H<00:02:11.430> 2<00:02:12.180> so

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
have I only have a manual pump and that

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.319 
have I only have a manual pump and that
did<00:03:10.319> not<00:03:10.500> work<00:03:10.680> very<00:03:10.769> well<00:03:11.040> last<00:03:11.879> time<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.150> used

did not work very well last time I used
it<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.540> got<00:03:12.689> like<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.079> much<00:03:13.290> but<00:03:13.889> so<00:03:14.159> I<00:03:14.189> didn't

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
it I got like this much but so I didn't

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.860 
it I got like this much but so I didn't
pump<00:03:14.730> but<00:03:14.939> I<00:03:15.000> thought<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.389> would<00:03:15.510> be<00:03:15.629> fine

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
pump but I thought you would be fine

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.149 
pump but I thought you would be fine
because<00:03:16.049> she<00:03:16.260> was<00:03:16.379> pretty<00:03:16.590> close<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:16.889> dropping

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
and ever since that day last week she
