00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.190
 our tour and electronic stand 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.020
 hearts at gamescom 2013 ie 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.240
 allowed again to try need for 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.279
 speed rivals the new goal title 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.650
 we had already tried two studios 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.119
 weeks ago in goteborg right in the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.980
 developer studies that it was 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.440
 created specifically to work on 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.660
 basically play the new title 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.600
 takes over what is the legacy of most 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.120
 wanted 2 and hot pursuit which are the two 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.650
 titles developed by cry tyrion 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.170
 consequently it is found again 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.440
 same graphic style and also the map 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.670
 open fully explorable one 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.730
 which is new are the two careers 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.840
 separated then policeman and racer in the 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.500
 in case you play in the shoes of a 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.600
 policeman 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.489
 basically the task will always be 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.440
 stay alert to hunt erasers 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.309
 if instead you play in the shoes of 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 one of the runners 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.899
 there will be speed to complete 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.450
 list are a kind of a list of 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.580
 assignments that allow the player to 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.720
 always have things to do assignments 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.090
 sometimes they can also be a lot 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.860
 simple it's about maybe keeping 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.020
 a certain average speed over a stretch 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.619
 or drifting for a distance 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.060
 the speedy lists have been built 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.100
 specially so that i 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.350
 policemen sooner or later enter 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.390
 contact with the runners giving the go-ahead 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.950
 naturally to pursuits 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.440
 this is the context of the game 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.910
 of course there is a strong emphasis on the 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.190
 online component 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.959
 it is a game that becomes more 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.920
 fun when you play it with others 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.539
 people 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.800
 eagles have worked a lot must be said 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.770
 also good on artificial intelligence 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.340
 however, even when playing 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.289
 online 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.929
 turning to the map are always found 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.819
 however racer and policemen checked 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.530
 from artificial intelligence so 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.630
 the best is also popular 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.550
 of course a traffic of np yes but 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.119
 those are not involved in the moles 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.890
 ran from the point of view of the 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.229
 Here the cooperation was possible 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.390
 try the same level again 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.090
 we had tried goteborg again 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.280
 we realized that given the vastness 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.680
 of the map can happen sometimes not 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.150
 meet players for even for a 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.920
 long enough time frame 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.959
 now what is to be understood 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.300
 costa still is not ready to communicate 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.400
 this information is how many i will be 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.780
 players supported in the same 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.800
 instance of play this is fundamental 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.450
 to understand why if it were a number 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.700
 too low would you risk 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.780
 just to play too often with 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.150
 artificial intelligence 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.550
 naturally ghosts are aware of 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.500
 this thing so we think they are 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.870
 working for this they have already stated 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.930
 moreover that the new generation is the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.430
 pc will have more players not 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.319
 will support more players online 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.090
 compared to the old generation also 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.890
 if we repeat it for now 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.230
 have no data 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.080
 one of the rather surprising aspects 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.360
 of the game is the look and feel was 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.950
 used the frostbite rehn and it was 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.870
 especially done a great job 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.910
 on atmospheric elements and effects 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.569
 the two droplets are particulate 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.180
 of water on the bodywork can be seen 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.010
 storms and sandstorms are 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.230
 truly something special from 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.480
 see overall not until now the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.040
 title we have always tried on pc with 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.750
 a hardware equal to that of playstation 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.609
 4 this we were told then again 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.310
 it has never been possible to see 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.609
 actually the console next versions 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.200
 January 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.900
 we hope this can happen 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.970
 soon the only perplexity 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.910
 what remains is relative to rifles is 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.620
 just what was said before or how many 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.410
 players will be supported online and 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.700
 how this will have a real impact 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.160
 on the shared experience for the rest 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.590
 the game is solid and the model of 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.540
 guide is basically that already 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.019
 created by criterion for need for speed 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.640
 so if you like it it was further 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.109
 consequently refined there are some 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.109
 excellent expectations for this title
