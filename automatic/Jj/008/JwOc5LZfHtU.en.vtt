00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Good morning I thought I would take 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.580
 you guys a little bit today 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.429
 with in my day i'm coming today 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.710
 so early back home 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.130
 I thought that's the whole thing 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.830
 I still look a bit disheveled and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.170
 shopping head out i do not know either 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.150
 so to start with my hair 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.650
 but I do not have too much anymore 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.160
 That's why time is over now 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.599
 with the camera because I have so much time 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.080
 I have to be in about five 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.899
 minutes out of the house I think sometimes 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.090
 just because it's easy outside too 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.380
 ultra warm but me of course 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.450
 very happy 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.059
 and then we'll meet again later 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.579
 when i come back from school 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.899
 when i'm in the morning absolutely no time or 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.989
 I actually grab myself 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.629
 only a banana and a flame 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.160
 or nectarine with me in school 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.960
 do not starve 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.940
 I'm home now 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.680
 now just after one comes really very 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.539
 very rare that I am satisfied 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.449
 that 's why I'm all the more excited about the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.939
 wetters just so amazing is hot we 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.040
 have over 30 degrees 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.720
 but I love the sun and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.540
 I'm glad if true is when things 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.369
 not raining 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.049
 are you so summer people I am 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.310
 always totally depressed when it rains 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.590
 or when the weather is bad 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.880
 That's why I'm so happy 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.650
 I will eat something now 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.869
 and then make me in the garden 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.420
 put and then I have one too 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.060
 I would not do much in the garden 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.110
 but not so much now 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.110
 Well, I have to go through it now 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.260
 I just know how did they see 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.090
 all the time in the garden and I are so 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.850
 I warm up shortly after three 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.590
 and I have to go today 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.270
 the school still has a package of sheens 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.530
 That's why I picked up at the post office 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.110
 I'll try all the stuff now 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.620
 just show me what's in there 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.989
 was 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.360
 That's the first part of what's in the package 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.989
 It was just so easy in there 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.819
 find a liquid short sundress 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.069
 I'm super nice with everything 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.010
 this hole pattern here and I like that 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.320
 I really like color in his 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:40.180
 blue you just see somehow brown 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:42.680
 and I just think it's very cute 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.989
 that is already the next small one 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.060
 As you can see it definitely has to be 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.500
 be ironed the whole looks like this 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.720
 a bit fancier outside though I wanted 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.069
 quite happy to the wedding of 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.290
 put on my brother 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.540
 I really liked the color again 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.860
 like the room too nice in the sunlight 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.480
 and yes it has exhibited downstairs and upstairs 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.910
 that has me cut relatively high 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.700
 very much 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.870
 and yes I am somehow that is very 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.200
 looks cute 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.230
 it could be a bit tighter 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:21.049
 So not all sitting up at the moment 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:24.620
 perfect but I finds in any case 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:28.120
 very sweet next, this was great 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.489
 cute top here in the package 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:36.230
 So I love why such fluffy 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:41.200
 tops and the super nice color and 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:44.390
 is super easy and super nice 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.150
 the next one here is such a combo and 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.109
 though there was this t-shirt and this one 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.670
 To be honest, rock is still there 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.140
 not as much as I find the whole thing 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.400
 he has such a franc down here 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.400
 I think that's very cool, though 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.010
 the throws here as you can see on the 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.840
 side so a weird wrong here but 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.099
 per se 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.510
 I think that's kind of cool 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:21.669
 that's the whole thing from the side 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:27.820
 So this has such a zig zag zack 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:30.820
 Zack cut is actually cool and too 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.510
 Last but not least, this super cute skirt 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.970
 here is the skater style 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.280
 cut not so far fail 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.320
 and he's down here 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.860
 I think this top off super super 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.630
 cute and simply very simple 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.820
 and still through the top something 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.330
 We had something special in any case 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.620
 also very much liked 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.660
 and here you see rock him again a 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.970
 a bit closer to how the point looks 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.800
 So super super nice as I think the 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.440
 I like things again this time 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.440
 I have to say that very well 

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.679
 the 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.690
 you'll probably become one now 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.699
 everyone's head and me for 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.039
 completely stupid 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.919
 but I just had so much lust 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.620
 currywurst and pommes and that's why 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.300
 I've done it all now and it 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.539
 now actually currywurst and pommes 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.620
 at over 30 degrees 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.030
 I think I do more today 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.169
 especially how I thought so 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.580
 I now finish the flop of follow me 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.690
 a and whatever you do the whole 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.160
 I would like to call now 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.780
 just ever so slightly in 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.590
 garden and wait for that my friend 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.630
 comes home and then we enjoy 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.520
 the time a bit in twos what 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.949
 but I still want to ask you and 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.639
 Although my friend who I and my 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:04.080
 friend and I think about that 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.210
 We like to have a video together again 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.539
 I want to turn and that's why I ask 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.430
 But you have to video suggestions what we 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.870
 could turn for you and then hope 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.130
 Of course I like that video 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.240

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.240
