00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 the inventor from the structure to the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.509
 structure builds a machine that 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.360
 produces electricity 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.630
 the andré ex ascended lamps and even call 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.269
 the television daniel vasques see the show 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.000
 How does this gadget work? 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.400
 gearbox draws attention to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.529
 almost three meters high and makes a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.529
 noise and rain and pain 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.500
 the machine that makes power works 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.070
 in a garage in the workshop 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.860
 structure is able to make the lamps 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.230
 turn on and even a television 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.750
 the inventor all this machine that 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.489
 impressed everyone enough is the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.830
 carlos carrão we are meeting him 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.440
 has only the first degree but the 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.629
 idea that creating a machine and 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.120
 produce energy cars time 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.980
 answer a kid already took the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.019
 Lula radio engine was 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.989
 spoiled repaired at any time 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.789
 to find 99 energy was born this 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.910
 the idea of ​​creating a regional 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.460
 Energy informed growing and this what 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.580
 we have the farm built through 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.039
 electronic scrap and it takes a lot of 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.200
 force that turns all this force 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.259
 that adilson is doing in energy 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.080
 this generator in the middle is 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.899
 through it that the energy reaches the 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.509
 lamps and television and so they 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.600
 now a detail begins to work 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.290
 special attention draws these super magnets 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.700
 who stand here, look, they are 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.369
 essential for the operation of 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.380
 all this contraption without them 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.780
 this contraption does not work this in 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.520
 area as the magnet passes through 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.450
 of this coil it starts already in the energy 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.759
 hundredth year 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.619
 cans also give weight to 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.979
 that the wheels do not stop spinning 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.390
 not by chance does the toy call 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.060
 attention of the curious 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.610
 I think the service is used 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.619
 tdt be more used to have more 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.159
 a value will work 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.440
 believe 5 the machine has even name 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.320
 energy andrade ex a modest tribute 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.280
 the inventor himself already has 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.200
 sparrow teacher already has the hiv already has a 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.350
 walk here and now I hope to be called 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.390
 different anthrax the hypothesis also 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.850
 energy from andré wanted for this 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.650
 electrical engineering professor of unb 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.709
 The good thing is that the project was 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.810
 made in a smaller or adapted version 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.419
 in day-to-day situations the next 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.210
 step would be to adapt the system to a 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.010
 source of energy 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.930
 is from a renewable source for example 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.030
 using energy from the silver winds 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.800
 turning this turbine or for example 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.600
 adapting a bicycle on a treadmill 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.970
 a gym where people go there 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.710
 to spend energy between them pedalam 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.290
 enough they run quite this 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.020
 could be moving that wheel 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.150
 as an origin of mechanical force 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.440
 renewable energy generating electricity 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.030
 For this I need more investment. 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.120
 people who support this energy is a 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.650
 time will not pollute will not attack the 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.580
 then it would be a very excellent thing 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.580
 good for me
