00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
that just eight gigs of RAM if you

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.800 
that just eight gigs of RAM if you
didn't<00:02:11.730> understand<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.239> said

56 gigs of flash storage in this which

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.140 
56 gigs of flash storage in this which
may<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.860> mention<00:02:17.070> flash<00:02:17.430> storage<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.910> also

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
may I mention flash storage is also

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.210 
may I mention flash storage is also
upgraded<00:02:18.810> from<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.050> previous<00:02:19.440> retina<00:02:19.830> that

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
upgraded from the previous retina that

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.830 
upgraded from the previous retina that
means<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.520> retina<00:02:20.790> from<00:02:20.880> last<00:02:21.150> year<00:02:21.390> it's

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
means the retina from last year it's

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.360 
means the retina from last year it's
gonna<00:02:21.960> be<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> lot<00:02:22.410> faster<00:02:22.830> on<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.160> year's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
gonna be a lot faster on this year's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.520 
gonna be a lot faster on this year's
model<00:02:23.820> now<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.900> twelve<00:02:25.230> point<00:02:25.470> three

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
