00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
fantasy 15 which was a fair / good I

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.720 
fantasy 15 which was a fair / good I
might<00:02:10.050> be<00:02:10.080> too<00:02:10.470> leaning<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.340> might<00:02:11.550> be

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
might be too leaning on and I might be

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.170 
might be too leaning on and I might be
too<00:02:11.910> harsh<00:02:12.180> he<00:02:12.480> know
