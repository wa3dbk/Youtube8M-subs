00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.340
 yes man i would also like emergency fear 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.290
 I show here in one 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.590
 effervescent tablet housed company 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.000
 cover 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.619
 I've just shortened something 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.619
 That's for comparison 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.830
 original which of them a good third 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.630
 simply cut away with a saw 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.470
 cut off so cut off a bit 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.130
 with two out of four a bit 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.850
 completed and it fits sooner 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.260
 so I wound from at once 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.820
 you probably do not see it too 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.170
 here very little of it comes moored 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.600
 the ones out there but I hold tight 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.180
 knotted thus holds is also 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.219
 relatively robust the whole thing I have 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.149
 Hold on so I do not know 20 meters or 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.180
 What that are not a clue in any case 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.190
 should be enough 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.600
 that is still a fear only the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.020
 holds 15 kilos 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.170
 why braided with 15 kilo I can 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.020
 They also use them very well 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.689
 to fall or to take 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.409
 when I got the needle while yes that have 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.710
 I have everything in it 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.600
 actually only the most important perhaps 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.390
 some will say one or the other 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.170
 does not necessarily need 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.350
 I have it so I have one 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.350
 here 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.780
 a piece of wood taken as a swimmer 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.890
 Just here with a rubber band like that 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.479
 is from a bicycle tube around 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:58.640
 Wrapped so that the harbor the extract 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:02:00.979
 Now you can get out of it with the species 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.549
 just keep it longer and I have it here 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.369
 also on the cord a red one 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.170
 Dye itself wrapped when I first 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.670
 take a look because I do not have a wall 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.910
 simply make off the pose 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.910
 dismantle and just do it 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.410
 why do not I have any left now 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.480
 I know that suddenly just with it 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.130
 the bait by the weight of the car 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.860
 slowly sinking why do I know it 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.959
 Just done that and that is now 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.180
 already under warm size I believe 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.910
 Eighth or something I do not know I got it 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.790
 get paid but who 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:49.310
 says that is always solid that's it 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.310
 even so what I just already 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.940
 so we have got something 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:07.959
 still a second home -made 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:14.690
 Wood pose a packet with different 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:18.069
 once have up and also 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.069
 others have 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:41.270
 the other races would be through 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:45.490
 small 49 between small me 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.490
 are all relatively small role 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:12.900
 you come back the same way I do have it 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.690
 not counted then I have in here 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.420
 Yet three of these set bicycle locks 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.850
 rubbers in here I have little in 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.430
 0.2 grams so that's what you call that 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:41.850
 a clear in it I do not know how to 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:44.910
 So that is called the dismal very 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.050
 small is 0 2 if I have the 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.340
 would like to complain a bit 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.630
 Maybe you should not just crunch 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.630
 that as practical 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:11.820
 yes I still have 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:16.010
 I have here a little sun 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.010
 in front of it fits in two colors 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:28.850
 then I have a little red 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:33.810
 gaal as rosenheim interested 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:38.660
 more conspicuous and then have 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.580
 I only have four suns left here 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.150
 twice in six grams twice in four 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.890
 gram 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.770
 I know need know is indeed the 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:56.490
 By and large, that's what I am 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:59.040
 it 's not much but me 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:05.910
 think for the emergency angel set is 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:08.220
 that's more than enough and I think so 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:13.910
 it is all said if still ask 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.910
 otherwise between 0 comments until then
