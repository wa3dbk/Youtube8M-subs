they were really really nice and that's

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.210 
they were really really nice and that's
probably<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.200> easiest<00:03:09.230> way<00:03:09.799> I<00:03:09.829> found<00:03:10.099> to

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
probably the easiest way I found to

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.949 
probably the easiest way I found to
finish<00:03:10.489> for<00:03:10.640> them<00:03:10.730> he<00:03:11.120> was<00:03:11.360> really<00:03:11.630> really

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
finish for them he was really really

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.569 
finish for them he was really really
good<00:03:12.049> power<00:03:12.319> shots<00:03:12.590> with<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.769> 84<00:03:13.160> shot<00:03:13.370> pal

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
good power shots with the 84 shot pal

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.330 
good power shots with the 84 shot pal
and<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.450> 84<00:03:14.930> finishing<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.010> did<00:03:16.190> make

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
and the 84 finishing so that did make

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.160 
and the 84 finishing so that did make
his<00:03:16.579> shooting<00:03:16.910> really<00:03:17.360> really<00:03:17.569> nice<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.019> I

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
his shooting really really nice so I

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.809 
his shooting really really nice so I
started<00:03:18.650> off<00:03:18.769> I<00:03:18.920> didn't<00:03:19.250> really<00:03:19.400> like<00:03:19.640> his

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
started off I didn't really like his

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.460 
started off I didn't really like his
shooting<00:03:20.120> class<00:03:20.299> of<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.630> box<00:03:20.810> but<00:03:21.319> did

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
shooting class of the box but did

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.170 
shooting class of the box but did
eventually<00:03:21.680> get<00:03:21.980> used<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:23.030> was

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
eventually get used to it and it was

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.300 
eventually get used to it and it was
really<00:03:23.510> really<00:03:23.810> nice<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.590> 89<00:03:24.920> bodies<00:03:25.190> as

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
really really nice and the 89 bodies as

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.920 
really really nice and the 89 bodies as
well<00:03:25.459> for<00:03:25.639> once<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:25.880> did<00:03:26.090> notice<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.480> 89

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
well for once I did notice the 89

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.930 
well for once I did notice the 89
volleys<00:03:27.260> was<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.799> really<00:03:28.220> really<00:03:28.430> nice<00:03:28.639> goal<00:03:28.910> I

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
volleys was a really really nice goal I

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.370 
volleys was a really really nice goal I
scored<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.359> start<00:03:29.600> where<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:29.810> flicked<00:03:30.049> over<00:03:30.319> a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
scored the start where I flicked over a

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.410 
scored the start where I flicked over a
play<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.190> 89<00:03:31.519> bodies<00:03:31.760> helped<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.150> lot<00:03:32.269> just

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
play and the 89 bodies helped a lot just

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.640 
play and the 89 bodies helped a lot just
smashing<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:32.959> straight<00:03:33.230> into<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.470> top<00:03:33.620> corner

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
smashing it straight into the top corner

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.440 
smashing it straight into the top corner
and<00:03:34.310> that<00:03:34.400> was<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.579> really<00:03:34.760> great<00:03:34.970> goal<00:03:35.269> and

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
and that was a really great goal and

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.449 
and that was a really great goal and
making<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.200> nice<00:03:36.319> cause<00:03:36.530> plenty<00:03:36.799> of<00:03:37.100> nice<00:03:37.250> girls

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
making a nice cause plenty of nice girls

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.009 
making a nice cause plenty of nice girls
at<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.700> when<00:03:38.239> going<00:03:38.389> through<00:03:38.510> on<00:03:38.660> goal<00:03:38.840> you

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
at that when going through on goal you

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.479 
at that when going through on goal you
can<00:03:39.049> just<00:03:39.260> power<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.620> finesse<00:03:39.889> it<00:03:40.069> pretty<00:03:40.310> much

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
can just power it finesse it pretty much

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.360 
can just power it finesse it pretty much
it'll<00:03:40.790> go<00:03:40.940> in<00:03:41.060> every<00:03:41.150> single<00:03:41.389> time<00:03:42.370> nothing

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
it'll go in every single time nothing

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.370 
it'll go in every single time nothing
that<00:03:43.489> did<00:03:43.609> notice<00:03:43.940> was<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.480> four-star<00:03:45.139> weak

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
that did notice was the four-star weak

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.870 
that did notice was the four-star weak
effort<00:03:45.560> that<00:03:45.889> was<00:03:45.980> really<00:03:46.340> noticeable<00:03:46.670> his

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
effort that was really noticeable his

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.970 
effort that was really noticeable his
right<00:03:47.090> foot<00:03:47.299> shooting<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.989> not<00:03:48.350> quite<00:03:48.680> as<00:03:48.739> good

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
right foot shooting is not quite as good

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.069 
right foot shooting is not quite as good
as<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.220> left<00:03:49.430> for<00:03:49.549> obviously<00:03:49.880> but<00:03:50.510> it's<00:03:50.780> nearly

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
as is left for obviously but it's nearly

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.229 
as is left for obviously but it's nearly
as<00:03:51.290> good<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:51.769> shooting<00:03:52.370> on<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.519> right<00:03:52.700> foot<00:03:52.940> is

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
as good so shooting on the right foot is

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.720 
as good so shooting on the right foot is
very<00:03:53.780> very<00:03:53.989> good<00:03:54.109> you've<00:03:55.069> also<00:03:55.250> watch<00:03:55.489> free

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
very very good you've also watch free

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.490 
very very good you've also watch free
kicks<00:03:56.000> he's<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.209> good<00:03:56.420> free-kick<00:03:56.630> take<00:03:57.019> it<00:03:57.230> does

have<00:03:57.799> things<00:03:58.130> 74<00:03:58.760> free<00:03:58.940> kick<00:03:59.090> accuracy<00:03:59.359> but

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
have things 74 free kick accuracy but

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.270 
have things 74 free kick accuracy but
does<00:03:59.780> have<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.019> 18<00:04:00.260> on<00:04:00.350> curve<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.769> 84<00:04:01.069> shot

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280

Pat<00:04:01.459> says<00:04:01.970> what<00:04:02.209> you're<00:04:02.329> looking<00:04:02.600> for<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:02.900> a

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
Pat says what you're looking for in a

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.990 
Pat says what you're looking for in a
free<00:04:03.079> kick<00:04:03.290> taker<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.889> if<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:04.549> do<00:04:04.760> get<00:04:04.910> the

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
free kick taker and if you do get the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.839 
free kick taker and if you do get the
chance<00:04:05.239> he<00:04:05.720> will<00:04:05.870> score<00:04:06.200> free<00:04:06.410> kicks<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.790> I

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
chance he will score free kicks and I

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:08.800 
chance he will score free kicks and I
think<00:04:08.060> that's<00:04:08.209> what<00:04:08.329> pretty<00:04:08.480> much<00:04:08.540> all<00:04:08.750> the

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
think that's what pretty much all the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.870 
think that's what pretty much all the
positives<00:04:09.200> just<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.680> couple<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.069> negatives<00:04:10.489> he

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
positives just a couple of negatives he

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.940 
positives just a couple of negatives he
is<00:04:11.000> quite<00:04:11.239> expensive<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.840> moment<00:04:12.109> about<00:04:12.170> 85<00:04:12.650> k

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
is quite expensive the moment about 85 k

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.250

on<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.220> Xbox<00:04:13.609> he<00:04:14.060> should<00:04:14.329> drop<00:04:14.569> anyway<00:04:15.019> and

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
on the Xbox he should drop anyway and

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
also his finishing was off at times he

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.089 
also his finishing was off at times he

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
would occasionally go through and go and

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.110 
would occasionally go through and go and

do i think is worth it will compared to
like<00:04:47.930> gabbiadini<00:04:48.350> gabbiadini<00:04:48.919> is<00:04:49.190> good<00:04:49.460> but

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
like gabbiadini gabbiadini is good but

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.939 
like gabbiadini gabbiadini is good but
make<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.030> really<00:04:50.150> does<00:04:50.660> have<00:04:50.960> crazy<00:04:51.440> shooting

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
make it really does have crazy shooting
