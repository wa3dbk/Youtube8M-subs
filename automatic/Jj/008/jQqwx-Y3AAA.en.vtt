 Here and gentlemen and glass do not pretend to 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.480
 title of champions of originality

 revealed to the world is not fresh but 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.420
 relatively new creation daylight sake 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.610
 which players must quit and run 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.460
 mow down

 undead let's tell video review from

 gamer info 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.230
 dot com 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.030
 the fictional eastern town of Harran fell 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.730
 the victim of a dangerous virus symptoms 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.160
 infected patients overly convincing 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.650
 burning desire to eat living flesh and 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.320
 reduction of conscious activity to 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.880
 the level of the ottoman artful government 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.920
 touches residential area 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.840
 leaving healthy people alone with 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.120
 freshly made raw foodists 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.640
 and in the eyes of the public not to be 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.280
 really quite soulless ranging from active 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.650
 air utility delivery method 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.330
 dropping from flying over us 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.430
 airplanes but one of the beautiful 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.740
 sunny days pandemic 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.530
 instead of drugs on the city is landed 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.380
 Special Agent Kyle Crane Secret Files 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.320
 look up to do the usual for the brave 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:56.119
 Americans craft rescue survivors and 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:58.400
 killing a bad guy if on 1 2 3 and 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.410
 all subsequent views to the player can 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.170
 It seems that the project is very much 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.290
 reminds grandfather island then this because 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.140
 so it is hot Polish guys from 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.480
 those land sculpted both games and as 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.390
 the basis of all daylight gaming mechanics 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.819
 exactly dead island is taken and so much the better 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.940
 favor daylight the further away from 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.020
 It’s a pity that it’s not always her 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.630
 it succeeds 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.750
 the story could well be atmospheric 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.920
 benefit all the elements for this are 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.319
 postapocalyptic setting wonderful 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.940
 location excellent soundtrack let 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.520
 caricature but what no 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.950
 dramatic line but scriptwriters all 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.680
 the road is diligently discredited 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.069
 reminding myself of a crazy past 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.600
 task to find coffee crayons and other 9 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.790
 rims good 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.220
 bit by bit gathering atmosphere 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.200
 ghost town abandoned in the background 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.870
 requests for more zombies for 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.540
 shooting movie scenes footage of the dying 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:04.220
 comrades under dramatic music often 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:06.590
 look ridiculous enough main 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.110
 modern techland trump newfangled 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.180
 a handful of city ​​travel systems 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.370
 survivors can remain so only 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.740
 because everything in it is like a selection 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.260
 tracer and moving on stone 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.840
 the jungle is set very well not 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.000
 sin against the truth if we report that 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.400
 daylight is the best on 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.120
 today the implementation of virtual 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.850
 parkour 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.560
 jump drop while ranked balance in 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.780
 you start to feel a certain moment 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.330
 self born and makosi 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.880
 sorry that the primitive system of the same type 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.950
 quests works strictly according to the scheme go 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.320
 find and visit points 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.540
 placed very badly let 2 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.370
 the locations in the game are enough 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.380
 little stupid race 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.210
 from one corner of the map to another view 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.360
 lack of fast moving system 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.240
 sometimes very annoying but for the surrender 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.190
 quests pour experience stupid 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.050
 pumping for pumping supplied 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.840
 immediately in three directions 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.210
 survival agility strength the trouble is that 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.880
 techland chose the poorest method 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.130
 development initially took away from the character all 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.330
 basic abilities like tackles and 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.640
 zombie jump 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.220
 and then put the player on the opportunity 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.220
 little by little they return the words paws 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.800
 distinctive feature of daylight 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.960
 besides the superb picture is and 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.759
 time of day dynamic system 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.159
 all the days on the streets of Charon 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.139
 relatively calm then at night 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.629
 crane becomes easy prey for 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.240
 monsters creeping on the hunt alone 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:46.090
 hope to sleep in safe areas 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.610
 but go ahead and run in the dark 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.650
 the twilight of the resulting experience becomes as much 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.650
 twice is not a bad way 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.990
 confront brain overt adversity in 4 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.569
 local co-op or seamless 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.569
 multiplayer if the first is clear 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.669
 one head is good a4 mutant killer then 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:06.069
 network standoff deserves 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.750
 separate curtsy at times in on whose 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:10.509
 voice on the radio may ask 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.839
 destroy nests of especially dangerous ghouls 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.879
 zest is that these ghouls are people too 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:18.249
 what is called on the other end of the wire 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:20.199
 anybody can get into the role of a zombie 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:22.360
 wishing to try to pump their 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.610
 talents in the field of devouring humans 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.389
 not so much not decided to destroy 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.389
 your nests 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.509
 but no matter how many great ideas do not 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.759
 generated those lan to fight with them 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.279
 creeps creeping elements 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:43.099
 mechanics from which a mile carries 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:45.169
 stench grandfather island why the poles believe 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.809
 that respawn zombies at intervals 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.360
 set aside from a protected spot of sight 

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:52.699
 it's okay where did they get them 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.369
 Levi- ring auto system is interesting 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.860
 knowhow which is obliged to go from the game to 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:06:00.020
 the game is like a dead system constantly 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.899
 breaking weapon got to release 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.539
 for the third time in a row the victory of the absurd 

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:08.539
 this is a super special agent gasping from 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:11.210
 two sweeps with a tiny knife 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.610
 fixing a broken baseball bat this 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.189
 permanent taking damage from scrub 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.020
 unwillingness hanowa weapons is unwillingness 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.510
 raises your own level to 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.290
 rootstock 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.290
 but who 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.060
 but 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.759
 daylight is a good game with bad 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.560
 elements are very interesting to combine 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.380
 under one roof incredible progress 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.630
 studios on pictures and new ideas 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.210
 game mechanics with as much 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.910
 incredible stagnation of a depressing 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.860
 crafting systems and the author of the evaning sum 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.020
 the company abandon its so 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.210
 beloved developments we could well 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.930
 to wait for a park breakthrough in game 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.000
 industry 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.460
 at the moment we have a good 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.380
 crafts with a lot of roughness 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.810
 which may try to brighten 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.030
 fun from cooperative passing 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.849
 or authentic and thriller on and feeling 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.680
 vulnerabilities at night like 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.020
 whatever we congratulate techland on 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:30.080
 development of their ideas that you look soon 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.080
 commando sculpts quite decent project
