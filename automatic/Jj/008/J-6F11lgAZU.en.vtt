00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
let's make this a little bit quicker

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.970 
let's make this a little bit quicker
head<00:00:23.519> around<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> left<00:00:24.260> and<00:00:25.260> you're

head around to the left and you're
looking<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.490> these<00:00:27.390> kind<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.900> structures

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
looking for these kind of structures

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.000 
looking for these kind of structures
which<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.130> happily<00:00:29.880> jump<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:34.010> preferably

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
which you can happily jump up preferably

00:00:35.010 --> 00:01:25.170 
which you can happily jump up preferably
without<00:00:35.219> being<00:00:35.640> eaten

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.500 

and<00:01:26.020> there<00:01:26.260> we<00:01:26.440> have<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.940> next<00:01:27.940> up<00:01:28.090> is<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.330> one

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
and there we have it next up is the one

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.770 
and there we have it next up is the one
at<00:01:28.630> gabion<00:01:29.140> swype<00:01:29.410> I<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.820> Vista<00:01:31.210> is<00:01:31.450> just

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
at gabion swype I the Vista is just

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.320 
at gabion swype I the Vista is just
outside<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.230> gap<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:32.800> if<00:01:33.070> it's<00:01:33.250> contested<00:01:33.880> you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
outside the gap so if it's contested you

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.620 
outside the gap so if it's contested you
may<00:01:34.570> have<00:01:34.600> a<00:01:34.900> bit<00:01:35.110> of<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.290> run<00:01:35.530> but<00:01:36.460> it's<00:01:37.060> not<00:01:37.450> too

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
may have a bit of a run but it's not too

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.040 
may have a bit of a run but it's not too
bad<00:01:37.780> as<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.320> can<00:01:38.440> see<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:40.210> a<00:01:40.479> relatively

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
bad as you can see it's a relatively

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:54.690 
bad as you can see it's a relatively
short<00:01:41.260> on<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.670> just<00:01:42.910> get<00:01:43.150> rid<00:01:43.300> of<00:01:43.450> these<00:01:43.570> mods

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.810 

nice<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:55.940> easy<00:01:56.200> up<00:01:57.200> next<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.010> Vista<00:01:58.400> just

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
nice and easy up next is the Vista just

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.140 
nice and easy up next is the Vista just
east<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.360> meddlers<00:01:59.840> waypoint

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.270 

now<00:02:04.660> this<00:02:04.900> one's<00:02:05.140> really<00:02:05.410> nice<00:02:05.710> as<00:02:05.980> you<00:02:06.160> can

now this one's really nice as you can

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.840 
now this one's really nice as you can
actually<00:02:06.430> see<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:07.180> whole<00:02:07.630> pathway<00:02:08.050> up<00:02:08.550> from<00:02:09.550> a

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
actually see the whole pathway up from a

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.310 
actually see the whole pathway up from a
long<00:02:10.479> distance<00:02:10.869> so<00:02:12.900> should<00:02:13.900> have<00:02:14.080> a

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
long distance so should have a

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.890 
long distance so should have a
relatively<00:02:14.950> good<00:02:15.370> idea<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.150> where<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.360> go<00:02:16.510> just

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
relatively good idea of where to go just

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.680 
relatively good idea of where to go just
from<00:02:17.020> looking<00:02:17.320> at<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.620> really<00:02:21.330> now<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.540> I've

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
from looking at it really now that I've

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:36.210 
from looking at it really now that I've
said<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.290> bet<00:02:23.560> I'm<00:02:23.650> gonna<00:02:23.800> fall

Cathedral of silence now getting here is
probably<00:03:31.719> going<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.139> be<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.739> most

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
probably going to be the most

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.979 
probably going to be the most
time-consuming<00:03:34.959> part<00:03:35.409> I<00:03:36.120> suppose<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.389> this

time-consuming part I suppose of this
Vista<00:03:38.199> this<00:03:38.560> one<00:03:38.709> is<00:03:38.799> relatively<00:03:39.280> easy<00:03:39.419> when

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
Vista this one is relatively easy when

Vista this one is relatively easy when
you<00:03:40.569> get<00:03:40.750> on<00:03:40.870> short<00:03:41.139> you<00:03:41.319> just<00:03:41.530> want<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.829> head

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
you get on short you just want to head

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.640 
you get on short you just want to head
around<00:03:42.699> to<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.180> left<00:03:43.209> hand<00:03:43.750> side<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:44.379> the

any<00:03:50.259> mobs<00:03:52.259> and<00:03:53.939> we<00:03:54.939> got<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.120> nice<00:03:55.359> little

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569
