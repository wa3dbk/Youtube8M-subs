00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
the combination of the longer wheelbase

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.270 
the combination of the longer wheelbase
and<00:04:38.970> wider<00:04:39.300> track<00:04:39.690> makes<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.350> i-10<00:04:40.710> feel<00:04:40.980> more

and wider track makes the i-10 feel more

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.610 
and wider track makes the i-10 feel more
stable<00:04:41.610> in<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.000> corners<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:42.630> because<00:04:43.470> it's

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
stable in the corners and because it's

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.680 
stable in the corners and because it's
got<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.800> lower<00:04:44.100> roof<00:04:44.460> it's<00:04:44.820> got<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.000> lower<00:04:45.240> center

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
got a lower roof it's got a lower center

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.810 
got a lower roof it's got a lower center
of<00:04:45.720> gravity<00:04:45.810> so<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.620> doesn't<00:04:47.070> feel<00:04:47.250> as<00:04:47.310> wall

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
of gravity so it doesn't feel as wall

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
front and back so there's less dive
