dive straight in and here we go on so

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.730 
dive straight in and here we go on so
each<00:01:27.299> level<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.659> different<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
each level is different it's a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.770 
each level is different it's a
procedurally<00:01:29.460> generated<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.329> mean<00:01:30.659> there's

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
procedurally generated so I mean there's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.300 
procedurally generated so I mean there's
not<00:01:30.869> much<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.860> will<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.159> little

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
not much to it but it will be a little

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.859 
not much to it but it will be a little
bit<00:01:32.490> different<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.030> thought<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.360> was<00:01:33.509> coming<00:01:33.630> for

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
bit different I thought I was coming for

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.469 
bit different I thought I was coming for
the<00:01:33.990> sort<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.640> final<00:01:35.640> plans<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.150> escape

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the sort of final plans of escape

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.969 
the sort of final plans of escape
because<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.259> say<00:01:37.439> only<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.770> early

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
because it's like say only in early

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.080 
because it's like say only in early
access<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.430> moments<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> don't<00:01:38.970> know<00:01:39.030> if

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
access at the moments I don't know if

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.340 
access at the moments I don't know if
there's<00:01:39.210> gonna<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.390> any<00:01:39.479> online<00:01:39.720> multiplayer
