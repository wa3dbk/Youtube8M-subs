00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
theater mode really makes everything

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.290 
theater mode really makes everything
look<00:00:43.829> off<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.399> don't<00:00:44.520> know<00:00:44.579> what<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.000> maybe

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
look off I don't know what it is maybe

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.150 
look off I don't know what it is maybe
only<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.870> host<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.260> really<00:00:46.440> looks<00:00:46.620> real

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
only if your host it really looks real

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.790 
only if your host it really looks real
but<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.120> reason<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.660> recording<00:00:49.620> live

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
but I'm the reason I like recording live

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.680 
but I'm the reason I like recording live
it's<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.219> everything<00:00:50.700> seems<00:00:51.120> more<00:00:51.239> genuine

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it's just everything seems more genuine

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's just everything seems more genuine
especially<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.199> teammates<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
especially we have teammates and the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.590 
especially we have teammates and the
talking<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.180> feel<00:00:54.390> for

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
talking you kind of get this feel for

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.229 
talking you kind of get this feel for
communication<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.440> camaraderie<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.789> guess<00:00:57.030> I

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
communication and camaraderie I guess I

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.369 
communication and camaraderie I guess I
don't<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.480> that's<00:00:57.690> kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.989> dumb<00:00:58.109> word<00:00:58.260> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
don't know that's kind of a dumb word to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.970 
don't know that's kind of a dumb word to
use<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.760> yeah<00:00:59.760> anyways<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
use but yeah anyways a little some of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.429 
use but yeah anyways a little some of
the<00:01:02.039> reasons<00:01:02.340> i<00:01:02.460> don't<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.940> mission<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:04.080> feel

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the reasons i don't like mission it feel

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.710 
the reasons i don't like mission it feel
a<00:01:04.680> lot<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.309> terminal<00:01:05.939> from<00:01:06.299> modern<00:01:06.570> warfare

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
a lot like terminal from modern warfare

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.000 
a lot like terminal from modern warfare
2<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> sense<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.560> there's<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:07.890> only

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
2 in the sense that there's really only

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.940 
2 in the sense that there's really only
two<00:01:08.159> ways<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> play<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.790> map<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.720> either

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
two ways to play this map you can either

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.460 
two ways to play this map you can either
rush<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.189> meet<00:01:11.490> your<00:01:11.610> enemy<00:01:11.850> head-on<00:01:12.060> or<00:01:12.470> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
rush up meet your enemy head-on or you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.530 
rush up meet your enemy head-on or you
can<00:01:13.650> camp<00:01:13.950> back<00:01:14.220> with<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> sniper<00:01:14.729> an<00:01:15.060> AR<00:01:15.330> and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
can camp back with a sniper an AR and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.749 
can camp back with a sniper an AR and
play<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> cunt<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.530> that's<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.640> not

anos Search and Destroy I explained out
this<00:03:06.430> map<00:03:06.610> is<00:03:06.640> probably<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.420> best<00:03:07.870> for<00:03:08.110> kill

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
this map is probably the best for kill

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.450 
this map is probably the best for kill
Street<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.500> probably<00:03:08.710> one<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.130> best<00:03:09.310> I

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
Street is probably one of the best I

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.640 
Street is probably one of the best I
should<00:03:09.610> rephrase<00:03:10.410> actually<00:03:11.410> no<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.530> probably

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
should rephrase actually no it probably

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.830 
should rephrase actually no it probably
is<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.980> best<00:03:12.130> people<00:03:13.120> keep<00:03:13.270> saying<00:03:13.330> village

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
is the best people keep saying village

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.260 
is the best people keep saying village
