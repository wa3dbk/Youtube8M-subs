hey guys this is Ivan will ever look E&amp;T
and<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.840> today's<00:00:13.110> video<00:00:13.290> we're<00:00:13.559> working<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:13.889> a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
and in today's video we're working on a

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.090 
and in today's video we're working on a
smart<00:00:14.219> furnace<00:00:14.580> version<00:00:14.910> 2<00:00:15.089> point<00:00:15.330> 0<00:00:15.540> BAM

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
smart furnace version 2 point 0 BAM

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.460 
smart furnace version 2 point 0 BAM
alright<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:18.090> unfortunately<00:00:18.779> I'm<00:00:19.050> not

a good version 2 point 0 this is more of
a<00:00:21.480> fix<00:00:21.949> here<00:00:22.949> lately<00:00:23.189> I've<00:00:23.369> had<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> lot<00:00:23.670> of

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
a fix here lately I've had a lot of

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.370 
a fix here lately I've had a lot of
comments<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> smart<00:00:24.510> furnace<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.350> broken

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
comments if the smart furnace is broken

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.410 
comments if the smart furnace is broken
I<00:00:26.010> actually<00:00:26.160> saw<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.760> my<00:00:26.849> let's<00:00:27.090> play<00:00:27.150> as

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
I actually saw that on my let's play as

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.080 
I actually saw that on my let's play as
well<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:28.140> was<00:00:28.320> originally<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.340> code

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
well this was originally a a code

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.330 
well this was originally a a code
crafted<00:00:30.630> design<00:00:30.929> basically<00:00:31.619> what's<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.219> on

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
crafted design basically what's going on

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.810 
crafted design basically what's going on
here<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:33.230> their<00:00:34.230> furnaces<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.160> course<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
here is their furnaces of course and

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.819 
here is their furnaces of course and
these<00:00:35.940> are<00:00:36.000> bud<00:00:36.660> switches<00:00:37.140> block<00:00:37.380> update

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
these are bud switches block update

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.299 
these are bud switches block update
detectors<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:40.140> what<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.500> used<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.800> happen<00:00:40.980> is

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
detectors so what it used to happen is

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.889 
detectors so what it used to happen is
used<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.790> able<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.090> go<00:00:42.210> ahead<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.480> burn<00:00:42.690> an

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
used to be able to go ahead and burn an

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.430 
used to be able to go ahead and burn an
item<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:44.640> bud<00:00:44.850> switch<00:00:45.090> would<00:00:45.480> react<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
item the bud switch would react the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.889 
item the bud switch would react the
change<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> furnace<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.660> from

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
change in the furnace you know from

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.080 
change in the furnace you know from
unlit<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.829> lit<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.309> block<00:00:50.610> update<00:00:50.969> would

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
unlit to lit and the block update would

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.689 
unlit to lit and the block update would
react<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.539> them<00:00:51.750> shooting<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.829> colorful

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
react to them shooting up this colorful

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.959 
react to them shooting up this colorful
you<00:00:54.570> know<00:00:54.690> block<00:00:55.640> letting<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.699> know<00:00:56.820> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
you know block letting you know that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.369 
you know block letting you know that
there's<00:00:57.149> something<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.780> specific<00:00:58.350> one

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
there's something in this specific one

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.560 
there's something in this specific one
but<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.010> tell<00:00:59.070> now<00:00:59.430> they<00:01:00.180> were<00:01:00.239> all

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
but as you can tell now they were all

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.510 
but as you can tell now they were all
activated<00:01:01.199> why<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.949> apparently<00:01:02.340> there

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
activated why because apparently there

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.039 
activated why because apparently there
was<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.670> change<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.120> bud<00:01:03.420> switches<00:01:03.840> where<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
was a change in bud switches where a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.770 
was a change in bud switches where a
piston<00:01:04.650> reacts<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.850> another<00:01:06.240> piston

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
piston reacts to another piston

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.080 
piston reacts to another piston
previously<00:01:07.439> let's<00:01:07.650> say<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.850> bud

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
previously let's say this is a bud

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.090 
previously let's say this is a bud
switch<00:01:09.299> right<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:10.470> when<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.860> one

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
switch right here and then when this one

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.179 
switch right here and then when this one
fired<00:01:11.400> off<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.299> bud<00:01:12.630> switch<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:13.530> react<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
fired off this bud switch when react to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.969 
fired off this bud switch when react to
the<00:01:14.280> change<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> piston<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.170> nowadays

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the change of the piston on nowadays

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.820 
the change of the piston on nowadays
they<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.720> both<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.350> so

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
they do and so they both go up so

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.039 
they do and so they both go up so
basically<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.400> happens<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.659> block

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
basically what happens is this block

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.710 
basically what happens is this block
update<00:01:22.590> detector<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.030> detecting<00:01:24.630> that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
update detector here is detecting that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.510 
update detector here is detecting that
this<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.140> move<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.220> moves

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
this one move so when this one moves

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.130 
this one move so when this one moves
this<00:01:26.729> one<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> text<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.900> text

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
this one to text it in this one to text

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.620 
this one to text it in this one to text
and<00:01:28.229> they<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.500> go<00:01:28.650> crazy<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:30.119> unfortunately

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and they all go crazy so unfortunately

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.789 
and they all go crazy so unfortunately
the<00:01:30.720> only<00:01:30.810> way<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> fix<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.439> which<00:01:31.560> kind<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the only way to fix it which kind of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.830 
the only way to fix it which kind of
makes<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.100> bulkier<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.549> less<00:01:32.909> efficient<00:01:33.420> but

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
makes it bulkier and less efficient but

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.530 
makes it bulkier and less efficient but
this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> now<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.340> hoppers<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.210> things

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
this is a now we have hoppers and things

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.690 
this is a now we have hoppers and things
like<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.740> think<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
like that so I don't think that the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.420 
like that so I don't think that the
whole<00:01:38.909> system<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.840> needed<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.470> much<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:41.310> you

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
whole system is needed so much but you

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.340 
whole system is needed so much but you
know<00:01:41.549> people<00:01:42.150> still<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.540> having<00:01:42.780> them<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
know people still like having them and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.020 
know people still like having them and
it<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.560> still<00:01:43.770> young<00:01:44.009> serves<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.460> purpose<00:01:44.670> for

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
it is still young serves a purpose for

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.240 
it is still young serves a purpose for
example<00:01:45.899> let<00:01:46.409> me<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.619> rid<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:46.920> because

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
example let me get rid of this because

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.380 
example let me get rid of this because
you<00:01:47.340> don't<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.549> need<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.180> doing

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you don't really need it I was doing

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.690 
you don't really need it I was doing
something<00:01:48.600> else<00:01:49.189> can<00:01:50.189> defeat<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> whole

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
something else can defeat the whole

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.060 
something else can defeat the whole
purpose<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.570> know<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.049> 40<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.770> uh

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
purpose of you know this is 40 so uh

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.740 
purpose of you know this is 40 so uh
what<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.909> would<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.329> would<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.659> ahead

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
what you would do is you would go ahead

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.190 
what you would do is you would go ahead
and<00:01:54.869> burn<00:01:55.049> an<00:01:55.229> item<00:01:56.479> as<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.719> tell<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.020> fix

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and burn an item as you can tell the fix

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.160 
and burn an item as you can tell the fix
is<00:01:58.320> against<00:01:58.590> separating<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.340> by<00:01:59.490> one<00:02:00.020> now<00:02:01.020> what

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
is against separating it by one now what

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.630 
is against separating it by one now what
happens<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.530> lets<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.799> go<00:02:01.920> exploring<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.610> a

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
happens is lets you go exploring on a

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.280 
happens is lets you go exploring on a
big<00:02:02.880> expedition<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.630> you've<00:02:03.750> gone<00:02:03.990> ahead<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
big expedition and you've gone ahead and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.800 
big expedition and you've gone ahead and
cook<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> thousand<00:02:05.369> fishes<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
cook the thousand fishes but you have a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.469 
cook the thousand fishes but you have a
room<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.320> furnaces<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
room of furnaces and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.790 
room of furnaces and
you<00:02:08.569> hate<00:02:08.840> going<00:02:09.200> through<00:02:09.409> every<00:02:09.619> single

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
you hate going through every single

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.500 
you hate going through every single
furnace<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.399> figure<00:02:10.670> out<00:02:10.789> if<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.269> cook

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
furnace to figure out if you cook

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.130 
furnace to figure out if you cook
something<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:12.050> one<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.290> them<00:02:12.590> right<00:02:13.269> this<00:02:14.269> here

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
something on one of them right this here

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.440 
something on one of them right this here
lets<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.620> know<00:02:15.769> hey<00:02:16.010> look<00:02:16.519> at<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.670> look<00:02:17.360> at

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
lets you know hey look at that look at

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.600 
lets you know hey look at that look at
that<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.690> purple<00:02:18.080> ones<00:02:18.290> up<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.159> clearly<00:02:19.459> I

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
that the purple ones up so clearly I

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.210 
that the purple ones up so clearly I
left<00:02:20.000> something<00:02:20.269> here<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.690> cook<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.409> you<00:02:21.920> take

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
left something here to cook and you take

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.440 
left something here to cook and you take
it<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.610> clearly<00:02:23.000> there<00:02:23.239> would<00:02:23.330> have<00:02:23.390> been

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
it and clearly there would have been

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.300 
it and clearly there would have been
nothing<00:02:23.690> here<00:02:24.049> and<00:02:24.230> when<00:02:24.769> you're<00:02:24.920> ready<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.190> go

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
nothing here and when you're ready to go

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.640 
nothing here and when you're ready to go
you<00:02:25.370> reset<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.660> go<00:02:26.959> ahead<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.290> use<00:02:27.500> it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
you reset it and go ahead and use it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.970 
you reset it and go ahead and use it
again<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.629> this<00:02:29.629> case<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.170> know<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.769> now<00:02:30.920> you

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
again in this case you know and now you

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.860 
again in this case you know and now you
use<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.489> one<00:02:31.670> go<00:02:31.849> on<00:02:31.970> an<00:02:32.060> expedition<00:02:32.209> come

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
use that one go on an expedition come

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.509 
use that one go on an expedition come
back<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.170> it's<00:02:33.260> like<00:02:33.379> oh<00:02:33.470> hey<00:02:33.709> there's<00:02:34.280> stuff

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
back and it's like oh hey there's stuff

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.940 
back and it's like oh hey there's stuff
you're<00:02:34.700> ready<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.030> take<00:02:35.239> all<00:02:36.019> right<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:36.829> let's

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
you're ready to take all right so let's

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.009 
you're ready to take all right so let's
build<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.459> I'll<00:02:38.060> build<00:02:38.329> it<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.540> guess<00:02:38.720> kind<00:02:38.959> of

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
build it I'll build it I guess kind of

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.110 
build it I'll build it I guess kind of
like<00:02:39.170> full<00:02:39.620> size<00:02:39.890> let's<00:02:40.459> start<00:02:40.700> off<00:02:40.790> with<00:02:40.819> the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
like full size let's start off with the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.970 
like full size let's start off with the
button<00:02:41.360> that's<00:02:41.480> going<00:02:41.629> to<00:02:41.690> hold<00:02:41.840> up<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.769> block

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
button that's going to hold up the block

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.680 
button that's going to hold up the block
that's<00:02:43.160> going<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.430> hold<00:02:43.549> a<00:02:43.700> button<00:02:43.970> will<00:02:44.480> put<00:02:44.660> a

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
that's going to hold a button will put a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.400 
that's going to hold a button will put a
repeater<00:02:45.049> behind<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.650> put<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.489> block<00:02:47.410> redstone

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
repeater behind it put a block redstone

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.880 
repeater behind it put a block redstone
torch<00:02:48.739> block<00:02:49.579> on<00:02:49.790> top<00:02:49.819> of<00:02:50.359> that<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.049> then

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
torch block on top of that and then

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.089 
torch block on top of that and then
let's<00:02:52.069> play<00:02:52.280> some<00:02:52.599> furnaces<00:02:53.599> one<00:02:53.959> two<00:02:54.470> three

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
let's play some furnaces one two three

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.569 
let's play some furnaces one two three
four<00:02:55.549> five<00:02:55.579> six<00:02:56.000> seven<00:02:56.890> seven<00:02:57.890> basically<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.459> a

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
four five six seven seven basically is a

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.660 
four five six seven seven basically is a
maximum<00:02:59.030> because<00:02:59.209> redstone<00:02:59.870> ones<00:03:00.049> for<00:03:00.260> 15<00:03:00.739> so

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
maximum because redstone ones for 15 so

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.080 
maximum because redstone ones for 15 so
yeah<00:03:03.099> alright<00:03:04.099> let's<00:03:04.250> kind<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.459> run<00:03:04.640> this<00:03:04.819> all

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
yeah alright let's kind of run this all

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.509 
yeah alright let's kind of run this all
the<00:03:05.450> way<00:03:05.480> over<00:03:05.750> here<00:03:05.780> put<00:03:06.709> sticky<00:03:07.099> pistons

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
the way over here put sticky pistons

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.039 
the way over here put sticky pistons
directly<00:03:07.940> behind<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.359> furnaces<00:03:08.840> like<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:11.049> and

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
directly behind the furnaces like so and

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.420 
directly behind the furnaces like so and
we're<00:03:12.319> gonna<00:03:12.440> go<00:03:12.590> ahead<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:12.739> put<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:12.980> block<00:03:13.250> it

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
we're gonna go ahead and put a block it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.710 
we're gonna go ahead and put a block it
doesn't<00:03:13.639> have<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.819> be<00:03:13.880> purple<00:03:14.329> well<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.569> could

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
doesn't have to be purple well it could

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.390 
doesn't have to be purple well it could
be<00:03:14.750> any<00:03:14.989> block<00:03:15.260> as<00:03:15.440> long<00:03:15.590> as<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.829> pistons<00:03:16.160> able

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
be any block as long as the pistons able

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.129 
be any block as long as the pistons able
to<00:03:16.519> push<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:16.970> bring<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.180> back<00:03:17.419> and<00:03:17.599> then

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
to push it and bring it back and then

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.809 
to push it and bring it back and then
the<00:03:18.230> gravity<00:03:18.620> block<00:03:18.859> on<00:03:19.040> top<00:03:19.069> of<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:19.579> it

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
the gravity block on top of it so it

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.379 
the gravity block on top of it so it
could<00:03:19.970> be<00:03:20.000> sand<00:03:20.389> or<00:03:20.630> gravel<00:03:20.930> like<00:03:21.889> so<00:03:22.269> well<00:03:23.269> you

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
could be sand or gravel like so well you

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.599 
could be sand or gravel like so well you
do<00:03:23.510> design<00:03:23.930> wise<00:03:24.169> guys<00:03:24.470> I<00:03:24.680> mean<00:03:24.829> I<00:03:24.919> completely

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
if this does go into a hopper system

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.890 
if this does go into a hopper system

chest of this one it's activated because

sucked into a hopper and this would

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.870 
sucked into a hopper and this would
still<00:04:36.660> remain<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:37.050> this<00:04:37.200> state<00:04:37.310> okay<00:04:38.310> so<00:04:38.820> you

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
okay don't take the item because you

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.740 
okay don't take the item because you
only<00:04:58.020> needed<00:04:58.229> to<00:04:58.410> cook<00:04:58.560> one<00:04:58.890> quick<00:04:59.190> thing

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
only needed to cook one quick thing

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.730 
only needed to cook one quick thing
because<00:05:00.750> then<00:05:00.840> you<00:05:00.990> go<00:05:01.080> ahead<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.260> take<00:05:01.500> the

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
because then you go ahead and take the

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.580 
because then you go ahead and take the
item<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.479> then<00:05:03.479> it<00:05:03.660> should<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.140> believe

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
item and then it should I believe

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.409 
item and then it should I believe
actually<00:05:05.190> no<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:05.880> doesn't<00:05:06.150> do<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.360> anymore

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
actually no it doesn't do that anymore

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.719 
actually no it doesn't do that anymore
I've<00:05:06.750> noticed<00:05:07.050> that<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:08.250> doesn't<00:05:08.550> have<00:05:08.700> a

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
I've noticed that it doesn't have a

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.719 
I've noticed that it doesn't have a
change<00:05:09.200> but<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.560> problem<00:05:10.919> is<00:05:11.039> this<00:05:11.190> if<00:05:11.400> you<00:05:11.580> do

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
change but the problem is this if you do

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.430 
change but the problem is this if you do
do<00:05:11.910> this<00:05:12.120> actually<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.780> like<00:05:12.930> okay<00:05:13.200> I'm<00:05:13.320> going

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
do this actually and like okay I'm going

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.420 
do this actually and like okay I'm going
to<00:05:13.530> reset<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.970> then<00:05:15.120> you<00:05:15.270> reset<00:05:15.750> it

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
to reset it and then you reset it

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.200 
to reset it and then you reset it
normally<00:05:17.430> if<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:17.550> didn't<00:05:17.760> do<00:05:17.880> them<00:05:18.000> at<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.120> same

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
normally if I didn't do them at the same

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.570 
normally if I didn't do them at the same
exact<00:05:18.690> time<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.620> block<00:05:20.100> up<00:05:20.280> they<00:05:20.430> would

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
exact time the block up they would

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.400 
exact time the block up they would
probably<00:05:20.789> detect<00:05:21.180> that<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.389> went<00:05:21.539> off<00:05:21.690> but

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
probably detect that it went off but
