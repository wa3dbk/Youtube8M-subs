 all sorts of recipes for snacks from 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:18.179
 eggplant but more often it happens 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.670
 the misfortune that this snack is not very 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.859
 long stored and the reason for that and more often 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.869
 all are that data snacks 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.720
 all kinds of take out we add garlic and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.210
 unfortunately if there is not enough 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.579
 cool place then ours are not kept 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.860

 eggplant for the winter that is but nothing 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.539
 need besides our eggplants 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.399
 vegetable oil for roasting and 4000 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.379
 necessary for that here you see that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.870
 eggplant us already sliced ​​ie we 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.449
 take any fruit and any size any 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.940
 forms and cut them into circles 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.859
 in principle, if you do not build pieces 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.570
 can in any other shape like you 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.579
 like more but they should not be 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.330
 thin enough not fat enough 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.820
 that is , about one and a half to two centimeters and 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.940
 so necessary soaked in salt water is not 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.160
 less than an hour neatly them from there 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.230
 learned can wash the salt is 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.540
 not very much and now very 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.560
 simple operation now we have prepared 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.460
 skillet 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.170
 pour ordinary vegetable oil there 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.360
 you shouldn't have too many legs too 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.820
 least in the process of frying eggplant of course 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.210
 same oil absorbs it can be added 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.770
 as needed we pour 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.280
 vegetable oil and a frying pan 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.530
 we stack our eggplants to start 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.530
 disperse and pans and from 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.870
 at the same time now we have prepared 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.820
 jars 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.350
 necessarily in sterilized jars not 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.100
 we will lay our fried 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.920
 eggplants 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.230
 but in the easiest way possible 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.740
 carpenters in the pan well laid 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.520
 our eggplants from two sides to full 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.630
 readiness 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.350
 this way and roasted our 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.460
 show 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.950
 see production so 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:14.790
 plump we guess in 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:18.000
 I put our jars a little bit 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.740
 My seminar is not very good 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.260
 diligently because otherwise they just 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.670
 lose shape 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.450
 will not be very beautiful when you 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.820
 get on the eve of something like this 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.330
 way carpenters lay our 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.330
 jar 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:49.880
 remains it burns passing we ignite 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:55.150
 vegetable oil and roll up left 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.150
 nothing terrible is digested to the little corner 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.460
 a little bit 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.870
