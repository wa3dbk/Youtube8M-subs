00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.889
 nutrition and nutrition it is very important to have all the knowledge 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.130
 to do it correctly especially for the little ones so that the pp 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.659
 that last year when in the partial 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:13.709
 in a healthy way 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.470
 that's why the special license for this format in which both banks 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.470
 popular 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.949
 he stood there moreover also steps clearly there is that special block 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.460
 about food and nutrition but let's get to know 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.969
 what is the complementary limitation that I know is that we are going to devote our 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.720
 some criticism time 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.179
 after six months start receiving supplementary pension 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.320
 and we want to know what this is all about here 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.220
 then what is this complementary limitation 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.760
 elements are complementary that defines it as a process that begins with 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.920
 exclusive breastfeeding 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.440
 with the choice of the breast 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.840
 enough to cover the nutritional requirements of our 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.530
 baby 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.290
 then when we are going to start this complementary feeding 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.210
 when the baby meets freshly emitted 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.770
 because we are going to start only after six months because the device 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.360
 Our baby's digestive system is fully mature to be able to incorporate 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.619
 other types of nutrients other than breastfeeding 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.530
 What happens if we start with supplementary feeding to the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830
 four months which 5 thousand 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.270
 the baby can usually suffer a criminal overload because we do not 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.990
 We are only recharging the digestive system but can also have 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.120
 changes dinner dinner to the validity of the digestive system then what is appropriate and 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.370
 when is really mature all the body of our baby 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.020
 that departure of the six months of life 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.240
 then after six months of life the digestive system is ready and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.579
 ready to receive 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.759
 complementary feeding let's start with this limitation 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.210
 complementary 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.380
 so let's give it in the first place 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.799
 finally it can be a patricia of dad uncover opposite of the unam 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.630
 fruit rice noodle 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.740
 although many times we do not know with what we can start 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.470
 but he can not 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.530
 they have a predilection for sweet taste that's why we're going to start 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.059
 always with porridge structure 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.890
 remember that your baby's gastric capacity 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.079
 It is very small 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.519
 we add that you have access to more than one whole apple 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.089
 a woman in tehran 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:26.809
 sting remember what you have to do 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:32.009
 in smaller quantity it can be that for apple egypt for pear hits a puree 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.279
 of band 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.660
 and just add sugar to that puree with cams added honey 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.800
 it is not necessary because, since it resists 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.390
 of member taste buds therefore 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.849
 It does not need that you all dare for a while 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.319
 and mine and not because it's a single alex food that we're going to talk about 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.339
 a little bit later 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.330
 then let's start with a 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.899
 daddy be enjoy 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:57.529
 during these 6 between eight months how many times a day 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.749
 at least 2 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:03.989
 if it was close to mid-morning and mid-afternoon it was replaced by some 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.389
 for some pub is a taken of hair done does not do it has replanted 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.159
 it is simply enough to add a patrician baby to your baby at mid morning 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.610
 patricia at mid afternoon 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.120
 remember that you have to make fruit that between 6 and 8 million 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.170
 then color foods appear 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.569
 that is, the yellow vegetables 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.809
 which are ideal for your baby 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.080
 maybe a step 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.569
 in the pumpkin 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.799
 the carrot 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.590
 that's why they're ideal foods so I had to start with batteries 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.639
 vegetable 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.909
 what we are going to add there has been done is the puree that you will find out 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:40.819
 no, no 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.749
 salt alliance because it is also not necessary to submit it in addition to be quantity 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.219
 of sodium chloride 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.119
 because it can cause renal overload and other 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:54.579
 then you mohamed is such if you can add it is a teaspoon of oil 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.859
 to continue compensating a little more the calories 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.479
 you cheer up will start 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.769
 replace him that is to say 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.099
 I already told him a patricia of fruits in the afternoon you can give him I was born papi be 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.650
 warm a highway of mashed pumpkin puree with carrot 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.919
 I put that continuous 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.700
 with the colored vegetables 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.829
 berardi it was happiness judges step by step we will not have a little more 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.539
 Carefully respect the schools finally like broccoli for example 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.680
 it may bring some gastric discomfort 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.430
 so let's give it for now, maybe a little step away, we're still between 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.259
 6 and 8 thousand 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.990
 from eight months 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.469
 we can only start with the serials 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:40.449
 with the rice in order to oppose oatmeal optics with the sopita 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:41.300
 cristina 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.900
 we can just start with this guy 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.300
 d food from the firmness is little to say 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.300
 can give you carlyle polar lane before not 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.770
 When you're six months old, you can start there by incorporating the 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.409
 meat 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.680
 preferably white and after incorporations 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.820
 the red meat from there in the six months can only go the 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.380
 foods that are unique allergy for example 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.879
 so conducive citrus fruits that not the egg white the fish and honey 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:15.539
 those are the foods that finally style incorporate before the six 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:16.180
