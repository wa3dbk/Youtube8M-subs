00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:21.199
 3 of 1 of Tamron Co., Ltd. in 2009 for headphone purpose of promotion society 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.380
 No 4 No 8 No 1 What 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.810
 But it is here- 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.810
 Will lose edition 8 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.009
 But soon futuristic 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.890
 I agree 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.390
 That chance is already 20 years as a manufacturer as a company 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.820
 If it stands today, it is the following, but let's release a big hit 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.290
 It is a specialized manufacturer that is making clean 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.100
 So now this liquid crystal meter is all zero 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.680
 Developed from 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.050
 It is such a product 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.930
 Name has put all the accumulated results so far into this 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.840
 I was told that 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.180
 Memory up to 9th 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.180
 Power is expected to fc headphones 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.600
 I received the mystery that the edition series was too late 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.830
 Overlook the cost of falling prices 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.260
 Has been 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.390
 It is not ultra 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.750
 So, even in Yue 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.110
 Though 810 does not have the third 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.200
 truly 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.300
 How are they? 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.090
 All the thoughts of wanting to make such headphones 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.200
 Being 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 That's what it is 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.540
 I think I love my daughter 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.670
 In life 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.800
 Old Town Forest 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 I can not hear it last year 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.040
 6. 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.080
 Rubber softens 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.080
 There is a sense of luxury 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.630
 Gross margin 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.630
 Great 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.440
 Good luck and there was also a voice 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.430
 There is an improvement effect during 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.839
 This time it is during this main festival 2000 yen but this time 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:59.570
 Aichi's top favorite Aichi 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.040
 It may be the difference between the eastern part of the prefecture and the head office, etc. 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.830
 It is quite difficult to use a position but I am fired 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.760
 As for apple, all 8 of this series are 324 degrees brazed impedance 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.279
 Put out things 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:14.359
 So I want to bring it to people using 8 ways 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.869
 There is also a story that the volume is quite standing up 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:17.359
 I will 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.739
 That's it 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.079
 This is a little design in this form of eight 3024 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.790
 The version employs 8 groups of colors a little 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.000
 Do not enjoy music with a portable player 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.999
 A little bit unusual for young people 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:36.559
 As a result, that 8 is a new type 8 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.209
 There are a total of four types of earphones that you can take and have this time 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.449
 It's raining and it's raining, but it's a new product before it's announced, but it's overwintering 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.829
 It is said that it is a professional product by all means until now at night 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.199
 Although the image was strong 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.790
 Let's have such consumer-oriented lectures for consumers 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:57.849
 I'm saying I'm going to put it a little more 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.049
 I think 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.040
 Thank you
