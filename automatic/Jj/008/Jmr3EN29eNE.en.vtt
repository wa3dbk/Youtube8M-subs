00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
hey guys last time we tore down and

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.480 
hey guys last time we tore down and
index<00:00:05.609> sand<00:00:06.600> filter<00:00:06.930> pool<00:00:07.140> pump<00:00:07.379> down<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
index sand filter pool pump down to the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.390 
index sand filter pool pump down to the
the<00:00:08.820> motor<00:00:09.440> after<00:00:10.440> I've<00:00:10.530> taken<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.920> closer<00:00:11.130> look

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
the motor after I've taken a closer look

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.120 
the motor after I've taken a closer look
at<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:12.240> pretty<00:00:12.450> clear<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.259> there's<00:00:14.040> a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
at it it's pretty clear that there's a

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.269 
at it it's pretty clear that there's a
bad<00:00:14.940> bearing<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.480> there<00:00:15.599> somewhere<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.379> I

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
bad bearing in there somewhere so I

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.980 
bad bearing in there somewhere so I
actually<00:00:17.760> went<00:00:18.300> ahead<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.570> pulled<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> motor

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
actually went ahead and pulled the motor

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.300 
actually went ahead and pulled the motor
off<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:20.359> take<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.449> apart<00:00:21.949> went<00:00:22.949> ahead<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.189> did

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
off and take it apart went ahead and did

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.890 
off and take it apart went ahead and did
that<00:00:23.340> got<00:00:23.820> all<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.090> screws<00:00:24.330> out<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.750> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
that got all the screws out of it and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.870 
that got all the screws out of it and
figured<00:00:25.650> out<00:00:25.769> how<00:00:25.859> came<00:00:26.099> apart<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.699> guys

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
figured out how came apart for you guys

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.730 
figured out how came apart for you guys
so<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.750> real<00:00:27.960> quick<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.590> video

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
so we can do it real quick here on video

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.740 
so we can do it real quick here on video
but<00:00:29.220> basically<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.150> where<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.390> got<00:00:30.539> to
