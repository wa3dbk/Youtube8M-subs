World<00:00:33.250> Championship<00:00:33.730> in<00:00:33.820> January<00:00:34.330> the<00:00:34.540> team's

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
World Championship in January the team's

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.890 
World Championship in January the team's
been<00:00:34.989> working<00:00:35.230> really<00:00:35.739> hard<00:00:35.890> I<00:00:36.400> think<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.360> the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
been working really hard I think the the

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.810 
been working really hard I think the the
two<00:00:38.050> big<00:00:38.230> things<00:00:38.379> are<00:00:38.829> of<00:00:39.430> course<00:00:39.610> the

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
two big things are of course the

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.729 
two big things are of course the
controls<00:00:40.210> we're<00:00:40.540> always<00:00:40.720> optimizing<00:00:41.589> those

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
controls we're always optimizing those

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.680 
controls we're always optimizing those
make<00:00:41.949> sure<00:00:42.100> they<00:00:42.309> feel<00:00:42.670> really<00:00:43.150> awesome<00:00:43.600> and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
make sure they feel really awesome and

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.329 
make sure they feel really awesome and
they'd<00:00:43.839> feel<00:00:44.290> really<00:00:44.559> good<00:00:44.710> in<00:00:44.920> this<00:00:45.070> build

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
they'd feel really good in this build

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.160 
they'd feel really good in this build
and<00:00:45.549> then<00:00:45.699> the<00:00:46.089> user<00:00:46.239> interface<00:00:46.479> has<00:00:46.930> come<00:00:47.140> a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
and then the user interface has come a

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.340 
and then the user interface has come a
long<00:00:47.260> way<00:00:47.680> so<00:00:48.119> specifically<00:00:49.119> the<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:50.140> gods

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
long way so specifically the the gods

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.070 
long way so specifically the the gods
selection<00:00:50.979> screen<00:00:51.159> and<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:52.000> item<00:00:52.330> store<00:00:52.570> have

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
selection screen and the item store have

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.859 
selection screen and the item store have
been<00:00:53.350> optimized<00:00:53.979> for<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.430> consult<00:00:54.869> and

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:55.869 
been optimized for the consult and

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:58.320 
been optimized for the consult and
there's<00:00:56.710> further<00:00:57.150> improvements<00:00:58.150> still

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
there's further improvements still

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.899 
there's further improvements still
coming<00:00:58.689> actually<00:00:59.110> so<00:00:59.379> the<00:01:00.309> item<00:01:00.519> store<00:01:00.670> feels

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
coming actually so the item store feels

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.039 
coming actually so the item store feels
pretty<00:01:01.119> good<00:01:01.210> so<00:01:01.510> we<00:01:01.600> think<00:01:01.780> it's<00:01:01.869> in<00:01:01.960> a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
pretty good so we think it's in a

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.590 
pretty good so we think it's in a
generally<00:01:02.439> good<00:01:02.799> good<00:01:03.309> place<00:01:03.580> but<00:01:03.850> God

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
generally good good place but God

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.539 
generally good good place but God
selection<00:01:05.110> is<00:01:05.199> better<00:01:05.439> in<00:01:05.590> this<00:01:05.740> build<00:01:06.010> which

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
selection is better in this build which

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.340 
selection is better in this build which
is<00:01:06.700> basically<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.210> pre<00:01:07.450> alpha<00:01:07.630> build<00:01:07.960> it'll

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
is basically the pre alpha build it'll

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.039 
is basically the pre alpha build it'll
be<00:01:08.470> even<00:01:08.710> better<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.340> beta<00:01:09.759> that's<00:01:10.630> coming<00:01:10.840> up

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
be even better in beta that's coming up

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.470 
be even better in beta that's coming up
so<00:01:11.350> team<00:01:11.830> continues<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.310> work<00:01:12.460> on<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.000> but

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
so team continues to work on it and but

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.420 
so team continues to work on it and but
it<00:01:13.540> looks<00:01:13.690> really<00:01:13.870> nice<00:01:14.050> on<00:01:14.230> this<00:01:14.350> TV<00:01:14.560> here<00:01:14.860> so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
it looks really nice on this TV here so

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.950 
it looks really nice on this TV here so
is<00:01:15.520> there<00:01:15.670> any<00:01:15.790> primary<00:01:16.150> changes<00:01:16.690> you<00:01:16.810> guys

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
is there any primary changes you guys

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.380 
is there any primary changes you guys
have<00:01:17.230> decided<00:01:17.710> where<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.460> pc<00:01:18.910> versions

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
have decided where the pc versions

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.970 
have decided where the pc versions
divergent<00:01:20.080> from<00:01:20.230> the<00:01:20.410> xbox<00:01:20.770> version

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
divergent from the xbox version

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.520 
divergent from the xbox version
certainly<00:01:21.940> not<00:01:22.090> in<00:01:22.150> terms<00:01:22.540> of<00:01:22.900> functionality

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
certainly not in terms of functionality

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.700 
certainly not in terms of functionality
I<00:01:23.830> mean<00:01:24.040> it's<00:01:24.220> going<00:01:24.370> to<00:01:24.460> be<00:01:24.730> a<00:01:25.270> Content<00:01:26.170> parity

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
I mean it's going to be a Content parity

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.100 
I mean it's going to be a Content parity
and<00:01:26.950> feature<00:01:27.190> function<00:01:27.790> parody<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.990> we're

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
and feature function parody and we're

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.810 
and feature function parody and we're
almost<00:01:29.320> there<00:01:29.620> with<00:01:29.950> this<00:01:30.130> build<00:01:30.370> about<00:01:30.640> the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
almost there with this build about the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.030 
almost there with this build about the
only<00:01:31.150> major<00:01:31.330> function<00:01:31.900> that's<00:01:32.380> not<00:01:32.620> in<00:01:32.830> here

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
only major function that's not in here

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.910 
only major function that's not in here
yet<00:01:33.310> well<00:01:34.150> I'd<00:01:34.210> say<00:01:34.390> there's<00:01:34.600> 21<00:01:35.050> is<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.320> bgs

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
yet well I'd say there's 21 is the bgs

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.160 
yet well I'd say there's 21 is the bgs
system<00:01:36.310> which<00:01:36.490> will<00:01:36.730> be<00:01:36.909> in<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.390> xbox<00:01:37.750> one<00:01:37.990> but

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
system which will be in the xbox one but

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.410 
system which will be in the xbox one but
it's<00:01:38.320> not<00:01:38.500> yet<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.010> then<00:01:39.460> also<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:40.300> ability

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
it's not yet and then also the ability

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.890 
it's not yet and then also the ability
to<00:01:40.990> actually<00:01:41.200> customize<00:01:42.570> every<00:01:43.570> ability

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
to actually customize every ability

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.080 
to actually customize every ability
targeting<00:01:44.650> mode<00:01:44.830> viability<00:01:45.430> which<00:01:45.760> is<00:01:45.880> in<00:01:46.030> the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
targeting mode viability which is in the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.090 
targeting mode viability which is in the
PC<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:46.690> that<00:01:46.870> will<00:01:47.080> also<00:01:47.320> be<00:01:47.620> coming<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.010> the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
PC and that will also be coming to the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.430 
PC and that will also be coming to the
Xbox<00:01:48.220> but<00:01:48.940> it's<00:01:49.060> not<00:01:49.240> in<00:01:49.420> this<00:01:49.540> alphaville<00:01:50.140> but

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440
