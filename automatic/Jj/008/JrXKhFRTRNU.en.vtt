00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hi Guys, I'll give you a brief 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.779
 demonstration of an application that can 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.219
 be used to improve your audi 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.070
 sb known as essb for those who do not know 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.160
 is to receive is to improve the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.660
 audio quality in sb and transmit 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.310
 bandwidths exceeding 2.4 here 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.310
 which is what is present in most 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.529
 two conventional radios there then 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.399
 when you hear there in the 40 meter that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.910
 loud audio for sure the operator 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.950
 must have good rock good microphones and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.170
 etc and then there's plenty of money 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.620
 invested at times but this is a 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.660
 basic way of doing it works cool I 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.280
 I'm starting to understand a little bit now 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.260
 accent and I intend to go deep 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.690
 then for those who do not have those 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.820
 famous and expensive equipment of the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.199
 bÃ©ranger or from other manufacturers 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.500
 this software can be an alternative 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.719
 feasible I am not wanting to compare the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.710
 physical equipment will always have more 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.420
 benefits 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.450
 but a solution is a viable form of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.100
 improve your audio ringtone 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.710
 so here we have the first option one 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.979
 10-band parametric equalizer in 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.360
 our ranking in the second option we have 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.220
 four band equalizer 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.770
 to work as a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.000
 crossover eliminating the frequencies 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.619
 unwanted 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.020
 the third option, perhaps the most 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.110
 important of all in my view that it is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.030
 this recent year and through him 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.310
 able to remove all noise is captured 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.369
 microphone, letting only the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.650
 Then I'll turn it off for you. 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.780
 to see how much the environment is 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.700
 filtered by this preset hear noise 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.729
 are noises of curves of 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.100
 computers and the room does not have 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.780
 acoustics properly treated by this 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.659
 I received this noise bombardment in the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:03.689
 microphone when you enable it again 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.219
 you will see the remarkable difference ready 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.640
 like in a magic trick almost all the 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.649
 noise was eliminated 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.180
 our next step is 71 reverb for 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.770
 dig a small effect on the voice 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.160
 let's go 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.160
 enable 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.190
 listen to the audio without reverb or the pope 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.790
 uniform 2 victor lime whiskey testing 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:30.320
 audio without reverb now listen to the audio with 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.930
 Reverb I'm going to yell again the pope

 uniform 2 victor smolski testing the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.350
 audio with reverb the next preset 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.860
 again the teacher equalizer 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.670
 four-band parametric band that prepares 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.500
 our signal for compressor input 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.790
 here is open and let's go to the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.790
 next president who is a compressor 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.090
 our next preset is a simulator of 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.560
 solid state compressor 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.290
 soon after the compressor we have a limit 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.170
 which substantially decreases the signal at 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:11.900
 order to avoid a clip is this l2 here I go 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.050
 off mt and see how the signal is 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.500
 high in this step the two 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.140
 evil vectors that testing 100m have 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.610
 testing without having me now the usual 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.720
 again and the signal is 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.020
 normalized 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.620
 Uniform Chat 2 Testing with Limit 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:34.840
 enabled in uniform 2 victor smolski 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.840
 testing with limiter enabled 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.459
 our last preset is what it is 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.840
 responsible for the increase of serious 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:48.170
 note that turning it off appears serious from 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.070
 substantial form the uniform 2 victor d

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.760
 activated again the perception of the 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.270
 presence of serious annotated form

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.170
 enabled for colleagues who have 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.780
 equipment with bandwidth 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.070
 more than 2.4 transmission rates 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.870
 do tests 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.360
 the audio will be infinitely better than 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.090
 a simple tt1 mike table like ping 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.160
 among others 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.080
 I would like to make an addendum on this 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.720
 software he works only with boards 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.580
 sound with support and azio drivers am 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.830
 using a 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.210
 julia is properly configured with the 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.280
 empty drivers 73 of uniform pope 2 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.199
 victor lima whiskey and as soon as I have 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.460
 More toy news here I 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.389
 I can for you 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.389
 thank you
