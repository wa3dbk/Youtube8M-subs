00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
against a monster inspirations which

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.880 
against a monster inspirations which
they<00:00:21.090> can<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.170> depends<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.680> which

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
they can be but it just depends on which

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
against because there's two different

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.830 
against because there's two different
types<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.490> monster<00:00:26.849> inspirations<00:00:27.570> there's

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the active noise-cancelling and then the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.229 
the active noise-cancelling and then the
the<00:00:30.689> one<00:00:30.840> without<00:00:31.399> the<00:00:32.399> one<00:00:32.550> without<00:00:32.669> would<00:00:33.120> be

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the one without the one without would be

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.940 
the one without the one without would be
the<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.079> fanny<00:00:34.290> Wang's<00:00:34.590> would<00:00:34.770> go

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
because monster doesn't have an O near

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.970 
because monster doesn't have an O near
one<00:00:40.620> besides<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.899> diesel<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.440> diamond

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.520 
but those those are you know more style
than<00:00:46.649> then<00:00:47.489> sound<00:00:47.969> quality<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:49.410> own

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
than then sound quality in my own

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.490 
than then sound quality in my own
opinion<00:00:49.879> um<00:00:50.879> couple<00:00:51.480> highlights<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:52.320> I

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
opinion um couple highlights here I

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.950 
opinion um couple highlights here I
think<00:00:53.039> both<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.280> these<00:00:53.489> have<00:00:53.789> extremely<00:00:54.719> good

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
think both of these have extremely good

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.229 
think both of these have extremely good
build<00:00:55.289> quality<00:00:55.410> unlike<00:00:56.219> if<00:00:56.699> you've<00:00:56.910> ever<00:00:57.059> had

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
build quality unlike if you've ever had

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.040 
build quality unlike if you've ever had
the<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.840> initial<00:00:58.289> solo<00:00:58.530> HDS<00:00:59.359> or<00:01:00.359> these<00:01:00.539> solos

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the the initial solo HDS or these solos

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.680 
the the initial solo HDS or these solos
even<00:01:01.410> does<00:01:01.649> those<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.219> really<00:01:02.879> really

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
even does those have really really

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.810 
even does those have really really
horrible<00:01:03.989> build<00:01:04.199> quality<00:01:04.619> they<00:01:04.799> snapped<00:01:05.519> very

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
horrible build quality they snapped very

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.429 
horrible build quality they snapped very
easily<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.330> think<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.960> was<00:01:07.080> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.320> go<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
easily I think if I was going to go to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.289 
easily I think if I was going to go to
build<00:01:07.830> quality<00:01:08.100> only<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.670> would<00:01:09.000> say<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
build quality only I would say the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.560 
build quality only I would say the
monsters<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:10.080> better<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.729> because<00:01:12.090> they

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
monsters are better just because they

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.090 
monsters are better just because they
have<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> lot<00:01:12.960> more<00:01:12.990> metal<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.010> if

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
have a lot more metal on them like if

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.020 
have a lot more metal on them like if
you<00:01:14.159> could<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:14.610> got<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.850> like

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
better sound quality crisper sound than

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.420 
better sound quality crisper sound than
monster<00:01:58.020> inspiration<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:58.799> that's<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
monster inspiration but that's not to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.280 
monster inspiration but that's not to
say<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> monster<00:01:59.850> inspiration<00:02:00.570> doesn't<00:02:01.170> have

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
say the monster inspiration doesn't have

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.810 
say the monster inspiration doesn't have
amazing<00:02:01.710> sound<00:02:01.890> quality<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.640> actually

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
amazing sound quality and I actually

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.310 
amazing sound quality and I actually
think<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.240> has<00:02:03.329> better<00:02:03.540> sound<00:02:03.780> quality<00:02:04.229> than

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
think it has better sound quality than

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.050 
think it has better sound quality than
my<00:02:04.790> studio<00:02:05.790> beats<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:07.489> as<00:02:08.489> far<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:08.759> build

the<00:03:16.320> monster<00:03:16.680> inspirations<00:03:17.340> are<00:03:17.940> pretty<00:03:18.239> cool

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
the monster inspirations are pretty cool

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.830 
the monster inspirations are pretty cool
because<00:03:19.700> they<00:03:20.700> these<00:03:21.180> are<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.450> ones<00:03:21.630> that

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
because they these are the ones that

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.600 
because they these are the ones that
have<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.170> noise<00:03:22.320> canceling<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:23.070> great<00:03:23.459> thing

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
have this noise canceling a great thing

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.520 
have this noise canceling a great thing
about<00:03:23.700> these<00:03:23.910> over<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.239> studios<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.900> if<00:03:25.140> the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
about these over the studios is if the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.960 
about these over the studios is if the
batteries<00:03:25.890> die<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.130> can<00:03:26.400> still<00:03:26.580> listen<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.880> it

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
batteries die you can still listen to it

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.490 
batteries die you can still listen to it
because<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.269> turn<00:03:27.510> off<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.810> noise<00:03:27.930> canceling

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
because you turn off the noise canceling

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.280 
because you turn off the noise canceling
you<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.299> you<00:03:30.299> can<00:03:30.450> actually<00:03:30.540> just<00:03:31.019> turn<00:03:31.170> off

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
you can you can actually just turn off

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.750 
you can you can actually just turn off
the<00:03:31.380> noise<00:03:31.500> canceling<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.070> save<00:03:32.250> power<00:03:32.489> if<00:03:32.730> you

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
the noise canceling to save power if you

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.300 
the noise canceling to save power if you
want<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:34.170> batteries<00:03:34.650> don't<00:03:34.920> go<00:03:35.100> on<00:03:35.220> the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
want the batteries don't go on the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.870 
want the batteries don't go on the
outside<00:03:35.670> like<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.150> like<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.870> beats<00:03:37.170> they

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
outside like the like the beats they

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.610 
outside like the like the beats they
actually<00:03:38.880> pop<00:03:39.120> off<00:03:39.299> right<00:03:39.540> here<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.019> it's<00:03:40.560> a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
actually pop off right here and it's a

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.530 
actually pop off right here and it's a
little<00:03:40.739> clip<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.220> magnets<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.060> it's<00:03:42.180> pretty

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
little clip and magnets so it's pretty

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.570 
little clip and magnets so it's pretty
easy<00:03:44.239> as<00:03:45.239> far<00:03:45.630> as<00:03:45.660> bass<00:03:46.560> goes<00:03:46.950> which<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> lot

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
easy as far as bass goes which is a lot

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.300 
easy as far as bass goes which is a lot
of<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:48.000> lot<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.540> people's<00:03:48.810> favorite<00:03:49.049> thing<00:03:49.440> they

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
of a lot of people's favorite thing they

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.910 
of a lot of people's favorite thing they
both<00:03:50.549> have<00:03:50.850> extremely<00:03:51.450> good<00:03:51.660> bass<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.680> one

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
both have extremely good bass the one

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.979 
both have extremely good bass the one
thing<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.220> would<00:03:53.280> say<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.209> lot<00:03:54.390> deeper<00:03:54.780> a

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
thing I would say is it's a lot deeper a

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.229 
thing I would say is it's a lot deeper a
lot<00:03:55.320> crisper<00:03:55.680> bass<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.340> can<00:03:56.760> hear<00:03:57.030> all

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
lot crisper bass and you can hear all

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.940 
lot crisper bass and you can hear all
the<00:03:57.420> notes<00:03:57.570> better<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.230> both<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.709> them<00:03:58.799> than<00:03:58.920> I

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
the notes better on both of them than I

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.039 
the notes better on both of them than I
can<00:03:59.220> on<00:03:59.250> my<00:03:59.489> studio<00:04:00.060> beats<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.600> think<00:04:00.959> the

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
can on my studio beats I think the

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.720 
can on my studio beats I think the
studio<00:04:01.350> Beach<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.980> bass<00:04:02.280> just<00:04:02.549> kind<00:04:02.700> of

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
studio Beach the bass just kind of

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.460 
studio Beach the bass just kind of
muffles<00:04:03.060> everything<00:04:03.360> out<00:04:03.510> but<00:04:03.720> if<00:04:04.019> I'm<00:04:04.230> honest

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
muffles everything out but if I'm honest

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.289 
muffles everything out but if I'm honest
I<00:04:04.560> think<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.830> bass<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.489> louder<00:04:05.730> on<00:04:05.970> both<00:04:06.150> of

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
I think the bass is louder on both of

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.850 
I think the bass is louder on both of
these<00:04:06.420> if<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:08.239> had<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.329> choose<00:04:09.540> on<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.930> go<00:04:10.079> it

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
these if I I had to choose on the go it

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.410 
these if I I had to choose on the go it
would<00:04:10.980> always<00:04:11.130> be<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.489> monster<00:04:11.820> inspirations

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
would always be the monster inspirations

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.780 
would always be the monster inspirations
but<00:04:12.959> Fanny<00:04:13.230> wings<00:04:13.530> are<00:04:14.370> by<00:04:14.760> far<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.380> best

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790
