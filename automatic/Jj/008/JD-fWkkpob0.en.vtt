map lakay covers a lot of ground but

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.870 
map lakay covers a lot of ground but
it's<00:00:24.960> also<00:00:25.230> extremely<00:00:25.680> close<00:00:26.279> quarters<00:00:26.699> which

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
it's also extremely close quarters which

it's also extremely close quarters which
kind<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.210> sounds<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:27.630> an<00:00:27.779> oxymoron<00:00:28.070> but<00:00:29.070> i'd

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
kind of sounds like an oxymoron but i'd

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.310 
kind of sounds like an oxymoron but i'd
say<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.789> mainly<00:00:30.060> being<00:00:30.359> fought<00:00:30.660> inside<00:00:31.080> like

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
say it's mainly being fought inside like

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.540 
say it's mainly being fought inside like
on<00:00:31.560> each<00:00:31.710> side<00:00:31.949> there's<00:00:32.160> kind<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.399> an

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
on each side there's kind of like an

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.340 
on each side there's kind of like an
open<00:00:32.850> pit<00:00:33.059> area<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.870> then<00:00:34.020> there's<00:00:34.200> this

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
open pit area but then there's this

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.799 
open pit area but then there's this
giant<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:35.280> building<00:00:36.000> right<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.510> middle

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
giant like building right in the middle

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.420 
giant like building right in the middle
of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.020> map<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.500> kind<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.710> separates<00:00:38.219> each

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
of the map that kind of separates each

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.160 
of the map that kind of separates each
side<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> fighting<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.140> done

side and a lot of the fighting is done
within<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.800> building<00:00:40.980> there's<00:00:41.280> all<00:00:41.399> kinds

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
within that building there's all kinds

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.130 
within that building there's all kinds
of<00:00:41.820> different<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.450> know<00:00:42.540> alleyways<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
of different like you know alleyways and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.930 
of different like you know alleyways and
windows<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.309> jump<00:00:44.489> through<00:00:44.670> all<00:00:44.910> kinds

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
windows you can jump through all kinds

windows you can jump through all kinds
of<00:00:45.329> crazy<00:00:45.539> stuff<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.050> although<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.890> pretty

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
of crazy stuff so although it's a pretty

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.400 
of crazy stuff so although it's a pretty
big<00:00:47.309> map<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:48.239> also<00:00:48.420> super<00:00:48.750> close<00:00:49.079> quarters

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
big map it's also super close quarters

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.650 
big map it's also super close quarters
like<00:00:49.590> SMG<00:00:50.160> shotguns<00:00:50.760> stuff<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.210> are<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
like SMG shotguns stuff like that are a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.439 
like SMG shotguns stuff like that are a
lot<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> fun<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.620> use<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:52.980> now<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.180> very

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
lot of fun to use here now it is very

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.240 
lot of fun to use here now it is very
symmetrical<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.649> said<00:00:55.890> there's<00:00:56.070> kind<00:00:56.219> of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
symmetrical like I said there's kind of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.619 
symmetrical like I said there's kind of
like<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.489> middle<00:00:56.850> building<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.390> kind<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
like that middle building that kind of

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.760 
like that middle building that kind of
separates<00:00:58.079> everything<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> lot<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
separates everything a lot of the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.139 
separates everything a lot of the
fighting<00:00:58.980> goes<00:00:59.219> down<00:00:59.399> there<00:00:59.609> but<00:00:59.789> then<00:00:59.910> each

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
fighting goes down there but then each

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.250 
fighting goes down there but then each
side<00:01:00.420> there's<00:01:00.600> kind<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.050> giant

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
side there's kind of like this giant

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.139 
side there's kind of like this giant
open<00:01:01.680> pit<00:01:01.890> area<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:02.760> you've<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.030> like

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
open pit area and then you've got like

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.609 
open pit area and then you've got like
spawn<00:01:03.480> buildings<00:01:03.870> back<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> back<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
spawn buildings back in the back of the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.660 
spawn buildings back in the back of the
map<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.920> stuff<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.460> it's

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
map and stuff like that so it's

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.890 
map and stuff like that so it's
extremely<00:01:05.880> symmetrical<00:01:06.600> kind<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.810> like

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
extremely symmetrical kind of like

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.929 
extremely symmetrical kind of like
high-rise<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.590> from<00:01:08.159> modern<00:01:08.430> warfare<00:01:08.580> 2<00:01:08.880> if

you guys remember that so it's really

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.380 
you guys remember that so it's really
good<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.490> those<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.790> round<00:01:12.090> based

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
good for those like round based

really<00:01:30.119> expect<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:30.720> my<00:01:31.320> favorite<00:01:31.770> thing

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
really expect now my favorite thing

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.399 
really expect now my favorite thing
about<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.369> map<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:33.630> not<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:33.990> favorite<00:01:34.140> map

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
about this map it's not my favorite map

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.719 
about this map it's not my favorite map
out<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> four<00:01:34.920> I'd<00:01:35.159> probably<00:01:35.369> say<00:01:35.610> it's

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
out of the four I'd probably say it's

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.609 
out of the four I'd probably say it's
like<00:01:35.850> my<00:01:35.970> third<00:01:36.299> or<00:01:36.450> fourth<00:01:36.689> favorite<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.229> it's

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
like my third or fourth favorite so it's

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.109 
like my third or fourth favorite so it's
definitely<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.250> favorite<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.790> my

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
definitely not my favorite but my

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.940 
definitely not my favorite but my
favorite<00:01:39.390> thing<00:01:39.420> about<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.990> map<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
favorite thing about this map is the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.560 
favorite thing about this map is the
grapple<00:01:41.430> mode<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> grandpa<00:01:42.329> mode<00:01:42.479> is

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
grapple mode I think the grandpa mode is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.270 
grapple mode I think the grandpa mode is
probably<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> most<00:01:43.200> fun<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.799> map<00:01:44.009> out<00:01:44.220> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
probably the most fun on this map out of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.069 
probably the most fun on this map out of
all<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> them<00:01:44.790> because<00:01:45.270> there<00:01:45.600> are<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.720> many

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
all of them because there are so many

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.170 
all of them because there are so many
different<00:01:46.229> surfaces<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.340> areas<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.030> stuff

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
different surfaces and areas and stuff

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.240 
different surfaces and areas and stuff
that<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.659> attach<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.710> maps<00:01:50.070> are<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
that you can attach to so I maps are a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.350 
that you can attach to so I maps are a
little<00:01:50.399> bit<00:01:50.549> more<00:01:50.700> spread<00:01:50.970> out<00:01:51.000> they<00:01:51.210> don't

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
little bit more spread out they don't

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.670 
little bit more spread out they don't
have<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.630> quite<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:51.930> many<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.290> buildings

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
have as quite as many you know buildings

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.810 
have as quite as many you know buildings
and<00:01:52.829> stuff<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.579> map<00:01:53.790> is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and stuff like that but this map is

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.789 
and stuff like that but this map is
literally<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.540> these<00:01:54.810> huge<00:01:55.290> high-rise

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
literally all these huge high-rise

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.709 
literally all these huge high-rise
buildings<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.700> there's<00:01:56.880> an<00:01:57.030> unlimited<00:01:57.509> number

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
buildings so there's an unlimited number

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.600 
buildings so there's an unlimited number
of<00:01:58.079> surfaces<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.250> know<00:01:59.310> attach

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
of surfaces that you can you know attach

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.880
