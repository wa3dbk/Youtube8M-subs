00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.119 

let's<00:00:00.420> take<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.659> look<00:00:00.840> at<00:00:00.989> an<00:00:01.110> example<00:00:01.260> problem

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
let's take a look at an example problem

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.039 
let's take a look at an example problem
involving<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.120> motion<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:04.040> two<00:00:05.040> particles<00:00:06.049> in

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
involving the motion of two particles in

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.919 
involving the motion of two particles in
rectilinear<00:00:07.589> motion<00:00:07.970> so<00:00:08.970> here's<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> problem

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
rectilinear motion so here's the problem

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.379 
rectilinear motion so here's the problem
we've<00:00:10.679> got<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> ball<00:00:11.130> it's<00:00:11.460> thrown<00:00:11.759> upward<00:00:12.240> from

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
we've got a ball it's thrown upward from

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.240 
we've got a ball it's thrown upward from
the<00:00:12.480> 12<00:00:12.840> meter<00:00:13.049> level<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.650> an<00:00:13.799> elevator<00:00:14.160> shaft

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
the 12 meter level in an elevator shaft

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.849 
the 12 meter level in an elevator shaft
with<00:00:14.849> an<00:00:14.969> initial<00:00:15.360> velocity<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.809> 18<00:00:16.410> meters

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
with an initial velocity of 18 meters

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.429 
with an initial velocity of 18 meters
per<00:00:17.100> second<00:00:17.520> at<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.270> same<00:00:18.510> time<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.199> elevator

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
per second at the same time the elevator

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.160 
per second at the same time the elevator
passes<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.310> 5<00:00:20.580> meter<00:00:20.880> level<00:00:21.150> moving<00:00:21.660> upward

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
passes the 5 meter level moving upward

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.259 
passes the 5 meter level moving upward
with<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> constant<00:00:22.980> velocity<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.580> 2<00:00:23.760> meters<00:00:24.060> per

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
with a constant velocity of 2 meters per

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.210 
with a constant velocity of 2 meters per
second<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.199> what<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.920> ball

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
second so what do we have we have a ball

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.419 
second so what do we have we have a ball
that's<00:00:26.930> undergoing<00:00:27.930> uniform<00:00:28.890> acceleration

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
that's undergoing uniform acceleration

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.389 
that's undergoing uniform acceleration
that's<00:00:30.179> motion<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.470> gravitational<00:00:32.160> field

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
that's motion in a gravitational field

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.510 
that's motion in a gravitational field
it<00:00:32.759> starts<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.980> from<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> 12<00:00:35.340> meter

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it starts going up from the 12 meter

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
it starts going up from the 12 meter
level<00:00:35.790> at<00:00:36.210> an<00:00:36.390> initial<00:00:36.480> velocity<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:37.140> 18

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
level at an initial velocity of 18

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.770 
level at an initial velocity of 18
meters<00:00:37.860> per<00:00:38.040> second<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.329> we'll<00:00:39.510> write<00:00:39.690> an

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
meters per second and so we'll write an

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.170 
meters per second and so we'll write an
equation<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.559> motion<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.160> ball<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.090> at

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
equation of motion for that ball and at

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.819 
equation of motion for that ball and at
the<00:00:42.300> same<00:00:42.480> time<00:00:42.780> we've<00:00:42.989> got<00:00:43.140> another<00:00:43.410> thing

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
the same time we've got another thing

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.450 
the same time we've got another thing
we've<00:00:44.370> got<00:00:44.550> an<00:00:44.640> elevator<00:00:45.140> which<00:00:46.140> passes<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> 5

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
we've got an elevator which passes the 5

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.889 
we've got an elevator which passes the 5
meter<00:00:47.760> level<00:00:47.969> moving<00:00:48.360> upward<00:00:48.719> with<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
meter level moving upward with a

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.049 
meter level moving upward with a
constant<00:00:49.469> velocity<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:50.010> 2<00:00:50.219> meters<00:00:50.489> per<00:00:50.520> second

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
constant velocity of 2 meters per second

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.069 
constant velocity of 2 meters per second
so<00:00:51.180> we're<00:00:51.300> gonna<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> write<00:00:51.870> an<00:00:51.989> equation

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so we're gonna have to write an equation

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.799 
so we're gonna have to write an equation
of<00:00:52.530> motion<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.640> ball<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> an<00:00:54.449> equation

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
of motion for the ball and an equation

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.260 
of motion for the ball and an equation
of<00:00:55.110> motion<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> elevator<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.180> we

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
of motion for the elevator what can we

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.700 
of motion for the elevator what can we
do<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.480> those<00:00:57.629> equations<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.230> motion<00:00:58.559> well

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
do with those equations of motion well

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.939 
do with those equations of motion well
Part<00:00:59.520> A<00:00:59.760> says<00:01:00.090> determine<00:01:00.570> when<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.320> where<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
Part A says determine when and where the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.820 
Part A says determine when and where the
ball<00:01:02.190> will<00:01:02.430> hit<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.850> elevator<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.680> do

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
ball will hit the elevator so can we do

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.560 
ball will hit the elevator so can we do
that<00:01:04.860> well<00:01:05.280> sure<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.760> first<00:01:06.150> will<00:01:06.330> determine

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that well sure we first will determine

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.450 
that well sure we first will determine
when<00:01:06.930> we're<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.830> say<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> ball

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
when we're going to say that the ball

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.890 
when we're going to say that the ball
and<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> elevator<00:01:09.150> are<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> same

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
and the elevator are at the same

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.690 
and the elevator are at the same
position<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.710> we've<00:01:10.830> got<00:01:11.010> an<00:01:11.100> equation<00:01:11.189> of

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
position so we've got an equation of

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.490 
position so we've got an equation of
motion<00:01:12.180> for<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:13.049> elevator

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
motion for the elevator

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.350 
motion for the elevator
an<00:01:13.710> equation<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.340> motion<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.880> ball<00:01:15.090> we'll

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
an equation of motion for the ball we'll

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
an equation of motion for the ball we'll
set<00:01:15.600> them<00:01:15.720> equal<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.259> solve<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.799> time

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
set them equal and solve for the time

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.980 
set them equal and solve for the time
that'll<00:01:17.430> tell<00:01:17.610> us<00:01:17.640> when<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.450> ball<00:01:18.630> hits<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
that'll tell us when the ball hits the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140 
that'll tell us when the ball hits the
elevator<00:01:19.470> well<00:01:20.189> where<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.610> well<00:01:21.000> then

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
elevator well where is that well then

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.550 
elevator well where is that well then
we'll<00:01:21.270> take<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.540> time<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.110> plug<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> into

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
we'll take that time and plug it into

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.890 
we'll take that time and plug it into
either<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.490> first<00:01:23.670> equation<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> second

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
either the first equation or the second

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.300 
either the first equation or the second
because<00:01:25.110> at<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.380> time<00:01:25.439> they'll<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.070> same

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
because at that time they'll be the same

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.640 
because at that time they'll be the same
and<00:01:26.549> we'll<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.090> position<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> we'll

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and we'll get a a position and we'll

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.280 
and we'll get a a position and we'll
know<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.689> position<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.810> where<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
know that that position is where the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.679 
know that that position is where the
ball<00:01:31.439> hits<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> elevator<00:01:32.369> now<00:01:33.090> Part<00:01:33.360> B<00:01:33.420> is

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
ball hits the elevator now Part B is

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
ball hits the elevator now Part B is
determine<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.170> relative<00:01:34.560> velocity<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
determine the relative velocity of the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.249 
determine the relative velocity of the
ball<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.909> respect<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> elevator<00:01:37.049> when

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
ball with respect to the elevator when

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.670 
ball with respect to the elevator when
they<00:01:37.439> hit<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.729> write<00:01:38.909> an<00:01:39.030> equation<00:01:39.810> for

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
they hit so we can write an equation for

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.289 
they hit so we can write an equation for
the<00:01:40.740> relative<00:01:40.890> velocity<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> ball<00:01:42.090> with

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the relative velocity of the ball with

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.300 
the relative velocity of the ball with
respect<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> elevator<00:01:43.350> remember<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:43.950> we

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
respect to the elevator remember we we

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.960 
respect to the elevator remember we we
previously<00:01:44.729> wrote<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.509> down<00:01:46.520> will<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.790> then

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
previously wrote that down will and then

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.270 
previously wrote that down will and then
we<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.210> need<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.540> plug<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.259> time<00:01:49.619> when

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
we just need to plug in the time when

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.830 
we just need to plug in the time when
the<00:01:50.430> ball<00:01:50.579> hits<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> elevator<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.659> we'll

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the ball hits the elevator and we'll

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.499 
the ball hits the elevator and we'll
find<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> velocity<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:54.090> ball<00:01:54.329> with

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
find the velocity of that ball with

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.730 
find the velocity of that ball with
respect<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> elevator

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.190 
respect to the elevator
so<00:01:56.130> let's<00:01:56.310> first<00:01:56.610> let<00:01:57.180> me<00:01:57.210> sketch<00:01:57.570> out<00:01:57.780> some

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
so let's first let me sketch out some

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.870 
so let's first let me sketch out some
the<00:01:59.869> problem<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.020> we'll<00:02:01.110> take<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.259> look<00:02:01.560> at<00:02:01.680> it

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
the problem and we'll take a look at it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.389 
the problem and we'll take a look at it
ok<00:02:02.880> here's<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.380> elevator<00:02:04.380> shaft<00:02:04.860> I've<00:02:05.159> got<00:02:05.310> an

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
ok here's the elevator shaft I've got an

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.139 
ok here's the elevator shaft I've got an
elevator

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
elevator

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.770 
elevator
we<00:02:07.509> have<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:08.019> elevator<00:02:08.349> platform<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.780> here's

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
we have the elevator platform and here's

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.540 
we have the elevator platform and here's
the<00:02:10.959> motion<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.379> the<00:02:11.470> ball<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.040> remember<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
the motion of the ball so remember the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.150 
the motion of the ball so remember the
as<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.390> ball<00:02:13.629> was<00:02:13.870> thrown<00:02:13.900> upward<00:02:14.680> from<00:02:15.010> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
as the ball was thrown upward from the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.339 
as the ball was thrown upward from the
12<00:02:15.459> meter<00:02:15.640> level<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.239> here<00:02:16.390> I've<00:02:16.510> written<00:02:16.540> this

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
12 meter level so here I've written this

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.869 
12 meter level so here I've written this
is<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.620> 12<00:02:17.890> meter<00:02:18.040> level<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.640> has<00:02:18.760> an

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
is the 12 meter level so it has an

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.600 
is the 12 meter level so it has an
initial<00:02:19.269> velocity<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.780> 18<00:02:20.650> meters<00:02:20.950> per<00:02:21.160> second

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
initial velocity of 18 meters per second

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.850 
initial velocity of 18 meters per second
and<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.810> under<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.260> gravitational

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
and this is under the gravitational

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.430 
and this is under the gravitational
field<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:25.750> we'll<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:25.989> write<00:02:26.230> that

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
field and so we'll have to write that

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.710 
field and so we'll have to write that
equation<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:27.370> motion<00:02:27.849> for<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.090> ball<00:02:28.269> so

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
equation of motion for the ball so

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.970 
equation of motion for the ball so
that's<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.290> wrote<00:02:29.410> here<00:02:29.560> first<00:02:29.830> we'll

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
that's what I wrote here first we'll

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.110 
that's what I wrote here first we'll
write<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.129> equation<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.640> motion<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
write the equation of motion for the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.150 
write the equation of motion for the
ball<00:02:31.330> then<00:02:32.019> we'll<00:02:32.170> write<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.349> equation<00:02:33.069> of

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
ball then we'll write the equation of

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.370 
ball then we'll write the equation of
motion<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.849> elevator<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.349> elevator

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
motion for the elevator and the elevator

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.100 
motion for the elevator and the elevator
here<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.069> starts<00:02:39.459> off<00:02:39.640> at<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.120> 5<00:02:40.420> meter<00:02:40.750> at<00:02:40.930> T

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
here it starts off at the 5 meter at T

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.009 
here it starts off at the 5 meter at T
equals<00:02:41.410> zero<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:41.769> at<00:02:41.920> five<00:02:42.190> meters<00:02:42.400> high<00:02:43.209> and

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
equals zero it's at five meters high and

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.430 
equals zero it's at five meters high and
it<00:02:44.500> moves<00:02:44.680> 2<00:02:44.860> meters<00:02:45.099> per<00:02:45.250> second<00:02:45.579> up<00:02:46.440> easy

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
it moves 2 meters per second up easy

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.990 
it moves 2 meters per second up easy
enough<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:47.920> write<00:02:48.069> that<00:02:48.250> equation<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.760> motion

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
enough to write that equation of motion

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.360 
enough to write that equation of motion
so<00:02:49.180> once<00:02:49.360> we<00:02:49.510> do<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:49.769> we'll<00:02:50.769> set<00:02:51.099> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
so once we do that we'll set the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.610 
so once we do that we'll set the
equation<00:02:52.329> of<00:02:52.569> motion<00:02:52.870> for<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.079> ball<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.560> I've

the<00:05:55.120> velocity<00:05:55.630> of<00:05:55.660> the<00:05:56.020> elevator<00:05:56.320> is<00:05:56.530> 2<00:05:59.790> let's

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
the velocity of the elevator is 2 let's

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.310 
the velocity of the elevator is 2 let's
look<00:06:01.030> at<00:06:01.120> that<00:06:01.270> again<00:06:01.479> the<00:06:01.600> velocity<00:06:01.720> of<00:06:02.050> ball

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
look at that again the velocity of ball

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.719 
look at that again the velocity of ball
with<00:06:02.470> respect<00:06:02.860> to<00:06:02.949> the<00:06:03.039> elevator<00:06:03.340> is<00:06:03.430> equal<00:06:03.639> to

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
with respect to the elevator is equal to

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:04.980 
with respect to the elevator is equal to
the<00:06:03.820> velocity<00:06:03.910> of<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:04.330> ball<00:06:04.479> minus<00:06:04.900> the

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
the velocity of the ball minus the

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.960 
the velocity of the ball minus the
velocity<00:06:05.139> of<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:05.590> elevator<00:06:05.919> the<00:06:06.460> velocity<00:06:06.880> of

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
velocity of the elevator the velocity of

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.340 
velocity of the elevator the velocity of
the<00:06:07.060> ball<00:06:07.180> remember<00:06:07.539> that<00:06:07.690> had<00:06:07.810> an<00:06:07.930> initial

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
the ball remember that had an initial

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.560 
the ball remember that had an initial
velocity<00:06:08.800> of<00:06:08.830> 18<00:06:09.250> meters<00:06:09.520> per<00:06:09.669> second<00:06:10.030> in<00:06:10.180> the

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
velocity of 18 meters per second in the

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.510 
velocity of 18 meters per second in the
up<00:06:10.750> direction<00:06:10.780> so<00:06:11.500> the<00:06:11.650> positive<00:06:11.860> is<00:06:12.280> the<00:06:12.400> up

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
up direction so the positive is the up

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.719 
up direction so the positive is the up
Direction<00:06:13.090> minus<00:06:13.690> 9.8<00:06:14.460> that's<00:06:15.460> the

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
Direction minus 9.8 that's the

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.820 
Direction minus 9.8 that's the
acceleration<00:06:16.539> due<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:16.780> gravity<00:06:16.900> times<00:06:17.320> time

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
acceleration due to gravity times time

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.560 
acceleration due to gravity times time
so<00:06:18.100> it<00:06:18.220> starts<00:06:18.520> off<00:06:18.639> with<00:06:18.789> 18<00:06:19.180> meters<00:06:19.449> per

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
so it starts off with 18 meters per

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.570 
so it starts off with 18 meters per
second<00:06:19.990> and<00:06:20.169> it<00:06:20.530> undergoes<00:06:20.770> of<00:06:21.070> this<00:06:21.220> the

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
second and it undergoes of this the

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.100 
second and it undergoes of this the
velocity<00:06:21.729> undergoes<00:06:22.360> this<00:06:22.509> constant<00:06:23.080> change

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
velocity undergoes this constant change

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.529 
velocity undergoes this constant change
due<00:06:23.590> to<00:06:23.620> gravity<00:06:24.160> the<00:06:25.030> velocity<00:06:25.419> of<00:06:25.449> the

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
due to gravity the velocity of the

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.390 
due to gravity the velocity of the
elevator<00:06:25.900> was<00:06:26.050> just<00:06:26.199> a<00:06:26.289> constant<00:06:26.860> 2<00:06:27.100> meters

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
elevator was just a constant 2 meters

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.240 
elevator was just a constant 2 meters
per<00:06:27.490> second<00:06:27.910> in<00:06:28.000> the<00:06:28.440> up<00:06:29.440> direction<00:06:29.500> so<00:06:30.160> that's

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
per second in the up direction so that's

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.510 
per second in the up direction so that's
a<00:06:30.400> positive<00:06:30.910> so<00:06:31.600> we<00:06:32.139> take<00:06:32.320> this<00:06:32.470> in<00:06:32.650> 18<00:06:32.919> minus

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
a positive so we take this in 18 minus

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.000 
a positive so we take this in 18 minus
9.8<00:06:33.729> T<00:06:35.220> subtract<00:06:36.220> 2<00:06:36.610> we<00:06:36.940> get<00:06:37.060> 16<00:06:37.660> minus<00:06:38.080> 9.8<00:06:38.320> T

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
9.8 T subtract 2 we get 16 minus 9.8 T

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.580 
9.8 T subtract 2 we get 16 minus 9.8 T
put<00:06:39.850> in<00:06:39.940> the<00:06:40.150> time<00:06:40.449> which<00:06:40.990> we<00:06:41.139> got<00:06:41.289> up<00:06:41.410> here

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
put in the time which we got up here

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.000 
put in the time which we got up here
three<00:06:41.830> point<00:06:42.070> six<00:06:42.310> five<00:06:42.490> seconds<00:06:43.180> and<00:06:43.889> we<00:06:44.889> get

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
three point six five seconds and we get

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.150 
three point six five seconds and we get
this<00:06:45.190> solution<00:06:45.550> that<00:06:46.449> the<00:06:46.660> velocity<00:06:47.380> of<00:06:47.680> the

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
this solution that the velocity of the

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.920 
this solution that the velocity of the
ball<00:06:48.340> when<00:06:48.580> it<00:06:48.729> hits<00:06:48.880> the<00:06:49.060> elevator<00:06:49.360> is<00:06:49.539> minus

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
ball when it hits the elevator is minus

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.659 
ball when it hits the elevator is minus
nineteen<00:06:50.349> point<00:06:50.650> eight<00:06:50.770> meters<00:06:50.919> per<00:06:51.250> second

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
nineteen point eight meters per second

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:53.850 
nineteen point eight meters per second
the<00:06:51.789> minus<00:06:52.150> sign<00:06:52.900> indicates<00:06:53.349> the<00:06:53.530> ball<00:06:53.710> is

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
the minus sign indicates the ball is

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.909 
the minus sign indicates the ball is
traveling<00:06:54.250> in<00:06:54.340> a<00:06:54.460> downwards<00:06:55.120> direction<00:06:55.919> so

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 
traveling in a downwards direction so

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.330 
traveling in a downwards direction so
let's<00:06:57.630> review<00:06:58.630> this<00:06:59.020> so<00:06:59.530> just<00:06:59.770> it's<00:06:59.979> a<00:07:00.070> brief

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
let's review this so just it's a brief

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.730 
let's review this so just it's a brief
overview<00:07:00.699> that<00:07:01.000> here<00:07:01.479> is<00:07:01.599> the<00:07:01.750> problem<00:07:02.020> we've

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
overview that here is the problem we've

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.460 
overview that here is the problem we've
got<00:07:02.889> the<00:07:03.010> ball<00:07:03.630> thrown<00:07:04.630> up<00:07:04.870> in<00:07:05.080> the<00:07:05.139> elevator

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
got the ball thrown up in the elevator

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.560 
got the ball thrown up in the elevator
shaft<00:07:05.530> when<00:07:06.070> the<00:07:06.160> elevator<00:07:06.520> is<00:07:06.580> moving<00:07:06.699> up<00:07:07.389> at

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
shaft when the elevator is moving up at

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.839 
shaft when the elevator is moving up at
a<00:07:07.599> constant<00:07:08.020> rate<00:07:08.229> the<00:07:09.099> ball<00:07:09.310> of<00:07:09.430> course<00:07:09.669> will

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:09.849 
a constant rate the ball of course will

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.800 
a constant rate the ball of course will
rise<00:07:10.240> some<00:07:10.630> to<00:07:11.139> some<00:07:11.320> level<00:07:12.510> because<00:07:13.510> of<00:07:13.750> the

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:13.810 
rise some to some level because of the

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.450 
rise some to some level because of the
influence<00:07:14.050> of<00:07:14.260> gravity<00:07:14.620> will<00:07:14.710> slow<00:07:14.949> down<00:07:15.130> stop

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
influence of gravity will slow down stop

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.040 
influence of gravity will slow down stop
and<00:07:15.760> start<00:07:15.940> coming<00:07:16.240> down<00:07:16.389> at<00:07:16.570> some<00:07:16.780> point

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
and start coming down at some point

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.779 
and start coming down at some point
it'll<00:07:17.260> hit<00:07:17.409> the<00:07:17.620> elevator<00:07:18.039> which<00:07:18.220> is<00:07:18.370> going<00:07:18.639> up

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:18.789 
it'll hit the elevator which is going up

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.670 
it'll hit the elevator which is going up
the<00:07:19.330> question<00:07:19.720> was<00:07:19.840> to<00:07:19.960> determine<00:07:20.320> when<00:07:20.500> and

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 
the question was to determine when and

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.409 
the question was to determine when and
where<00:07:20.800> those<00:07:20.949> ball<00:07:21.190> that<00:07:21.490> ball<00:07:21.729> will<00:07:21.940> hit<00:07:22.150> and

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:22.419 
where those ball that ball will hit and

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:24.240 
where those ball that ball will hit and
then<00:07:22.840> determine<00:07:23.289> the<00:07:23.349> relative<00:07:23.620> velocity<00:07:24.220> of

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
then determine the relative velocity of

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.100 
then determine the relative velocity of
the<00:07:24.400> ball<00:07:24.550> with<00:07:25.150> respect<00:07:25.300> to<00:07:25.659> the<00:07:25.750> elevator

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
the ball with respect to the elevator

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.629 
the ball with respect to the elevator
when<00:07:26.320> they<00:07:26.470> hit<00:07:26.650> and<00:07:26.830> so<00:07:26.919> if<00:07:27.039> the<00:07:27.130> strategy

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 
when they hit and so if the strategy

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.159 
when they hit and so if the strategy
here<00:07:27.940> was<00:07:28.120> to<00:07:28.300> write<00:07:28.479> the<00:07:28.599> equation<00:07:28.960> of<00:07:29.080> motion

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:29.169 
here was to write the equation of motion

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:31.200 
here was to write the equation of motion
for<00:07:29.470> the<00:07:29.590> ball<00:07:29.770> write<00:07:30.580> the<00:07:30.729> equation<00:07:31.120> of

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
for the ball write the equation of

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.210 
for the ball write the equation of
motion<00:07:31.570> for<00:07:31.599> the<00:07:31.870> elevator<00:07:32.229> set<00:07:32.919> the<00:07:33.039> two

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.220 
motion for the elevator set the two

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.029 
motion for the elevator set the two
equal<00:07:33.669> and<00:07:33.909> solve<00:07:34.479> for<00:07:34.570> the<00:07:34.750> time<00:07:35.050> this<00:07:35.860> is<00:07:36.010> a

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 
equal and solve for the time this is a

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.029 
equal and solve for the time this is a
quadratic<00:07:36.520> equation<00:07:36.880> has<00:07:37.360> two<00:07:37.659> roots<00:07:37.900> we<00:07:38.889> took

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 
quadratic equation has two roots we took

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:40.560 
quadratic equation has two roots we took
the<00:07:39.220> positive<00:07:39.729> roots<00:07:39.909> so<00:07:40.090> there's<00:07:40.270> another

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:40.570 
the positive roots so there's another

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.779 
the positive roots so there's another
there's<00:07:40.990> a<00:07:41.020> negative<00:07:41.229> root<00:07:41.590> that<00:07:41.770> is<00:07:42.190> before<00:07:42.610> T

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:42.789 
there's a negative root that is before T

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:44.850 
there's a negative root that is before T
equals<00:07:43.150> zero<00:07:43.419> that's<00:07:44.050> irrelevant<00:07:44.320> in<00:07:44.710> this

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:44.860 
equals zero that's irrelevant in this

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.610 
equals zero that's irrelevant in this
case<00:07:45.130> and<00:07:45.460> so<00:07:45.970> that<00:07:46.270> at<00:07:46.389> that<00:07:46.419> time<00:07:46.599> T<00:07:47.320> equals

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:47.620 
case and so that at that time T equals

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.370 
case and so that at that time T equals
three<00:07:47.830> point<00:07:48.070> six<00:07:48.280> five<00:07:48.550> seconds<00:07:49.240> we<00:07:49.750> plug

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:50.380 
three point six five seconds we plug

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.649 
three point six five seconds we plug
that<00:07:50.560> back<00:07:50.620> in<00:07:50.979> and<00:07:51.130> found<00:07:51.370> that<00:07:51.580> the<00:07:51.880> position

00:07:52.649 --> 00:07:52.659 
that back in and found that the position

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:54.750 
that back in and found that the position
was<00:07:52.810> twelve<00:07:53.110> point<00:07:53.380> three<00:07:53.590> meters<00:07:53.979> and<00:07:54.280> then

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:54.760 
was twelve point three meters and then

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.909 
was twelve point three meters and then
we<00:07:54.880> went<00:07:55.030> down<00:07:55.150> and<00:07:55.680> calculated<00:07:56.680> the<00:07:56.800> velocity

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 
we went down and calculated the velocity

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:00.380 
we went down and calculated the velocity
of<00:07:57.340> the<00:07:57.490> ball<00:07:57.669> relative<00:07:58.210> to<00:07:58.360> the<00:07:58.449> elevator

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:00.390 
of the ball relative to the elevator

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.160 
of the ball relative to the elevator
plugged<00:08:01.390> in<00:08:01.570> the<00:08:01.690> velocity<00:08:02.170> of<00:08:02.200> the<00:08:02.380> ball<00:08:02.560> here

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.170 
plugged in the velocity of the ball here

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.390 
plugged in the velocity of the ball here
subtracted<00:08:05.170> the<00:08:05.230> velocity<00:08:05.620> of<00:08:05.650> elevator<00:08:05.980> here

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 
subtracted the velocity of elevator here

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.580 
subtracted the velocity of elevator here
and<00:08:06.640> got<00:08:07.210> this<00:08:07.360> minus<00:08:07.780> nineteen<00:08:08.170> point<00:08:08.470> eight

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:08.590 
and got this minus nineteen point eight

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.640 
and got this minus nineteen point eight
meters<00:08:08.830> per<00:08:09.100> second
