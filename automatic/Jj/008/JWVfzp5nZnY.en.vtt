glasses<00:03:26.989> in<00:03:27.260> front<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.620> camera

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
glasses in front of the camera

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.130 
glasses in front of the camera
it<00:03:28.430> says<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.760> least<00:03:29.000> amount<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.330> crosstalk<00:03:29.870> or

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
it says the least amount of crosstalk or

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.530 
it says the least amount of crosstalk or
ghosting<00:03:30.890> of<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.100> second<00:03:31.459> image<00:03:31.670> that<00:03:32.420> we've

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
ghosting of the second image that we've

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.300 
ghosting of the second image that we've
seen<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.930> 3d<00:03:33.200> TV<00:03:33.350> of<00:03:33.620> course<00:03:34.010> when<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:34.190> get

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
seen in a 3d TV of course when you get

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.289 
seen in a 3d TV of course when you get
punched<00:03:34.549> in<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.790> face<00:03:34.910> because<00:03:35.150> you're

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
punched in the face because you're

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.610 
punched in the face because you're
wearing<00:03:35.450> them<00:03:35.750> then<00:03:35.989> you<00:03:36.080> might<00:03:36.260> see<00:03:36.440> some

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
wearing them then you might see some

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.520 
wearing them then you might see some
ghosting<00:03:36.980> of<00:03:37.220> life<00:03:37.840> but<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:38.959> panasonic<00:03:39.500> has

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
ghosting of life but the panasonic has

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.979 
ghosting of life but the panasonic has
this<00:03:39.799> technology<00:03:40.010> nailed<00:03:40.580> down<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.690> a<00:03:41.720> tee

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
this technology nailed down to to a tee

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.330 
this technology nailed down to to a tee
and<00:03:42.140> one<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.410> reasons<00:03:42.680> is<00:03:42.769> they<00:03:43.130> have<00:03:43.250> the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
and one of the reasons is they have the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.090 
and one of the reasons is they have the
600<00:03:43.790> Hertz<00:03:43.910> refresh<00:03:44.330> rate<00:03:44.570> which<00:03:44.989> smooths<00:03:45.799> out

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
600 Hertz refresh rate which smooths out

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.800 
600 Hertz refresh rate which smooths out
the<00:03:46.160> motion<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.730> help<00:03:46.910> refresh<00:03:47.150> two<00:03:47.450> images

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
the motion to help refresh two images

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.940 
the motion to help refresh two images
simultaneously<00:03:47.959> okay

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
simultaneously okay

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.920 
simultaneously okay
the<00:03:49.250> smooth<00:03:49.489> motion<00:03:49.670> is<00:03:50.060> not<00:03:50.330> as<00:03:50.540> pronounced

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
the smooth motion is not as pronounced

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.900 
the smooth motion is not as pronounced
as<00:03:51.019> Samsung's<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:52.190> fans<00:03:52.400> of<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.580> anti<00:03:52.760> blur

technology<00:03:53.420> may<00:03:53.510> not<00:03:53.660> get<00:03:53.780> exactly<00:03:53.870> what<00:03:54.290> they

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
technology may not get exactly what they

technology may not get exactly what they
want<00:03:54.440> alright<00:03:54.799> well<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.160> also<00:03:55.370> up<00:03:55.640> converts

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
want alright well this also up converts

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.610 
want alright well this also up converts
2d<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.510> 3d<00:03:56.540> which<00:03:56.959> is<00:03:57.080> one<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.320> those<00:03:57.410> sort<00:03:57.590> of

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
2d to 3d which is one of those sort of

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.039 
2d to 3d which is one of those sort of
magical<00:03:58.340> things<00:03:58.549> that<00:03:58.790> sounds<00:03:59.360> cool<00:03:59.540> on<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.750> box

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
magical things that sounds cool on a box

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.170 
magical things that sounds cool on a box
yeah<00:04:00.350> never<00:04:00.799> is<00:04:01.070> cool<00:04:01.340> probably<00:04:01.820> you<00:04:01.940> probably

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
yeah never is cool probably you probably

yeah never is cool probably you probably
won't<00:04:02.299> really<00:04:02.480> use<00:04:02.570> that<00:04:02.930> yeah<00:04:03.140> yeah<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:03.590> mean

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
won't really use that yeah yeah I mean

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.860 
won't really use that yeah yeah I mean
the<00:04:03.920> 2d<00:04:04.160> is<00:04:04.250> shot<00:04:04.489> in<00:04:04.610> 2d<00:04:04.880> it's<00:04:05.269> it's<00:04:05.480> not<00:04:05.660> it's

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
the 2d is shot in 2d it's it's not it's

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.600 
the 2d is shot in 2d it's it's not it's
not<00:04:05.989> designed<00:04:06.350> to<00:04:06.530> be<00:04:07.330> 3d<00:04:08.330> Chris<00:04:09.190> it's<00:04:10.190> like<00:04:10.310> an

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
not designed to be 3d Chris it's like an

migraine<00:04:18.350> yeah<00:04:18.650> I<00:04:18.680> mean<00:04:18.919> this<00:04:19.850> is<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.090> best

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
migraine yeah I mean this is the best

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.090 
migraine yeah I mean this is the best
that<00:04:20.419> we've<00:04:20.540> seen<00:04:20.840> this<00:04:21.019> version<00:04:21.320> of<00:04:21.590> it<00:04:21.709> but

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
that we've seen this version of it but

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.860 
that we've seen this version of it but
but<00:04:22.790> but<00:04:22.940> again<00:04:23.060> I<00:04:23.210> just<00:04:23.300> don't<00:04:23.570> think<00:04:23.690> people

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
but but again I just don't think people

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.000 
but but again I just don't think people
gonna<00:04:23.960> use<00:04:24.140> it<00:04:24.229> that<00:04:24.320> often<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.620> beds<00:04:24.740> very

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
gonna use it that often it beds very

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.040 
gonna use it that often it beds very
little<00:04:25.250> depth<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.550> 2d<00:04:25.850> stuff<00:04:26.120> which<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.900> guess

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
little depth to 2d stuff which I guess

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.870 
little depth to 2d stuff which I guess
it's<00:04:27.200> better<00:04:27.320> than<00:04:27.440> making<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:28.070> difficult<00:04:28.370> to

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
it's better than making it difficult to

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.700 
it's better than making it difficult to
watch<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.600> would<00:04:29.780> happen<00:04:30.110> some<00:04:30.320> other<00:04:30.380> time

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
watch it would happen some other time

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.590 
watch it would happen some other time
put<00:04:30.979> a<00:04:31.010> hurdle<00:04:31.370> in<00:04:31.430> my<00:04:31.490> living<00:04:31.760> range<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.419> we

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
put a hurdle in my living range I we

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.310 
put a hurdle in my living range I we
make<00:04:32.870> it<00:04:33.020> worse<00:04:33.310> it's<00:04:34.330> 1,400<00:04:35.330> bucks<00:04:35.479> on<00:04:35.870> Amazon

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
make it worse it's 1,400 bucks on Amazon

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.839 
make it worse it's 1,400 bucks on Amazon
which<00:04:36.650> is<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.800> little<00:04:37.010> pricey<00:04:37.130> for<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.550> set<00:04:37.760> the

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
which is a little pricey for a set the
