okay so this is how you install the

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.889 
okay so this is how you install the
battery<00:00:02.300> it<00:00:03.300> will<00:00:03.419> be<00:00:03.510> in<00:00:03.600> here<00:00:03.750> on<00:00:03.840> the

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
battery it will be in here on the

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.769 
battery it will be in here on the
trickle<00:00:04.200> charger<00:00:04.589> you're<00:00:05.339> going<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.730> just<00:00:06.359> you

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
trickle charger you're going to just you

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.299 
trickle charger you're going to just you
might<00:00:06.930> have<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.170> loop<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:07.859> came<00:00:08.099> from

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
might have to loop this this came from

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.450 
might have to loop this this came from
inside<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.820> ATV<00:00:09.740> just<00:00:10.740> loosen<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.160> or<00:00:11.370> you

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
inside the ATV just loosen it or you

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.310 
inside the ATV just loosen it or you
could<00:00:11.610> use<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> screw<00:00:12.120> driver<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.599> unplug<00:00:13.139> it

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
could use a screw driver and unplug it

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.129 
could use a screw driver and unplug it
first<00:00:13.530> oh<00:00:13.889> yeah<00:00:14.309> that's<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.580> good<00:00:14.700> idea

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
first oh yeah that's a good idea

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.680 
first oh yeah that's a good idea
and<00:00:16.139> put<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.470> there<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.949> then<00:00:17.760> this

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
and put it there and then this

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.330 
and put it there and then this
connection<00:00:19.230> right<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.380> I'm<00:00:19.680> close<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:25.340> you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
connection right here I'm close and you

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.689 
connection right here I'm close and you
just<00:00:26.369> take<00:00:26.670> these<00:00:26.789> leads<00:00:27.090> off<00:00:28.429> one<00:00:29.429> little

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
just take these leads off one little

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.440 
just take these leads off one little
turn<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.300> then<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.630> hand<00:00:30.900> unscrew<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
turn and then you can hand unscrew it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.690 
turn and then you can hand unscrew it
these<00:00:33.450> screws<00:00:33.809> actually<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.380> into<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.860> ATV<00:00:35.370> so

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
these screws actually go into the ATV so

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:47.060 
these screws actually go into the ATV so
hang<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.329> them<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:45.649> just<00:00:46.649> leave<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.010> in

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
hang on to them and just leave that in

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.040 
hang on to them and just leave that in
here<00:00:47.460> okay<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:47.940> here<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.239> are<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> only<00:00:48.719> thing

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
here okay so here we are the only thing

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.100 
here okay so here we are the only thing
before<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> put<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.989> there<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
before you put this in is there are a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.490 
before you put this in is there are a
couple<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.500> these<00:00:52.680> battery<00:00:53.840> things<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.320> make

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
couple of these battery things just make

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.889 
couple of these battery things just make
sure<00:00:55.850> sometimes<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.030> might<00:00:57.270> stick<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
sure sometimes this might stick to the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.369 
sure sometimes this might stick to the
bottom<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:59.180> and<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> might<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.809> important

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
bottom and and so it might be important

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.290 
bottom and and so it might be important
which<00:01:01.559> battery<00:01:02.010> goes<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.340> which<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.670> TV<00:01:03.030> because

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
which battery goes in which a TV because

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
which battery goes in which a TV because
they<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.170> height<00:01:04.580> each

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
they have to be the right height each

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
they have to be the right height each
atv<00:01:06.150> should<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.960> these<00:01:07.080> height

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
atv should have one of these height

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.899 
atv should have one of these height
adapters<00:01:08.090> down<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> bottom<00:01:09.830> okay<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.640> take

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
adapters down in the bottom okay so take

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.179 
adapters down in the bottom okay so take
a<00:01:11.939> look<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> make<00:01:13.020> sure<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.320> sits<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
a look and make sure it sits in the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.420 
a look and make sure it sits in the
bottom<00:01:14.700> properly<00:01:18.020> if<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.710> should<00:01:20.189> stay

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
bottom properly if that that should stay

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.830 
bottom properly if that that should stay
in<00:01:20.610> there<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:20.880> sometimes<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.390> sticks<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
in there but sometimes it sticks to the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.320 
in there but sometimes it sticks to the
bottom<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> battery<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.240> have

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
bottom of the battery so you just have

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.820 
bottom of the battery so you just have
to<00:01:24.420> kind<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.780> aware<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> then<00:01:25.619> put

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
to kind of be aware of that and then put

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.179 
to kind of be aware of that and then put
this<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:27.320> make<00:01:28.320> sure<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> terminals<00:01:28.799> are

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
this in make sure the terminals are

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.260 
this in make sure the terminals are
facing<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.030> seated

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
facing that way and is that it's seated

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.190 
facing that way and is that it's seated
down<00:01:33.630> inside<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> height<00:01:34.829> adjuster<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.960> this

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
down inside that height adjuster so this

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.960 
down inside that height adjuster so this
black<00:01:37.470> wire<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
black wire is going to go on the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.190 
black wire is going to go on the
negative<00:01:39.360> there's<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> little<00:01:39.750> similar<00:01:40.079> right

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
negative there's a little similar right

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.859 
negative there's a little similar right
there<00:01:40.350> for<00:01:40.560> negative<00:01:41.270> symbol<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.390> positive

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
there for negative symbol for positive

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.109 
there for negative symbol for positive
so<00:01:42.990> we're<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> start<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> black

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
so we're going to start with the black

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.109 
so we're going to start with the black
he's<00:01:45.119> one<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.299> these<00:01:45.450> screws

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:57.920 

let's<00:01:49.780> start<00:01:49.960> by<00:01:50.079> hand<00:01:50.320> tightening

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.140 

and<00:01:58.930> we'll<00:01:59.170> just<00:01:59.940> you'll<00:02:00.940> have<00:02:01.060> to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
and we'll just you'll have to

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.550 
and we'll just you'll have to
over-tighten<00:02:01.420> but<00:02:01.900> just<00:02:02.080> tighten<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.409> with

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
over-tighten but just tighten it with

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.399 
over-tighten but just tighten it with
this<00:02:02.710> thing<00:02:03.630> now<00:02:04.630> on<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.810> red<00:02:05.020> there<00:02:05.290> is<00:02:05.380> a

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
this thing now on the red there is a

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.890 
this thing now on the red there is a
little<00:02:05.650> trickier<00:02:06.190> it's<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.299> comes<00:02:07.509> all<00:02:07.780> the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
little trickier it's it comes all the

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.870 
little trickier it's it comes all the
way<00:02:07.990> over<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.500> other<00:02:08.530> side<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.459> has<00:02:09.640> to

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
way over to the other side and it has to

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.360 
way over to the other side and it has to
so<00:02:10.300> don't<00:02:10.509> try<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.750> put<00:02:10.990> it<00:02:11.080> on<00:02:11.200> sideways<00:02:12.100> eh

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
so don't try to put it on sideways eh

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.220 
so don't try to put it on sideways eh
it's<00:02:12.760> pretty<00:02:13.120> obvious<00:02:13.540> but<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:13.989> want<00:02:14.170> to

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
it's pretty obvious but just want to

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:24.960 
it's pretty obvious but just want to
make<00:02:14.350> sure<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:16.590> read<00:02:17.590> on<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.680> tight<00:02:24.520> or<00:02:24.700> just

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
make sure you read on and tight or just

make sure it's not crushed to it this
particular<00:02:59.500> ATV<00:03:00.569> this<00:03:01.569> hole<00:03:01.810> right<00:03:01.840> here<00:03:02.080> is

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
particular ATV this hole right here is

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.600 
particular ATV this hole right here is
cross<00:03:02.650> threaded<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:03.129> I'm<00:03:03.220> going<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.430> worry

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
cross threaded so I'm going to worry

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.399 
cross threaded so I'm going to worry
about<00:03:03.670> that<00:03:04.030> this<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.540> ATV<00:03:08.140> with<00:03:08.319> the
