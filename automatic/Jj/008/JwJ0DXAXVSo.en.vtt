the grant program is to expand the

commercial strawberries are produced so

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.210 
commercial strawberries are produced so
we're<00:01:54.260> hoping<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.620> have<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.830> number<00:01:55.100> of

in<00:01:57.680> that<00:01:58.159> can<00:01:58.490> demonstrate<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.600> Arkansas

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
in that can demonstrate that in Arkansas

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.260 
in that can demonstrate that in Arkansas

will continue to flower and fruit until
mid<00:02:10.310> May<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.510> we've<00:02:11.690> now<00:02:11.870> taken<00:02:11.930> our

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
mid May so we've now taken our

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.470 
mid May so we've now taken our
traditional<00:02:12.890> season<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.730> was<00:02:13.909> about<00:02:14.120> three

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
traditional season that was about three

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.449 
traditional season that was about three
or<00:02:14.510> four<00:02:14.840> weeks<00:02:15.080> long<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:15.650> we've<00:02:16.099> converted

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
or four weeks long and we've converted

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.720 
or four weeks long and we've converted
to<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:16.849> five<00:02:17.390> month<00:02:17.810> long<00:02:18.200> season<00:02:18.920> we're<00:02:19.610> also

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
to a five month long season we're also

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.309 
to a five month long season we're also
hoping<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.239> this<00:02:20.480> program<00:02:20.959> will<00:02:21.140> be

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
hoping that this program will be

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.830 
hoping that this program will be
successful<00:02:22.129> that<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:22.849> can<00:02:23.060> make<00:02:23.239> an<00:02:23.420> impact

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
successful that we can make an impact

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.259 
successful that we can make an impact
and<00:02:24.200> make<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.980> change<00:02:25.459> in<00:02:25.670> our<00:02:25.790> strawberry

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
and make a change in our strawberry

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.300 
and make a change in our strawberry
system<00:02:26.599> in<00:02:26.689> the<00:02:26.779> country<00:02:27.170> because<00:02:27.680> we<00:02:27.980> believe

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
system in the country because we believe

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.020 
system in the country because we believe
that

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
that

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.020 
that
Walmart<00:02:29.959> or<00:02:30.230> other<00:02:30.590> agencies<00:02:31.249> will<00:02:31.549> come<00:02:31.790> back

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
Walmart or other agencies will come back

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.449 
Walmart or other agencies will come back
to<00:02:32.269> us<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.569> say<00:02:32.749> we<00:02:32.989> need<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.319> continue<00:02:33.950> this

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
to us and say we need to continue this

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.660 
to us and say we need to continue this
for<00:02:34.700> another<00:02:34.999> year<00:02:35.120> or<00:02:35.749> another<00:02:35.900> two<00:02:36.530> years<00:02:36.889> we

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
for another year or another two years we

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.479 
for another year or another two years we
believe<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.480> there<00:02:38.719> is<00:02:38.749> sufficient<00:02:39.530> science

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
believe that there is sufficient science

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.239 
believe that there is sufficient science
and<00:02:40.730> research<00:02:41.590> technology<00:02:42.590> at<00:02:43.040> our

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:43.249 
and research technology at our

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:44.860 
and research technology at our
University<00:02:43.969> and<00:02:44.060> at<00:02:44.180> universities<00:02:44.719> around

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
University and at universities around

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.869 
University and at universities around
the<00:02:45.170> United<00:02:45.230> States<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:46.549> we<00:02:46.700> can

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
the United States that we can

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.599 
the United States that we can
reintroduce<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.629> crop<00:02:47.870> by<00:02:48.609> introducing

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
reintroduce the crop by introducing

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.599 
reintroduce the crop by introducing
these<00:02:50.090> technologies<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.829> grant<00:02:52.069> program

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
these technologies so the grant program

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.539 
these technologies so the grant program
is<00:02:52.819> aimed<00:02:53.209> at<00:02:53.389> taking<00:02:54.129> laboratory<00:02:55.129> and

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
is aimed at taking laboratory and

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.659 
is aimed at taking laboratory and
research<00:02:56.139> Experiment<00:02:57.139> Station<00:02:57.680> work<00:02:58.310> and

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
research Experiment Station work and

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.970 
research Experiment Station work and
moving<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.659> out<00:02:59.810> into<00:03:00.139> the<00:03:00.230> production<00:03:00.680> field

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
moving it out into the production field

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.750 
moving it out into the production field
so<00:03:01.849> this<00:03:02.209> grant<00:03:02.569> program<00:03:02.840> is<00:03:03.230> really<00:03:03.469> about

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
so this grant program is really about

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.959 
so this grant program is really about
technology<00:03:04.760> transfer<00:03:05.799> demonstration<00:03:06.799> and

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:06.969 
technology transfer demonstration and

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.750 
technology transfer demonstration and
