00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
this inspiration kinda strapless I kind

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.700 
this inspiration kinda strapless I kind
of<00:00:20.430> like<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.570> math<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:21.990> distortion<00:00:22.590> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
of like like this math like distortion I

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.519 
of like like this math like distortion I
kind<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.160> like<00:00:23.310> those<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:23.850> i<00:00:24.119> made<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:25.380> I

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
kind of like those so i made one like I

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.290 
kind of like those so i made one like I
made<00:00:25.680> them<00:00:25.830> up<00:00:25.949> kind<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.730> big<00:00:27.000> zipper

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
made them up kind of like it big zipper

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.370 
made them up kind of like it big zipper
way<00:00:28.230> smaller<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.890> more<00:00:29.400> false<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:30.109> like<00:00:31.109> I

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
way smaller and more false like like I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.380 
way smaller and more false like like I
think<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.099> would<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.669> pretty<00:00:32.850> good<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.239> like

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
think it would be pretty good for like

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.340 
think it would be pretty good for like
one<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.380> or<00:00:34.620> two<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.040> two<00:00:35.250> maybe<00:00:36.200> three<00:00:37.200> on

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
one on one or two one two maybe three on

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.290 
one on one or two one two maybe three on
videos<00:00:37.770> kind<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.070> pushing<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.460> though<00:00:38.489> but

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
videos kind of pushing it though but

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.709 
videos kind of pushing it though but
like<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.770> basically<00:00:41.309> just<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.730> small<00:00:42.030> box<00:00:42.270> or

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
like it's basically just a small box or

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.290 
like it's basically just a small box or
make<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.110> small<00:00:43.379> box<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.010> we've<00:00:44.640> turned<00:00:45.030> up

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
make a small box and we've turned up

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.110 
make a small box and we've turned up
what<00:00:45.660> if<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.530> angle<00:00:47.660> okay<00:00:48.950> they're

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
what if I this to be angle okay they're

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.670 
what if I this to be angle okay they're
like<00:00:51.120> I'm<00:00:51.300> taking<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.140> race<00:00:52.350> my<00:00:52.559> life

must 11 think there's um like sockin
delay<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.610> clip<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.270> everything<00:00:57.829> sorta

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
delay of one clip and everything sorta

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.470 
delay of one clip and everything sorta
there's<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.280> as<00:00:59.370> much<00:00:59.550> rocket<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.690> well<00:01:00.920> and

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
there's one as much rocket as well and

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.310 
there's one as much rocket as well and
like<00:01:03.480> also<00:01:03.949> study<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> map

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
like also study the map

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.399 
like also study the map
is<00:01:06.500> like<00:01:06.920> pretty<00:01:07.460> much<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:08.229> unacceptable<00:01:09.229> as

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
is like pretty much it unacceptable as

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.590 
is like pretty much it unacceptable as
well<00:01:09.680> although<00:01:10.340> i<00:01:10.490> don't<00:01:10.820> see<00:01:11.030> why<00:01:11.150> people<00:01:11.510> and

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
also was like one's a new breaking

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.430 
also was like one's a new breaking
points<00:01:22.220> for<00:01:22.369> like<00:01:22.490> my<00:01:22.729> map<00:01:22.970> making<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:23.570> because

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
points for like my map making so because

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.590 
points for like my map making so because
I<00:01:24.770> kind<00:01:25.550> of<00:01:25.640> messed<00:01:25.790> up<00:01:25.970> on<00:01:26.090> some<00:01:26.270> parts<00:01:26.509> but

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
I kind of messed up on some parts but

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.050 
I kind of messed up on some parts but
like<00:01:26.869> i<00:01:27.080> like<00:01:27.920> i<00:01:28.040> just<00:01:28.070> realized<00:01:28.520> i<00:01:28.610> made<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.820> map

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
like i like i just realized i made a map

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.390 
like i like i just realized i made a map
that<00:01:29.090> like<00:01:29.420> ground<00:01:29.840> level<00:01:30.259> so<00:01:30.470> on<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.190> bottom

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
that like ground level so on the bottom

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.969 
that like ground level so on the bottom
part<00:01:31.640> right<00:01:31.820> here<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:32.479> had<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:32.930> force<00:01:33.200> push<00:01:33.470> boxes

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
part right here I had a force push boxes

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.800 
part right here I had a force push boxes
in<00:01:34.160> zoo<00:01:34.310> grounds<00:01:34.580> which<00:01:35.060> that<00:01:35.479> was<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.630> new

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
in zoo grounds which that was a new

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.830 
in zoo grounds which that was a new
thing<00:01:35.840> for<00:01:36.080> me<00:01:36.259> I've<00:01:36.979> never<00:01:37.130> done<00:01:37.369> before<00:01:37.840> but

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
thing for me I've never done before but

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.680 
thing for me I've never done before but
it's<00:01:39.560> kind<00:01:39.800> of<00:01:39.890> pretty<00:01:40.100> well<00:01:40.340> they<00:01:40.729> just<00:01:41.270> found

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
it's kind of pretty well they just found

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.450 
it's kind of pretty well they just found
this<00:01:41.930> little<00:01:42.259> year<00:01:42.560> because<00:01:42.740> if<00:01:42.890> I<00:01:42.979> could<00:01:43.160> yeah

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
this little year because if I could yeah

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.300 
this little year because if I could yeah
right<00:01:43.789> there<00:01:43.910> but<00:01:44.119> he<00:01:44.630> won't<00:01:44.869> really<00:01:45.080> knows<00:01:45.350> it

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.120 

yes<00:01:49.310> then<00:01:50.149> let's<00:01:50.600> factor<00:01:51.170> that<00:01:51.470> will<00:01:51.649> like<00:01:52.009> it

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
yes then let's factor that will like it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.570 
yes then let's factor that will like it
like<00:01:52.729> I'm<00:01:53.000> he<00:01:53.210> didn't<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:53.690> my<00:01:53.899> cookies<00:01:54.890> like

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
like I'm he didn't like my cookies like

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.100 
like I'm he didn't like my cookies like
there's<00:01:55.850> no<00:01:56.000> spots<00:01:56.330> really<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.690> hide<00:01:56.840> on<00:01:56.960> this

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
there's no spots really to hide on this

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.450 
there's no spots really to hide on this
map<00:01:57.320> at<00:01:57.470> all<00:01:57.590> is<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:58.610> too<00:01:59.119> small<00:02:00.940> like<00:02:01.940> I<00:02:02.300> mean

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
map at all is it too small like I mean

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.210 
map at all is it too small like I mean
there<00:02:04.460> really<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:05.030> no<00:02:05.210> face<00:02:05.479> behind<00:02:08.890> joy<00:02:09.890> I'm

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
there really is no face behind joy I'm

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.789 
there really is no face behind joy I'm
on<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:16.340> map<00:02:16.519> is<00:02:16.880> number<00:02:17.390> generator<00:02:17.870> for<00:02:18.620> two

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
on the map is number generator for two

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.150 
on the map is number generator for two
regenerators<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.870> because<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.920> really
