let's<00:01:48.990> go<00:01:49.259> down<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> hu<00:01:49.890> oh<00:01:50.070> why<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
let's go down the hu oh why don't you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.149 
let's go down the hu oh why don't you
heal<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> foot<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.840> 34<00:01:52.290> so

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
heal that with the foot of the 34 so

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.080 
heal that with the foot of the 34 so
yeah<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.310> guess<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> dark<00:01:53.820> will<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.060> just

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
yeah I guess the dark will is just

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.760 
yeah I guess the dark will is just
around<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> same<00:01:54.750> value<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.259> whip<00:01:55.470> maybe<00:01:55.680> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
around the same value as a whip maybe a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
around the same value as a whip maybe a
tiny<00:01:56.070> bit<00:01:56.189> less<00:01:56.520> which<00:01:56.700> makes<00:01:56.909> complete<00:01:57.360> sense

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
tiny bit less which makes complete sense

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.850 
tiny bit less which makes complete sense
obviously<00:01:57.869> because<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.350> not<00:01:58.439> only<00:01:58.530> needed

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
obviously because it's not only needed

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.130 
obviously because it's not only needed
too<00:01:58.979> much<00:01:59.009> right<00:01:59.610> now<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:02:00.570> sure<00:02:00.750> dark<00:02:00.960> really

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
too much right now I'm sure dark really

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.450 
too much right now I'm sure dark really
needed<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.469> lot<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> future<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.340> don't

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
needed a lot in the future but I don't

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.740 
needed a lot in the future but I don't
think<00:02:02.579> they'll<00:02:02.790> ever<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.969> priced<00:02:03.270> around<00:02:03.390> five

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
think they'll ever be priced around five

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.530 
think they'll ever be priced around five
mil<00:02:04.020> or<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.710> very<00:02:04.979> long<00:02:05.130> time<00:02:05.189> uh<00:02:05.700> but

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
mil or so for a very long time uh but

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.670 
mil or so for a very long time uh but
that's<00:02:06.689> great<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.960> know<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.350> an<00:02:07.469> extra

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
that's great to know that's an extra

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.559 
that's great to know that's an extra
