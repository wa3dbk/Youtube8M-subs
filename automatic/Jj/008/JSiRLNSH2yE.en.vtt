00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:12.180
 the value was founded in 1986 is a 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.820
 small family business 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.790
 started at that time serving industries 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.710
 also small everything else like 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.080
 time with market consolidation and 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.850
 everything else we started to grow and 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.859
 today we serve large companies 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.720
 multinationals across the region of 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.720
 Campinas to reach SÃ£o Paulo 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.809
 practically because it is a 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.690
 laundry consumption of natural resources 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.729
 high waste and everything else 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.070
 the goal is that people were charged 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.870
 by the market was 14,000 when the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.150
 people we met a long time ago we went 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.809
 presented the platform how it worked 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.659
 and everything else 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.540
 In time he offered us to make the 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.580
 certification to 9 but to 14 thousand 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.559
 eventually found interesting because it already 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.330
 has a commitment to quality 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.890
 our procedures and everything else to be 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.900
 a small company was a little told 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.390
 At first I was a little afraid for 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.090
 find that only large companies 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.670
 multinationals could have a 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.289
 certification running 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.810
 that's when we started doing 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.280
 started calmly on the platform step 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.570
 step and everything else 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.969
 we managed to do it in a way 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.060
 calm down with employees and understand 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:27.340
 the process and it was all very quiet and 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.469
 everything much in the flow we go 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.109
 working was implemented gradually 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.789
 and the process was to develop in the desire 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.840
 that I have a much more 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.210
 locked up 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.979
 then all the material that enters the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.560
 laundry today it is totally 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.869
 been tracked since the beginning of the hour he 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.460
 Passed the gate until it was time to go. 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.159
 although I have a trace of it 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.960
 complete that before I had not then I 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.569
 I know how the process was executed by 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.369
 Who was executed what time was it done? 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.869
 with equipment was then used the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.509
 people have a much more closed process. 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.520
 so if I have any problems with the 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.649
 in the process today we know 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.890
 exactly where was the problem 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.110
 Why? What happened? 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.410
 It's no use just to give a 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.780
 well done service has everything with return 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.250
 for society this then waste is 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.430
 fully treated 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.600
 a work j 160 framed throughout 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.670
 legislation relevant to a work already came 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.650
 in the market on account of 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.550
 quality of care and quality in the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.570
 service 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.160
 so this is something that people 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.680
 keep a concern we have 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.160
 and we've been taking this very seriously 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.340
 with certifications this only only improved 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.230
 because now we have this 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.510
 worry and everything else 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.870
 we have it proven that in fact 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.310
 we have a process implemented 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.720
 focused on both quality and 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.940
 environment with which we already 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.560
 achieved a good market 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.800
 we are already reaping the fruits of this 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.800
 certification
