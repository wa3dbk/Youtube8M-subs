00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
should probably make money on it

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.249 
should probably make money on it
definitely<00:02:03.729> way<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:03.970> do<00:02:04.149> reducing<00:02:04.990> our<00:02:05.080> carbon

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
definitely way to do reducing our carbon

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.759 
definitely way to do reducing our carbon
footprint<00:02:06.330> is<00:02:07.330> definitely<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.080> way<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.259> go

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
footprint is definitely the way to go

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.800 
footprint is definitely the way to go
so<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.009> battery<00:02:09.310> power<00:02:09.569> electric<00:02:10.569> gotta

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
so the battery power electric gotta

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.449 
so the battery power electric gotta
really<00:02:11.110> save<00:02:11.380> us<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> huge<00:02:11.830> amount<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.190> money<00:02:12.310> on

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
really save us a huge amount of money on

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.199 
really save us a huge amount of money on
gas

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209

I believe what via motors is doing is

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.559 
I believe what via motors is doing is
truly<00:02:16.739> transformative<00:02:17.739> via<00:02:18.700> motors<00:02:19.120> says<00:02:19.420> hey

truly transformative via motors says hey
we<00:02:19.780> can<00:02:19.930> find<00:02:20.319> ways<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.920> do<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.250> without<00:02:21.400> the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
we can find ways to do it without the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.520 
we can find ways to do it without the
heavy<00:02:21.819> hand<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.269> government<00:02:22.330> making<00:02:23.140> us<00:02:23.260> do<00:02:23.410> it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
heavy hand of government making us do it

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.030 
heavy hand of government making us do it
the<00:02:23.940> actual<00:02:24.940> all-in<00:02:25.690> cost<00:02:26.049> of<00:02:26.319> ownership<00:02:26.530> is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
the actual all-in cost of ownership is

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.650 
the actual all-in cost of ownership is
lower<00:02:27.250> than<00:02:27.549> it<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.819> for<00:02:28.060> conventional

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
lower than it is for conventional

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.960 
lower than it is for conventional
vehicles<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.470> when<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.860> happens<00:02:30.430> it's
