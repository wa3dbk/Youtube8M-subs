more<00:03:26.050> this<00:03:27.050> is<00:03:27.110> supposedly<00:03:27.560> going<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:28.100> shock

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
more this is supposedly going to shock

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.360

your hair and make it grow like crazy

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.680 
your hair and make it grow like crazy
that's<00:03:31.370> why<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:31.670> can<00:03:31.850> only<00:03:31.970> do<00:03:32.180> it<00:03:32.300> once<00:03:32.540> a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
that's why you can only do it once a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.510 
that's why you can only do it once a
month<00:03:32.720> for<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.200> week<00:03:33.470> or<00:03:33.740> else<00:03:33.950> your<00:03:34.190> hair<00:03:34.310> will

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.620 
month for a week or else your hair will
get<00:03:34.790> used<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.300> it

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
get used to it

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.930 
get used to it
to<00:03:36.110> me<00:03:36.350> this<00:03:36.680> whole<00:03:36.890> method<00:03:37.130> kind<00:03:37.580> of<00:03:37.730> makes

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
to me this whole method kind of makes

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.000 
to me this whole method kind of makes
sense<00:03:38.210> because<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.750> lot<00:03:39.050> of<00:03:39.170> blood<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:39.560> going<00:03:39.800> to

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
sense because a lot of blood is going to

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.710 
sense because a lot of blood is going to
rush<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.400> your<00:03:40.460> head<00:03:40.550> and<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.060> massaging<00:03:41.390> and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
rush to your head and the massaging and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.840 
rush to your head and the massaging and
everything<00:03:42.230> should<00:03:42.770> stimulate<00:03:43.100> some<00:03:43.550> kind<00:03:43.790> of

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
everything should stimulate some kind of

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.480 
everything should stimulate some kind of
hair<00:03:44.030> growth<00:03:44.240> I<00:03:44.510> will<00:03:45.440> try<00:03:45.680> this<00:03:45.740> for<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.190> week

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
hair growth I will try this for a week

I decided to measure it from my forehead

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.700 
I decided to measure it from my forehead
down<00:05:52.160> my<00:05:52.220> back<00:05:53.060> and<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.780> the<00:05:53.810> longest<00:05:54.260> piece<00:05:54.530> of

down my back and to the longest piece of
my<00:05:54.830> hair<00:05:55.130> and<00:05:55.340> I<00:05:56.120> know<00:05:56.180> that<00:05:56.930> you<00:05:57.110> can't<00:05:57.320> really

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530
