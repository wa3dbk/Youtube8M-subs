00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.610
 the first mystery is just a cliché of 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.530

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.530

 we move away from this place a little 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.719
 windows of that building will have a 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.719

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.010
 but when we entered this place it 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.409
 you will see a window and the bullets will not 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.610

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.780

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.520
 up and down the windows will turn 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.060
