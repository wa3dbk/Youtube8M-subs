00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
to go full screen because since i'm

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.770 
to go full screen because since i'm
recording<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> screen<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.329> same<00:00:39.390> time

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
recording the screen at the same time

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.930 
recording the screen at the same time
that<00:00:40.260> does<00:00:40.500> affect<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.129> playback<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> when<00:00:41.879> i

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that does affect the playback and when i

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.490 
that does affect the playback and when i
show<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.300> back<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:42.690> i<00:00:42.719> recorded<00:00:43.260> video

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
show this back when i recorded video

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.229 
show this back when i recorded video
earlier<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.430> why<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:44.700> not<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:45.059> full

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
earlier so that's why I'm not going full

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.580 
earlier so that's why I'm not going full
screen<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:45.570> trust<00:00:45.750> me<00:00:45.809> full<00:00:46.050> screen<00:00:46.289> plays

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590

alright<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.580> here<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.790> am<00:02:56.610> moving<00:02:57.610> just<00:02:57.850> like<00:02:58.090> so

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
alright so here I am moving just like so

alright so here I am moving just like so
so<00:02:58.540> everything<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.050> really<00:02:59.590> smooth<00:02:59.890> as<00:02:59.950> far<00:03:00.160> as

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
so everything is really smooth as far as

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.860 
so everything is really smooth as far as
the<00:03:00.340> reaction<00:03:00.610> time<00:03:01.180> here<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.540> everything

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
the reaction time here and everything

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.250 
the reaction time here and everything
like<00:03:01.990> that<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:06.610> mean<00:03:06.910> there<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.720> know<00:03:07.840> I'll

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
like that so I mean there you know I'll

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.780 
like that so I mean there you know I'll
be<00:03:08.440> lying<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.740> you<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.980> say<00:03:09.130> there<00:03:09.280> wasn't<00:03:09.460> it

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
be lying to you to say there wasn't it

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.490 
be lying to you to say there wasn't it
doesn't<00:03:10.060> feel<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.840> doesn't<00:03:11.170> feel<00:03:11.260> just<00:03:11.470> like

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
doesn't feel it doesn't feel just like

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.170 
doesn't feel it doesn't feel just like
it<00:03:11.710> was<00:03:11.890> if<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.250> was<00:03:12.430> on<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.610> console<00:03:13.090> or

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
it was if it was on a console or

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.090 
it was if it was on a console or
something<00:03:13.450> like<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.600> but<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.500> really<00:03:14.830> can't

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
something like that but you really can't

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.500 
something like that but you really can't
tell<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.460> difference<00:03:15.670> unless<00:03:16.120> you're<00:03:16.420> really

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
tell the difference unless you're really

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.510 
tell the difference unless you're really
looking<00:03:16.750> forward<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.440> everything<00:03:18.160> works<00:03:18.370> for

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
looking forward and everything works for

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.130 
looking forward and everything works for
the<00:03:18.610> latency<00:03:19.210> and<00:03:19.240> all<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.600> stuff<00:03:19.690> is<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> big

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
the latency and all that stuff is a big

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.230 
the latency and all that stuff is a big
part<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.680> very<00:03:21.010> net<00:03:21.220> connection<00:03:21.640> but<00:03:22.210> this

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
part on a very net connection but this

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.760 
part on a very net connection but this
is<00:03:22.360> really<00:03:22.660> pretty<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.350> this<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.650> pretty

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
is really pretty and this is pretty

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.980 
is really pretty and this is pretty
awesome<00:03:23.980> just<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.460> way<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.700> feels<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:25.810> see

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
awesome just the way it feels you see

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.470 
awesome just the way it feels you see
the<00:03:26.080> graphics<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:27.310> graphics<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:28.090> know<00:03:28.210> are

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
the graphics the graphics you know are

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.300 
the graphics the graphics you know are
really<00:03:29.140> good<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.620> know<00:03:29.710> they're<00:03:29.950> not<00:03:29.980> the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
really good you know they're not the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.100 
really good you know they're not the
best<00:03:30.490> of<00:03:30.760> course<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.060> i'm<00:03:31.390> not<00:03:31.510> expecting<00:03:31.840> i

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
best of course and i'm not expecting i

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.300 
best of course and i'm not expecting i
think<00:03:32.290> nobody<00:03:32.530> expects<00:03:32.800> them<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:32.980> look<00:03:33.130> like

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
think nobody expects them to look like

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.220 
think nobody expects them to look like
if<00:03:33.490> you<00:03:33.520> actually<00:03:34.150> download<00:03:34.750> this<00:03:34.870> game<00:03:34.960> when

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
your computer had it physically yourself

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.400 
your computer had it physically yourself
but<00:03:37.180> they're<00:03:37.330> really<00:03:37.720> good<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.020> play<00:03:38.140> through

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
but they're really good to play through

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.300 
but they're really good to play through
everything<00:03:39.190> works<00:03:39.490> fine<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.680> i<00:03:41.680> mean<00:03:42.010> i'm<00:03:42.160> at

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
everything works fine so i mean i'm at

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.010 
everything works fine so i mean i'm at
the<00:03:42.400> graphics<00:03:42.610> can<00:03:42.880> get<00:03:43.030> better<00:03:43.180> over<00:03:43.570> time<00:03:43.600> as

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
the graphics can get better over time as

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.510 
the graphics can get better over time as
pretty<00:03:44.230> sure<00:03:44.410> as<00:03:44.530> they<00:03:44.680> work<00:03:44.890> this<00:03:45.040> out<00:03:45.250> but

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
pretty sure as they work this out but

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.730 
pretty sure as they work this out but
for<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.670> most<00:03:45.820> part<00:03:45.910> this<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:47.260> game<00:03:47.470> really

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
for the most part this this game really

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.680 
for the most part this this game really
really<00:03:48.250> impresses<00:03:48.580> these<00:03:48.880> disservice<00:03:49.300> right

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
really impresses these disservice right

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.270 
really impresses these disservice right
here<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.020> this<00:03:50.320> really<00:03:50.590> is<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:50.860> feature<00:03:51.160> is

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
here and this really is the feature is

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
going to be a cheap way to actually play

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.540 
going to be a cheap way to actually play
games<00:03:52.990> these<00:03:53.560> games<00:03:53.740> are<00:03:53.980> definitely<00:03:54.400> cheaper

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
games these games are definitely cheaper
