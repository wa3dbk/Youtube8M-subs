00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
will spawn up the field it may take a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.560 
will spawn up the field it may take a
while<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.950> show<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.489> because<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.090> loading

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
while to show it because it's loading

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.250 
while to show it because it's loading
and<00:00:36.719> stuff<00:00:37.100> but<00:00:38.390> you<00:00:39.390> lay<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.750> block<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and stuff but you lay this block in the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590 
and stuff but you lay this block in the
right-click<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:42.030> sets<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
right-click on it and it sets up the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.229 
right-click on it and it sets up the
field<00:00:43.050> now<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.280> little<00:00:44.399> laggy<00:00:44.730> at<00:00:44.969> first

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
field now it's a little laggy at first

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.910 
field now it's a little laggy at first
but<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:46.050> all<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.350> Lane<00:00:46.620> changing

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
but you can see all this Lane changing

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.830 
but you can see all this Lane changing
and<00:00:47.370> wait<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.829> just<00:00:49.829> wait<00:00:50.149> it<00:00:51.149> spawns<00:00:51.570> up

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and wait for it just wait it spawns up

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.790 
and wait for it just wait it spawns up
goals<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> coolest<00:00:53.699> mod<00:00:54.090> ever

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
goals this is like the coolest mod ever

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.439 
goals this is like the coolest mod ever
so<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.860> basically<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.489> lay<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.850> block<00:00:57.149> in

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
so you basically you lay that block in

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.450 
so you basically you lay that block in
the<00:00:57.989> center<00:00:58.410> where<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.710> want<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> field<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the center where you want the field to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.160 
the center where you want the field to
be<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.210> spawns<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.690> fields

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
be and then it spawns up fields

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.200 
be and then it spawns up fields
basically<00:01:01.980> these<00:01:02.430> are<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> goals<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.120> I'll

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
basically these are the goals and I'll

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.200 
basically these are the goals and I'll
show<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.449> how<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> score<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.260> stuff<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:05.210> see

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
you try to score by throwing the blocks

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.609

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
I can make it yep and then here we go

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.340 
I can make it yep and then here we go
these<00:01:53.399> are<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> brooms<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.270> fly<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.540> now<00:01:55.170> it's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
these are the brooms you fly on now it's

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
just but it's pretty awesome it's a nice

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.790 
just but it's pretty awesome it's a nice
mod<00:03:10.490> and<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:11.210> think<00:03:11.630> that<00:03:12.110> block<00:03:12.500> right<00:03:12.740> there

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
mod and I think that block right there

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.340 
mod and I think that block right there
is<00:03:13.130> what<00:03:13.310> makes<00:03:13.550> them<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.120> awesome<00:03:14.540> if<00:03:15.230> you

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
is what makes them on so awesome if you

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.830 
is what makes them on so awesome if you
had<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.650> set<00:03:15.920> up<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:16.250> field<00:03:16.580> every<00:03:16.940> time<00:03:16.970> it'd

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
had to set up this field every time it'd

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.900 
had to set up this field every time it'd
be<00:03:18.080> really<00:03:18.410> annoying<00:03:18.680> but<00:03:19.190> since<00:03:19.610> you<00:03:19.760> can

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
be really annoying but since you can

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.180 
be really annoying but since you can
just<00:03:20.120> lay<00:03:20.330> that<00:03:20.360> block<00:03:20.840> right<00:03:21.080> there<00:03:21.350> you<00:03:22.010> have

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
just lay that block right there you have

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.520 
just lay that block right there you have
your<00:03:22.370> two<00:03:22.550> goalposts<00:03:23.090> set<00:03:23.390> up<00:03:23.570> and<00:03:23.810> then<00:03:24.440> all

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
your two goalposts set up and then all

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.350
