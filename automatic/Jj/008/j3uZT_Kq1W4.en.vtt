00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.859
 There are two ways to increase 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.210
 computer performance 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.070
 outbid newer equipment 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.259
 spending a tidy sum 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.639
 money 2 maximize 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.800
 existing performance 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.169
 equip apply with all the most 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.670
 modern means and knowledge first 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.380
 The method is more suitable for solid 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.720
 companies sparing no money for 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.369
 computer park the second method is applicable 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.380
 for ordinary users and small 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.349
 enterprises that do not want to spend 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.769
 money for computer equipment 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.930
 chip temperature 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.510
 one of the main limiting factors 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.309
 user overclocking todays 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.830
 processors are quite large 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.019
 power over 20 watts of course 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.080
 I work at such high frequencies and me 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.699
 avoid side effects of warming the core 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.449
 and is one of these side 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.890
 unwanted power loss effects 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.440
 cooling problem is perhaps 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.269
 the main limiting factor but 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.190
 besides acceleration computer interest in 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.019
 water cooling may be caused 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.699
 another one to stand up with the feed 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.360
 water is produced using water 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.090
 pumps 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.340
 who are virtually silent so 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.270
 way we lose one of the main 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.780
 noise sources 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.550
 CPU unit processor new cooler 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.410
 besides water cooling possesses 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.910
 another added advantage 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.190
 if air cooling 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.680
 removes heat from the processor and dissipates 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.690
 its inside the system unit then water 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.300
 cooling completely removes this heat 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.370
 from the case for this reason it was possible 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.140
 feel free to get rid of personal fans 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.840
 or translate them to reduced speed 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.590
 standard rotation 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.490
 water cooler w202 ultra allows 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.550
 produce water cooling 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.159
 central processor video card 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.780
 processors and video cards simultaneously 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.210
 Now consider the connection method 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.180
 cooler for all three cases first 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.190
 CPU cooler connection using 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.979
 plastic tubes connect between 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.900
 a heatsink CPU cooler and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.830
 the execution unit is filled 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.880
 water-block with antifreeze water mixture 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.190
 we connect to the executive unit 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.210
 power from the computer we check the work 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.460
 second video card cooler connection 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:19.200
 3 video card cooler connection and 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.880
 I would like to draw conclusion 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.200
 attention to the fact that before installing 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.210
 cooler in the system unit 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.400
 you need to assemble the circuit on the table and 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.150
 run it to make sure 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.150
 tightness system
