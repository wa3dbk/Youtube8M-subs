definitely fighting it wouldn't make

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.820 
definitely fighting it wouldn't make
sense<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:08.690> be<00:03:08.780> on<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:08.959> undercard<00:03:09.560> with

sense to be on that undercard with
Canelo<00:03:10.130> trout<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.670> think<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.090> would<00:03:11.269> I<00:03:11.299> mean<00:03:11.660> if

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
Canelo trout I think it would I mean if

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.400 
Canelo trout I think it would I mean if
you<00:03:12.470> think<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:13.370> day<00:03:13.549> designated<00:03:14.209> us<00:03:14.359> as<00:03:14.600> the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
you think the day designated us as the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.500 
you think the day designated us as the
mandatory<00:03:16.040> challenger<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.850> think<00:03:17.299> it<00:03:17.390> would<00:03:17.480> be

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
mandatory challenger I think it would be

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.729 
mandatory challenger I think it would be
good<00:03:17.780> for<00:03:17.840> hibachi<00:03:19.030> now<00:03:20.140> Brian<00:03:21.140> Berra<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.680> a

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
good for hibachi now Brian Berra is a
