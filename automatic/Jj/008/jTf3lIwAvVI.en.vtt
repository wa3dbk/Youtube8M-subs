00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.120
 hi to all and are welcome in 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.109
 cartons of the week in the summary 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.379
 front red 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.440
 2 you want maples and lodge of the week 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.630
 is attributed to gattuso 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.400
 the former iconic player we will have 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.599
 the opportunity to discuss milan ac 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.429
 so I got dropped so 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.539
 appreciable hasten last week I 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.890
 do not know what people are doing in this 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.359
 moment maybe the close of holiday's 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.939
 christmas but in any case we want to 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.359
 to confide and here he confided is the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.279
 case to say it 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.190
 be France in front of the French I 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.530
 their German we start with his 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.480
 ibra budget statements told me 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.579
 that in the cloakroom of the French of 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.870
 psg talk a lot about salary and he 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.480
 will have to realize that where 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.129
 the other touches more than first thing 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.629
 we do not adapt to the goal since 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.000
 must admit the french psg what 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.559
 minority second thing I do not know 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 if this is true or not in any case it 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.890
 did not seem like this strategy we had 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.930
 a child to give more impact to this 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.059
 they say there we take the strong suit it 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.519
 arm told me that one is easier to 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.199
 to say unpublished that I understood 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.360
 second statement since they 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.119
 outbidding saying when I see 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.530
 the team of France evolves and I can not 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.390
 to stop me from feeling that the mentality 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.630
 is not good and needs to change 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.070
 sorry soon without telling you about 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.420
 mentality it's a little bit the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.799
 camembert who will not go strong who can the 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.000
 nantes where I could have me the saint 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.380
 nectary who laughing waters that he 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.350
 is not ambitious enough and that I 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.240
 do not accept you understand gattuso 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.280
 the player who gave more tact to 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.420
 kik no but what is this a site 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.700
 e lyon come give us lessons 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.060
 of exemplary excuse me excuse me from 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.860
 tell you no 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.409
 so there he always has you washed 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.880
 see these people think more when I 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.189
 think you said to propose slab 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.720
 that it's a plan or cat when I think 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.159
 that he made a death in belgrade 6 not 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.350
 blur richard this rab 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.430
 it's not good is hard to violence 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.969
 everything is close to what the 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.890
 Corrections 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.469
 the day is the next game of the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.090
 week he returns to khartoum to 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.439
 defender of saint-etienne who has 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.090
 fractured the ankle of thomas guerbert 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.560
 players say unavailable until 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.030
 probably the end of the season has 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.259
 still shown the images must already 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.390
 have evolved in this case a beautiful to see 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.190
 in addition I think you 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.930
 I saw all that to say that I have 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.660
 any case obviously a deserved red wine 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.370
 but we decided to give it a day 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.630
 why because this player celebrated he 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.430
 a few days ago it's disappointing 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.709
 it does not excuse where I concede it but 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.150
 it's not a problem of experience manage 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.260
 that it is more a problem of immaturity 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.270
 is very important to stress management 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.070
 which khartoum if you listen to us do 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.300
 feng shui to master a little bit 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.680
 however your anger what me everything to 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.690
 time for example so at all I was 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.280
 naÃ¯ve I became again like this 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.620
 work this job here we go 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.870
 explain how to put a kind the d2 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.060
 Here we will demonstrate that it is more 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.739
 here we take advantage of this yellow card for 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.630
 obviously always wanted 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.400
 of establishment to the Sochaux thomas 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.280
 guerbert and good luck for the future 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.450
 the second yellow card and for new 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.400
 york red bulls by thierry henry 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.110
 eliminated from the mls here we understand 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.600
 why the best team of the season 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.930
 regular they fall four years from 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.430
 after 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.230
 again in the semi finals of the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.489
 conference since you know that the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.840
 football in the usa it's like the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.980
 basketball and american football it's by 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.930
 conference is and by system of 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.850
 playoffs and again in the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.430
 red bull the hard to shoot in laughter or not 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.690
 at the end it's amazing especially it was 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.400
 one of the favorite teams and thierry 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.510
 henry still does not have this title at 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.989
 united states that he misses in a 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.690
 prize list 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.030
 I assure you very full but no 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.700
 do we reassure thierry henry can still 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.040
 get the mvp title of the season 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.329
 even though it's still pretty much a 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.040
 movie as hope 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.299
 knowing that usually it is given 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.130
 to the players who dispute the final 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.570
 did not go to the finals 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.790
 their conference so that's going to be when we 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.590
 do not hide it for that 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.600
 titillates at us to grace the last 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.220
 table but it's not just your fault 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.630
 I advise you the cemac is an armchair 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.920
 we were still not dead 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.600
 not mess with that we'll go 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.459
 now bourgeois 20 weeks is 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.410
 deserved the beautiful blue blue cardboard box 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.940
 for aaron ramsey midfielder 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.380
 Welsh arsenal that makes a start of 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.630
 season I will use my you 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.670
 know early visit rue louis des 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.269
 incredible stats ten matches of 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.280
 1st league 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.450
 six goals 3rd top scorer behind 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.209
 excuse me from the little 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.160
 sturridge and aguero so two attackers 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.320
 serge and more we have them when 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.630
 not bad in c1 he has five goals 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.459
 dam and he continues even in 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.010
 this decisive week for arsenal in 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.239
 being an incredible player the 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.920
 last for the victory against 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.400
 liverpool who was second who was 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.349
 just behind 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.150
 he scores the goal of the break and this Wednesday 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.100
 in league champions he offers the goal 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.970
 which allows arsenal to beat dortmund 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.329
 and take the first place of the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.070
 group 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.630
 this is finally excuse me I did my 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.250
 week I even share pay for it 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.380
 pass how then yes sir 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.789
 yeah he who used to be 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.930
 rather a player burns enough months the 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.639
 years before that's a player who 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.199
 was returning to the losing game 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.570
 some balloons so here we can say 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.340
 to sum up to conclude that he has 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.870
 changed his rifle 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.570
 it's a joke since rifle poles 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.130
 arsenal gunners military vocabulary 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.850
 I leave you there on the week 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.850
 next on thomas 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.910
 and
