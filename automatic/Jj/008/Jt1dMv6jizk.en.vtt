this<00:04:58.330> right<00:04:58.540> now<00:04:58.720> I<00:04:58.960> mean<00:04:59.169> I<00:04:59.440> think<00:04:59.980> it's<00:05:00.310> got

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
this right now I mean I think it's got

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.700 
this right now I mean I think it's got
great<00:05:00.490> promise<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.780> only<00:05:02.020> problem<00:05:02.320> I<00:05:02.380> can<00:05:02.560> see

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
great promise the only problem I can see

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.680 
great promise the only problem I can see
it<00:05:02.950> so<00:05:03.100> far<00:05:03.370> is<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.700> textures<00:05:04.090> need<00:05:04.240> improving

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
it so far is the textures need improving

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.720 
it so far is the textures need improving
but<00:05:04.870> this<00:05:04.990> is<00:05:05.260> an<00:05:05.440> alpha<00:05:05.620> so<00:05:06.070> that's<00:05:06.490> what<00:05:06.639> you

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
but this is an alpha so that's what you

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.850 
but this is an alpha so that's what you
should<00:05:06.850> expect<00:05:06.940> but<00:05:07.930> my<00:05:08.080> main<00:05:08.260> problem<00:05:08.680> is<00:05:08.830> the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
should expect but my main problem is the

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.010 
should expect but my main problem is the
court<00:05:09.310> tales<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.850> kind<00:05:10.060> of<00:05:10.180> flares<00:05:10.480> too<00:05:10.810> much

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
court tales it kind of flares too much

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.200 
court tales it kind of flares too much
at<00:05:11.139> the<00:05:11.230> bomb<00:05:11.410> so<00:05:12.130> in<00:05:12.370> my<00:05:12.520> opinion<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:13.060> he's

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
at the bomb so in my opinion and he's

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.850 
at the bomb so in my opinion and he's
drawing<00:05:13.450> in<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.690> bit<00:05:13.900> not<00:05:14.440> too<00:05:14.620> much<00:05:14.650> just

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
drawing in a bit not too much just

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.400 
drawing in a bit not too much just
drawing<00:05:15.370> in<00:05:15.460> a<00:05:15.550> bit<00:05:15.730> and<00:05:15.880> then<00:05:16.630> maybe<00:05:16.960> add<00:05:17.200> some

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
drawing in a bit and then maybe add some

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.320 
drawing in a bit and then maybe add some
more<00:05:17.590> animations<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.610> clough<00:05:18.850> at<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.030> bottom

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
more animations to clough at the bottom

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.440 
more animations to clough at the bottom
and<00:05:19.510> it<00:05:19.900> will<00:05:20.020> be<00:05:20.200> perfect<00:05:20.950> and<00:05:21.300> that's<00:05:22.300> my

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
and it will be perfect and that's my
