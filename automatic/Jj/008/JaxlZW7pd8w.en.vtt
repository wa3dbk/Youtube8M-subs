for up lighting you know I usually I

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.230 
for up lighting you know I usually I
might<00:03:54.540> throw<00:03:54.750> them<00:03:54.959> up<00:03:55.050> on<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.200> trust<00:03:55.560> but<00:03:55.830> I<00:03:55.860> can

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
might throw them up on a trust but I can

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.460 
might throw them up on a trust but I can
master/slave<00:03:57.240> them<00:03:57.420> together<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.810> can<00:03:58.050> DMX
