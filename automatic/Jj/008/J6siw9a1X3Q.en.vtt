00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.940 
the use of this exfoliating disc
combined<00:01:39.119> with<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> gentle<00:01:39.840> suction<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.829> it's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
combined with a gentle suction so it's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.700 
combined with a gentle suction so it's
very<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.490> powerful<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.150> very<00:01:42.450> effective<00:01:43.140> so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
very very powerful and very effective so

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.560 
very very powerful and very effective so
I<00:01:43.740> recommend<00:01:44.040> only<00:01:44.369> using<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.909> about<00:01:45.149> once<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
I recommend only using it about once a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.050 
I recommend only using it about once a
week<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> usually<00:01:46.649> start<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:47.430> my<00:01:47.610> jawline

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
week so I usually start at my jawline

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.420 
week so I usually start at my jawline
and<00:01:48.329> pull<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.869> device<00:01:49.110> backwards<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.220> sort

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and pull the device backwards and a sort

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.789 
and pull the device backwards and a sort
of<00:01:50.490> upward<00:01:51.000> motion<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.899> sort<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.259> feels<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
of upward motion it sort of feels like a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.490 
of upward motion it sort of feels like a
suction<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.700> exfoliation<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> same<00:01:55.170> time

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
suction and exfoliation at the same time

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.740

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
but it doesn't hurt or anything but it

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.600

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
those impurities so when you start to

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.990 
those impurities so when you start to
see<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.870> mask<00:04:32.110> hardening<00:04:32.800> like<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.400> when

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
see the mask hardening like this when

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.640 
see the mask hardening like this when
the<00:04:34.120> color<00:04:34.360> starts<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.900> get<00:04:35.020> a<00:04:35.050> little<00:04:35.169> lighter

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
the color starts to get a little lighter

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.190 
the color starts to get a little lighter
then<00:04:36.250> it's<00:04:36.460> time<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.730> rinse<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.510> off<00:04:37.630> with<00:04:37.840> some
