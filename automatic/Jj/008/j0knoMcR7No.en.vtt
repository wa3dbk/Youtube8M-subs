cuz that's on mount plate too maybe I

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:29.660 
cuz that's on mount plate too maybe I
don't<00:03:22.930> know<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.730> then<00:03:27.939> the<00:03:28.150> winch<00:03:28.420> is<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:29.079> here

cable I think I'll put this synthetic
rope<00:03:37.269> on<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.510> now<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:37.840> save<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.560> cable<00:03:39.040> for

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579
