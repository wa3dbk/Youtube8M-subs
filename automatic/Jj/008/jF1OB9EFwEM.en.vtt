00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.120 
way seem to have the 7th gear way too
low<00:01:42.720> let's<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.200> had<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.350> really<00:01:43.620> work<00:01:43.800> hard<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
low let's go had to really work hard to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.880 
low let's go had to really work hard to
get<00:01:44.310> second<00:01:44.610> place<00:01:44.840> because<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.230> saw<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> move

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
get second place because we saw a move

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.850 
get second place because we saw a move
with<00:01:47.250> Schumacher<00:01:47.730> as<00:01:48.360> well<00:01:48.690> where<00:01:49.440> Schumacher

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
with Schumacher as well where Schumacher

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.050 
with Schumacher as well where Schumacher
actually<00:01:50.160> goes<00:01:50.310> into<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.580> pits<00:01:50.760> assist

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
actually goes into the pits assist

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.490 
actually goes into the pits assist
that's<00:01:51.240> gonna<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.540> investigated<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.230> well<00:01:52.350> but

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
that's gonna be investigated as well but

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.690 
that's gonna be investigated as well but
I<00:01:52.560> doubt<00:01:52.740> they're<00:01:52.890> gonna<00:01:52.950> give<00:01:53.190> him<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.370> penalty

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
I doubt they're gonna give him a penalty

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.630 
I doubt they're gonna give him a penalty
or<00:01:53.730> anything<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.150> that<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:55.520> he<00:01:56.520> had<00:01:56.610> very

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
or anything like that but he had very

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.720 
or anything like that but he had very
tricky<00:01:56.970> race<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.540> Vettel<00:01:58.470> but<00:01:58.680> he<00:01:58.800> manages<00:01:59.310> to

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
tricky race for Vettel but he manages to

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.790 
tricky race for Vettel but he manages to
get<00:01:59.910> second<00:02:00.300> place<00:02:00.330> where<00:02:01.230> I<00:02:01.260> can<00:02:01.440> only<00:02:01.560> manage

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
get second place where I can only manage

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.440 
get second place where I can only manage
to<00:02:01.920> get<00:02:02.070> third<00:02:02.280> great<00:02:02.640> race<00:02:02.880> from<00:02:03.090> him<00:02:03.270> I

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
to get third great race from him I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.540 
to get third great race from him I
expected<00:02:04.170> him<00:02:04.230> to<00:02:04.290> get<00:02:04.500> podium<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.070> spa<00:02:05.280> I

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
expected him to get podium and spa I

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.220 
expected him to get podium and spa I
reckon<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.120> was<00:02:06.390> trying<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:06.780> make<00:02:06.900> a<00:02:07.020> move

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
reckon and was trying to make a move

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.229 
reckon and was trying to make a move
around<00:02:08.069> Michael<00:02:08.459> Schumacher<00:02:08.789> at<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> start

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
around Michael Schumacher at the start

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.279 
around Michael Schumacher at the start
of<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.390> race<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:09.720> Michael<00:02:10.019> Schumacher

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
of the race but Michael Schumacher

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.890 
of the race but Michael Schumacher
obviously<00:02:10.709> having<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> defensive<00:02:11.430> line

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
obviously having the defensive line

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.190 
obviously having the defensive line
eventually<00:02:13.190> Schumacher<00:02:14.190> was<00:02:14.900> really<00:02:15.900> slow

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
eventually Schumacher was really slow

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.960 
eventually Schumacher was really slow
and<00:02:16.580> räikkönen

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and räikkönen

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.640 
and räikkönen
made<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.360> move<00:02:18.540> because<00:02:18.900> my<00:02:19.020> cannon<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.440> had

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
made the move because my cannon just had

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.220 
made the move because my cannon just had
much<00:02:20.370> more<00:02:20.640> peace<00:02:20.850> than<00:02:20.880> Schumacher<00:02:21.510> did<00:02:21.750> it

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
much more peace than Schumacher did it

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.720 
much more peace than Schumacher did it
was<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.410> disappointing<00:02:23.100> race<00:02:23.280> with<00:02:23.460> Schumacher

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
was a disappointing race with Schumacher

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.270 
was a disappointing race with Schumacher
I<00:02:23.940> mean<00:02:24.120> he<00:02:24.240> was<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:24.360> fifth<00:02:24.690> place<00:02:24.890> when<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
I mean he was in fifth place when the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.490 
I mean he was in fifth place when the
safety<00:02:26.520> car<00:02:26.790> came<00:02:27.030> out<00:02:27.240> after<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.230> incident

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
safety car came out after that incident

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.220 
safety car came out after that incident
and<00:02:28.950> he<00:02:29.910> managed<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.180> make<00:02:30.300> some<00:02:30.540> moves<00:02:30.750> after

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
and he managed to make some moves after

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.090 
and he managed to make some moves after
the<00:02:31.410> race<00:02:32.160> restarted<00:02:33.020> but<00:02:34.020> after<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.530> after

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
the race restarted but after that after

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.740 
the race restarted but after that after
a<00:02:35.130> few<00:02:35.250> laps<00:02:35.640> for<00:02:35.910> Blackhawk<00:02:36.270> were<00:02:36.480> after

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
a few laps for Blackhawk were after

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.840 
a few laps for Blackhawk were after
halfway<00:02:37.050> through<00:02:37.350> we<00:02:38.250> saw<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.640> Schumacher

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
halfway through we saw that Schumacher

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.580 
halfway through we saw that Schumacher
was<00:02:39.150> losing<00:02:39.510> pace<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.960> tires<00:02:40.170> were<00:02:40.380> just

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
was losing pace and the tires were just

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.280 
was losing pace and the tires were just
going<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.690> sure<00:02:42.690> mike<00:02:42.810> has<00:02:42.900> just<00:02:43.020> lost<00:02:43.170> his

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
going and sure mike has just lost his

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.660 
going and sure mike has just lost his
pace<00:02:43.470> from<00:02:43.620> there<00:02:43.800> after<00:02:43.890> räikkönen<00:02:44.490> just

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
pace from there after räikkönen just

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.250 
pace from there after räikkönen just
made<00:02:44.850> his<00:02:45.000> move<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.990> really

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
made his move and it's really

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.780 
made his move and it's really
frustrating<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.920> watch<00:02:47.040> because<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.610> see

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
frustrating to watch because we see

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.700 
frustrating to watch because we see
these<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.240> doesn't<00:02:48.540> have<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.720> pace<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.470> you

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
these just doesn't have the pace and you

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.590 
these just doesn't have the pace and you
know<00:02:49.830> there's<00:02:50.010> even<00:02:50.190> talks<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.730> Schumacher

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
know there's even talks of Schumacher

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.260 
know there's even talks of Schumacher
retiring<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:53.370> I'm<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:53.940> hoping<00:02:54.209> that

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
retiring so I'm just hoping that

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.000 
retiring so I'm just hoping that
Schumacher<00:02:54.540> stays<00:02:54.990> is<00:02:55.200> going<00:02:55.380> on<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.830> just

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
Schumacher stays is going on it's just

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.740 
Schumacher stays is going on it's just
what<00:02:56.160> film<00:02:56.370> noir<00:02:56.490> needs<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.940> think<00:02:57.120> everyone

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
what film noir needs I think everyone

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.140
