00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.170
 hello to all that as you are good 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.850
 because today I bring you a video I hope that 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.040
 be short because I will explain a 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.500
 very simple way very quick to do 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.690
 ripples or curl the hair and leave it 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.820
 with more thanks in a super way 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.220
 easy that yes with heat this time 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.510
 where I was born there conical that I like 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.490
 besides the effect that they leave much more 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.980
 natural means that well 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.830
 It has cone shape obviously and nothing 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.930
 Well, I'm going to comment on how I do it 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.180
 and that is super easy and you will see that you are going 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.400
 to like we need to look for things the 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.110
 true a rubber band hair is worth it 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.770
 this kind that does not mark the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.070
 hair is ok and we are going to put two clamps 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.500
 two clips or two forks worth of this 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.590
 type of those that you have by house and what 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.410
 we put it in jump say 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.670
 to one side you see here 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.280
 and on the opposite side super simple 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.440
 next with a comb then let's go 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.880
 let's comb the hair well all the hair 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.430
 back to make a ponytail 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.039
 he talks about really fucking me 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.979
 like the result too static 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.439
 too much to see as I tell you state 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.240
 perfect, I like the things that 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.969
 you want natural ones that remain then 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.070
 irregular that everything is not perfect 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.780
 So, well, it just helped me 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.479
 a little with him with the other little comb 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.860
 but much empain I armed the hair for this 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.640
 this point has arrived 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.899
 we take this collection that we have not done 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.899
 with the crochet hook 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.880
 and with the rest of the hair we do we give 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.580
 go back to the queue now to create a 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.030
 pigtail and so not create a queue that 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.759
 is too tight and that is 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.090
 especially the brand is worth like that and then 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.110
 this end that is this clip so what 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.210
 we put back 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.960
 that's how it would look like, it 's super 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.280
 simple 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.380
 and now squeeze a little 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.380
 we comb the pigtail 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.650
 to remove entanglements for this can be 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.590
 do in several ways you can use 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.680
 if for whatever reason we have the curls 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.930
 of facts you can use the Balearic Islands with 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.490
 so many slipped my hair but I 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.290
 this time I 'm not going to do it that way 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.150
 I'm not going to use any kind of 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.100
 fixation because I want it to be very 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.590
 natural then what we do with 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.440
 the technique then to pick up tufts 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.099
 of a thickness because not very big very 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.099
 small 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.600
 something like that and roll it in 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:47.350
 conical tendency 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.960
 let's wait about 10 15 15 seconds 20 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.190
 seconds a thing like that and let's go and 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.530
 we are doing it with each lock of 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.290
 hair as easy as that very important 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.880
 go loosing and do not go allocating voucher 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.340
 we simply letting it 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.560
 cool is the most important thing of this type 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.560
 of curls should always be taken into account 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.630
 that the fattest goes to the fattest area 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.630
 from which I was born there you have to put it 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.340
 in the root of the queue is worth and the tip 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.360
 always the finite thing so that it remains 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.370
 this effect is worth but it continues little 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.620
 we are slowly picking up tufts 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.070
 randomly as I say as notions 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.750
 different so that everything is not the same 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.600
 well it is already finished and you see how 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.310
 The truth that remains is very funny 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.600
 very nice stamp service 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.460
 you can leave to continue if you want the 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.740
 true and now wait a bit then for 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.480
 example right now when we have 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.370
 so the hair can make up the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.690
 quietly it was good once we 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.850
 we have already made up and we have finished 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.340
 especially that it is cold fact 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.700
 we can do well like this a little so that 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.379
 cool 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.420
 and well you can see that it has 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.150
 keeping the curls we do not touch it 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.470
 we open or anything like that I say and 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.519
 now then for those who well what 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.220
 what we have to do when we have 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.190
 cooled down it removes equal of the same 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.459
 way that we have put remove the the 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.739
 click to remove the pigtail from this 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.030
 way so easy and good so what 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.030
 we do is use the hair 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.250
 we can create the line where we want now 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.250
 on that occasion I'm going to create it that way 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.850
 you see that a male ruffles the genes 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.929
 Well, I'm so simple it took me 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:35.389
 like 10 minutes in doing this the 

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:37.069
 truth is that very very easy and I say 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.199
 which is very recurrent because at the time of 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.689
 for example if you do not have anything 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.389
 we do in the hair and what you want is 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.999
 a quick thing because you do it or 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.279
 makeup and then six and you 're 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:52.639
 list now here so you can get 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:54.529
 some kind of fixation in the spray by 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.629
 is Polish what you want is worth a 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:58.279
 very simple trick you can take a 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.989
 tail higher and terminals you will get 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:03.139
 much more volume and at the time of 

00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:05.329
 remove the rubber you can take os 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.519
 all the hair down move it with the 

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:10.369
 hands threw lacquer or some kind of 

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:13.069
 fixation in the root is worth and so it remains 

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:14.449
 much more voluminous hair and nothing that 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:18.169
 speaking a lot of fact this I 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.599
 I have done many times and since 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.129
 a lot of time and well, it had never been 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.709
 happened that they taught the tables worth 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:27.019
 nothing that I hope you liked as 

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:28.399

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:34.670
 it deserves because the truth is that 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.530
