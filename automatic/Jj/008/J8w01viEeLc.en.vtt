00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.490 
I have to head in Metropolis why is that
damage<00:06:08.490> control<00:06:08.639> algorithm<00:06:09.330> that<00:06:09.960> city<00:06:10.289> needs

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
damage control algorithm that city needs

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.290 
damage control algorithm that city needs
help<00:06:10.740> being<00:06:10.979> rebuilt<00:06:11.340> every<00:06:11.729> Superman<00:06:12.180> in

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
help being rebuilt every Superman in

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.709 
help being rebuilt every Superman in
that<00:06:12.450> Kryptonian<00:06:13.050> tor

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:14.719 
that Kryptonian tor

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.839 
that Kryptonian tor
so<00:06:15.289> I'm<00:06:15.379> guessing<00:06:15.679> you<00:06:15.949> will<00:06:16.129> donate<00:06:16.489> some<00:06:16.729> of

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
so I'm guessing you will donate some of

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.179 
so I'm guessing you will donate some of
your<00:06:16.999> money<00:06:19.179> yes
