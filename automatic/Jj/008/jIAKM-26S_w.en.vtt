before<00:05:29.360> it<00:05:29.660> got<00:05:29.900> quite<00:05:30.530> to<00:05:30.710> ten<00:05:30.980> I<00:05:31.280> think<00:05:32.120> he

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
before it got quite to ten I think he

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.960 
before it got quite to ten I think he
probably<00:05:33.320> just<00:05:33.830> didn't<00:05:34.160> quite<00:05:34.310> make<00:05:34.610> it<00:05:34.670> the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
probably just didn't quite make it the

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.780

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290
