hello<00:00:05.549> minecrafters<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:06.390> just<00:00:06.569> want<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.899> show

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
hello minecrafters I just want to show

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.680 
hello minecrafters I just want to show
quickly<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:08.400> build<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.269> pseudo-random

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
quickly this I build a pseudo-random

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.560 
quickly this I build a pseudo-random
number<00:00:10.349> generator<00:00:10.740> with<00:00:11.429> redstone<00:00:13.429> it's

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
number generator with redstone it's

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.970 
number generator with redstone it's
fairly<00:00:15.570> big<00:00:15.870> but<00:00:16.139> most<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:16.890> this

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
fairly big but most of it's just this

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.640 
fairly big but most of it's just this
multiplier<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:17.850> which<00:00:18.840> has<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.380> bug

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
multiplier here which has a bug

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.560 
multiplier here which has a bug
somewhere<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.189> haven't<00:00:20.310> quite<00:00:20.820> found<00:00:21.119> yet<00:00:21.390> but

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
somewhere I haven't quite found yet but

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.650 
somewhere I haven't quite found yet but
mostly<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.140> whole<00:00:22.170> system<00:00:22.560> works<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.279> then<00:00:23.820> so

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
mostly the whole system works I then so

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.359 
mostly the whole system works I then so
this<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> seed<00:00:25.289> em<00:00:25.439> cheap<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.859> why<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.039> NT

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
this is the seed em cheap and why you NT

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.510 
this is the seed em cheap and why you NT
aversi<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.980> it's<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:31.820> some<00:00:32.820> Island<00:00:33.120> memory

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
aversi so it's just some Island memory

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.060 
aversi so it's just some Island memory
and<00:00:35.520> then<00:00:35.700> around<00:00:36.210> multiplier<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.140> there<00:00:37.920> are

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and then around multiplier and there are

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.040 
and then around multiplier and there are
prepare<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.700> minutes<00:00:38.940> not<00:00:39.180> very<00:00:39.420> motivated<00:00:39.629> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
prepare the minutes not very motivated I

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.119 
prepare the minutes not very motivated I
don't<00:00:40.230> know<00:00:40.320> what<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> longest<00:00:40.950> delay

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
don't know what the longest delay

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.790 
don't know what the longest delay
through<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.469> waitin<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
through this is so I just waitin to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.310 
through this is so I just waitin to
other<00:00:43.980> things<00:00:44.250> settle<00:00:44.579> down<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.789> minute<00:00:45.320> so

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
other things settle down a minute so

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.310 
other things settle down a minute so
we've<00:00:46.559> got<00:00:46.829> out<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.280> wires<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.780> should

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
we've got out the wires here I should

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.670 
we've got out the wires here I should
explain<00:00:49.500> why<00:00:49.710> i'm<00:00:49.800> doing<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.370> i'm<00:00:50.489> using

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
explain why i'm doing here is i'm using

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.139 
explain why i'm doing here is i'm using
the<00:00:52.680> middle<00:00:52.920> square<00:00:53.129> method<00:00:53.550> i<00:00:53.699> think<00:00:54.030> it's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
the middle square method i think it's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.479 
the middle square method i think it's
called<00:00:54.210> which<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.350> devised<00:00:55.649> by<00:00:55.649> john<00:00:56.250> von

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
called which was devised by john von

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.639 
called which was devised by john von
neumann<00:00:56.520> quite<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> long<00:00:57.539> time<00:00:57.570> ago<00:00:57.960> in

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
neumann quite a long time ago in

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.600 
neumann quite a long time ago in
computer<00:00:59.489> terms<00:01:03.379> yeah<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.460> was

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
computer terms yeah it was it was

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940 
computer terms yeah it was it was
basically<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.090> kind<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.780> know<00:01:06.840> it'll<00:01:07.799> do

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
basically a kind of you know it'll do

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.460 
basically a kind of you know it'll do
for<00:01:08.220> now<00:01:08.250> kind<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.760> thing<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:10.229> very

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
for now kind of thing so it's very

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.350 
for now kind of thing so it's very
simple<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.070> square<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:11.760> input<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
simple you just square your input and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.770 
simple you just square your input and
then<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.780> take<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.530> middle<00:01:14.010> digits<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.420> many

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
then you take the middle digits as many

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.390 
then you take the middle digits as many
as<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.990> need<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> same<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.280> I've

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
as you need to do the same so here I've

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.390 
as you need to do the same so here I've
got<00:01:17.479> 55<00:01:18.479> bit<00:01:18.720> seed<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.439> go<00:01:19.680> through<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.130> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
got 55 bit seed you go through this you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.100 
got 55 bit seed you go through this you
get<00:01:20.520> 10<00:01:20.790> bits<00:01:21.000> output<00:01:21.509> when<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> don't

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
get 10 bits output when you don't

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.810 
get 10 bits output when you don't
because<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.530> haven't<00:01:22.890> actually<00:01:23.130> finished<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
because I haven't actually finished the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600 
because I haven't actually finished the
young<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.979> haven't<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.100> finished<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
young I haven't actually finished the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.310 
young I haven't actually finished the
multiplier<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.840> don't<00:01:28.020> need<00:01:28.200> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
multiplier because you don't need to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.859 
multiplier because you don't need to
i've<00:01:28.439> only<00:01:28.619> wired<00:01:28.979> up<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> ones<00:01:29.490> which<00:01:29.909> which

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
i've only wired up the ones which which

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.140 
i've only wired up the ones which which
i'm<00:01:31.020> actually<00:01:31.200> taking<00:01:31.470> if<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.729> makes<00:01:32.939> sense

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
i'm actually taking if that makes sense

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.120 
i'm actually taking if that makes sense
i<00:01:33.420> mean<00:01:33.500> what<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.530> don't<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.799> take<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
i mean what you don't you take the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.010 
i mean what you don't you take the
middle<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.610> gonna<00:01:36.030> tell<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.329> with<00:01:36.450> middle<00:01:36.810> 5

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
middle I'm gonna tell you with middle 5

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.109 
middle I'm gonna tell you with middle 5
bits<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.890> I've<00:01:38.130> only<00:01:38.310> actually<00:01:38.670> wired<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.060> up

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
bits so I've only actually wired it up

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.330 
bits so I've only actually wired it up
to<00:01:39.360> produce<00:01:39.540> those<00:01:39.900> number<00:01:40.229> 5<00:01:40.470> bits<00:01:40.829> I've

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
to produce those number 5 bits I've

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.810 
to produce those number 5 bits I've
skipped<00:01:41.670> some<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> outputs<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.460> yeah<00:01:44.460> usually

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
skipped some the outputs so yeah usually

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.850 
skipped some the outputs so yeah usually
got<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.240> five<00:01:45.390> bits<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:45.930> which<00:01:46.380> come<00:01:46.649> back

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
got your five bits here which come back

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.160 
got your five bits here which come back
around<00:01:47.040> here<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.240> would<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.720> result

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
around here and this would be the result

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.320 
around here and this would be the result
of<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.560> iteration<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.340> then<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.820> point

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
of this iteration and then the point

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.860 
of this iteration and then the point
you<00:01:51.510> then<00:01:51.720> feed<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.860> back<00:01:53.480> around<00:01:54.480> for

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
you then feed that see back around for

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
you then feed that see back around for
the<00:01:54.960> next<00:01:54.990> iteration<00:01:55.790> get<00:01:56.790> your<00:01:56.940> next<00:01:57.210> number

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
the next iteration get your next number

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.880 
the next iteration get your next number
now<00:01:58.890> I<00:02:00.110> don't<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.290> because<00:02:01.470> of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> bug

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
now I don't know this because of the bug

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.390 
now I don't know this because of the bug
or<00:02:02.190> just<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:04.010> limitations<00:02:05.010> of

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
or just because of the limitations of

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.889 
or just because of the limitations of
having<00:02:06.120> just<00:02:07.160> five<00:02:08.160> bits<00:02:08.630> or<00:02:09.630> some<00:02:09.810> other

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
mathematical problem with it all but

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.990 
mathematical problem with it all but
these<00:02:13.020> sequences<00:02:13.680> tent<00:02:13.980> collapse<00:02:14.400> very

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
these sequences tent collapse very

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.260 
these sequences tent collapse very
quickly<00:02:15.330> into<00:02:15.840> an<00:02:16.470> infinite<00:02:16.710> loop<00:02:16.890> or<00:02:17.340> just

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
quickly into an infinite loop or just

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.880 
quickly into an infinite loop or just
having<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.690> same<00:02:18.840> number<00:02:19.230> obviously<00:02:19.680> if<00:02:19.770> you

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
having the same number obviously if you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.290 
having the same number obviously if you
feel<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.220> see<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.060> same

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
feel you see you can get the same

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.120 
feel you see you can get the same
feedback<00:02:21.690> you're<00:02:22.320> going<00:02:22.500> into<00:02:22.680> an<00:02:22.830> infinite

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
feedback you're going into an infinite

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.430 
feedback you're going into an infinite
loop<00:02:23.250> there<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.420> guess<00:02:24.690> one<00:02:24.930> solution<00:02:25.230> would

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
loop there so I guess one solution would

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.840 
loop there so I guess one solution would
be<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.590> check<00:02:25.920> if<00:02:26.070> you've<00:02:26.250> reached<00:02:26.550> one<00:02:26.820> of

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
be to check if you've reached one of

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.970 
be to check if you've reached one of
those<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.360> then<00:02:27.450> change<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.530> see<00:02:28.710> if<00:02:28.890> you

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
those and then change the see if you

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.790 
those and then change the see if you
have<00:02:29.190> but<00:02:29.610> I'm<00:02:30.170> quite<00:02:31.170> sure<00:02:31.200> how<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.560> didn't

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
have but I'm quite sure how you didn't

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.330 
have but I'm quite sure how you didn't
point<00:02:32.010> out<00:02:32.190> hand<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:33.510> yeah<00:02:33.690> obviously<00:02:34.340> it's

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
point out hand so yeah obviously it's

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.449 
point out hand so yeah obviously it's
not<00:02:35.370> great<00:02:35.670> you're<00:02:35.910> gonna<00:02:36.030> got<00:02:36.209> five<00:02:36.450> bits<00:02:37.459> you

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
not great you're gonna got five bits you

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.430 
not great you're gonna got five bits you
can<00:02:38.520> keep<00:02:38.820> doing<00:02:38.850> this<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.420> keep<00:02:39.990> getting<00:02:40.290> new

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
can keep doing this and keep getting new

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.540 
can keep doing this and keep getting new
random<00:02:40.970> numbers<00:02:41.970> until<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.540> there<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.550> think

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
random numbers until I there I think

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.980 
random numbers until I there I think
this<00:02:44.640> will<00:02:44.820> get<00:02:45.000> exactly<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.480> same<00:02:45.720> thing

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
this will get exactly the same thing

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.520 
this will get exactly the same thing
back

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.040 

ya<00:02:51.530> think<00:02:52.530> ya<00:02:53.160> own<00:02:53.640> one<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.120> these<00:02:54.300> wires<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.900> it

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
ya think ya own one of these wires in it

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.440 
ya think ya own one of these wires in it
up<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.890> think<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.250> send<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.640> will<00:02:56.790> find<00:02:57.030> same

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
up and I think I send it will find same

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.420 
up and I think I send it will find same
one<00:02:59.750> for<00:03:00.750> my<00:03:00.900> little<00:03:01.020> baby<00:03:01.260> zoo<00:03:04.100> it's<00:03:05.100> just

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
one for my little baby zoo it's just

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.729 
one for my little baby zoo it's just
gonna<00:03:05.550> keep<00:03:05.760> doing<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.180> now<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.470> say<00:03:07.709> I

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
gonna keep doing that now like I say I

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.170 
gonna keep doing that now like I say I
don't<00:03:07.920> know<00:03:08.100> that's<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:08.459> because<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
don't know that's just because of the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.180 
don't know that's just because of the
about<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.200> only<00:03:10.440> very<00:03:10.620> small<00:03:10.940> space<00:03:11.940> from

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
about the only very small space from

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.520 
about the only very small space from
different<00:03:14.190> combinations<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:16.230> just

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
different combinations just just

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.809 
different combinations just just
generally<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.010> algorithm<00:03:17.370> or<00:03:17.520> that's

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
generally the algorithm or that's

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.040 
generally the algorithm or that's
because<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.180> bug<00:03:18.330> in<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.569> multiplier

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
because of a bug in the multiplier

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.110 
because of a bug in the multiplier
that's<00:03:19.650> quite<00:03:19.950> possible<00:03:19.980> because<00:03:20.730> I've<00:03:20.940> never

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
that's quite possible because I've never

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.290 
that's quite possible because I've never
built<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.140> multiplier<00:03:22.620> for<00:03:23.030> orphan<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.120> have

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
built the multiplier for orphan I have

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.830 
built the multiplier for orphan I have
to<00:03:24.390> build<00:03:24.570> anything<00:03:24.870> quite<00:03:25.260> as<00:03:25.290> big<00:03:25.650> before<00:03:26.100> so

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
to build anything quite as big before so

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.479 
to build anything quite as big before so
it's<00:03:27.840> possible<00:03:28.019> one<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.410> these<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.890> missing<00:03:29.430> a

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
it's possible one of these is missing a

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.990 
it's possible one of these is missing a
wire<00:03:29.670> or<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.060> torch<00:03:30.810> somewhere<00:03:31.470> or<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.250> wired<00:03:32.790> up

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
wire or a torch somewhere or I wired up

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.979 
wire or a torch somewhere or I wired up
the<00:03:33.209> wrong<00:03:33.450> ah<00:03:34.280> adder<00:03:35.280> output<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.030> next

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
the wrong ah adder output to the next

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.949 
the wrong ah adder output to the next
layer<00:03:37.200> or<00:03:37.380> whatever<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:39.239> might<00:03:39.480> look<00:03:39.630> I'm<00:03:39.840> a

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
layer or whatever so I might look I'm a

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.900 
layer or whatever so I might look I'm a
real<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.500> multiplier<00:03:40.950> somewhere<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.610> see<00:03:41.819> if

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
real the multiplier somewhere and see if

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.040 
real the multiplier somewhere and see if
I<00:03:42.000> can<00:03:42.150> get<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.330> working<00:03:42.510> there<00:03:44.930> it's<00:03:45.930> about

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
I can get it working there it's about

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.009 
I can get it working there it's about
organs<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.739> say<00:03:46.920> about<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.250> for<00:03:47.489> now<00:03:47.900> in<00:03:48.900> the

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
organs to say about this for now in the

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.140 
organs to say about this for now in the
long<00:03:49.200> term<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:49.830> I<00:03:50.010> take<00:03:50.519> this<00:03:50.610> project<00:03:50.819> and

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
long term if I take this project and

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.759 
long term if I take this project and
further<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:51.600> would<00:03:51.660> just<00:03:51.810> be<00:03:51.989> too<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.290> up<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
further it would just be too I up the

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.890 
further it would just be too I up the
clock<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.489> work<00:03:53.910> out<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.150> longest<00:03:54.690> path

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.949 
clock and work out the longest path
through<00:03:55.170> this<00:03:55.320> is<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.400> can<00:03:56.959> just

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
through this is so that you can just

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.080 
through this is so that you can just
keep<00:03:58.170> generating<00:03:58.709> random<00:03:59.220> numbers<00:03:59.430> maybe<00:03:59.880> add

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
keep generating random numbers maybe add

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.670 
keep generating random numbers maybe add
some<00:04:00.120> sort<00:04:00.570> of<00:04:00.600> detection<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:01.380> case

some sort of detection for this case

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
just be a budding multiply so just

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.530 
just be a budding multiply so just
examine<00:04:29.480> is<00:04:29.720> getting<00:04:30.020> dark<00:04:30.230> so<00:04:31.420> we're<00:04:32.420> going

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
examine is getting dark so we're going

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.880 
examine is getting dark so we're going
to<00:04:32.630> value<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:33.020> i<00:04:33.050> like<00:04:33.230> to<00:04:33.410> watch<00:04:33.530> these

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
the new states it's a

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.610 
the new states it's a
like<00:04:43.450> a<00:04:43.480> really<00:04:43.750> deep<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.200> treat<00:04:44.440> Christmas
