00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.700

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.230

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.130
 but I had such a desire to buy 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.940
 a parrot 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.969
 who has or had a parrot before 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.670

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.440
 features of its content that to him 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 generally need to be like him 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.329
 take care not that I know my mom is, 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.960
 A friend who had a parrot can not 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.629
 he just sat in a cage he was given food 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.300
 here he just sat there and ate I do not remember 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.510
 let it fall around the room fly or 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.030
 no, but he constantly tweeted 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.040
 constantly what did you say for example if i 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.250
 says oleander 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.189

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.580

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.130

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.890

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.049
 Kolya roads will be fun here 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.200
 talking parrot but not for any 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.979
 there are features that have subtleties and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.110
 what do i need to know 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.049
 here's how to contain it at all 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.259
 for example , does he need 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.570
 bright room to always be light 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.820
 fresh air is not on hamsters for example 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.590
 you can not ventilate the room to cold 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.049
 air they do not like and loud sounds they 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.329
 don't like light they don't like and especially 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.149
 at night because they do not sleep at night 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.860

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.009

 google yahoo hamster hto w google i 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.120
 used google 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.350
 One site tells me that it can 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.450
 give this food 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.970
 Another site says that I can not give 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.920
 I've already done a video about it, google 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.540
 gives you different sites different forms you 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.880
 read somewhere they say one thing somewhere 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.490
 says another I want to know exactly 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.520
 a person who has experience himself 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.510
 who is watching this video now 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.430
 there is now a parrot at home in a cage 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.910
 just say yes I want exactly 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.910
 saying my cool cockroach fool 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.110
 or he he i will teach him to talk about will 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.660
 say Kolya doshirak kolyan doshirak 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.760
 who has a parrot or who it was that 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.780
 who has experience who can me everything 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.850
 tell about him 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.150
 of course I can go to the store 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.930
 dance ask well and I wonder from 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.750
 people too 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.630
 from whom to find out that is in the pet store 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.640
 for example, the seller will tell me, and he will tell me 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.220
 will consult this one but another thing 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.830
 when people write to you on the Internet themselves 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.810
 to understand something that is so, I will go to 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.330
 shop talk to the seller and of course 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.950
 I’ll find out everything there, but I’m curious to know 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.380
 you are here who is watching me who has 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.870
 or was a parrot bird or well here 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.870
 I want to say a parrot 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.980
 content features here because 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.810
 hamster well, for example, here I am in the last 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.880
 time began to sleep at night basically I 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.620
 I do not sleep at night I have rings of light 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.540
 my room is open all the time 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.820
 pane I love the cool air that 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.209
 was all the time aired and hamster in 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.400
 that's not it is not necessary here therefore in my 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.810
 he can't live in a room 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:50.220
 mom next room hamster here a 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:52.200
 the bird that she needs a parrot she can 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.930
 live me what i want or have me 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.280
 the room was here when i want there 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.110
 retire or Che, I know what it 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.600
 some dark rag 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.410
 dark fabric to him there is not 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.300
 translucent cover the cell and that's it 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.190
 otherwise I'll be there given to myself when she 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.360
 wants me for example want peace there 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.950
 quietly sit there at least a movie 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.900
 look there is something else 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.480
 and he will tell me so he is a fool 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.329
 Kolyan fool I'll cover him in short cell 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.670
 his cloth is dark and he will shut up 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.830
 or how generally in general here you are 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:30.000
 tell me guns draws want to buy 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.980
 parrot you loan harvey there and here's how 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.110
 also lets him fly around the room or 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:39.030
 Yes, I really want to 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.430
 do hamster of course fun but I 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.340
 I say as it is awkward he basically 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.470
 at night he cannot sleep bright light but 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.540
 very include because at night he knows 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.840
 that night should not be dark to him 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.660
 air loud noises there still there 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.230
 what is the parrot that you understand here 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.330
 so here 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.490
 and here I am interested in but so true 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.730
 I wanted to do it at all 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.310

 teary eyes here she is she there she is 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.180
 bags there I don’t know under the eye or there still 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.830
 which in general she is allergic to cats here 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.140
 when i was little we had a cat 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.660
 then he grew up then we got a bone 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.850

 I have to walk each time, that is, I 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.100
