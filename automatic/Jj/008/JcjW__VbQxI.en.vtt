next this is a specialty exercise so
it's<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.729> football<00:01:42.000> bar<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.570> called<00:01:42.840> this

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it's a football bar it's called this

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.319 
it's a football bar it's called this
helps<00:01:43.619> me<00:01:43.710> really<00:01:43.979> emphasize<00:01:44.520> also<00:01:44.729> my<00:01:44.970> chest

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
helps me really emphasize also my chest

helps me really emphasize also my chest
that<00:01:45.509> neutral<00:01:45.960> position<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
that neutral position as you can see the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.249 
that neutral position as you can see the
bar<00:01:47.670> position<00:01:48.090> where<00:01:48.240> I'm<00:01:48.299> holding<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> it's

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
bar position where I'm holding it it's

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.840 
bar position where I'm holding it it's
also<00:01:49.500> very<00:01:49.799> important<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.340> what's<00:01:50.520> called<00:01:50.759> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
also very important for what's called a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.149 
also very important for what's called a
straight<00:01:51.240> bar<00:01:51.750> path<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.680> could<00:01:52.829> tell<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
straight bar path as you could tell the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.190 
straight bar path as you could tell the
bar<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:53.970> incorrectly<00:01:54.180> because<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
bar if you do it incorrectly because of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.840 
bar if you do it incorrectly because of
your<00:01:55.320> hand<00:01:55.560> position<00:01:56.040> will<00:01:56.369> actually<00:01:56.610> start

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
your hand position will actually start

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.969 
your hand position will actually start
to<00:01:56.939> sort<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.450> shake<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.049> move<00:01:58.200> around<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.860> it's

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
to sort of shake and move around so it's

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.950 
to sort of shake and move around so it's
very<00:01:59.159> important<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> learn<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.360> proper

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
very important to learn that proper

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.050 
very important to learn that proper

the upper clavicle area is responsible
for<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.980> couple<00:02:32.370> different<00:02:32.790> things<00:02:32.850> right

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
for a couple different things right

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.480 
for a couple different things right
horizontal<00:02:33.840> adduction<00:02:34.470> flexion<00:02:35.280> and

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
horizontal adduction flexion and

horizontal adduction flexion and
internal<00:02:36.210> rotation<00:02:36.240> now<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.560> might<00:02:38.160> sound

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
internal rotation now that might sound

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.650 
internal rotation now that might sound
like<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.580> bunch<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.910> big<00:02:39.060> words<00:02:39.090> but

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
like a bunch of big words but

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.880 
like a bunch of big words but
essentially<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.290> are<00:02:40.380> different<00:02:40.740> ways<00:02:40.860> to

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
essentially there are different ways to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.470 
essentially there are different ways to
target<00:02:41.370> different<00:02:41.400> areas<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.090> your<00:02:42.210> chest

this<00:02:43.110> part<00:02:43.440> right<00:02:43.590> here<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:43.830> great<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.520> the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
this part right here is great for the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.180 
this part right here is great for the
upper<00:02:45.000> class<00:02:45.420> one<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.650> exact<00:02:46.920> same<00:02:47.130> thing

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
upper class one is the exact same thing

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
momentary pause at the top so if we had

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.380 
momentary pause at the top so if we had

grip<00:03:22.620> bench<00:03:22.680> press<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:23.520> is<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.820> correct

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
grip bench press this is the correct

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.120 
grip bench press this is the correct
form<00:03:24.300> whereas<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.110> could<00:03:25.230> tell<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.770> bring<00:03:26.010> it

below your chest push the bar path in a
straight<00:03:28.560> line<00:03:28.770> this<00:03:29.280> remember<00:03:30.090> because<00:03:30.390> this

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
straight line this remember because this

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.990 
straight line this remember because this
is<00:03:30.690> really<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.140> pressing<00:03:31.800> day<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.790> is

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
is really a pressing day this is

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.060 
is really a pressing day this is
actually<00:03:33.330> more<00:03:33.510> tricep<00:03:34.140> dominant<00:03:34.620> than<00:03:34.740> chest

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
actually more tricep dominant than chest

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.640 
actually more tricep dominant than chest
but<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:35.970> know<00:03:36.270> from<00:03:36.510> doing<00:03:36.660> all<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.380> prior

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650

but you know from doing all the prior
chest<00:03:38.040> movements<00:03:38.430> you'll<00:03:38.580> still<00:03:38.820> get<00:03:38.910> great

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
chest movements you'll still get great

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.270 
chest movements you'll still get great
chest<00:03:39.750> stimulation<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.770> that's<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.040> first

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
chest stimulation so that's the first

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.850 
chest stimulation so that's the first
exercise<00:03:41.490> the<00:03:42.300> second<00:03:42.720> exercise<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.350> going<00:03:43.739> to

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
exercise the second exercise is going to

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.070 
exercise the second exercise is going to
be<00:03:43.980> right<00:03:44.160> here<00:03:44.220> BAM<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.300> neutral<00:03:45.810> grip<00:03:45.900> so

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
be right here BAM the neutral grip so

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.570 
be right here BAM the neutral grip so
you<00:03:46.170> could<00:03:46.290> choose<00:03:46.500> one<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.920> two<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.340> these

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
you could choose one of two of these

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.090 
you could choose one of two of these
instead<00:03:48.450> for<00:03:48.840> your<00:03:48.959> tricep<00:03:49.500> movement<00:03:49.950> so

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
instead for your tricep movement so

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.680 
instead for your tricep movement so
instead<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.430> football<00:03:50.760> bar<00:03:50.940> now<00:03:51.270> they<00:03:51.510> do<00:03:51.660> the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
instead the football bar now they do the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.780 
instead the football bar now they do the
Close<00:03:51.989> Grip<00:03:52.020> or<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.980> neutral<00:03:53.340> grip<00:03:53.489> dumbbell

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
Close Grip or the neutral grip dumbbell

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.540 
Close Grip or the neutral grip dumbbell
press<00:03:54.270> and<00:03:54.480> for<00:03:54.750> most<00:03:54.900> individuals<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:56.459> know

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
press and for most individuals you know

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.699 
press and for most individuals you know
because<00:03:56.940> your<00:03:57.510> wrists<00:03:57.780> don't<00:03:58.440> have<00:03:58.620> the

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
because your wrists don't have the

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:59.990 
because your wrists don't have the
flexibility<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.340> have<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.550> groove<00:03:59.760> in<00:03:59.910> the

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
flexibility you have to groove in the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.550 
flexibility you have to groove in the
close<00:04:00.180> grip<00:04:00.390> bench<00:04:00.450> press<00:04:00.750> this<00:04:01.260> would<00:04:01.440> be

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
close grip bench press this would be

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.040 
close grip bench press this would be
easier<00:04:02.070> one<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.489> do<00:04:02.670> right<00:04:02.970> off<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.360> bat<00:04:03.540> so

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
easier one to do right off the bat so

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.720 
easier one to do right off the bat so
you<00:04:04.080> keep<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.500> elbows<00:04:04.860> locked<00:04:05.130> in<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.610> you

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
you keep the elbows locked in and you

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.190 
you keep the elbows locked in and you
really<00:04:06.030> flex<00:04:06.360> them<00:04:06.540> at<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.750> top<00:04:06.989> position

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
really flex them at the top position

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.160
