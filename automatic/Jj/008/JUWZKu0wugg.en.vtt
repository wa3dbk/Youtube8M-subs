00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 arms of craft here at htc in barcelona 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.029
 the battle between htc the one in the new 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.529
 and samsung with the galaxy s 6 is not 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.420
 just a fight of the design but 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.790
 of course, a fight of the processors 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.200
 and the performance we have the first one 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.179
 benchmark and now have us once 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.560
 looked at how fast that has the cdu 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.560
 man in new title 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.240
 so I have the title here 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.260
 benchmark it and make it 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.590
 Let's just get up and there you go 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.930
 the result is 58,000 times funny in 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.760
 the survey there have that synonymous normal 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.170
 which one should go on me 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.300
 actually the details if that 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.570
 that's why the values ​​are interesting 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.050
 the snapdragon 810 with three gigabytes 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.670
 tans in htc travels and who now in 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.920
 we have the galaxy together 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.510
 s 6 we have in the channel also the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.380
 anti open let it run six 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.270
 in the s6 of samsung exynos 74 20 14 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.180
 nanometer process also made 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.810
 splendid cores and yes the delight 10.000 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.489
 more points 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.930
 I 'm going to say benchmarks this 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.130
 are synthetic results that is 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.080
 not now that one of the two devices 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.180
 in everyday life necessarily much faster 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.680
 or slower but pure from 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.560
 the values ​​that now at the antique 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.360
 Samsung has come out with the s6 and 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.090
 the nose of one's own exynos processor 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.280
 in front and the snapdragon 810 so there was 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.229
 a good reason why the koreans up 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.200
 have your own processor set and 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.470
 have given the 810 a running pass htc 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.569
 installed the snapdragon 810 here in m 9 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.729
 the device is determined with this value 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:32.619
 not a slow smartphone but i say 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.850
 the sheet is already on the paper 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.929
 it's a bit behind us 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.550
 Of course, in the detailed 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.289
 tests the two of them really in 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.060
 everyday compete to play against each other 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.800
 let and then find out if it too 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.819
 really noteworthy significant 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.009
 make a difference 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.640
 should make the purchase decision 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.780
