the<00:00:00.450> difference<00:00:00.719> between<00:00:00.810> manslaughter<00:00:01.439> and

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
the difference between manslaughter and

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.720 
the difference between manslaughter and
murder<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.820> intent<00:00:03.720> that<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.859> murder<00:00:05.430> is

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
murder is a intent that a murder is

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.639 
murder is a intent that a murder is
intentional<00:00:06.480> killing<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.899> another<00:00:07.170> person

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
intentional killing of another person

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.009 
intentional killing of another person
manslaughter<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.030> unintentional

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
manslaughter is the unintentional

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.020 
manslaughter is the unintentional
killing<00:00:10.200> involuntary<00:00:10.860> manslaughter<00:00:11.759> is

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
killing involuntary manslaughter is

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.700 
killing involuntary manslaughter is
actually<00:00:12.420> kind<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.780> redundant<00:00:13.410> phrase

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
actually kind of a redundant phrase

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.709 
actually kind of a redundant phrase
because<00:00:14.460> manslaughter<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.330> always

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
because manslaughter is always

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.099 
because manslaughter is always
involuntary<00:00:16.590> she<00:00:16.980> took<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.430> sobriety<00:00:18.029> test<00:00:18.510> at

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
involuntary she took a sobriety test at

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.529 
involuntary she took a sobriety test at
the<00:00:19.350> scene<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.160> incident<00:00:20.189> past<00:00:21.000> no

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the scene of the incident past no

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.269 
the scene of the incident past no
problem<00:00:21.960> there<00:00:22.140> how<00:00:22.500> does<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.769> factor<00:00:23.039> into

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
problem there how does that factor into

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.980 
problem there how does that factor into
all<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.880> well<00:00:24.119> that's<00:00:24.300> that's<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.869> of

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
all of this well that's that's one of

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.810 
all of this well that's that's one of
the<00:00:25.050> factors<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.710> know<00:00:25.800> manslaughter<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.609> be

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the factors you know manslaughter can be

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.630 
the factors you know manslaughter can be
charged<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.510> felony<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> misdemeanor

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
charged as a felony or a misdemeanor

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.070 
charged as a felony or a misdemeanor
apparently<00:00:29.640> only<00:00:29.880> misdemeanor<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.840> under

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
apparently only misdemeanor is under

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.780 
apparently only misdemeanor is under
consideration<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:32.099> which<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.610> can

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
consideration here which you can

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.290 
consideration here which you can
understand<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:33.600> there<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.620> no<00:00:34.980> issue<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.059> drunk

understand if there is no issue of drunk
driving<00:00:36.570> there's<00:00:37.110> no<00:00:37.230> issue<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.770> over

driving there's no issue of going over

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.950 
driving there's no issue of going over
the<00:00:38.100> speed<00:00:38.309> limit<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:39.000> still<00:00:39.329> behave<00:00:39.690> in

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the speed limit you can still behave in

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.650 
the speed limit you can still behave in
a<00:00:40.110> reckless<00:00:40.379> way<00:00:40.860> without<00:00:41.520> being<00:00:42.149> drunk<00:00:42.329> or

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
a reckless way without being drunk or

a reckless way without being drunk or
without<00:00:42.930> going<00:00:43.710> over<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> speed<00:00:44.309> limit<00:00:44.370> you

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
without going over the speed limit you

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.910 
without going over the speed limit you
can<00:00:44.879> change<00:00:45.149> lanes<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.750> reckless<00:00:45.960> way<00:00:46.320> but

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
can change lanes in a reckless way but

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.119 
can change lanes in a reckless way but
that<00:00:47.160> leads<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.450> usually<00:00:49.200> lesser<00:00:49.620> charges

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that leads to usually lesser charges

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
that leads to usually lesser charges
than<00:00:50.789> say<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> drunk<00:00:51.629> driving<00:00:51.930> homicide<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
than say a drunk driving homicide and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.709 
than say a drunk driving homicide and
the<00:00:52.770> fact<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.160> she<00:00:53.399> was<00:00:53.550> driving<00:00:53.850> under<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the fact that she was driving under the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.709 
the fact that she was driving under the
posted<00:00:55.350> speed<00:00:55.500> limit<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.460> above<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.480> was

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
posted speed limit but above what was

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.650 
posted speed limit but above what was
regarded<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:59.370> an<00:00:59.579> unsafe<00:01:00.000> speed<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
regarded as as an unsafe speed for the

regarded as as an unsafe speed for the
road<00:01:00.930> conditions<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.129> time<00:01:02.340> how<00:01:02.520> does

road conditions at the time how does

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
road conditions at the time how does
that<00:01:02.789> play<00:01:03.000> into<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.420> well<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.290> would

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that play into this well that that would

that play into this well that that would
is<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> factors<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.420> almost

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
is one of the factors that is almost

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.530 
is one of the factors that is almost
certainly<00:01:07.020> leading<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.240> misdemeanor<00:01:09.240> rather

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
certainly leading the misdemeanor rather

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.359 
certainly leading the misdemeanor rather
than<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> felony<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.500> under<00:01:10.799> consideration

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
than a felony to be under consideration

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.210 
than a felony to be under consideration
the<00:01:12.030> fact<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:13.080> apparently<00:01:13.950> an

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the fact that this was not apparently an

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.789 
the fact that this was not apparently an
outrageously<00:01:15.090> bad<00:01:15.420> piece<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> driving<00:01:16.470> by

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
outrageously bad piece of driving by

outrageously bad piece of driving by
Caitlyn<00:01:17.310> Jenner<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:17.990> something<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.259> could

Caitlyn Jenner but something that could

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
