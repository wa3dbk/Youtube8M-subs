00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello people the injury explains the strongest hello 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.350
 and I have fans it has been defeated we have a lot of stuff 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.619
 to give away once for food 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.219
 arranged for you 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.720
 and we just tell you what the stuff is 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.759
 there must be 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.749
 as you know Sunday after the break also this time the band was cut I look 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:22.669
 have still saved 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.560
 every we have the veb the pet cap percent 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.579
 at the signature in the pile what is it once again 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.280
 say as far as martial science is concerned, we are going to have it too 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.499
 there is still room to think about it is we put the signatures there too 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:39.540
 at 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.720
 then it is absolutely true we have that point you have no question I already have 4 this year 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.040
 if it's those shirts for you and therefore the first hours after placing five 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.110
 sawing falls 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.280
 we were a couple stacking everything on top we give 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.900
 completely correct 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.440
 and we can just go 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.750
 when giving but what do you have to do for that after setting up in the responses 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.410
 first thing you would prefer not not to say everything because it 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.580
 haag anp nec 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.440
 I do not understand I will not do so I have won everything 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.670
 when put first just what you want the light alderman out of draw 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.680
 otherwise it would have had real news 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.840
 we have Tuesday this week you know what you choose, even if I say so 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.560
 not bed 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.370
 Yes would opt for something else because then the first opportunity the artwork offers 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.460
 preserve 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.790
 m what you have to do for that is below a response to the subject said 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.920
 whatever you want you should turn it off anyway but i did on this channel too 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.610
 to support 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.040
 because the first you have to have surgery on vincent experts and that makes it wetzel 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.050
 nature 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.040
 of course, again I think I am not quite right that the same applies 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.260
 but I'm just watching you 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.430
 subscribe to that wetzel 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.350
 because if you guys i'm just above the cameras i'm not going to cuba if you m 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.540
 if you 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.760
 my response was also put down to that same response, also assistance 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.330
 more than that also applies to viewers starting at the court how they are 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.979
 front and not vote if you drop more than once then it is 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.319
 so actually take over 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.239
 there are skype to the bible last Thursday said i put it together 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.989
 then you will call in person 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.589
 the winner of popstars 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.659
 make sure you score points online next Thursday 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:24.959
 and then count di rupo 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.920
 and the board also yes she is between private messages 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.469
 celtic 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.569
 you have attended the late hours I am told who has 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.489
 eventually won on the channel itself it would be cool if you too 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.129
 send photos to us with what you won if you say so 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.540
 Yes 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.540
 7 and that it is really fat 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.629
 I say give green roofs 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.419
 responses and paul for nerds can be answered fifi on demand on all entries 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:54.399
 fit for italy 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:55.899
 before that dio 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.759
 the subjects 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:02.669
 nadal it was really just also have to follow our twitter accounts for years 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.869
 if you send on twitter again you must also send it once and 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:11.439
 at least once on twitter and follow me and therefore follow terms 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.569
 and link to both of us and put videos on both of us once 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.629
 if you do more than once then it will gain some respect 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.129
 these are going to be the problems 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.950
 chance is high 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.830
 ten times as much was just everything performed on tomecak and so there was raf 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.109
 the watching 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.579
 Yes that was it 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.099
 how does this segment sense channel work if you don't have an entire band on it soon 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.429
 week after that she still has to go through the church 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:41.599
 get there 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.069
 it is the intention 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.370
 look very carefully the description at all sentences all links all channels but 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.459
 I got going after the start and they had subscribers to the 10 lists by the way 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.849
 just tried to make a parody before that because we got it 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.949
 parking also made in one day 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.289
 that's how quickly they acted 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:59.089
 you know that 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.649
 tactus i say check it out no view on the video names to exit 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:04.089
 let plan look ahead for once
