00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.750
 how to install a vegetable garden level 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.790
 difficulties a hammer install a 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.530
 vegetable garden in his garden is within reach 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.809
 of all with a little bit of time and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.789
 of organization the harvests will be at 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.340
 meet you and you will taste your 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.430
 own vegetables you will need to 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:29.820
 some planks of fertilizer plans from 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:32.759
 mulch equip yourself with a spade of a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.000
 rake a fork spade a watering can 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.489
 of a wheelbarrow of a plant of a 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.079
 hoe of a greenhouse whipping a 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.079
 tiller and a string 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.590
 before was chosen this is a place 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.080
 sunny sheltered from the prevailing winds 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.200
 is far from the shade of the trees of the walls 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.500
 if you have a wall facing south it's 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.450
 the ideal limit of your future vegetable garden 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.340
 to make the best use of space and 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.100
 especially to access anywhere without effort 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.860
 adopt the very classic layout in 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.230
 quarters and structure the space in four 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.630
 equal parts for example of four 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.400
 square one meter twenty -two side aisle 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.010
 central crossing at the center 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.510
 will easily circulate 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.369
 shift principle and facilitates the 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.350
 crop rotation a year on 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.450
 the other to avoid having the same type 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.640
 of plants on a plot of a year 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.300
 on the other with a return to the same 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.820
 place after four years 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.740
 it's dead dial for culture point 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.670
 water for watering should not be 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.680
 too far 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.630
 If possible, plan at least one 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.560
 of water in the center to avoid 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.570
 lengths of pipes 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.690
 everything will be purged for the winter as he 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.090
 Why should you pay for tap water? 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.250
 for your watering while just 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.170
 recover rainwater a tank 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.440
 plugged into the gutter and the turn is 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.360
 play 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.700
 if the slope is too low for 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:02.180
 bring it to the kitchen garden a pump will be the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:05.360
 sphere weeding the soil as soon as the end of 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.670
 summer raking to scratch the ground and 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.850
 remove the maximum then return the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.710
 land with spade or with a tiller 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.060
 let stand two weeks time 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.820
 that weed seeds 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.430
 raises again kidnapped then his young 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.350
 shoots to the hoe then rake for 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.990
 remy was the land and remove the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.760
 pebbles according to the species the seedlings 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.910
 vegetable gardens have needs more or less 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.310
 important nutrients sponge 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.200
 compost or fertilizer on the floor and 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.120
 scratched the surface 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.370
 analyzing a sample of soil you 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.910
 will provide useful guidance for your 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.910
 future plantations 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.489
 if they have different needs one 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.989
 others than vegetables with 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.630
 common points can be associated in 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.910
 the same plot for example vegetables 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.910
 fruits or bulbs such as tomatoes 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.239
 eggplant peppers zucchini fennel 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.030
 garlic onions or shallots may occupy 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.160
 the plot 1 while next we can 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.180
 find vegetables leaves salads 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.860
 spinach watercress or mash avoid sowing 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.660
 or plants and all your vegetables in one 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.060
 only once to avoid having to 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.170
 eat all at the same time 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.810
 staggered over time to create a 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.120
 shift production and enjoy 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.860
 Longer 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.810
 the gap between two shots on the same 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.900
 line of culture and between two rows 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.000
 and defined for each vegetable for example 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.700
 the cabbages after a pralinage will be 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.519
 transplanted interval of 40 cm and the 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.900
 tidy away from the same distance for 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.020
 leeks it is necessary to realize 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.810
 dressing for that cut the roots 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.410
 and remove one-third of the length of 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.360
 leaves 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.460
 let the leeks soak for a 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.440
 quarter of an hour in the bucket having put 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.140
 a bleach cap per liter of water 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.970
 after preparing your pitch place 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.880
 your body of water and using the 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.400
 hogwash traced a furrow with a 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:04.319
 dibbler dug a hole every 10 or 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:06.840
 15 cm and 15 cm deep planted 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.620
 fill up and water abundantly with 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.319
 the watering can with its apple 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.690
 another example for salads on a 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.479
 land previously enriched with compost 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.549
 place your body of water choose 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.340
 most vigorous shots and cut a 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.400
 third of the leaves makes a hole with 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.850
 your dibble every 30 cm lines 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.919
 will be spaced 40 cm apart place your 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.830
 salad plants taking care of 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.470
 to put the collar will have earth is 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.990
 to say the junction leaves to avoid 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.289
 the rotting realize a second hole 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.600
 to 2 cm by tilting the dibble towards the 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:48.610
 seedlings this will allow the roots 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.610
 to be in touch with the land 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.020
 you just have to water 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:54.020
 profusely 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.400
 the maintenance work promotes the 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.460
 culture because soil nutrients 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.050
 benefits your plantation soils 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.570
 regularly hoe the earth leaves 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.190
 better penetrate the water by capillarity 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.960
 to keep the earth's moisture in 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.780
 summer and its heat in winter 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.180
 leverage mulching in time 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.430
 decomposing it will turn into humus 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.320
 for a few minutes past of time 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.270
 in time in your garden you go 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.110
 taste the pleasure of eating your own 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.800
 production 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.060
 a universe of flavors in perspective a 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:33.550
