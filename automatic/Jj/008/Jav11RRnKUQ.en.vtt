flecks like we used to do in the bad old

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.950 
flecks like we used to do in the bad old
days<00:00:23.060> you<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.240> use<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.949> borax<00:00:25.949> cone<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.960> a

fairly rough ceramic dish if you decide
to<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:34.290> water<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.980> want<00:00:35.190> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
to do this the water that you want to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.670 
to do this the water that you want to
use<00:00:37.010> is<00:00:38.180> distilled<00:00:39.180> water<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.290> get<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.559> at

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
use is distilled water you can get it at

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.000 
use is distilled water you can get it at
most<00:00:40.860> supermarkets<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.290> just<00:00:43.290> put<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
most supermarkets and you just put the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
most supermarkets and you just put the
smallest<00:00:44.480> amount

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.979 

on<00:00:52.090> your<00:00:52.990> ceramic<00:00:53.890> dish<00:00:54.130> and<00:00:55.030> then<00:00:55.540> you<00:00:57.989> just

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
on your ceramic dish and then you just

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:07.740 
on your ceramic dish and then you just
grind<00:01:04.950> your<00:01:05.950> Covenant<00:01:06.610> until<00:01:07.120> you<00:01:07.300> have<00:01:07.510> a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
grind your Covenant until you have a

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:16.330 
grind your Covenant until you have a
young<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:09.600> light<00:01:10.600> paste

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.340 

I<00:01:20.590> have<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.649> little<00:01:21.860> too<00:01:22.040> much<00:01:22.220> water<00:01:22.490> here<00:01:22.790> but

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
I have a little too much water here but

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.359 
I have a little too much water here but
that's<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.710> idea<00:01:25.390> that<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.509> can<00:01:26.689> see<00:01:26.869> this<00:01:27.079> is

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
that's the idea that you can see this is

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.090 
that's the idea that you can see this is
kind<00:01:28.369> of<00:01:28.430> a<00:01:28.549> milky<00:01:31.330> color<00:01:32.679> that's<00:01:33.679> all<00:01:33.920> you

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
kind of a milky color that's all you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.230 
kind of a milky color that's all you
need<00:01:34.929> now<00:01:35.929> I<00:01:36.310> would<00:01:37.310> suggest<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.880> do<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.060> little

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
need now I would suggest you do a little

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.810 
need now I would suggest you do a little
test<00:01:38.600> there's<00:01:39.259> also<00:01:39.560> this<00:01:39.950> what<00:01:40.280> they<00:01:40.399> call<00:01:40.429> a

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
test there's also this what they call a

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.130 
test there's also this what they call a
you<00:01:41.299> flux<00:01:41.780> which<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:42.500> mostly<00:01:43.009> for<00:01:43.280> gold<00:01:44.110> take<00:01:45.110> a

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
you flux which is mostly for gold take a

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.240 
you flux which is mostly for gold take a
piece<00:01:45.439> of<00:01:45.619> copper<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:49.840> put<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:51.110> small<00:01:51.860> drop<00:01:52.220> of

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
piece of copper and put a small drop of

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.940 
piece of copper and put a small drop of
the<00:01:52.610> flux<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:53.330> want<00:01:53.539> to<00:01:53.659> use<00:01:53.899> so<00:01:54.830> I'm

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
the flux that you want to use so I'm

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.419 
the flux that you want to use so I'm
putting<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.399> youth<00:01:55.640> flux<00:01:55.970> there<00:01:59.439> and<00:02:00.439> then<00:02:01.280> I'm

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
putting a youth flux there and then I'm

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.240 
putting a youth flux there and then I'm
going<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.729> take<00:02:02.349> some<00:02:03.349> of<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.590> flux<00:02:03.860> that<00:02:04.130> I

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
going to take some of the flux that I

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:12.350 
going to take some of the flux that I
mixed<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:04.909> put<00:02:05.569> it<00:02:05.689> in<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.899> middle

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.260 

and<00:02:12.900> then<00:02:13.170> I'm<00:02:14.130> going<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.520> take<00:02:14.820> some<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.120> the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
and then I'm going to take some of the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:24.870 
and then I'm going to take some of the
pre-mixed<00:02:15.800> flux<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.450> I'll<00:02:18.630> put<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.560> over<00:02:19.680> here

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.240 

now<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.390> only<00:02:26.570> reason<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.230> use<00:02:27.500> flex<00:02:27.920> is

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
now the only reason that you use flex is

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.780 
now the only reason that you use flex is
to<00:02:28.700> keep<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.180> middle<00:02:29.360> clean<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
to keep the middle clean so that the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.510 
to keep the middle clean so that the
solder<00:02:32.170> can<00:02:33.170> penetrate<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:34.100> middle<00:02:34.370> that

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
solder can penetrate the middle that

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.990 
solder can penetrate the middle that
you're<00:02:34.670> trying<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.060> solder<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:37.670> what<00:02:37.820> we're

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
you're trying to solder so what we're

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.430 
you're trying to solder so what we're
going<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.270> do<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:39.410> heat<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:40.100> up<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:42.260> that

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
going to do is just heat this up so that

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440 
going to do is just heat this up so that
you<00:02:42.560> can<00:02:42.710> see<00:02:43.010> what<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.490> Flex<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:44.000> supposed<00:02:44.390> to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
you can see what the Flex is supposed to

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.090 
you can see what the Flex is supposed to
look<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:47.500> neutral<00:02:48.500> plane<00:02:50.200> I'll<00:02:51.200> zoom<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.800> so

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
look like neutral plane I'll zoom in so

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.740 
look like neutral plane I'll zoom in so
that<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.400> can<00:02:52.550> see<00:02:56.230> now<00:02:57.230> as<00:02:58.480> you're<00:02:59.480> heating

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
that you can see now as you're heating

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.700 
that you can see now as you're heating
your<00:02:59.960> metal<00:03:00.470> up<00:03:01.540> what<00:03:02.540> will<00:03:02.660> happen<00:03:03.020> is<00:03:03.260> it

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
your metal up what will happen is it

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.150 
your metal up what will happen is it
will<00:03:04.010> start<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.580> oxidize<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:08.500> if<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.860> flux

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
will start to oxidize and if the flux

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.240 
will start to oxidize and if the flux
that<00:03:10.460> you<00:03:10.700> using<00:03:11.210> works<00:03:11.480> correctly<00:03:12.250> you'll

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
that you using works correctly you'll

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.690 
that you using works correctly you'll
end<00:03:13.430> up<00:03:13.580> with<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.820> nice<00:03:14.120> clean<00:03:15.280> patch<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.610> metal

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
end up with a nice clean patch of metal

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.980 
end up with a nice clean patch of metal
to<00:03:19.700> work<00:03:19.910> on<00:03:21.460> now<00:03:22.490> sorry<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.570> metal<00:03:23.870> is

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
to work on now sorry the metal is

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.570 
to work on now sorry the metal is
oxidizing<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:26.380> what<00:03:27.380> what<00:03:27.680> will<00:03:27.920> happen<00:03:28.400> is

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
oxidizing and what what will happen is

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.230 
oxidizing and what what will happen is
if<00:03:28.880> you're<00:03:29.120> trying<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.510> solder<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.940> flux

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
if you're trying to solder and the flux

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.510 
if you're trying to solder and the flux
doesn't<00:03:32.810> keep<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.290> middle<00:03:33.470> clean<00:03:33.860> it<00:03:34.100> lets<00:03:34.340> it

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
doesn't keep the middle clean it lets it

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:46.820 
doesn't keep the middle clean it lets it
oxidize<00:03:35.290> then<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:37.220> solder<00:03:37.520> will<00:03:37.670> never<00:03:38.060> glow

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.860 

so<00:03:47.830> you<00:03:47.950> can<00:03:48.159> see<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.970> all<00:03:49.120> three<00:03:49.540> of<00:03:49.690> these

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
so you can see that all three of these

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.800 
so you can see that all three of these
are<00:03:50.440> fairly<00:03:50.860> clean<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.849> commercial<00:03:52.390> mixture

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
are fairly clean the commercial mixture

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.800 
are fairly clean the commercial mixture
is<00:03:52.959> clean<00:03:53.409> the<00:03:53.650> cleanest<00:03:54.190> but<00:03:55.120> it<00:03:55.330> has<00:03:55.540> the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
is clean the cleanest but it has the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.420 
is clean the cleanest but it has the
most<00:03:57.120> residue<00:03:58.120> limit<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.860> this<00:04:00.040> was<00:04:00.280> designed

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
most residue limit so this was designed

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.119 
most residue limit so this was designed
for<00:04:00.909> gold<00:04:01.150> because<00:04:01.690> gold<00:04:01.720> doesn't<00:04:02.379> oxidize<00:04:02.530> as

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
for gold because gold doesn't oxidize as

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.899 
for gold because gold doesn't oxidize as
much<00:04:03.370> as<00:04:03.579> silver<00:04:03.849> brass<00:04:04.690> or<00:04:04.989> copper<00:04:05.849> this<00:04:06.849> is

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
much as silver brass or copper this is

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.539 
much as silver brass or copper this is
the<00:04:07.269> part<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:07.810> mixed<00:04:08.230> with<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.920> column<00:04:09.310> so

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
the part that I mixed with the column so

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.360 
the part that I mixed with the column so
it's<00:04:09.700> still<00:04:09.970> fairly<00:04:10.299> effective<00:04:11.019> but<00:04:12.010> the

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
it's still fairly effective but the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.660 
it's still fairly effective but the
pre-mixed<00:04:12.819> with<00:04:13.090> borax<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:14.019> boric<00:04:14.980> acid<00:04:15.159> is

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
pre-mixed with borax and boric acid is

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.129 
pre-mixed with borax and boric acid is
the<00:04:15.849> best<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:19.209> all<00:04:20.019> works<00:04:20.440> well<00:04:20.799> up<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.910> point

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
the best it all works well up to a point

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.990 
the best it all works well up to a point
now<00:04:23.139> if<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.620> were<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.830> keep<00:04:24.130> heating<00:04:24.400> this<00:04:24.699> what

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
now if I were to keep heating this what

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.219 
now if I were to keep heating this what
would<00:04:25.150> happen<00:04:25.510> is<00:04:25.750> this<00:04:27.449> where<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.660> Flex<00:04:28.960> is

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
would happen is this where the Flex is

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.920 
would happen is this where the Flex is
would<00:04:29.680> eventually<00:04:30.280> turn<00:04:30.910> black<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.330> once<00:04:31.750> it

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
would eventually turn black and once it

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.350 
would eventually turn black and once it
turns<00:04:32.199> black<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:33.370> flux<00:04:33.699> is<00:04:33.910> no<00:04:34.090> longer

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
turns black the flux is no longer

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.529 
turns black the flux is no longer
effective<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:35.830> would<00:04:36.010> need<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.460> stop<00:04:36.820> quench

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
effective you would need to stop quench

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.879 
effective you would need to stop quench
pickle<00:04:38.940> flux<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:40.150> again<00:04:40.449> and<00:04:40.750> start<00:04:41.199> again<00:04:41.350> so

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
pickle flux it again and start again so

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.040 
pickle flux it again and start again so
any<00:04:42.130> time<00:04:42.400> you're<00:04:42.580> working<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.690> shoulder
