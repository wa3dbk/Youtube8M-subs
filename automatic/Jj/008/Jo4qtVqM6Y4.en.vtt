00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.850 
the back ends also the first rule is you
need<00:00:53.089> to<00:00:53.120> run<00:00:53.570> them<00:00:53.780> if<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:54.500> hit<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.710> ball

need to run them if you hit the ball
right<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.100> him<00:00:55.460> they're<00:00:56.329> gonna<00:00:56.449> hit<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.690> really

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
right to him they're gonna hit it really

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.189 
right to him they're gonna hit it really
wrong<00:00:57.079> I<00:00:57.489> mean<00:00:58.489> it<00:00:58.760> hitches<00:00:59.030> on<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.210> rise<00:00:59.420> it's

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
wrong I mean it hitches on the rise it's

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.720 
wrong I mean it hitches on the rise it's
a<00:01:00.350> great<00:01:00.530> shot<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:01.010> two<00:01:01.129> hands<00:01:01.339> give<00:01:01.489> you<00:01:01.579> more

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
a great shot the two hands give you more

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.950 
a great shot the two hands give you more
stability<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.210> they're<00:01:02.479> they're<00:01:02.750> used<00:01:02.899> to

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
stability so they're they're used to

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.020 
stability so they're they're used to
getting<00:01:03.049> shots<00:01:03.350> on<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.530> rise<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.070> it's<00:01:04.820> hard

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
getting shots on the rise and it's hard

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.310 
getting shots on the rise and it's hard
to<00:01:05.119> read<00:01:05.330> when<00:01:05.600> he<00:01:05.630> gets<00:01:05.899> the<00:01:05.990> shot<00:01:06.170> on<00:01:06.229> the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
to read when he gets the shot on the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.499 
to read when he gets the shot on the
rise<00:01:06.470> because<00:01:06.740> it's<00:01:07.100> such<00:01:07.549> a<00:01:07.580> short<00:01:07.670> motion

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
rise because it's such a short motion

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.889 
rise because it's such a short motion
but<00:01:09.500> if<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:09.710> run<00:01:09.979> them<00:01:10.479> then<00:01:11.479> they're<00:01:11.750> in

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
but if you run them then they're in

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:12.719 
but if you run them then they're in
trouble

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
trouble

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.100

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
he's in doubles Aaliyah's there's so

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.210 
he's in doubles Aaliyah's there's so
much<00:01:16.549> court<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:16.970> cover<00:01:17.590> he<00:01:18.590> hits<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.800> shiny<00:01:19.009> runs

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
much court to cover he hits a shiny runs

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.399 
much court to cover he hits a shiny runs
past<00:01:19.429> it<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:19.880> then<00:01:20.630> once<00:01:20.929> he<00:01:20.990> goes<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.229> one

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
hand and hits a slice and he can easily

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.350 
hand and hits a slice and he can easily
tell<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.470> me<00:01:24.619> a<00:01:24.649> slice<00:01:24.950> then<00:01:25.819> you<00:01:26.030> have<00:01:26.210> the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
tell it to me a slice then you have the

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.639 
tell it to me a slice then you have the
option<00:01:26.509> is<00:01:26.780> really<00:01:26.899> to<00:01:27.050> control<00:01:27.319> the<00:01:27.409> point

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
option is really to control the point

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.399 
option is really to control the point
and<00:01:28.640> once<00:01:29.479> you<00:01:29.630> start<00:01:29.929> taking<00:01:30.020> control<00:01:30.259> the

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
and once you start taking control the

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.690 
and once you start taking control the
point<00:01:30.649> in<00:01:30.800> stretching<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.159> corn<00:01:31.369> corner

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
point in stretching the corn corner

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.219 
point in stretching the corn corner
they're<00:01:31.880> really<00:01:32.090> screwed<00:01:32.390> but<00:01:33.020> if<00:01:33.080> you<00:01:33.140> go

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
they're really screwed but if you go

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.180 
they're really screwed but if you go
right<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.560> them<00:01:33.679> again<00:01:33.860> on<00:01:34.069> the<00:01:34.190> return<00:01:34.490> solid

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
right to them again on the return solid

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.620 
right to them again on the return solid
right<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.340> him<00:01:37.520> solid<00:01:40.330> anything<00:01:41.330> on<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.450> rise

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
right to him solid anything on the rise

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.719 
right to him solid anything on the rise
is<00:01:41.840> easy<00:01:42.140> for<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.649> 200<00:01:43.009> forehand<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.580> in<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
is easy for the 200 forehand to in the

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.469 
is easy for the 200 forehand to in the
back<00:01:43.880> end<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:46.580> key<00:01:46.789> is<00:01:46.940> you<00:01:46.970> need<00:01:47.149> to<00:01:47.179> stretch

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
back end the key is you need to stretch

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.039 
back end the key is you need to stretch
them<00:01:47.659> out

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
them out

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.160 
them out
don't<00:01:48.440> go<00:01:48.500> body<00:01:48.740> on<00:01:48.979> them<00:01:49.130> go<00:01:49.340> wide<00:01:49.959> get<00:01:50.959> to<00:01:51.050> go

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
don't go body on them go wide get to go

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.479 
don't go body on them go wide get to go
to<00:01:51.229> one<00:01:51.530> hand<00:01:51.800> because<00:01:51.890> once<00:01:52.099> it<00:01:52.160> go<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.340> one

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:52.489 
to one hand because once it go to one

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:54.609 
to one hand because once it go to one
hand<00:01:52.759> there's<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.869> reason<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.170> hit<00:01:54.289> two<00:01:54.410> hands

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
hand there's a reason to hit two hands

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.320 
hand there's a reason to hit two hands
it's<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.039> bear<00:01:55.190> shot<00:01:55.429> for<00:01:55.550> him<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.060> once<00:01:56.209> it<00:01:56.270> goes

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
it's a bear shot for him so once it goes

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.270 
it's a bear shot for him so once it goes
one<00:01:56.509> hand<00:01:56.750> it's<00:01:56.929> all<00:01:57.170> or<00:01:57.319> nothing<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:57.770> the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
one hand it's all or nothing and the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.740 
one hand it's all or nothing and the
odds<00:01:58.429> are<00:01:58.580> they<00:01:58.700> haven't<00:01:58.879> hit<00:01:59.000> good<00:01:59.119> shot<00:02:01.750> so

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
odds are they haven't hit good shot so

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.919 
odds are they haven't hit good shot so
in<00:02:02.840> your<00:02:02.929> service<00:02:03.229> power<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:03.530> go<00:02:03.619> wide

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
in your service power and go wide

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.969 
in your service power and go wide
another<00:02:05.929> thing<00:02:06.080> is<00:02:06.200> they<00:02:06.349> come<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:06.739> on<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
another thing is they come in on the

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.490 
another thing is they come in on the
CGHUB<00:02:07.340> see<00:02:07.789> he's<00:02:08.390> asked<00:02:08.720> hit<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.080> ball<00:02:09.259> on<00:02:09.410> the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
CGHUB see he's asked hit the ball on the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.589 
CGHUB see he's asked hit the ball on the
rise<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.220> he<00:02:10.280> has<00:02:10.369> come<00:02:10.610> in<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.819> get<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.270> return

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
rise so he has come in to get the return

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.570 
rise so he has come in to get the return
by<00:02:12.290> coming<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.770> give<00:02:12.920> up<00:02:13.010> court<00:02:13.250> coverage

by coming and you give up court coverage

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.630 
by coming and you give up court coverage
and<00:02:14.560> then<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.650> go<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.980> other<00:02:16.040> side<00:02:16.310> he's

and then you go to the other side he's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.580 
and then you go to the other side he's
doing<00:02:16.879> okay<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:20.720> once<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.019> stretch<00:02:21.290> him<00:02:21.500> and
