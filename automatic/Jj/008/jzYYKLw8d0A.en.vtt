00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.940
 this video will show you how 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.770
 avoid a garbage stitch error that 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.340
 we are left with stitches 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.889
 too general a year and this 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.240
 mistake happens when we start ranking 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:22.039
 next I identify with the colors I 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.680
 left there two blue miles to knit 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.720
 and I have a pink son to do the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.750
 news a new mesh gets 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.320
 reassure the guilds right 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.719
 I finish going there so with my blues 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.870
 I make a pink mesh with the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.940
 blue tide and the thread through the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:51.090
 blue mesh and pink yarn I manufacture 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 a pink mesh I check 3 6 9 10 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.250
 miles that fits well with what I have 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:04.710
 mounted here that's where I'm going to turn and 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.330
 that's where it's happening among other things 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.680
 first loose the thread to leave it 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.210
 hang it hangs behind where he was 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.970
 and after I turn then I turn my 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.830
 little needle there by cons we import 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 like that or well in that sense this 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.790
 is not the problem the right thing 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.220
 especially watch out is that this son there 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:33.119
 remains to wait on that side of the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.770
 side where he is and now I'm going 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.210
 continue in knit places like 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.290
 meshes place the net behind it 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.880
 have to play to make it 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.070
 pass behind my needle and well I 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.380
 make sure that always story they 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.030
 lay below needle does it 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.939
 always under the referral and I 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.070
 do not do it by keeping it well drunk 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.340
 needles here it is passed behind 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.340
 drunk and him 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:07.100
 what not to do there is that 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.580
 not pass the thread over ever 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:19.260
 because I end up with u2 pseudo 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:26.900
 my blue instead of a pink mesh 3 6 9 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:34.770
 10 11 second way to make the mistake 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:37.890
 that's when I finish the rank of not 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.520
 to place like that and turn in 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.050
 keeping the wire on top I keep on 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.790
 file at the top I turn and it's not 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.959
 good 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.120
 when I'm doing the same thing again 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.910
 I pull the blue mesh that shows me 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.490
 his legs today to have a 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.870
 bullous mesh underneath that shows me 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.260
 his head and a pink mesh has it so what 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.850
 which is important is that the son 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:11.330
 always be under the pointed and I 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.330
 redo the maneuver under the referrals 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.290
 under the pointed
