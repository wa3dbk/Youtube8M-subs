00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 or the girls and guys how are you 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.710
 welcome to a special video for 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.910
 dance today we are going to talk about the color of 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.910
 season that color came 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.360
 ah 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.820
 The first thing that came up is that you want a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.340
 monochrome look is to say that you use the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 wine color as the total basis of the look no 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 the only thing so you can use or play 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.980
 with different tones inside the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.320
 color wine as you see a jersey chosen 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.629
 openwork in maroon pants 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.160
 short skin also garnet and 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.809
 sandals and the bag that is to say the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.420
 accessories also in garnet color without 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.610
 But they are not great and they are equal 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.410
 small nuances with which remains a 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.329
 look pretty colorful in this look 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.579
 I also tried to mix textures like 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.920
 You see mixed leather with fabric like 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.930
 it can be from a jersey a before that is 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.520
 you can play also within the same 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.800
 monochrome tone that we are saying 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.420
 play with different materials to 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.420
 create different textures in the look 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.750
 Y 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.130
 to take the dye during the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.320
 night I suggest that the company is 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.240
 color black and golden color as you see in 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.579
 this case chosen a leather jacket 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.070
 with golden tacks to give it a 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.929
 touch more rocker a tiny bag of 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.970
 golden can also to give them the touch 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.890
 with a little harder shoes 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.189
 back with and some skinny pants 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.189
 black 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.360
 and I suggest third parties that you mix the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.760
 Wine color with colors that have more 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.590
 strength can already be fluorine or tonalities 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.330
 colors that have more light as per 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.250
 example the orange color of the bag that 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.250
 I wear the mustard color of the shoes 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.500
 and a little more I have left to tell you 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.060
 only that you animate with the color 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.590
 guarantor you are going to see how many 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.970
 possibilities and that will continue to repeat 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.420
 beautiful this autumn-winter until the 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.420
 next
