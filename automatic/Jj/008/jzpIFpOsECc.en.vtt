00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
progress it remained to be seen but I

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:08.949 
progress it remained to be seen but I
think<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.119> play<00:02:08.330> of<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.539> Lakers<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:08.929> the

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
physicality and he can be a little

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.229 
physicality and he can be a little
waiting<00:02:15.140> room<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.280> little<00:02:16.549> bit<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:17.030> lil

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239

he<00:02:17.840> can<00:02:17.989> be<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.170> little<00:02:18.319> wayward<00:02:18.620> with<00:02:19.010> some<00:02:19.220> of

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
he can be a little wayward with some of

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.699 
he can be a little wayward with some of
his<00:02:19.430> decisions<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:20.510> typically<00:02:20.900> he<00:02:21.110> overcomes

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
his decisions but typically he overcomes

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.039 
his decisions but typically he overcomes
that<00:02:22.040> with<00:02:22.730> his<00:02:22.940> effort<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.450> his<00:02:23.569> tenacity

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
that with his effort and his tenacity

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.020 
that with his effort and his tenacity
and<00:02:24.530> his<00:02:24.799> versatility<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.519> think<00:02:25.849> at<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
and his versatility I think at the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.699 
and his versatility I think at the
defensive<00:02:26.450> end<00:02:26.569> of<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.750> floor<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.230> an<00:02:27.349> older

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
defensive end of the floor and an older

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.400 
defensive end of the floor and an older
guy<00:02:27.860> for<00:02:28.549> a<00:02:28.580> younger<00:02:28.970> promising<00:02:29.840> rising

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
guy for a younger promising rising

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.490 
guy for a younger promising rising
player<00:02:30.769> like<00:02:31.160> Trevor<00:02:31.940> Ariza<00:02:32.150> any<00:02:32.569> flushes<00:02:33.319> it

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
player like Trevor Ariza any flushes it
