the<00:02:07.900> kettlebell<00:02:08.379> over<00:02:09.129> dumbbells<00:02:09.610> for<00:02:09.910> this

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
the kettlebell over dumbbells for this

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.290 
the kettlebell over dumbbells for this
movement

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
movement

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.540 
movement
mmm<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.450> think<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.690> was<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> 25<00:02:13.320> pound<00:02:13.590> kettlebell

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
mmm I think it was a 25 pound kettlebell

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.200 
mmm I think it was a 25 pound kettlebell
but<00:02:14.910> they<00:02:15.030> come<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.210> all<00:02:15.390> different<00:02:15.420> sizes

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
but they come in all different sizes

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.410 
but they come in all different sizes
here<00:02:18.210> I'm<00:02:18.330> just<00:02:18.540> doing<00:02:18.900> some<00:02:20.420> overhead

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
here I'm just doing some overhead

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.110 
here I'm just doing some overhead
presses<00:02:21.870> for<00:02:22.140> shoulders<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:23.550> movement

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
presses for shoulders this movement

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.420 
presses for shoulders this movement
again<00:02:24.420> sometimes<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.170> do<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.500> nice<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:25.980> slow

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
again sometimes I do it nice and slow

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.540 
again sometimes I do it nice and slow
just<00:02:27.150> really<00:02:27.690> working<00:02:27.930> my<00:02:28.800> muscles<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.430> then

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
just really working my muscles and then

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.130 
just really working my muscles and then
other<00:02:29.730> times<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.450> more<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.930> power

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
other times I do it more of a power

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.960 
other times I do it more of a power
movement<00:02:31.800> really<00:02:31.950> put<00:02:32.220> my<00:02:32.310> whole<00:02:32.490> body<00:02:32.730> into

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
movement really put my whole body into

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.990 
movement really put my whole body into
it<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.540> kind<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.290> do<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> quicker<00:02:34.860> motion<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.730> I

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
it and kind of do a quicker motion so I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.060 
it and kind of do a quicker motion so I
know<00:02:36.390> sometimes<00:02:36.990> people<00:02:37.200> comment<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.860> don't

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
know sometimes people comment I don't

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.520 
know sometimes people comment I don't
move<00:02:38.280> fast<00:02:38.640> enough<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.600> need<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.050> move<00:02:40.230> quicker

move fast enough I need to move quicker
but<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.400> really<00:02:41.670> depends<00:02:42.150> what<00:02:42.360> you're<00:02:42.510> doing

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
but it really depends what you're doing

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.290 
but it really depends what you're doing

push-ups<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.400> can<00:02:56.610> do<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> lot<00:02:57.090> more<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.390> these

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
push-ups I can do a lot more of these

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.000 
push-ups I can do a lot more of these
than<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.780> ever<00:02:57.959> used<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.380> be<00:02:58.500> able<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:58.830> them

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.290 
but as soon as I stopped doing them I
tend<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.380> lose<00:03:01.590> them<00:03:01.770> so<00:03:02.130> it's<00:03:02.880> kind<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.150> good

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300

tricep dips you can see I'm pretty shaky

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.099 
tricep dips you can see I'm pretty shaky
triceps<00:04:14.910> are<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.239> sore<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.540> small<00:04:16.470> muscle<00:04:17.340> but

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
triceps are so sore a small muscle but

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.630 
triceps are so sore a small muscle but
they're<00:04:19.109> really<00:04:19.350> important<00:04:19.830> to<00:04:19.919> work<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.400> need

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
they're really important to work I need

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.810 
they're really important to work I need
to<00:04:20.669> work<00:04:20.940> more<00:04:21.150> on<00:04:21.270> getting<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.570> little

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820

our<00:04:21.880> definition<00:04:22.480> in<00:04:22.570> my<00:04:22.690> triceps<00:04:23.170> I<00:04:23.350> think<00:04:23.560> I

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
our definition in my triceps I think I

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.380 
our definition in my triceps I think I
focused<00:04:24.130> so<00:04:24.250> much<00:04:24.310> on<00:04:24.520> my<00:04:24.670> shoulders<00:04:25.090> I

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
focused so much on my shoulders I

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.570 
focused so much on my shoulders I
haven't<00:04:26.020> been<00:04:26.140> doing<00:04:26.290> as<00:04:26.500> much<00:04:26.650> triceps<00:04:27.250> as<00:04:27.460> I

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
haven't been doing as much triceps as I

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.310 
haven't been doing as much triceps as I
probably<00:04:27.880> could<00:04:30.570> I'm<00:04:31.570> really<00:04:31.870> happy<00:04:32.200> though

me keep carbs in this whole time and
every<00:04:51.280> other<00:04:51.570> competition<00:04:52.570> I've<00:04:52.690> done<00:04:52.870> I've

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
every other competition I've done I've

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.710 
every other competition I've done I've
always<00:04:53.320> carb<00:04:54.040> cycles<00:04:54.550> or<00:04:54.760> cut<00:04:55.000> them<00:04:55.150> out<00:04:55.270> and

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
always carb cycles or cut them out and

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.690 
always carb cycles or cut them out and
done<00:04:56.380> all<00:04:56.500> kinds<00:04:56.770> of<00:04:56.830> stuff<00:04:57.040> with<00:04:57.070> my<00:04:57.310> carbs

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
done all kinds of stuff with my carbs

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.120 
done all kinds of stuff with my carbs
this<00:04:57.850> time<00:04:58.120> I've<00:04:58.330> kept<00:04:58.630> them<00:04:58.810> right<00:04:59.080> in<00:04:59.290> there

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
this time I've kept them right in there

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.130 
this time I've kept them right in there
cut<00:05:00.520> down<00:05:00.670> a<00:05:00.730> little<00:05:00.970> bit<00:05:01.180> on<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.480> amount<00:05:01.810> but

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
cut down a little bit on the amount but

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.420 
cut down a little bit on the amount but
they're<00:05:02.350> still<00:05:02.650> in<00:05:02.830> there<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.040> I<00:05:03.220> think

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
they're still in there and I think

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.450 
they're still in there and I think
that's<00:05:04.080> that's<00:05:05.080> why<00:05:05.350> my<00:05:05.560> muscles<00:05:05.980> do<00:05:06.220> look

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
that's that's why my muscles do look

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.420 
that's that's why my muscles do look
more<00:05:06.700> filled<00:05:06.940> out<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.950> I'm<00:05:08.950> really<00:05:09.130> happy

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
more filled out and I'm really happy

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.260 
more filled out and I'm really happy
with<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:09.820> way<00:05:09.970> things<00:05:10.030> are<00:05:10.480> looking<00:05:10.510> so<00:05:12.270> and

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
with the way things are looking so and

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.600 
with the way things are looking so and
then<00:05:13.990> looking<00:05:14.290> good

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
then looking good

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.450 
then looking good
just<00:05:16.090> more<00:05:16.210> tricep<00:05:16.750> work<00:05:17.260> here<00:05:17.620> tricep<00:05:18.190> pull

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
just more tricep work here tricep pull

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.080 
just more tricep work here tricep pull
downs<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:21.030> then<00:05:22.030> here<00:05:22.360> doing<00:05:22.810> for<00:05:23.350> triceps

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
downs and then here doing for triceps

downs and then here doing for triceps
bench<00:05:25.090> dips<00:05:25.510> which<00:05:27.120> might<00:05:28.120> look<00:05:28.300> like<00:05:28.360> they're

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
bench dips which might look like they're

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.020 
bench dips which might look like they're
real<00:05:28.900> easy<00:05:29.230> for<00:05:29.380> me<00:05:29.830> I<00:05:30.070> probably<00:05:30.610> could<00:05:30.940> have

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
real easy for me I probably could have

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.880 
real easy for me I probably could have
made<00:05:31.360> it<00:05:31.780> a<00:05:31.870> little<00:05:32.020> more<00:05:32.200> difficult<00:05:32.380> by

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
made it a little more difficult by

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.140 
made it a little more difficult by
adding<00:05:33.250> a<00:05:33.400> weight<00:05:33.580> like<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.090> plate<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:35.590> my<00:05:36.030> to<00:05:37.030> my

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
adding a weight like a plate to my to my

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.030 
adding a weight like a plate to my to my
lap<00:05:37.360> or<00:05:37.720> maybe<00:05:37.900> put<00:05:38.140> my<00:05:38.230> feet<00:05:38.500> up<00:05:38.650> on<00:05:38.800> another

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
lap or maybe put my feet up on another

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.280 
lap or maybe put my feet up on another
bench<00:05:39.370> but<00:05:39.790> at<00:05:40.120> this<00:05:40.450> point<00:05:40.810> it<00:05:40.930> was<00:05:40.990> fairly

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
bench but at this point it was fairly

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.410 
bench but at this point it was fairly
fatigued<00:05:41.830> so<00:05:42.430> I<00:05:42.460> was<00:05:42.610> just<00:05:42.760> making<00:05:43.060> sure<00:05:43.090> when

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
fatigued so I was just making sure when

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.210 
fatigued so I was just making sure when
I<00:05:43.450> came<00:05:43.540> up<00:05:43.750> I<00:05:44.080> really<00:05:44.590> thought<00:05:44.860> about<00:05:44.920> it

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
I came up I really thought about it

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.190 
I came up I really thought about it
mentally<00:05:45.790> and<00:05:45.910> squeezed<00:05:46.390> with<00:05:46.540> my<00:05:46.720> triceps

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
mentally and squeezed with my triceps

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.040 
mentally and squeezed with my triceps
really<00:05:47.500> hard<00:05:48.150> may<00:05:49.150> sound<00:05:49.420> like<00:05:49.510> a<00:05:49.600> simple<00:05:50.020> task

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
really hard may sound like a simple task

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.380 
really hard may sound like a simple task
but<00:05:50.590> it's<00:05:50.770> just<00:05:50.950> really<00:05:51.070> important<00:05:51.730> with<00:05:52.270> any

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
but it's just really important with any

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.270 
but it's just really important with any
of<00:05:52.540> those<00:05:52.630> movements<00:05:52.990> to<00:05:53.560> really<00:05:53.860> think<00:05:54.190> about

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
of those movements to really think about

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.940 
of those movements to really think about
the<00:05:54.550> muscle<00:05:54.910> you're<00:05:55.030> wanting<00:05:55.420> to<00:05:55.570> work<00:05:55.950> for

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
the muscle you're wanting to work for

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.920 
the muscle you're wanting to work for
myself<00:05:57.100> specifically<00:05:57.970> I<00:05:58.000> think<00:05:58.060> with<00:05:58.390> triceps

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.530 
myself specifically I think with triceps
and<00:05:59.140> biceps<00:05:59.790> you<00:06:00.790> really<00:06:01.060> need<00:06:01.210> to<00:06:01.360> think

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
and biceps you really need to think

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.650 
and biceps you really need to think
about<00:06:01.690> that<00:06:02.020> muscle<00:06:02.500> group<00:06:02.770> you're<00:06:03.160> working

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
about that muscle group you're working

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.730 
about that muscle group you're working
mentally<00:06:04.660> and<00:06:04.840> just<00:06:05.020> really<00:06:05.230> focus<00:06:05.260> on

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
mentally and just really focus on

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.370 
mentally and just really focus on
squeezing<00:06:06.010> em<00:06:06.600> you<00:06:07.600> don't<00:06:07.720> want<00:06:07.960> to<00:06:08.020> just<00:06:08.200> be

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
squeezing em you don't want to just be

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.660 
squeezing em you don't want to just be
moving<00:06:08.740> through<00:06:08.950> the<00:06:09.070> movement<00:06:09.460> you're

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
moving through the movement you're

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.040 
moving through the movement you're
probably<00:06:09.910> not<00:06:10.120> gonna<00:06:10.270> get<00:06:10.480> as<00:06:10.600> much<00:06:10.750> out<00:06:11.020> of

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
probably not gonna get as much out of

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.610 
probably not gonna get as much out of
that<00:06:12.600> so<00:06:13.600> that's<00:06:13.690> it<00:06:13.930> it's<00:06:14.080> a<00:06:14.140> little<00:06:14.230> bit<00:06:14.350> for

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
that so that's it it's a little bit for

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:25.990 
that so that's it it's a little bit for
my<00:06:14.710> workout<00:06:15.040> today

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000
