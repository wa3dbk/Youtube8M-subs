00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
this on the website because it might be

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.650 
this on the website because it might be
a<00:04:20.400> little<00:04:20.519> bit<00:04:20.700> rare<00:04:20.910> during<00:04:21.209> times<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.540> year

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
a little bit rare during times of year

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:32.430 
a little bit rare during times of year
you<00:04:22.140> can<00:04:22.320> always<00:04:22.500> use<00:04:22.830> sword<00:04:23.190> fern

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.020 

so<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.530> can<00:04:33.650> always<00:04:33.800> prune<00:04:34.340> down<00:04:34.610> by<00:04:34.820> just

so you can always prune down by just

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.220 
so you can always prune down by just
removing<00:04:35.450> some<00:04:35.600> of<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.870> leaves<00:04:36.020> on<00:04:36.110> the

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
removing some of the leaves on the

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.010 
removing some of the leaves on the
bottom<00:04:36.530> like<00:04:36.710> this<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:38.360> you<00:04:38.450> just<00:04:38.480> pull<00:04:38.840> them

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
bottom like this so you just pull them

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.990 
bottom like this so you just pull them
down<00:04:39.080> and<00:04:39.620> then<00:04:40.040> you<00:04:40.130> can<00:04:40.280> cut<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.610> bottom<00:04:40.880> of

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
down and then you can cut the bottom of

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:51.429 
down and then you can cut the bottom of
the<00:04:41.090> stem

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:51.439 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.079 

and<00:04:52.069> I'm<00:04:52.159> doing<00:04:52.369> that<00:04:52.550> with<00:04:52.699> each<00:04:52.879> and<00:04:53.029> every

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:53.089 
and I'm doing that with each and every

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:55.619 
and I'm doing that with each and every
one<00:04:53.239> of<00:04:53.389> them<00:04:53.569> because<00:04:53.929> they're<00:04:54.289> kind<00:04:54.559> of<00:04:54.619> big

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
one of them because they're kind of big

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:37.619 
one of them because they're kind of big
for<00:04:56.629> such<00:04:56.779> a<00:04:56.809> small<00:04:57.229> these

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.089 

so<00:05:38.629> you're<00:05:38.780> going<00:05:38.900> to<00:05:38.960> go<00:05:39.199> with<00:05:39.379> your<00:05:39.500> instinct

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
create a shape it's really hard to use a

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.719 
create a shape it's really hard to use a
pedestal<00:06:27.169> base<00:06:27.560> or<00:06:27.889> something<00:06:28.069> so<00:06:28.400> shallow

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
pedestal base or something so shallow

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.420 
pedestal base or something so shallow
like<00:06:29.120> this<00:06:29.330> if<00:06:29.509> you<00:06:29.599> don't<00:06:29.780> have<00:06:29.900> balls<00:06:30.050> net

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
like this if you don't have balls net

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.619 
like this if you don't have balls net
because<00:06:31.430> it<00:06:31.520> will<00:06:31.639> take<00:06:31.819> up<00:06:31.969> a<00:06:32.120> lot<00:06:32.419> more

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:32.629 
because it will take up a lot more

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.050 
because it will take up a lot more
flowers<00:06:33.169> to<00:06:33.199> fill<00:06:33.830> it<00:06:34.009> and<00:06:34.159> you<00:06:34.669> won't<00:06:34.819> be<00:06:35.000> able

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
flowers to fill it and you won't be able

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.700 
flowers to fill it and you won't be able
to<00:06:35.180> create<00:06:35.419> the<00:06:35.569> shape<00:06:35.870> that<00:06:36.110> you<00:06:36.199> really<00:06:36.500> want
