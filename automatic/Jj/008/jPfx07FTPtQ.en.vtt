00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.690
 5 1 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.360
 we declare with the last reply of the year I already know that it should be a reason 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.419
 but it's not coming out 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.349
 so you will have to make do with this recipe the first thing is to make a broth 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.880
 of vegetable is a complete menu it is about taking advantage of all the steps this 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.099
 It was Roxana Oria and Celery and I also add a little ham a couple of 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.250
 garlic cloves to which I gave them a little bit of pepper grain 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.180
 laurel leaf stalin trickle of extra virgin olive oil and then as the 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.180
 accompaniment of the meat are going to be the potatoes because he took advantage that auel 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.440
 broth clean while adding water supply and this in 10 minutes 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.470
 the express way is ready 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.470
 while we chop half a tender onion 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.850
 we put it in water and add to lettuce in this case it is oak leaf 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.030
 and we let it be affected 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.299
 therefore we are already trying and then we will see ourselves in a little horse 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.870
 the potatoes 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.950
 two parties in half 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.540
 yes 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.400
 the prizes value in a pan 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.670
 with a little butter and a little olive oil we put them face down 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.670
 and salt and pepper 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.250
 pilgrims a clove of garlic indicated 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.990
 and a sprig of rosemary 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.980
 we leave it until the potatoes take color 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.340
 the lettuce this treaty well we discover 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.150
 and when we have everything ready we do the entrecote section I'm going to do it to the 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.500
 Grill and the trick is adjusted as a ring is that it is very very hot 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.660
 Wake left and five minutes 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.429
 until it has caught a lot of heat 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.559
 like the record and so that it is toasted to the outside hell inside the trick 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:19.169
 is in turning around every 30 seconds until this one like you like it 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:20.549
 Finally 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.659
 we ask for a little bit of salt, the market bonds and then the entrecote 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.709
 with potatoes 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.139

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:35.650
