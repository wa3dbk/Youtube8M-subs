00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.460
 Immediately new simon here Saturday from 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.320
 level decrease during test today 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 review for the pott leaf 2.0 by cytec me 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.929
 have been in the shop for a long time i have it 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.029
 also tested before 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.580
 it comes in the last time or in 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.680
 an earlier time not possible to test 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.210
 have carbohydrates because as I expect 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.310
 we have about eight grams 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 carbohydrates on 100 of them too 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.269
 mainly maltodextrin because of that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.309
 not suitable for anabolic goes 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.840
 I could be very important now 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.510
 But I also try it out 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 Empty made portion size is larger 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.079
 as with all the others because of it 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.129
 So get a 20 gram scoop 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.750
 a little bit bigger than this one 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.950
 which we tested before 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.500
 I've quite a lot of it 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.629
 promised because the content list itself 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.340
 We read everything very well 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.800
 what we need so really 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.480
 such an all in one tree worker element 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.300
 become five different creative ones 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.969
 formulas in there creatine moderate 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.230
 also the original krealk alkalien where he 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.160
 I swear to many , too 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.989
 not so excited 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.200
 who knows my creative opinion did he 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.530
 Great in whatever form here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.990
 We have several in it anyway 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 different arginine formulas or 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.610
 different types with it 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.310
 magnin movie as I said in short only 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.229
 today for the muscles for the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.229
 muscle pump we have the best alanine 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.530
 a few repetitions in it for more 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.540
 a bit more power during the workout 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.250
 for more intense workout and we have 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.590
 by stimulants caffeine green tea 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.299
 extracts of pepper extracts so has become 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.299
 Everything was very well read also by the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.680
 very very pleasant to read 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.079
 every case promised a lot 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.110
 maybe that was why I was not quite 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.360
 So so excited to be a small Conclusion 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.880
 the pumps are not very good 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.380
 blood circulation has become quite fast 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.170
 quite full 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.640
 the beta alanine visa it's my turn 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.960
 because of that I can get used to that 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.969
 not say much but I have it 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.579
 Tingling noticed after 20 30 minutes 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.380
 why is there also in the crowd 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.850
 his will be there as well 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.040
 to have 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.869
 creatin I like well we have one 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.369
 good quantity will be so if so 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.840
 it takes the product you have one 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.780
 you do not have to have enough quantity 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.510
 additionally creative 45 grams then in 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.709
 a scoop size quite enough for her 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.150
 knows my opinion and in itself so the 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.120
 Truth, I did not think bad either 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.800
 focus was quite good was also fast there 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.319
 I believe in me it is mainly 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.090
 through this green tea extract I am a fan 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.520
 extracts of green tea I make myself 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.510
 always fast awake fast fit i had 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.459
 but so quickly again that 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.280
 the lust and so on lost that 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.269
 He is called the lust for training 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.700
 passed quickly 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.590
 but maybe very good if you are right 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.150
 in the evening or late at night 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.519
 We have quite a lot of caffeine 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.590
 Caffeine is fast as it makes you awake 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.920
 but do not last too long 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.989
 that's why my conclusion is a good one 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.580
 Product segment nothing outstanding 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.900
 Just check out form yours 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.819
 opinion I just wanted to go anyway 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.459
 a video does not even test tested 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.299
 because both had it there 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:17.269
 taste is okay very artificially very 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:22.370
 sweet but ok plays show you 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:24.170
 but it's more all out testing 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.600
 just everything is in it is one 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.280
 good creatine supplement in any case 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.959
 It is very much of the price performance 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.269
 good because it is quite cheap 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.200
 comparison to the other stuff is up 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.390
 In any case , I could be wrong about that 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.060
 and I thought it was good but not 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.220
 outstanding that from me to the next 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.720
 test subscribes to the channel goes in 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.579
 the shop just look purely what we still so 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.020
 Hard you know I'm just tough 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.130
 that's why 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.130
 Until next time
