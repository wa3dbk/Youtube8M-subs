00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.730
 hello people and welcome to one 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:13.559
 growing new at boxing by myself today 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.590
 we gran turismo 5 know me and this 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.960
 as far as I know critical first came 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.220
 recently released I think but that's 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.640
 a long time ago I do not remember 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.250
 exactly 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:31.320
 In any case he is the game 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 one sees here playstation network for 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:40.190
 the ps3 a blu ray disc 3d ready us 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.620
 look at the same times people according to 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.450
 You can see everything nice here 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.280
 screenshots from the game very very good 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.399
 quality 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.989
 so very, very good 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.870
 race simulator I would say again 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.609
 playstation network you can see it now 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.989
 not here but it is for 12 players 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:12.270
 needs a minimum of 256 megabytes you can do it 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:17.729
 play on 27p 1080i or 1080p 3d 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.540
 game psp compatible network features and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.390
 network plail 2 to 16 players you can 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:34.790
 the online game so very nice 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:38.479
 the reason here ps3 and will be in the case 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.479
 right now 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:02:00.290
 what do we see then that 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.460
 manual as I think 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:15.950
 It would quickly become out of this yes 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:22.550
 all in black hardstyle you will be all 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.260
 but that's not it 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.650
 in german that is now roll the me 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.740
 know you it can not read but PBUH 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.500
 in dutch and now comes up 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:38.690
 German yes probably everything explains that I 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.560
 maybe it's not that interesting 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.890
 But many languages ​​are in there 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.100
 motorstorm is still advertising sound 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:55.870
 I do not know what it is 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:03:07.430
 nice what can we have in here yet 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:11.840
 therefore, neither does she get her bright 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:22.760
 and downloadable bonus in bonus 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:28.750
 content and then here again something okay 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.940
 such a code somehow okay again 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.300
