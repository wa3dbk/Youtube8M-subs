00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.269
 the concrete benchtop and the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.119
 grouping of several disciplines 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.410
 in the bobsleigh track here at the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.600
 so we skate rollerblading 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.099
 buggy luge board rowling on 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.800
 try to bring down the times 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.650
 these disciplines or that individual one is 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.079
 each one confronted with his own ego and one 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.340
 will all search the seconds for 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.540
 trying to really have fun 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.540
 to take sensations 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.080
 for rent 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.080
 you broken mouths 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.420
 the case 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.729
 of brown years motivated a dummy 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.140
 euros the uci which to my great passion the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:38.790
 walkers who goes off football with me 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:43.159
 for eight years greg told me go type 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.159
 a lot of friends you are sure 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.440
 I 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.630
 m 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.630
 piece 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.569
 I did not know until now 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.760
 and yet I know how I win 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.739
 since 1999 2000 we have a sensation 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.659
 pressure that we do not have with the road 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.129
 for me the ground which founds the 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.390
 descent that they do not have at 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.310
 less basically does it once the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.579
 track to bab there something 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.579
 grand 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.090
 it's really something unique 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.489
 3d ride I think there is very very 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.959
 little discipline that can offer that 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.670
 we are the only ones who helped 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.379
 the horizontal is something 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.980
 of impressive we feel light and the 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.200
 compression 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.170
 it's really really really 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.250
 trippant it can be learned that it is 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.250
 really surpassing oneself 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.540
 when is it 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.439
 to the globe
