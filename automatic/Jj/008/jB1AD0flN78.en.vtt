00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Personal beauty, I'm here with over 20 of you. 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.970
 today they are seeing again that yes I 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.740
 I'm in black ops and I wanted to give 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.530
 highlight before you start talking because 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.509
 everything else and wants to highlight this 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.590
 start and look who was the guy is 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.410
 there is in this case 10 danny 69's there 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.410
 you will override the use of a player is 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.300
 But look, this one is going to take a little 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.880
 funny if it were running at the same time 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 that listening to Bruno took the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.880
 another turned too is that she was one 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.910
 God damn it, that's because he's 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.700
 playing black absolon I already told 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.510
 You guys who bring great tajra I played a lot. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.079
 on twitter 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.969
 does not youtube to show the ball 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.520
 you were extremely smart 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:57.360
 not today but it's the next and I tried 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.840
 quite a lot this is great 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.879
 to him all those defects of 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.299
 players still have the fields 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.610
 Anyway, we deal with the champions more 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.750
 that is a golf club with the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.229
 science and 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.070
 all addicted players I'm not 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.490
 addicted 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.270
 sometimes I play matches in good but in 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.270
 most of them 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.479
 Glory right? 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.869
 this nor anything 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.850
 the galera that destroy came out of mw 3 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.920
 currently destroying is a good fan of 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.400
 and is always playing in the final 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.200
 is released then it is but the galera so in 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.780
 casual was playing for fun 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.000
 People who are not so addicted are more 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:55.140
 cool play tastes smoother and 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.880
 prominent new look then and there what I 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.549
 I'm calmer about that. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.950
 is a woman 3 recently launching a 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.179
 update taking system light with 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.360
 You think and I also think it was 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.540
 responsible are saying there I will never 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.019
 tested 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.719
 exactly right but say milan 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.480
 I replied after the update I 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.159
 I had time to play a game I 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.109
 I was a long time before this 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.390
 but I had some parts time 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.970
 Dinho 03 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.099
 I played from space after 12 have to 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.409
 to play I had a red connection because 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.750
 I was occupying video in a tava with whom 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.400
 I could play in that moment I was in the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.420
 also the cable connection was 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.189
 red 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.049
 I played later I got to play well 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.889
 no language proficiency 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.049
 close 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:52.540
 then it seems that estimating that 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:57.459
 has decreased in one I know because it seems 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.889
 I do not order anything, it's almost 12 thousand mw 3 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.889
 fuck I 'm not saying any of this 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.239
 only the feeling of playing after 12 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.310
 really notice the change to us 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.579
 played quite early realized the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.590
 Please change talk that has no 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:35.699
 change also speaks in a comment that 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:35.699
 finally his name is very good 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:48.340
 You can see that it is exactly in the 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:50.829
 map is quieter beer and dogs right 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:57.669
 I have this problem 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:04:02.109
 I believe in a mall in most of the 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:04.389
 departure very often but the 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:08.319
 gaming skills when I get it 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:11.859
 do is catch dogs and shopping in 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:17.079
 some games only then when I'm 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:17.709
 close to achieving what always ends 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.979
 dying 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.330
 It's an incredible thing, it always ends. 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.370
 dying so I have to stay longer 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.760
 tranquil allies not 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.530
 I often end up dying for 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.610
 nervousness it is sometimes connected 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.680
 time to take exaggerated idea attitudes until 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.770
 I do not know, unexpected 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.479
 Anyway I do everything to kill the guy and 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.870
 He even told me I can not explain. 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.150
 the fact is what causes it more 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.389
 Anyway, I get nervous and end up losing it. 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:05:00.389
 What happens in this game? 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:05:00.389
 luckily I got enough 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:14.250
 drop a great game continue but give a 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:17.380
 chance really now then anyone 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.810
 You can add there and I'm going to kill this guy. 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:31.180
 and on my side will do the last that I 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:33.099
 I think it's cool and the video speaks in 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.039
 If you liked it a lot, it helped a lot too. 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:38.229
 did not like click did not like 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.650
 This is it. 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.650
