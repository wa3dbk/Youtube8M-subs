00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hi, people today, I'm still one more tip 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.290
 food care for you 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.389
 we know that the kitchen is a local 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.070
 that needs to have a lot of hygiene 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.150
 so today I'll talk about board 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.150
 food court 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.949
 It's important that we use a board. 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.710
 different for each type of group of 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.529
 food such as a bale 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.119
 the sinus project and another one for vegetables or 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 raw fruits 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.470
 It's important for us to do this. 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.260
 separation not to cause 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.380
 cross-contamination , for example the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.239
 people use shortcut for raw food 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.270
 or a meat for example and even if the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.590
 people there and do not stay is always 100% and 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.450
 sanitized 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.910
 So it's important that we have another one. 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.329
 option I found on the market 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.000
 planks that are made of flexible plastic 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.649
 and they are separated by colors gives to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
 people make the distinction quite easily 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.559
 They're easy to keep, I'll show them to you. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.410
 you 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.320
 then the boards that acquire it are not 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.550
 either by the brand or by the price or by 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.170
 place of purchase but that 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.170
 I found it quite interesting. 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.260
 looks at this type of cutting tabu of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.080
 Flexible food right it is if they 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.180
 live separated by colors already comes with 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.860
 suggestion to leave the food group 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.680
 that you can use the specific rate 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.250
 I found these quite interesting in 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.650
 particular because we can 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.530
 example you use there to cut the food 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.680
 and then we do it like this, it already takes the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.930
 food or for the pot or for the pot or 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.940
 dish we put on I found 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.780
 well cool, this is very thin 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.430
 you can see it has the thickness of one of 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.680
 an American game since we put 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:02.640
 on the table is easy to wash here is 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.800
 leprosy not smooth texture does not grab 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.860
 get food scraps and here 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.720
 has a more ashura texture that is 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.880
 to adhere to the surface where people 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 will put on top that tip to 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.610
