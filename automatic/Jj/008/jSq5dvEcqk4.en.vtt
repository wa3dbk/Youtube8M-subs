00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.260 
things by now so just have a go at
plucking<00:03:36.830> those<00:03:36.950> strings<00:03:37.280> again<00:03:37.430> four<00:03:37.970> three

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
plucking those strings again four three

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.260 
plucking those strings again four three
two<00:03:38.540> one

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.750 

okay<00:03:42.050> very<00:03:42.320> good<00:03:42.380> now<00:03:43.070> once<00:03:43.310> you've<00:03:43.490> done<00:03:43.700> that

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
okay very good now once you've done that

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.730 
okay very good now once you've done that
I<00:03:44.150> want<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.600> go<00:03:44.750> back<00:03:44.960> to<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.290> second

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
I want you to go back to the second

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.880 
I want you to go back to the second
string<00:03:46.010> with<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.430> middle<00:03:46.700> finger<00:03:46.730> and<00:03:47.890> then

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
string with the middle finger and then

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.180 
string with the middle finger and then
the<00:03:49.070> third<00:03:49.280> string<00:03:49.730> with<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.240> first<00:03:50.480> finger

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
the third string with the first finger

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.980 
the third string with the first finger
so<00:03:52.190> if<00:03:52.460> we<00:03:52.490> join<00:03:52.820> those<00:03:53.060> notes<00:03:53.300> on<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.660> end<00:03:53.780> it

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
so if we join those notes on the end it

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.870 
so if we join those notes on the end it
should<00:03:54.020> sound<00:03:54.350> like<00:03:54.470> this

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.700 

okay<00:03:59.880> now<00:04:00.300> what<00:04:00.450> happens<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.200> can<00:04:01.380> repeat

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
okay now what happens is you can repeat

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.590 
okay now what happens is you can repeat
that<00:04:01.920> over<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.460> over<00:04:02.610> again<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.240> it<00:04:03.360> joins

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
that over and over again and it joins

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:14.220 
that over and over again and it joins
together<00:04:03.900> perfectly<00:04:04.620> like<00:04:04.860> this

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.379 

okay<00:04:15.099> and<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:15.400> can<00:04:15.550> see<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:15.970> sounds

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
okay and you can see that that sounds

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.140 
okay and you can see that that sounds
really<00:04:16.780> nice<00:04:16.930> now<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.590> suggest<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.370> can<00:04:18.669> change

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
really nice now I suggest you can change

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.569 
really nice now I suggest you can change
their<00:04:19.419> different<00:04:19.750> chords<00:04:20.109> for<00:04:21.010> example<00:04:21.400> if<00:04:21.489> we

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
their different chords for example if we

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.250 
their different chords for example if we
went<00:04:21.729> to<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.000> G<00:04:22.180> chord<00:04:22.449> and<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.930> course<00:04:23.110> you

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
went to the G chord and of course you

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.750 
went to the G chord and of course you
already<00:04:23.380> know<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.830> G<00:04:23.979> chord<00:04:24.220> because<00:04:24.460> we

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
already know the G chord because we

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.800 
already know the G chord because we
learned<00:04:24.940> that<00:04:25.060> in<00:04:25.300> one<00:04:25.419> of<00:04:25.449> the<00:04:25.600> previous

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
learned that in one of the previous

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.620 
learned that in one of the previous
segments<00:04:26.530> but<00:04:27.280> just<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.669> refresh<00:04:27.970> your<00:04:28.270> memory

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
segments but just to refresh your memory

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.480 
segments but just to refresh your memory

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
the first string at fret 3 ok you can

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:41.790 
the first string at fret 3 ok you can
pause<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.810> video<00:04:40.930> if<00:04:41.139> you<00:04:41.350> just<00:04:41.560> need<00:04:41.680> to

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
pause the video if you just need to

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.890 
pause the video if you just need to
check<00:04:42.040> that<00:04:42.100> now<00:04:42.820> what's<00:04:43.120> going<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.389> happen<00:04:43.750> is

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
check that now what's going to happen is

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.780 
check that now what's going to happen is
the<00:04:44.440> thumb<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:45.040> now<00:04:45.190> going<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.460> pluck<00:04:45.669> the

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
the thumb is now going to pluck the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.820 
the thumb is now going to pluck the
sixth<00:04:46.120> string<00:04:46.360> because<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.410> some<00:04:47.650> always

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
sixth string because the some always

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.740 
sixth string because the some always
plucks<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.400> root<00:04:48.580> note<00:04:48.789> of<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.090> chord<00:04:49.120> when

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
plucks the root note of the chord when

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.810 
plucks the root note of the chord when
we<00:04:49.930> were<00:04:50.050> on<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.350> D<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.800> root<00:04:50.979> note<00:04:51.220> was<00:04:51.639> the

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
we were on the D the root note was the

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.969 
we were on the D the root note was the
fourth<00:04:52.060> string<00:04:52.360> but<00:04:52.600> now<00:04:52.750> we're<00:04:52.930> on<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.139> G<00:04:53.380> the

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
fourth string but now we're on the G the

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.010 
fourth string but now we're on the G the
root<00:04:54.190> note<00:04:54.400> is<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.729> sixth<00:04:55.030> string<00:04:55.270> ok<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:55.780> hope

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
root note is the sixth string ok I hope

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.050 
root note is the sixth string ok I hope
that<00:04:56.169> makes<00:04:56.380> sense<00:04:56.530> but<00:04:57.370> these<00:04:57.580> three<00:04:57.820> fingers

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
that makes sense but these three fingers

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.580 
that makes sense but these three fingers
are<00:04:58.449> still<00:04:58.720> going<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.080> be<00:04:59.169> on<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.380> same

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
are still going to be on the same

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.320 
are still going to be on the same
strings<00:04:59.949> as<00:05:00.130> before<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.729> third<00:05:00.940> string

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
strings as before the third string

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.990 
strings as before the third string
second<00:05:02.110> string<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.560> first<00:05:02.860> string<00:05:03.190> so<00:05:03.760> when

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
second string and first string so when

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.790 
second string and first string so when
we<00:05:04.150> apply<00:05:04.479> this<00:05:04.539> picking<00:05:05.139> pattern<00:05:05.530> it'll

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
we apply this picking pattern it'll

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.870 
we apply this picking pattern it'll
sound<00:05:05.949> like<00:05:06.070> this

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.110 

right<00:05:13.660> so<00:05:14.260> what<00:05:14.410> I<00:05:14.440> suggest<00:05:14.530> you<00:05:14.890> do<00:05:15.160> is<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.640> do

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
right so what I suggest you do is to do

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.180 
right so what I suggest you do is to do
that<00:05:16.300> picking<00:05:16.690> pattern<00:05:17.050> twice<00:05:17.290> on<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.680> D<00:05:17.860> and

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
that picking pattern twice on the D and

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.370 
that picking pattern twice on the D and
then<00:05:18.730> twice<00:05:19.060> on<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.330> G<00:05:19.540> so<00:05:19.990> it<00:05:20.050> should<00:05:20.230> sound

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
then twice on the G so it should sound

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:30.230 
then twice on the G so it should sound
like<00:05:20.500> this

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:42.999 

and<00:05:30.660> then<00:05:30.810> you<00:05:30.960> can<00:05:31.139> do<00:05:31.259> again

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.399 

okay<00:05:43.699> I<00:05:43.729> think<00:05:44.180> you<00:05:44.270> get<00:05:44.449> the<00:05:44.479> idea<00:05:44.599> now<00:05:45.379> I

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
okay I think you get the idea now I

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.829 
okay I think you get the idea now I
suggest<00:05:45.830> you<00:05:46.129> practice<00:05:46.999> that<00:05:47.270> with<00:05:47.449> the<00:05:47.689> other

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:47.839 
suggest you practice that with the other

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.450 
suggest you practice that with the other
chords<00:05:48.139> you<00:05:48.229> know<00:05:48.349> as<00:05:48.469> well<00:05:48.589> like<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:48.949> E<00:05:49.159> and

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
chords you know as well like the E and

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.939 
chords you know as well like the E and
the<00:05:49.550> a<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:50.629> if<00:05:51.050> you<00:05:51.139> go<00:05:51.289> on<00:05:51.409> the<00:05:51.499> archive
