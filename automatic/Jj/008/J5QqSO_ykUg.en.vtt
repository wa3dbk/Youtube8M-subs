builds<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.469> make<00:00:34.739> don't<00:00:35.579> exactly<00:00:35.940> match

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
builds that I make don't exactly match

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.930 
builds that I make don't exactly match
the<00:00:36.780> combos<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.530> game<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.640> reason

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the combos in the game and the reason

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.180 
the combos in the game and the reason
why<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> make<00:00:39.329> these<00:00:39.510> builds<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.860> I'm

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
why I make these builds is because I'm

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.190 
why I make these builds is because I'm
trying<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.670> break<00:00:42.000> other<00:00:42.239> people's<00:00:42.360> combos

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
trying to break other people's combos

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.229 
trying to break other people's combos
and<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.550> fact<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.910> if

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and I don't like the fact that if

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.779 
and I don't like the fact that if
somebody<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:45.960> faster<00:00:46.469> than<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.710> then<00:00:47.340> you

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
somebody is faster than you then you

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.540 
somebody is faster than you then you
basically<00:00:48.000> lose<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.410> kinda<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.430> have

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
basically lose like I that kinda I have

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.950 
basically lose like I that kinda I have
a<00:00:50.610> problem<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.690> don't

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
a problem with that because you don't

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.660 
a problem with that because you don't
where<00:00:52.260> somebody<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.160> three<00:00:53.520> or<00:00:53.640> four

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
where somebody is like three or four

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.580 
where somebody is like three or four
levels<00:00:53.940> under<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.570> then<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.140> lose<00:00:55.320> that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
levels under you then you can lose that

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
levels under you then you can lose that
way<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:55.949> somebody's<00:00:56.399> faster<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:57.329> I

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
way if somebody's faster you so what I

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.099 
way if somebody's faster you so what I
did<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.440> made<00:00:58.590> bills<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.309> bump<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
did is I made bills that bump that so

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.599 
did is I made bills that bump that so
you're<00:01:01.230> probably<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.129> do<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.340> bump

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
you're probably like well how do I bump

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.890 
you're probably like well how do I bump
the<00:01:02.850> system<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.570> basically<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> have

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
the system what I basically do is I have

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.140 
the system what I basically do is I have
classes<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.049> usually<00:01:07.650> put<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> wall<00:01:08.760> up<00:01:08.790> in

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
classes that usually put a wall up in

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.120 
classes that usually put a wall up in
the<00:01:09.330> front<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.020> absorbs<00:01:10.590> somebody<00:01:10.979> if

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the front and that absorbs somebody if

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.859 
the front and that absorbs somebody if
they're<00:01:11.310> faster<00:01:11.549> than<00:01:11.850> me<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.510> they<00:01:12.659> are

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
they're faster than me so if they are

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.750 
they're faster than me so if they are
faster<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.799> scheana<00:01:14.189> right<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.520> which

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
faster I have scheana right here which

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.060 
faster I have scheana right here which
does<00:01:15.000> his<00:01:15.240> grubs<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> floor<00:01:16.799> scale

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
does his grubs you see the floor scale

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.350 
does his grubs you see the floor scale
right<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.460> put<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> grub<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> third

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
right there you put a grub in the third

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.969 
right there you put a grub in the third
slot<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.840> put<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> grow<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> first<00:01:19.710> slot

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
slot you put a grow up in the first slot

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.730 
slot you put a grow up in the first slot
and<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> makes<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.299> wall<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:22.170> go<00:01:22.380> along<00:01:22.710> with

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and that makes a wall that go along with

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.700 
and that makes a wall that go along with
he<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:24.000> her<00:01:24.119> twirl<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.530> hit

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
little deep into the spell so now I have

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.569 
little deep into the spell so now I have
a<00:01:27.659> wall<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.200> front<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:28.799> anybody's<00:01:29.189> faster

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579

here and you see Tenten also comes up
now<00:05:13.370> this<00:05:13.550> is<00:05:13.699> a<00:05:13.729> separate<00:05:14.090> hit<00:05:14.240> combo<00:05:14.600> with

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.469 
now this is a separate hit combo with
tension<00:05:15.199> being<00:05:15.650> involved<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.880> it<00:05:17.330> basically

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
tension being involved and it basically

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.920 
tension being involved and it basically
is<00:05:17.960> using<00:05:18.740> let<00:05:19.520> me<00:05:19.639> hit<00:05:19.940> yes<00:05:20.300> it's<00:05:20.600> basically

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
is using let me hit yes it's basically

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.540 
is using let me hit yes it's basically
using<00:05:21.199> the<00:05:21.500> cactus<00:05:21.949> that<00:05:22.100> I<00:05:22.160> have<00:05:22.310> available

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
using the cactus that I have available

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.490 
using the cactus that I have available
so<00:05:23.000> I'm<00:05:23.600> pretty<00:05:23.750> sure<00:05:23.960> if<00:05:24.020> I<00:05:24.169> went<00:05:24.350> to<00:05:24.410> the

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
so I'm pretty sure if I went to the

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.159 
so I'm pretty sure if I went to the
other<00:05:24.669> account<00:05:25.669> that<00:05:26.389> this<00:05:26.750> would<00:05:26.930> be<00:05:27.020> even

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
other account that this would be even

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.629 
other account that this would be even
better<00:05:27.320> but<00:05:27.800> I'm<00:05:27.919> not<00:05:28.070> even<00:05:28.160> going<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.430> use<00:05:28.460> the

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
better but I'm not even going to use the

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.460 
better but I'm not even going to use the
other<00:05:28.760> account<00:05:29.090> anymore<00:05:29.270> because<00:05:29.750> I<00:05:30.080> can't
