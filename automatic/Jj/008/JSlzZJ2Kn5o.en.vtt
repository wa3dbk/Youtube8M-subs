00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:10.500
 Hey bb people and 3 tips plus a video 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:13.500
 for you and today I will make three tips and 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:22.279
 here are the times I'm going to use galaxy 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:32.430
 Handles hurts me phoenix that there is hardly any 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:41.730
 rock jazz rock luso alpha and thermal fathers 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:01:04.470
 quiz you have to find a good 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:01:12.479
 1991 more normal and knowledgeable and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:17.580
 I'm going to use mine when I elect 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:21.229
 less so but now that this pain is 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.229
 G force 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.210
 to innovate without doing it once 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:50.700
 Look how this meeting was 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:52.229
 I give 1991 for the second technique you go 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:00.570
 need 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:03.979
 Claudia, but for you today. 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.979
 normal and you 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:21.050
 This is how to get the right tea. 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.730
 so it will be stronger than the game 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:29.060
 demonstrate but still only that he 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:38.660
 is stronger does not use with dvd type 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:43.870
 before bottle does not use or is not like that 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.730
 dies is thus only the team to stay 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.540
 Who's in the bag is also more 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.670
 high 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:56.300
 it means that he is arriving with 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:03:01.730
 more force the third here as revive 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:18.230
 on the milk was that but in a battle 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:23.860
 alone you have I'll try 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:29.959
 do it again like this 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:33.370
 And now you win so it hurts. 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.370
 Who is not weaker? 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:49.030
 Who's going to do this here? 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.940
 returning now could you have 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.900
 So pick up the cord button only 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.350
 tea time 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.110
 so will see during the battle 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.260
 Thank you so much, this is not the quiz. 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.550
 Ben reed podium but does not close the video 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:10.580
 now why will you always have a 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:18.170
 battle in the end and the battle of today 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:25.300
 win the galaxy the verses burn there 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:29.320
 if he is there then donna do it 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.320
 I arrived on May 21 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.489
 It seems to me that the ball hits the 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:50.830
 winner 

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:53.679
