00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.570 

let's<00:00:02.399> try<00:00:02.639> it<00:00:02.700> with<00:00:02.939> that<00:00:02.970> first<00:00:03.680> okay<00:00:04.680> okay

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
let's try it with that first okay okay

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.700 
let's try it with that first okay okay
so<00:00:05.640> I'm<00:00:06.420> gonna<00:00:06.600> do<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.870> little<00:00:07.049> bit<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.440> video

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.110 

let's<00:00:13.710> take<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.099> look<00:00:14.280> at<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:14.490> we've<00:00:14.639> got<00:00:14.849> here

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
let's take a look at what we've got here

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.320 
let's take a look at what we've got here
so<00:00:15.540> let's<00:00:15.929> lean<00:00:16.139> back<00:00:16.379> on<00:00:16.619> your<00:00:16.650> system<00:00:17.580> we've

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
so let's lean back on your system we've

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:29.300 
so let's lean back on your system we've
got<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:20.300> extension<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> harness<00:00:28.010> here<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
got a extension on the harness here and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.490 
got a extension on the harness here and
then<00:00:29.519> we've<00:00:29.640> also<00:00:29.789> got<00:00:30.090> an<00:00:30.599> auto<00:00:30.840> block<00:00:31.230> down

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
then we've also got an auto block down

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.590 
then we've also got an auto block down
here<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.489> providing<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.000> self<00:00:33.270> fillet

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
here so this is providing a self fillet

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.910 
here so this is providing a self fillet
for<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.160> okay<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.760> our<00:00:35.910> rescuer<00:00:36.920> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
for this okay so this is our rescuer and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.540 
for this okay so this is our rescuer and
then<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.309> also<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.879> our<00:00:38.910> subject<00:00:40.520> who<00:00:41.520> is

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
then we also have our subject who is

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.430 
then we also have our subject who is
going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.329> clip<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.200> also<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> same<00:00:44.780> device

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.630 

there<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.510> also<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.690> an<00:00:51.809> extension<00:00:52.640> ideally

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
there and also with an extension ideally

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.119 
there and also with an extension ideally
the<00:00:53.850> extension<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> subject<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the extension for the subject is

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.680 
the extension for the subject is
slightly<00:00:56.579> shorter<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.140> when<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:59.730> Bend

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
slightly shorter so that when we Bend

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.979 
slightly shorter so that when we Bend
here<00:01:01.609> that<00:01:02.609> person<00:01:03.000> will<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.329> little<00:01:03.690> bit<00:01:03.809> in

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
here that person will be a little bit in

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.109 
here that person will be a little bit in
front<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:07.380> other<00:01:07.740> right<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> think

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
front of the other right now I think

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.450 
front of the other right now I think
we're<00:01:09.540> that's<00:01:10.020> it'll<00:01:10.890> work<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.990> it<00:01:12.990> is

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
we're that's it'll work it it is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.560 
we're that's it'll work it it is
probably<00:01:14.460> would<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:15.030> better<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> little

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
probably would be better to be a little

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.090 
probably would be better to be a little
bit<00:01:15.689> shorter<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.200> workable<00:01:16.560> okay<00:01:17.040> so

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
bit shorter but that's workable okay so

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.539 
bit shorter but that's workable okay so
now<00:01:17.490> let's<00:01:18.180> go<00:01:18.390> ahead<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.740> we're<00:01:20.400> gonna

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
now let's go ahead and and we're gonna

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.420 
now let's go ahead and and we're gonna
start<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> lower<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.430> rescuer

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
start the lower and so now the rescuer

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.429 
start the lower and so now the rescuer
manages<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> auto<00:01:24.479> block<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.140> order<00:01:25.229> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
manages the auto block in order to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.060 
manages the auto block in order to
control<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.860> friction

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.730 

uh-oh<00:01:34.070> issue<00:01:34.370> do<00:01:34.610> I<00:01:34.670> need<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:34.880> stop<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.210> video

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
uh-oh issue do I need to stop the video

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.800 
uh-oh issue do I need to stop the video
oh<00:01:39.010> the<00:01:40.010> rope<00:01:40.190> is<00:01:40.400> just<00:01:41.000> kind<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.270> snagged<00:01:41.570> up

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
oh the rope is just kind of snagged up

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.450 
oh the rope is just kind of snagged up
an<00:01:41.930> ass<00:01:42.080> actually<00:01:42.710> we<00:01:42.950> found<00:01:43.160> that<00:01:43.310> that

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
an ass actually we found that that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.210 
an ass actually we found that that
doesn't<00:01:43.640> necessarily<00:01:43.930> screw<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:45.050> up<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:46.010> just

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
doesn't necessarily screw it up you just

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.950 
doesn't necessarily screw it up you just
have<00:01:46.400> to<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:47.780> wouldn't<00:01:48.470> bother<00:01:49.810> it's<00:01:50.810> just

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
have to I wouldn't bother it's just

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.850 
have to I wouldn't bother it's just
going<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.140> give<00:01:51.260> you<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.380> little<00:01:51.590> bit<00:01:51.680> more

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
going to give you a little bit more

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.980 
going to give you a little bit more
friction<00:01:54.430> okay<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:55.490> now<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:55.880> just<00:01:56.090> manage<00:01:56.780> the

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
friction okay so now you just manage the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.810 
friction okay so now you just manage the
autoblock<00:01:57.590> knot<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.340> should<00:01:58.550> allow<00:01:58.640> the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
autoblock knot and that should allow the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.140 
autoblock knot and that should allow the
two<00:01:59.120> people<00:01:59.510> to<00:01:59.810> move<00:01:59.960> down<00:02:00.200> on<00:02:00.560> one<00:02:01.150> one

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
two people to move down on one one

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.410 
two people to move down on one one
device

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:20.490 

but<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:08.289> pretty<00:02:08.470> tight<00:02:18.959> there's<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:20.080> slippery

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
but it's pretty tight there's a slippery

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:33.030 
but it's pretty tight there's a slippery
log<00:02:20.680> there

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.710 

there<00:02:34.040> they<00:02:34.280> go<00:02:34.310> down<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.180> hill<00:02:35.360> like<00:02:35.570> a

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
there they go down the hill like a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:44.620 
there they go down the hill like a
couple<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.400> drunken<00:02:37.400> sailors<00:02:43.360> this<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:44.540> a

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
couple of drunken sailors this is a

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.600 
couple of drunken sailors this is a
technique<00:02:44.990> that<00:02:45.050> can<00:02:45.410> be<00:02:45.470> used<00:02:45.590> with<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.100> person

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
technique that can be used with a person

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.750 
technique that can be used with a person
who<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.960> they<00:02:47.960> has<00:02:48.170> an<00:02:48.320> injured<00:02:48.710> arm<00:02:48.950> or<00:02:49.280> it's

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
who is they has an injured arm or it's

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.300 
who is they has an injured arm or it's
still<00:02:50.000> mobile<00:02:50.300> or<00:02:50.960> it<00:02:51.470> can<00:02:51.710> be<00:02:51.830> used<00:02:52.040> with<00:02:52.280> a

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
still mobile or it can be used with a

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.550 
still mobile or it can be used with a
person<00:02:52.880> who<00:02:53.120> maybe<00:02:53.570> has<00:02:53.810> gotten<00:02:54.050> stranded<00:02:54.260> and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
person who maybe has gotten stranded and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.810 
person who maybe has gotten stranded and
they're<00:02:54.650> not<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.800> climber<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:55.550> they<00:02:55.670> don't

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
they're not a climber and so they don't

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:03.300 
they're not a climber and so they don't
really<00:02:55.940> know<00:02:56.120> how<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.330> rappel<00:02:56.750> on<00:02:56.870> their<00:02:57.020> own

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.860 

yeah<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.340> think<00:03:04.580> one<00:03:05.120> let's<00:03:05.330> wrap<00:03:05.600> on<00:03:05.840> that

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
yeah I think one let's wrap on that

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.900 
yeah I think one let's wrap on that
autoblock<00:03:06.440> might<00:03:06.650> help<00:03:06.800> or<00:03:06.980> if<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.520> was<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.640> more

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
autoblock might help or if it was a more

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.240 
autoblock might help or if it was a more
vertical<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.630> more<00:03:08.810> realistic<00:03:09.170> situation<00:03:10.100> you

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
vertical a more realistic situation you
