00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.770 
combo for that extra damage now looking
at<00:02:25.350> tap<00:02:25.590> Wars<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.100> super<00:02:26.490> breaks<00:02:26.760> with<00:02:27.540> tap

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
at tap Wars and super breaks with tap

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.310 
at tap Wars and super breaks with tap
Wars<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:28.770> get<00:02:29.040> seven<00:02:29.580> hits<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:31.020> that

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
Wars you can get seven hits and so that

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.530 
Wars you can get seven hits and so that
means<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.740> can<00:02:31.920> do<00:02:32.070> five<00:02:32.370> hits<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.090> combo

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
means you can do five hits and a combo

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.390 
means you can do five hits and a combo
or<00:02:33.780> two<00:02:34.709> hits<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.490> bonus<00:02:35.880> combo<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:38.220> must

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
or two hits and a bonus combo and I must

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.570 
or two hits and a bonus combo and I must
say<00:02:38.640> these<00:02:39.090> figures<00:02:39.390> are<00:02:39.950> totally<00:02:40.950> exact<00:02:41.310> they

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
say these figures are totally exact they

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.750 
say these figures are totally exact they
can<00:02:41.850> change<00:02:42.270> but<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.200> overall<00:02:43.980> feeling

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
can change but this is overall feeling

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.140 
can change but this is overall feeling
accurate<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.320> with<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> super<00:02:47.250> break<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:47.940> can

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
accurate so with a super break you can

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.260 
accurate so with a super break you can
get<00:02:48.330> seven<00:02:48.810> hits<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.320> any<00:02:50.310> people<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.880> five

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
get seven hits and any people on five

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.890 
get seven hits and any people on five
hits<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.050> combo<00:02:52.500> or<00:02:52.950> two<00:02:53.610> hits<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.510> bonus

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
hits and a combo or two hits and a bonus

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.000 
hits and a combo or two hits and a bonus
combo<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.600> same<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.500> tap<00:02:58.709> Wars

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
combo so it's the same as the tap Wars

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.030 
combo so it's the same as the tap Wars
