00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.660 
it takes a long time to get however
though<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.380> use<00:00:37.590> my<00:00:37.829> tactics<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.520> this

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
though if you use my tactics in this

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.000 
though if you use my tactics in this
video<00:00:38.969> it'll<00:00:39.629> probably<00:00:39.899> only<00:00:40.170> take<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.980> about

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
video it'll probably only take you about

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.130 
video it'll probably only take you about
10<00:00:41.879> minutes<00:00:42.180> assuming<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.110> already

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

that<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> don't<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.090> an<00:01:30.240> Eevee<00:01:30.509> at<00:01:30.659> all<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that you don't have an Eevee at all the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.780 
that you don't have an Eevee at all the
first<00:01:31.409> thing<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.650> want<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.250> fly<00:01:32.460> over

first thing you want to do is fly over
to<00:01:32.820> cyllage<00:01:33.360> town<00:01:33.540> which<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> town<00:01:34.140> where

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
to cyllage town which is the town where

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.050 
to cyllage town which is the town where
you<00:01:34.380> get<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> second<00:01:34.920> badge<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> game<00:01:35.549> fly

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
you get the second badge in the game fly

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.240 
you get the second badge in the game fly
to<00:01:36.119> cyllage<00:01:36.540> town<00:01:36.810> head<00:01:37.110> north<00:01:37.439> into<00:01:37.590> route<00:01:37.920> 10

to cyllage town head north into route 10

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.920 
to cyllage town head north into route 10
and<00:01:38.670> then<00:01:38.850> you're<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.150> see<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.570> grass

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
and then you're going to see a grass

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.870 
and then you're going to see a grass
patch<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.680> yellow<00:01:40.950> roses<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.820> all

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
patch with yellow roses in it and all

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.429 
patch with yellow roses in it and all
you<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.150> do<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.509> run<00:01:42.720> back<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:42.930> forth<00:01:43.140> in

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
you have to do is run back and forth in

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.899 
you have to do is run back and forth in
the<00:01:43.500> grass<00:01:43.710> patch<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.579> eventually

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the grass patch and then eventually

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.030 
the grass patch and then eventually
you're<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> encounter<00:01:45.990> an<00:01:46.439> Eevee<00:01:46.829> all

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you're going to encounter an Eevee all

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
you're going to encounter an Eevee all
you<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.850> catch<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.479> Eevee<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
you have to do is catch the Eevee and I

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.080 
you have to do is catch the Eevee and I
guess<00:01:49.320> that's<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.950> step<00:01:50.310> zero<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
guess that's going to be step zero of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.999 
guess that's going to be step zero of
this<00:01:51.299> tutorial<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.140> daggits<00:01:52.439> sylveon<00:01:52.860> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
this tutorial and a daggits sylveon so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.859 
this tutorial and a daggits sylveon so
right<00:01:53.579> now<00:01:53.759> there's<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.299> four

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
right now there's going to be four

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.810 
right now there's going to be four
different<00:01:55.350> scenarios<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.490> after

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
different scenarios that you have after

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.490 
different scenarios that you have after
you<00:01:57.149> caught<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.540> Eevee<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> first<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.380> is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you caught the Eevee the first one is

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560 
you caught the Eevee the first one is
that<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.710> caught<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.100> Eevee<00:01:59.460> at<00:01:59.549> level<00:01:59.850> 19<00:02:00.299> of

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that you caught the Eevee at level 19 of

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.959 
that you caught the Eevee at level 19 of
which<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.619> means<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.490> Eevee<00:02:02.939> is

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
which that means that this Eevee is

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.940 
which that means that this Eevee is
going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.390> already<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:04.079> fairy<00:02:04.500> type<00:02:04.710> move

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
going to already have a fairy type move

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.740 
going to already have a fairy type move
in<00:02:05.100> its<00:02:05.250> repertoire<00:02:05.729> which<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.570> course

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
in its repertoire which is of course

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.869 
in its repertoire which is of course
babydoll<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.950> you're<00:02:08.190> lucky<00:02:08.340> enough<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
babydoll I so you're lucky enough to

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.089 
babydoll I so you're lucky enough to
actually<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.599> level<00:02:09.869> 19<00:02:10.379> Eevee<00:02:10.619> you're

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
actually get a level 19 Eevee you're

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.540 
actually get a level 19 Eevee you're
already<00:02:11.370> done<00:02:11.670> with<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> first

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
already done with the first

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.710 
already done with the first
which<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.940> get<00:02:13.090> an<00:02:13.210> Eevee<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:13.690> a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
which is to get an Eevee with a

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.750 
which is to get an Eevee with a
fairy-type<00:02:14.230> move<00:02:14.490> unfortunately<00:02:15.490> if<00:02:15.610> you

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
fairy-type move unfortunately if you

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.210 
fairy-type move unfortunately if you
caught<00:02:15.940> an<00:02:16.090> Eevee<00:02:16.450> at<00:02:16.600> level<00:02:16.870> 20<00:02:17.260> or<00:02:17.470> above<00:02:17.500> you

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
caught an Eevee at level 20 or above you

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.740 
caught an Eevee at level 20 or above you
have<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.520> do<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> little<00:02:18.910> bit<00:02:19.090> more<00:02:19.270> work<00:02:19.510> in

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
have to do a little bit more work in

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.570 
have to do a little bit more work in
order<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.020> get<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.380> Eevee<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.950> learn<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> fairy

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
order to get this Eevee to learn a fairy

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.010 
order to get this Eevee to learn a fairy
type<00:02:21.820> move<00:02:22.030> there<00:02:22.240> are<00:02:22.360> three<00:02:22.600> different<00:02:22.870> ways

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
type move there are three different ways

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.200 
type move there are three different ways
to<00:02:23.050> do<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.470> first<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:24.280> can<00:02:24.460> just<00:02:24.490> level<00:02:25.060> up

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
to do this first you can just level up

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.750 
to do this first you can just level up
the<00:02:25.330> Eevee<00:02:25.780> until<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.410> learns<00:02:26.650> charm<00:02:27.190> at<00:02:27.490> level

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the Eevee until it learns charm at level

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.580 
the Eevee until it learns charm at level
29<00:02:28.060> that's<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.630> first<00:02:28.870> way<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.080> can<00:02:29.320> do<00:02:29.440> it

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
29 that's the first way you can do it

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.890 
29 that's the first way you can do it
the<00:02:30.130> second<00:02:30.460> way<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.730> actually<00:02:31.330> breed<00:02:31.660> more

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
the second way is to actually breed more

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.540 
the second way is to actually breed more
EVs<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.560> then<00:02:32.740> start<00:02:33.010> with<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.130> brand<00:02:33.430> new

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
EVs and then start with a brand new

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.610 
EVs and then start with a brand new
Eevee<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.180> level<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.540> Eevee<00:02:34.870> up<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.170> level<00:02:35.440> 9

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
Eevee and level that Eevee up to level 9

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.770 
Eevee and level that Eevee up to level 9
where<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.310> does<00:02:36.520> learn<00:02:36.820> baby<00:02:37.030> doll<00:02:37.300> eyes<00:02:37.510> or

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
where it does learn baby doll eyes or

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.690 
where it does learn baby doll eyes or
the<00:02:37.900> third<00:02:38.080> option<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.650> just<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.920> go<00:02:39.130> over<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.670> a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
the third option is just to go over to a

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.910 
the third option is just to go over to a
dead<00:02:39.970> Amell<00:02:40.240> town<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.690> go<00:02:41.110> over<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.710> move

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
dead Amell town and go over to the move

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.860 
dead Amell town and go over to the move
reel<00:02:42.220> earner<00:02:42.400> give<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.910> women<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.300> heart<00:02:43.540> scale

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
reel earner give the women a heart scale

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.050 
reel earner give the women a heart scale
and<00:02:44.140> then<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.530> can<00:02:44.800> just<00:02:44.980> relearn<00:02:45.490> baby<00:02:45.850> doll

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
and then you can just relearn baby doll

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.970 
and then you can just relearn baby doll
eyes<00:02:46.240> that<00:02:46.570> way<00:02:46.750> on<00:02:46.990> that<00:02:47.170> Eevee<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.680> those<00:02:47.830> are

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
eyes that way on that Eevee so those are

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.040 
eyes that way on that Eevee so those are

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
three ways yes it does take a little bit

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.690 
three ways yes it does take a little bit
more<00:02:50.200> time<00:02:50.410> if<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.740> are<00:02:50.860> not<00:02:51.040> lucky<00:02:51.400> enough<00:02:51.430> to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
more time if you are not lucky enough to

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.090 
more time if you are not lucky enough to
