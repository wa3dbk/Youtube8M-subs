00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello everyone Bender and today I 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.779
 tell you about the mod that will add 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.570
 maycroft is the real water yes 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.880
 exactly lego and what i would like to say about 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.320
 oleg that's such a house I built from 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.030
 this very lek in mykraft 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.100
 in just a few minutes 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.590
 Of course this is not a masterpiece in real life 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.359
 pouring out did much more cool things 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.310
 by the way about lego 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.350
 after all she had a childhood personally 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.630
 I still do not have a tank with 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.179
 By this very Lego remember in childhood ctac 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.980
 persuaded parents to buy it in general I 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.559
 I wanted to ask you friends if you have 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.780
 also was lego or you are active they played 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.969
 then like this video look 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.040
 how many logo lovers we have but okay 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.780
 let's go to the sea and actually 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.760
 saying here in a few seconds I 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.670
 put this house u can go 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.190
 something break well yes break it 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.410
 will only be possible in creative mode or 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.030
 if you beat for a long time without creative mode and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.789
 such blocks fall out 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.160
 which we can put back to 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.870
 these same league blocks can only be taken 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.390
 from creative mode and in normal mode you 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.220
 don't get it in my opinion 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.380
 a little bit strange but on the other hand 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.659
 to build such a house it took me 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.939
 very very many of these lego panels you 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.729
 see for yourself and craft them probably was 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.619
 would be very expensive let's see how 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.110
 it all looks and works go in 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.090
 Creative mode is opening e and here we have 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.549
 as you can see there is a new inventory 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.830
 the second so on him and here we are 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.930
 displayed lego colors we have here 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.470
 quite a lot let's try 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 count them 10 and so let's do it again 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.770
 together 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 13 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.020
 colors a strange number actually 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.210
 but in no less than 13 different colors we have 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.100
 will be lego and you can build from them 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.090
 completely different things let's take 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.880
 to each 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.009
 for each type of lego in hand and I'll show 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.229
 you all of them strictly speaking and how with him 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.000
 be controlled because you need to know what 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.399
 complex keyboard shortcuts really 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.560
 no, now I will show you everything and so they took 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.140
 we are also all possible 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.959
 lego blocks are only red and 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.759
 let's see 1 league block this is the most 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.860
 here is the usual single league 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.780
 block of it can do all the turrets 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.760
 anything from it can be done in 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.280
 In my childhood, they were constantly erased 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.590
 that's serious so much i lost them then 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.900
 mom still went and quarreled in apartment 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.970
 they say what are you doing son why are you 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.790
 I lost and then clean you all should 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.950
 Generally yes they scolded me for what I was losing and 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.049
 spread all over the apartment what of them 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.579
 you can do anything man 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.040
 In general, anything you can from them 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.739
 fast and that's cool looking further 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.690
 next we have a double such unit and for sure 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.430
 you can also build for example you can 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.819
 yourself build another talk with 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.769
 him as you are such an option a cool and 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.750
 also to deploy such a block 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.569
 I have for example put here and so and I 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.310
 need to put it horizontally well 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.750
 If you look at the top, that is, if here 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.760
 so here they stand upright I need 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.049
 put horizontally I just have to 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.030
 hold down the shift button 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.670
 I set the shift button and voila I can 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.560
 do not stand them vertically 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.930
 horizontally ux start talking already 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.420
 actually say yes just as well further 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.099
 we have a triple block and in the same way 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.410
 he turns around if you call 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.019
 shift further we have a quad block and 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.690
 Peter but also such a long block 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.560
 by the way one ordinary maycroft unit 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.660
 consists as far as I understood from 5 5 years before 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.669
 5 of such blocks 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.769
 that is, you can even make a cube of 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.660
 these years, the cube is done if 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.760
 try but we won't right now with this 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.190
 continue to work with us 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.290
 here are two two cube lego further we have 3 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.030
 2 cube lego goes them just as well 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.340
 You can expand and press shift 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:47.040
 further 4 by 2 google it either lego cube 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.560
 Yes, and the last is with us as far as I am 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.200
 I remember 6 by 2, that is , we do not have 5 by 2 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.150
 I think there was no dice at all 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.380
 have unfortunately long such big 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.470
 flat and 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.569
 Kubrikov who were a real Lego 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.390
 I personally have been exactly remember 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.250
 such long flat panels and of them 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.620
 it was already possible to build something for example 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.870
 grounds for some future buildings 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.269
 this is unfortunately no but nonetheless 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.359
 already from the fact that there is this mikroft 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.980
 fashion you can build a lot of cool 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.230
 Strictly speaking this is such a mod here 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.000
 Such are the Lego bricks and advise you 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.370
 use them somehow to 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.500
 decorate for example something in my 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.600
 minecraft least is really cool and 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.450
 don't know what it reminded me of this mod 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.000
 I did not remind a little of the mini-box 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.100
 called fashion where it was possible to build from 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.410
 small blocks but here you can build 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.750
 and the real lego that my 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.820
 look where is steeper to be honest and so 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.460
 own it all thank you all for 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.310
