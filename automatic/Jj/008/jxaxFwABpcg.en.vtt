 with the information 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.040
 after the resounding victory of hugo 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.990
 Chávez in the elections of Venezuela 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.970
 all the topics and lies handled 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.880
 by the big international media 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.330
 during the election campaign they have fallen 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.580
 abruptly like a house of cards 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.160
 one the technical tie they announced 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.620
 these means even though the immense 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.110
 most of the surveys predicted 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.930
 the result that finally a 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.870
 advantage for Chávez higher than 11 percent 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.899
 cent 2 that venezuela is a state 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.359
 authoritarian without democracy these 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.760
 Elections have mobilized more than 80 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.010
 percent of the electorate a figure of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.500
 participation that makes a fool of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.929
 means and governments of countries that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.269
 They intend to give lessons in democracy to 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.820
 venezuela in the last elections 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.400
 presidential elections in the USA where 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.240
 reached the highest participation in a 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.330
 century 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.360
 voted as a record figure 65 percent 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.670
 in Venezuela governed by Chavez 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.260
 They have called 15 electoral consultations 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.820
 in 14 years 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.670
 the government of venezuela for example 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.820
 convened a binding referendum in 2007 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.340
 to reform the constitution in 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.760
 contrast in Spain 'the big two 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.070
 parties approved in 2011 without consultation 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.500
 some to the citizenship and by imposition 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.020
 of international creditors a 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.520
 constitutional modification that prioritizes 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.690
 the payment of the debt over the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.550
 pensions and other social expenses 3 that 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.950
 the Venezuelan government has used in 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.410
 these elections your supposed control of 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.800
 the media nothing more 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.550
 false in Venezuela 85% of these 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.190
 media supported the opposition of the 111 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.620
 TV channels only 13 are of the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.640
 state and the private ones are in their immense 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.110
 most clearly opponents now after 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.660
 the defeat of his candidate enrique 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.209
 captain the message that the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.340
 great international media is that of 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.740
 the alleged political fracture of 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.720
 venezuela according to this thesis that never 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.200
 apply to elections in europe by 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.890
 example given that 44% oppose the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.590
 President 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.500
 this should govern also for this 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.959
 part of the population conclusion 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.480
 Chávez must renounce the policies of 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.850
 socialist orientation that supposedly 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.060
 fracture in the country but for which 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.770
 he has been voted by the majority 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.140
 but what policies are these 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.420
 these means have not informed us and that 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.940
 explain why hugo chávez 14 years 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.760
 then it's still backed by the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.650
 Venezuelan society means not us 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.569
 have spoken of the decline to half of the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.090
 unemployment since Chávez entered 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.400
 government of the total eradication of 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.980
 illiteracy of the creation of a 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.510
 public and free health system that 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.570
 has mainly benefited the population 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.570
 poorest of the drastic decline in 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:16.650
 poverty from 44 to 27 percent 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.650
 and extreme poverty from 25 to 7% 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.570
 thanks to the so-called social missions 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.450
 of the government some of them in 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.880
 cooperation with Cuba for the creation of 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.310
 22 new universities that have 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.220
 converted to venezuela in the fifth country 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.140
 of the world in enrollment rate 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.240
 public housing programs 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.360
 subsidized for families more 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.460
 humble and is that possibly does not exist 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.460
 international political figure in the 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.350
 last years more demonized and demonized 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.350
 manipulated in the media that the 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.820
 Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez as 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.980
 the paschal journalist reminds us 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.480
 serrano when Chavez called a 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.670
 referendum to eliminate the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.110
 constitution the limit in the number of 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.480
 presidential terms 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.300
 Venezuela was then compared with others 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.950
 states of the world like Spain but in 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.800
 the media repeated that chávez 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.110
 he proposed to become president 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.630
 for life when he proposed in nations 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.480
 joined a reform to democratize the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.430
 The media only informed that 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.730
 he had insulted President George 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.740
 bush saying here it smells like sulfur and 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.169
 when we saw him on television sing a 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.660
 ranchera no means told us that in 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.820
 that same act was inaugurated in all 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.910
 venezuela hundreds of offices 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.220
 doctors if they lie to us and hide us 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.650
 information these means would have to 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.210
 wonder why citizens do not 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.389
 He also directs his unworthy 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.699
 towards this powerful fourth power that 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.039
 shapes public opinion according to the 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:51.400
 model of society that responds to its 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:54.400
 obvious class interests 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.449
 Chávez is a dictator is a stranger 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:03.070
 dictator however won 8 elections 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:06.250
 in 5 years and now recently in the 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.400
 referendum was the first president in 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:13.949
 the history of humanity that put its 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.949
 resignation to people
