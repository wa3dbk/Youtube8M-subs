00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.180 
and I think everyone coming out you do
something<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.809> good<00:00:45.840> cause<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.829> raises

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
something for a good cause just raises

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.279

and the France against breast cancer for
my<00:00:51.660> team<00:00:51.870> perspective<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.559> something
