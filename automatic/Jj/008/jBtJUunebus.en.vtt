either of these really would be

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.350 
either of these really would be
fantastic<00:02:49.610> closed<00:02:50.610> cutting<00:02:51.239> machines<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:54.030> as

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
fantastic closed cutting machines and as

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.360 
fantastic closed cutting machines and as
for<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.870> handle<00:02:55.320> well<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.920> g10<00:02:56.340> handle

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
for the handle well the g10 handle

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.240 
for the handle well the g10 handle
scales<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:57.239> dimpled<00:02:57.720> texturing<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.500> you

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
scales with dimpled texturing and you

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.240 
scales with dimpled texturing and you
see<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.850> contour<00:03:00.360> of<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.540> handle<00:03:00.930> there<00:03:01.250> it

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
see the contour of the handle there it

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.290 
see the contour of the handle there it
does<00:03:02.550> have<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:03.290> four<00:03:04.290> position<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:05.300> four

does have a four position a four
position<00:03:06.540> pocket<00:03:07.470> clip<00:03:08.239> then<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.480> see

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
position pocket clip then you see

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.960 
position pocket clip then you see
obviously<00:03:10.350> locked<00:03:10.920> back<00:03:11.220> closed

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970

obviously locked back closed
construction<00:03:14.269> right<00:03:15.269> but<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.690> way<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.840> handle

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.610 
construction right but the way to handle
kind<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.489> conforms<00:03:18.090> right<00:03:18.390> your<00:03:18.930> thumb<00:03:19.200> pad<00:03:19.410> is

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
kind of conforms right your thumb pad is

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.250

right there thumb ramp there indentation
there<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:27.060> see<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:28.049> know<00:03:29.120> it's<00:03:30.120> meant<00:03:30.480> to

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
there and you see you know it's meant to

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.190 
there and you see you know it's meant to
give<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.380> good<00:03:31.920> solid<00:03:32.250> grip<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:36.720> opening

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
give you a good solid grip the opening

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.960 
give you a good solid grip the opening
hole<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.650> rather<00:03:37.980> small<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.610> diameter

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
hole is rather small in diameter

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.140 
hole is rather small in diameter
compared<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.079> many<00:03:40.260> other<00:03:40.350> spider<00:03:40.920> codes<00:03:41.310> but

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
compared to many other spider codes but

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.960 
compared to many other spider codes but
I<00:03:42.209> think<00:03:42.540> that's<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.170> function<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:44.010> the

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
I think that's just a function of the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.789 
I think that's just a function of the
blade<00:03:45.570> itself<00:03:45.989> being<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.890> fairly<00:03:47.760> narrow

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
blade itself being a fairly narrow

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.060 
blade itself being a fairly narrow
alright<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:50.180> as<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.209> lock<00:03:51.540> back<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.769> know<00:03:52.890> the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
alright and as a lock back you know the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.500 
alright and as a lock back you know the
opening<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.900> lot<00:03:55.350> stiffer<00:03:56.090> than<00:03:57.090> on<00:03:57.299> this

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
opening is a lot stiffer than on this

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.289 
opening is a lot stiffer than on this
like<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.650> liner<00:03:58.920> locks<00:03:59.250> like<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.730> Spyderco

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
like the liner locks like the Spyderco

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.509 
like the liner locks like the Spyderco
military<00:04:00.810> for<00:04:01.079> example<00:04:01.130> you're<00:04:02.130> not<00:04:02.280> going<00:04:02.459> to

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
military for example you're not going to

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.330 
military for example you're not going to
flick<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.970> open<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:04.560> know<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:04.890> it's<00:04:05.040> not<00:04:05.100> as

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
flick it open you know so it's not as

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.729 
flick it open you know so it's not as
good<00:04:05.519> for<00:04:05.730> playing<00:04:06.000> with<00:04:06.299> but<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.230> lock<00:04:07.440> back

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
good for playing with but the lock back

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.500 
good for playing with but the lock back
does<00:04:08.100> offer<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:09.739> slimmer<00:04:10.739> handle<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:12.209> it's

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
does offer a slimmer handle and it's

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.270 
does offer a slimmer handle and it's
very<00:04:12.780> strong<00:04:13.790> as<00:04:14.790> for<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.329> opening<00:04:15.780> itself

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
very strong as for the opening itself

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.750 
very strong as for the opening itself
you<00:04:17.280> know<00:04:17.400> just<00:04:17.669> give<00:04:17.850> it<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.060> decisive

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
you know just give it a decisive

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.560 
you know just give it a decisive
decisive<00:04:20.760> motion<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:24.060> know<00:04:24.180> it's<00:04:24.360> definitely

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
decisive motion you know it's definitely

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.140 
decisive motion you know it's definitely
stiffer<00:04:25.440> than<00:04:25.620> their<00:04:25.830> liner<00:04:26.099> locks

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
stiffer than their liner locks

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.790 
stiffer than their liner locks
but<00:04:30.110> still<00:04:31.110> opens<00:04:31.530> pretty<00:04:32.130> easily<00:04:33.800> completely

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
but still opens pretty easily completely

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.050 
but still opens pretty easily completely
ambidextrous<00:04:35.639> obviously<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:41.520> lockup

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
ambidextrous obviously and the lockup

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.629 
ambidextrous obviously and the lockup
the<00:04:42.870> lockup<00:04:43.320> is<00:04:43.500> good<00:04:43.800> no<00:04:44.759> play<00:04:46.310> all<00:04:47.310> right<00:04:47.520> now

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
the lockup is good no play all right now

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.080 
the lockup is good no play all right now
when<00:04:47.880> it's<00:04:48.030> actually<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:49.259> know<00:04:49.289> in<00:04:49.620> hand<00:04:50.090> you

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
when it's actually you know in hand you

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.010 
when it's actually you know in hand you
can<00:04:51.120> see<00:04:51.509> it<00:04:52.009> the<00:04:53.009> shape<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.550> handle<00:04:54.020> you

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
can see it the shape of the handle you

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.580 
can see it the shape of the handle you
know<00:04:55.139> it<00:04:55.320> puts<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:56.100> puts<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.699> blade<00:04:57.259> at<00:04:58.259> this

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
know it puts it puts the blade at this

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.090 
know it puts it puts the blade at this
particular<00:04:59.190> angle<00:04:59.460> which<00:04:59.910> happens<00:05:00.389> to<00:05:00.570> be

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
particular angle which happens to be

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.550 
particular angle which happens to be
very<00:05:02.100> good<00:05:02.250> for<00:05:02.669> slashing<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.510> pretty<00:05:04.350> good

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
very good for slashing and pretty good

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.370 
very good for slashing and pretty good
for<00:05:04.800> close<00:05:05.039> cutting<00:05:05.460> as<00:05:05.580> well<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.139> think

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
for close cutting as well and I think

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.870 
for close cutting as well and I think
that's<00:05:07.560> a<00:05:07.680> good<00:05:07.860> design<00:05:08.220> I<00:05:08.250> mean<00:05:08.550> it<00:05:08.669> goes

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
that's a good design I mean it goes

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.879 
that's a good design I mean it goes
along<00:05:09.120> with<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.630> whole<00:05:09.870> idea<00:05:10.470> of<00:05:10.789> this<00:05:11.789> as<00:05:12.060> a

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
along with the whole idea of this as a

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.490 
along with the whole idea of this as a
police<00:05:13.889> folder<00:05:14.419> backing<00:05:15.419> up<00:05:15.600> their<00:05:15.840> firearm

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
police folder backing up their firearm

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.570 
police folder backing up their firearm
and<00:05:18.110> you<00:05:19.110> know<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.949> would<00:05:20.070> make<00:05:20.280> a<00:05:20.310> great

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
and you know it would make a great

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.839 
and you know it would make a great
slasher<00:05:21.360> I<00:05:21.539> mean<00:05:22.070> you<00:05:23.070> know<00:05:23.190> not<00:05:23.370> so<00:05:23.639> much<00:05:23.789> a

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
slasher I mean you know not so much a

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.080 
slasher I mean you know not so much a
stabber<00:05:24.270> well<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.810> could<00:05:25.310> but<00:05:26.310> you<00:05:26.820> know<00:05:26.849> it's

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
stabber well you could but you know it's

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.550 
stabber well you could but you know it's
certainly<00:05:27.300> not<00:05:27.660> you<00:05:27.990> know<00:05:28.110> it's<00:05:28.289> certainly

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
certainly not you know it's certainly

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.980 
certainly not you know it's certainly
not<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.830> classic<00:05:29.370> dagger<00:05:29.849> but<00:05:30.539> more<00:05:30.840> of<00:05:30.900> a

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
not a classic dagger but more of a

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.540 
not a classic dagger but more of a
slasher<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.740> clothes<00:05:32.010> cutter<00:05:34.160> now<00:05:35.160> what<00:05:35.400> do

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
slasher and a clothes cutter now what do

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
looks and the design of the play I mean

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.520 
looks and the design of the play I mean
it's<00:05:53.820> just<00:05:53.880> it's<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.330> very<00:05:54.360> attractive<00:05:54.900> blade<00:05:55.500> I

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
mean it's not you know I think I mean if

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.080 
mean it's not you know I think I mean if
you're<00:06:00.960> a<00:06:00.990> Spyderco<00:06:01.650> collector<00:06:02.310> I<00:06:02.550> think

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
you're a Spyderco collector I think

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.790 
you're a Spyderco collector I think
you're<00:06:03.270> gonna<00:06:03.389> want<00:06:03.720> this<00:06:03.960> you<00:06:04.349> know<00:06:04.470> just

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
I guess I'd consider it a variant of the

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.640 
I guess I'd consider it a variant of the
classic<00:06:13.110> Spyderco<00:06:13.740> police<00:06:14.960> and<00:06:15.960> you<00:06:16.470> don't
