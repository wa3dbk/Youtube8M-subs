00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.290
 Hey Hey! 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.630
 We'll look at what clicker training is and how it starts. 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.309
 What is clicker training? Clicker training is the classic conditioning of the cat 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.400
 to a specific marker signal - 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.980
 for example, the clicker. 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.070
 What do we do with classical conditioning? 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.770
 Quite simple: The cat connects this marker signal, ie the clicker noise, 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.110
 with a reward 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.580
 and he knows when she is rewarded for a certain act and 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.460
 will repeat this behavior over and over again. 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.900
 What do you need for clicker training? 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.100
 First, a cat, 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.140
 I suppose you have at home, 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.310
 second, a clicker noise 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.400
 and third, a reward for the cat. 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.760
 How do I generate the clicker noise? 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.200
 Either I just buy a clicker 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.900
 There are in different versions 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.850
 or 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.260
 I use 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.510
 For example, simply write a ball. 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.520
 This one has the advantage that he 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.500
 a very concise, short and memorable sound 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.220
 produces and I can 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.780
 Also use it very well for clicker training 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.620
 because he is not too loud for cats 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 and the noise is generally rare in everyday life. (At least at our home) 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.340
 Of course, I can also generate the sound myself 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.859
 if it's a very short sound that I can do very fast 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.650
 and that sounds the same again and again. 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:43.520
 For example, you can hear the sound [tongue-click] 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.230
 use. 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.810
 Just think of a sound. 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.850
 For the rewards, you can use treats, for example, 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.720
 or kitten food or small pieces of dried meat. 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.230
 Ideally, really little bits 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.450
 so you can eat them very fast and you can eat them too 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.469
 can give very fast. 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.489
 Has the advantage of being easy 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.759
 can train relatively quickly. 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.509
 If you currently have nothing at home but still want to start immediately, 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.489
 Of course you can also use some natural yoghurt 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.989
 and give small drops of it. 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.980
 That's what most cats can handle 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.400
 if you only get it from time to time also quite good. 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.139
 Important especially for the first clicker training is that the cat 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.759
 not distracted. Other cats 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.539
 The best way out of the room in which you want to train. 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.269
 Or you just "lock in" with your cat in the room you want to train in. 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.499
 Best also turn off the radio and TV, 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:54.859
 otherwise the cat will be distracted by the clicker noise. 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.379
 How do you best start with clicker training? 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.360
 Very easily: 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.739
 First step: 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.889
 Click 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.829
 Second step: Immediately, give a reward within 1-2 seconds. 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.249
 and just repeat that 10-20 times, take a break 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.869
 and repeat again 10 to 20 times a few hours later. 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:24.609
 How long does it take for the cat to be conditioned to clicker noise? 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.180
 depends entirely on the cat 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.369
 and of course, depending on how precise you work 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.800
 and if the treat is really one or two seconds after the click. 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.540
 How do you know if the cat is conditioned to the sound? 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.160
 For example, if you see the cat turn away from you 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.120
 or she walks away from you, then just click once 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.480
 and the cat turns to you or 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.899
 make another move to look for the treat, 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:02.779
 then you know that your cat has understood and learned the clicker noise.
