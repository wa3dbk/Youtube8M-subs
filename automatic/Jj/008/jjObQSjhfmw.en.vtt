Beats<00:00:48.859> Audio<00:00:49.730> I<00:00:50.179> believe<00:00:50.420> that<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:50.600> sound

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
Beats Audio I believe that the sound

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.119 
Beats Audio I believe that the sound
card<00:00:50.929> in<00:00:51.109> the<00:00:51.199> speaker<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:51.679> you<00:00:51.739> get<00:00:51.920> really

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.069 
really crystal clear audio playback it
also<00:00:54.649> has<00:00:54.829> a<00:00:54.859> 13.1<00:00:55.640> I<00:00:55.879> believe<00:00:56.120> HD<00:00:56.600> display

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
also has a 13.1 I believe HD display

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.000 
also has a 13.1 I believe HD display
they<00:00:57.829> also<00:00:57.980> have<00:00:58.100> two<00:00:58.309> USB<00:00:58.460> ports<00:00:58.899> HDMI<00:00:59.980> for<00:01:00.980> a
