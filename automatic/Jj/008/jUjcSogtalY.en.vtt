00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:11.620
 8 Hewlett Packard is doing a campaign to 1 per person 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.620
 The cheapest is 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:24.939
 Because the 39800 yen at 39,800 yen and the tax actually in the tax say how much was 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.939
 30,000 yen 1,800 yen 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.770
 Shipping costs 3000 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:38.219
 Subtotal 42,800 yen 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 Because the consumption tax costs っ percent against this 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:50.609
 It costs 3,420 yen and totals 46,224 yen 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:56.920
 It will be that but this is how cheap Canaan 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:01:01.739
 Are you looking at specs windows 8.164 bit 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.739
 Te amd you a 4 part mountain push 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:10.340
 It is turned on , so memory yoongi is enough- 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.909
 106.4 inches 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.580
 It is a liquid crystal 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.020
 a building 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.210
 Over 1366 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:25.080
 It has been 768 turns 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.430
 It may be enough or it may be optimal 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.270
 Hard disk popular key is a byte well 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:37.010
 It is more than enough for normal use . 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.900
 I also have radio and bluetooth on my own . Never this 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.530
 It's a whole story 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.210
 This kind of cheap guy bluetooth month 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.770
 I do not follow 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.270
 It is standard by default, and battery north time 30 minutes 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.200
 This would be normal 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.320
 I don't care 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:05.570
 With 1 year pick up repair service 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:08.200
 What is worried about with 39,800 yen in this content 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.200
 Right here 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.370
 am ion 5000 apu 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:21.950
 Say wedding of performance and what degree of 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.980
 However it because there was an article that would be helpful for the sides 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.370
 Let's take a look at this 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:34.239
 The title that is published on pc is a singer with a 6 d mold 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.770
 Architecture Teikuautoko apu a 4 to the 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.390
 It is an article to try 5000 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.819
 In Well fine story 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.350
 Even though it's also hurts to look towards the article 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.490
 Well, in the sense that its performance 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:56.650
 I think this is the easiest to understand 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.530
 This is a benchmark test post focused on pu processing 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.540
 I think that you will probably understand when you read 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:09.670
 In short, even though the performance'm low per school 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:15.880
 Because it has quadruple core, it has 4 steps so it has dual core as a whole 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:19.550
 The celeron line m the island is supposed to have equal or better performance 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:25.280
 Actual redness pretty systems also look to see finely 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:31.400
 There is a government official, but I think that it seems to be comparable enough as a whole 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:38.540
 Although it is a supplement, it seems that power consumption is quite low when it comes to a4 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.540
 Compared to celeron line m is the battery life is painful relatively long 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.680
 This point is also collar 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.440
 The price I because to say rattan is 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:55.360
 For the price of 3 kippa 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:57.200
 Emory's favor is piled up with this price that can be evaluated as quite a bargain 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.160
 The 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:06.400
 If a bluetooth is with 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.690
 If it's a pc that's easy to sleep here, it says that things that tend to be omitted are also properly attached 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.260
 Is 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.980
 The kana not it also good'm not quite 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.980
 think 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.860

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.950
 me 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.950
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.270
 Hmm
