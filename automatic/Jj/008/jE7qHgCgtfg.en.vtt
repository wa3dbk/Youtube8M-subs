00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.670
 we continue our mobility training 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.449
 we will undertake 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:09.939
 the first clip them 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:14.549
 he was placed on the carpet the amount to do it must be pressed the button 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.630
 left with expire of mouse 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.320
 or knife that I sponsor 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.270
 then you will drag it 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.650
 and drop him on the white rectangle which are so 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.949
 so you can put your clips we need right away 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.800
 so you see that the well first the first part what has been 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.670
 possible we will go I think look for the second part 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.970
 he lay right next 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.020
 to continue henri 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.870
 add more video clips and we will still choose it now 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.050
 this one 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.050
 view it can follow 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.970
 thanks my God 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.380
 philippe 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.449
 and we can also go the politician 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.010
 now that we can also quite prime that is to say cut a 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.170
 part of the clip that does not suit us 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.960
 finding it too long 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.960
 so we'll take for example the following text 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.359
 he wants to aim at the elysÃ©e 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.700
 and you see here at the bottom 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.190
 you signed here 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.950
 the split word that meant the cut in half 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.039
 one of his passengers in two parts 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.310
 so every time you go to press split told you to cut the clip 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 I'm reading 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.050
 I have my place on the horns 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.100
 Explain me 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.630
 I want to harry potter at this place just take a quick turn 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.340
 then you see that at that moment the clip and split into two parts 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 the first part that I can not see 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.230
 for the moment nothing stops we needed funds 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.790
 then the second part 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.790
 that's what's left 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:17.099
 we can still possibly be operated if we just want to cut in 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.059
 pieces but keep the end 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:23.229
 or at that time totally suppressed the army it's gone for the 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.890
 meal how to delete it is simply 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.379
 by selecting prices 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.379
 by right clicking on it 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.159
 I'm going to take the clip today and do it 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.789
 but that's for sure 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.309
 the assembly table 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.559
 and now let's move on to the compassion of the photos 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.539
 you go back in the left pane you put your mouse on what 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:52.069
 were carrying piquet pictures 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.039
 if you look good that president 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.389
 other 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.389
 left my pictures an image 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.099
 choose if needed 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.189
 images 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.129
 while obviously to go with the patrol of France I was not 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.829
 really great image 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.829
 we will try to put at that moment simply 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.859
 the same 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.230
 lack of space then you can obviously 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.250
 in the same way that we have selected clippers 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.549
 select multiple photos 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.549
 the juve account for example but everyone 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.999
 I remind you that you can also use the ctrl key 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:33.119
 power 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:36.499
 able to select multiple files a woman had selected one 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:37.119
 Photo 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:39.629
 you click again on not made 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.869
 and we saw colas the photos 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:45.719
 only pose and if it ensures the central part very quickly 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:48.979
 and more 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:53.369
 with the drag and drop I take a picture and in the same way I can 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:54.769
 go drop 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.929
 or look like 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:59.639
 following 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.899
 or by taking them back 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:05.139
 I want displaced is the master 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.859
 another place 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.289
 you still have the ability to move your clicks and photos to the 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:12.789
 assembly table 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:16.579
 if you want to have the biggest river first or move it 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.709
 the real estate market and furniture that everything is shifted and automatically 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.490
 you want to see her 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.479
 these flowers in the end I move you are you taxes place at the end 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.330
 so it's quite possible to 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.199
 change the order of your images of your clips it is also possible to 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.150
 delete a clip an image as it was done or while the rights 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.069
 then 8 in the submenu 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.930
 you click delete 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.930
 at that time another spade will be permanently deleted 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.379
 we will move on now after the game 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:56.300
 transition especially after the music part 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.970
 transitions what is it and well it's like doing a little 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.889
 slideshow in this sense dmc fact we will apply further photos 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.189
 eric lipp 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.699
 it is not an obligation to hand over each time you can put some 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.930
 from time to time but if you enjoy it you can put some 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.930
 between each click 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.430
 you do it according to your taste 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.729
 so you have placed the mouse on the displayed video transition 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.280
 by clicking on it you do not get all kinds of videos of two 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.089
 transitions 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:32.039
 at the start of course we do not really know what it's all about, so just 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.360
 click on a 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.360
 in a preview click on read to see what kind of transmission his 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.099
 girl 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.920
 you see that you have the parents you to support workers 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.120
 which 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.050
 here wheels for example the group select the wheels you click 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.599
 which ones to look at 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:50.810
 this date 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.279
 this transition is going 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:53.409
 you want to laugh 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.180
 try something else for example 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.620
 Tuesday 6 euros select the route 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.909
 you look at it 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.939
 when you have so 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:05.630
 a transition 2 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.010
 preferably for the first league the same way we did for the 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.300
 photos you drag the transition the harmony put it 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.300
 we can quite choose 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.300
 the same transition to different places 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.160
 if you want to use transitions for small videos 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.420
 you do exactly the same thing with for example this one so needs 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.599
 but to make it better 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:31.410
 and the man 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.620
 we are not able to put it as I told you earlier to 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.520
 every time 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.319
 now let's see what it looks like to see what it looks like 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.080
 well it must be remembered on the first 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.090
 we will do the addition from the beginning 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.639
 so you see and you have 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.379
 I see your transition 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:48.490
 finally arkema 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.490
 akasaka suffered would please 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:59.239
 more 

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:02.949
 during this time every month because the blues 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:07.419
 all of its peculiarities and years spent as often 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:09.029
 he was again selected 

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:11.779
 you scored each time 

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:14.289
 well 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:17.289
 the brand 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.949
 despite this sect happened 

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:25.059
 the truth if read more 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:28.180

 every time I see what you have 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:34.559

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:38.719

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:40.729
 evening while facing photos
