 little gardens but the thing is not even often not 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:28.410
 as a reward mouse up as a hire 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:30.619
 now the american gras and year fifth 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.619
 after 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.949
 life is Beautiful 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.949
 what folded 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:59.100
 keep hold chisels snow 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.740
 struggle but let's make a lagos to yes here 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.420
 being from the cascade painting of course should 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.760
 was jumping home country this magnifier she 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.090
 well done she pitching felt no departure 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.090
 began to risk 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.540
 here they deliver 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.540
 she is Vasily am metal 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.119
 but moves 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.520
 drunks 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.080
 yes try 30 schools and again single 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.670
 up to a nice figure downloaded charming 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.350
 max max need something not happened 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.260
 nose can be gone nose blood because 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.040
 that she I think that they are likely 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.100
 she paid saying riding time 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.320
 but I am trying to liberate think 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.200
 this is my cat voltage for what up 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.940
 when blood from the nose went this she 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.340
 tried to somehow stop well done 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.510
 coped with this flaw and talk 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.030
 very good figure skater good 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.850
 does not look like ice 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.350
 not enough missing 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.630
 yuri schweppes tnr we have no team 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.410
 who works with her I think that 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.840
 alicaps 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.030
 as the former ends the program puts 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.960
 deals with component programs 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.420
 printing 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.680
 Now now now right now, in general Alexander 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:27.080
 same your dance experience he is very 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.180
 valuable and singles sports couples then 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.540
 gliding small steps in the tracks and 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.800
 many people use just 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.020
 counseling and the world of dance 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.670
 professionals for what you know 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.450
 Andrei is still not a water isstra 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.830
 not a big danger because dancers 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.350
 utter so alone steps alone support 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.330
 yes there is a certain level to say 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.720
 muscular work yes is not necessary 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.310
 periphery glut on forgive 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.840
 shuffle step because after 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.940
 dance steps have to jump 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.460
 let social steps come to do 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.320
 support and there the steps should be 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.270
 put exactly under what or before 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.730
 this or after that comes another element 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.640
 so here sometimes you need to somehow 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.780
 be attentive and trainer 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.000
 sports couples and singles and on to 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.530
 working with dancers but this is a big other 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.170
 work out you know but what you 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.300
 just said it really is because the 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.400
 what many think about but little 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.050
 really somehow research 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.090
 serious on this subject the main thing is very little 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.890
 some seminars that rule on 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.270
 topic is actually a topic of curly from 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.890
 hotel choreography because 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.620
 figure skating choreography is not 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.210
 ballet choreography 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.520
 This essentially I express your if you as 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.480
 directors 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.760
 the choreographer passed yes and so 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.310
 people such elements of acrobatics catch up 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.990
 combine to combine correctly correctly 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.880
 just talking about the balance of what to do 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.400
 if you put what they balanced 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.620
 This is a very complicated link. 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.340
 the coaching team that is 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.960
 successes and then the athlete rises by 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.580
 sports career success up 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.660
 aggression silver medalist 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:04.940
 last year's junior world report 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:08.080
 his sister was really cool 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.790
 twin who is also 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.390
 like when you're skating 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.610
 yes crumbs 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.980
 seven years old started skating games now and 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.980
 will want 2 2 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.330
 no one can get ahead or land but 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:26.300
 really rolled and 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.300
 and according to land estimates
