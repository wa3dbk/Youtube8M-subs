different worlds there one other thing

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.359 
different worlds there one other thing
that<00:02:02.990> I'll<00:02:03.170> notice<00:02:03.470> here<00:02:03.649> is<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.190> build

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
that I'll notice here is that the build

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.490 
that I'll notice here is that the build
quality<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:05.240> pretty<00:02:05.539> good<00:02:05.659> on<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.050> slate<00:02:06.259> 7

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
quality is pretty good on the slate 7

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.559 
quality is pretty good on the slate 7
you<00:02:07.280> get<00:02:07.429> you<00:02:07.640> look<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:07.970> have<00:02:08.119> what<00:02:08.300> kind<00:02:08.450> of

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
you get you look you have what kind of

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.470 
you get you look you have what kind of
looks<00:02:08.720> like<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.899> middle<00:02:09.140> but<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.530> metal<00:02:10.480> lining

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
looks like a middle but a metal lining

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.370 
looks like a middle but a metal lining
around<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.900> sides

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
around the sides

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.199 
around the sides
the<00:02:12.680> bezel<00:02:12.920> however<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.610> front<00:02:13.880> seems<00:02:14.090> to

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
the bezel however on the front seems to

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.059 
the bezel however on the front seems to
be<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.360> little<00:02:14.690> bit<00:02:14.840> wider<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.680> sides<00:02:15.890> of

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
be a little bit wider on the sides of

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.220 
be a little bit wider on the sides of
the<00:02:16.220> slate<00:02:16.549> 7<00:02:16.850> it<00:02:17.420> seems<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.200> little

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
the slate 7 it seems to be just a little

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.410 
the slate 7 it seems to be just a little
bit<00:02:18.799> thinner<00:02:19.130> over<00:02:19.400> on<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.730> Nexus<00:02:20.030> 7<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.390> let's

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
bit thinner over on the Nexus 7 so let's

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.680 
bit thinner over on the Nexus 7 so let's
display<00:02:20.900> while<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.709> r7<00:02:22.310> inches<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:23.540> will

display while the r7 inches you will

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.420 
display while the r7 inches you will
have<00:02:23.989> a<00:02:24.019> little<00:02:24.380> bit<00:02:24.560> less<00:02:24.739> real<00:02:25.010> estate<00:02:25.310> on

the slate 7 by HP over here one of the

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.620 
the slate 7 by HP over here one of the

important differences between these two
