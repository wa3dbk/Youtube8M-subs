sources<00:00:36.670> of<00:00:36.790> beta-carotene<00:00:37.390> now

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
sources of beta-carotene now

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.900 
sources of beta-carotene now
beta-carotene<00:00:38.620> is<00:00:39.010> what<00:00:39.129> gives<00:00:39.309> sweet<00:00:39.580> potato

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
beta-carotene is what gives sweet potato

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.240 
beta-carotene is what gives sweet potato
that<00:00:40.120> bright<00:00:40.420> orange<00:00:41.230> color<00:00:41.590> and<00:00:41.920> it's

actually<00:00:42.340> a<00:00:42.580> really<00:00:42.790> powerful<00:00:43.350> antioxidant

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
actually a really powerful antioxidant

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.290 
actually a really powerful antioxidant
so<00:00:44.770> we<00:00:44.890> hear<00:00:45.040> about<00:00:45.070> antioxidants<00:00:45.520> all<00:00:46.059> of<00:00:46.210> the

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
so we hear about antioxidants all of the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.090 
so we hear about antioxidants all of the
time<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:46.780> basically<00:00:47.170> they're<00:00:47.470> substances

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
time and basically they're substances

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.030 
time and basically they're substances
that<00:00:48.370> fight<00:00:49.059> free<00:00:49.930> radicals<00:00:50.559> now<00:00:50.800> free

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
that fight free radicals now free

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.380 
that fight free radicals now free
radicals<00:00:51.489> are<00:00:51.580> little<00:00:51.790> scavengers<00:00:52.360> that

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
radicals are little scavengers that

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.360 
radicals are little scavengers that
damage<00:00:52.870> our<00:00:53.019> cells<00:00:53.260> in<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.589> body<00:00:53.739> and<00:00:54.100> that's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
damage our cells in the body and that's

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.530 
damage our cells in the body and that's
why<00:00:54.489> a<00:00:54.610> lot<00:00:54.670> of<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:54.940> research<00:00:55.269> surrounding

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
why a lot of the research surrounding

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.540 
why a lot of the research surrounding
beta-carotene<00:00:56.260> has<00:00:57.040> shown<00:00:57.309> that<00:00:57.339> it<00:00:57.519> can

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
beta-carotene has shown that it can

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.100 
beta-carotene has shown that it can
prevent<00:00:57.850> things<00:00:58.000> like<00:00:58.150> cancer<00:00:58.449> heart<00:00:59.019> disease

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
prevent things like cancer heart disease

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.560 
prevent things like cancer heart disease
macular<00:00:59.949> degeneration<00:01:00.010> all<00:01:00.790> that<00:01:01.420> to<00:01:01.540> say

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
macular degeneration all that to say

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.479 
macular degeneration all that to say

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
the skin on this is important because a

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.779 
the skin on this is important because a
lot<00:01:41.109> of<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.229> fiber<00:01:41.530> most<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.100> fiber<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:42.460> in

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
lot of the fiber most of the fiber is in

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.330 
lot of the fiber most of the fiber is in
the<00:01:43.149> actual<00:01:43.479> skin<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.170> when<00:01:44.619> we<00:01:44.770> cut<00:01:45.219> them

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
the actual skin and when we cut them

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.980 
the actual skin and when we cut them
into<00:01:45.520> fries<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.149> notice<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.719> skin

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
into fries and notice that the skin

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.840 
into fries and notice that the skin
actually<00:01:47.170> gives<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:47.770> really<00:01:47.920> nice<00:01:48.130> texture<00:01:48.579> and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
actually gives a really nice texture and

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.700 
actually gives a really nice texture and
it<00:01:48.939> helps<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.479> fries<00:01:49.719> pull<00:01:50.049> together<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.530> bit

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
it helps the fries pull together a bit

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.020 
it helps the fries pull together a bit
better<00:01:50.829> so<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.340> want<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.579> make<00:01:51.609> sure<00:01:51.729> that<00:01:51.880> you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
better so you want to make sure that you

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.700 
better so you want to make sure that you
watch<00:01:52.270> these<00:01:52.479> properly<00:01:53.020> with<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.380> vegetable

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
watch these properly with a vegetable
