00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.660

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:19.020

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.020
 At whatever price 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.039
 when you are hungry how are you the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.039
 pride 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.440
 When you are hungry you turn to a 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.850
 person who is totally free of 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.490
 proud because you are 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.010

 meeting where they want to touch us 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.620

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.949

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.810
 but when you are a hungry and a 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.000
 outgoing you are free from all pride 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.340
 you know why because everything is not like that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.780
 you care who is in front so do not 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.370
 you care who you have by your side 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.420
 simply your heart is 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.290
 you know he's there if you know he 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.310
 is if you want to touch what you 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.310
 you want to touch it 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.310
 that hunger for God is caused by the 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.610
 spirit itself you only have the conviction 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.369
 you only have the conviction that 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.130
 in front of a new site of something new 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.200
 what God wants to do is when in your 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.200
 inside you are convinced that 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.960

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.179

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.360

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:10.270

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.640
 when have you gone 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.860
 when you have been convinced by the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.680
 spirit of god is because he himself 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.989
 is causing 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.959
 I am convinced I am fully 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.849
 sure that we are facing a new 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.159
 time that God has determined 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.030
 manifest in this house 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.030

 I am totally sure that I know that I know 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.580
 I know there is a new cycle that has 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.209
 gestated in the heart of God for this 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.970
 time for this time for this house and 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.000

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.360

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.540
 a manifestation of his glory for this 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.540
 nation 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.330
 good 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.200
 when you know 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.090
 that God is determined to do something 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.510
 when you know it 's time to 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.810
 fulfillment of something new when you 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.080
 spirit has been enabled by the flow 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.980
 of the spirit of god and you feel the 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.350
 waves of the spirit that come sometimes 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.440
 you feel chills every time you feel 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.560
 soft fire feels it is trembling but 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.710
 you know that in your spirit you say there 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.440
 something else there is something else there is something else there 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.780
 something else there is something else there is something else or he 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.360

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.710
 he has something else for this house he has 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.710
 something more for this nation 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.140
 then what will happen 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.069
 they are the ones who pass it, you are not going to 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.069
 settle for nothing less 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.200
 v 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.939
 someone can tell you it was not good 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.640
 another spirit says it's not that I know that 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:14.600
 there's something else is that I know there's something 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.270
 plus 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.820
 the hungry do not settle for anything 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.950
 least until you see the perfect and full 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.980
 of God manifested then can 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.310
 sit down and say I'm satisfied or 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.400
 If I'm satisfied, God made him such 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.960
 as he had told me he would 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.960
 you know that otherwise 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:42.150
 you will be in your dissatisfied spirit 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.560
 looking looking hungry and thirsty 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.560
 see it manifest 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.610
 when we go out to the missions 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.620
 sometimes the people who accompany us from 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.570
 team we go with 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.570
 I am impregnated with blood 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.630
 they are impregnated with that demand 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:10.060
 remember that hunger is demand 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.130
 demand 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.040
 when you are an environment you know what 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.590
 come on you have a demand you put on 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.470
 sue god but not only 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.540
 God himself puts demand on you 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.370
 God himself puts you in demand of you 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.889
 about what he wants to do to 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.139
 through your life 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.360
 you know when you feel sued by 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.610
 God 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.800
 they know what it is to feel that demand for 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.930
 God 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.940
 that you become mutual you feel 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.160

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.080
 to sue god 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.150
 you feel sued by god that 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.880
 you have to look for more than you have to 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.560
 be more in his presence than 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.170
 you have to have a heart of a 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.310
 event worshiper demand but when 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.380

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.000

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.950
 God has put you know how are you going as 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.840
 someone who claims as someone who 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.060
 comes in front of him and someone who says 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.580
 oh god I want to see I hate you I want 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.430
 of the manifestation of your hateful glory 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.400
 I will not get out of this moment until 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.770
 I have experienced your presence until 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.260
 that you have manifested until I 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.290
 I have received the heartbeat of your heart 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.690
 until you have revealed to me the will and 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.300
 I do not know why he put you in demand to 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.820
 look for them but then you put demand 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.700
 in front of him and you become a person 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.860
 plaintiff in front of his presence 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.900
 you know when there is a demanding town you 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.140
 not after preaching anything 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.960
 when there is a demanding people you do not 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.270
 you can always improvise when there is a 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.730
 plaintive people you do not have to sue 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.920
 to God and tell them I go out to eat that 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.680
 town because it is the town that is 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.510
 suing you I feel sued 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.030
 for them for parents 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.940
 open the heavens because this town is 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.940
 extremely hungry these people have 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.150
 come divinely starved to death 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.150

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:12.360
 they were closing and we started praying 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:16.650
 soon and the voice of god and told me you're going to 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:20.150
 preach the adoration that causes goodbye 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.740
 and who message eye I enjoyed it 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:28.370
 because I knew it came from the mouth itself 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.370
 of god as green god having 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:36.669
 and at the end of the meeting 

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:36.669
 I told them today I'm satisfied 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.010
 but so you can walk in my 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.500
 time sometimes you go to 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.690
 Deprogram your time is not so much 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.680
 time is in God's time it is not in 

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:52.560

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.650

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.570
 sated 

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:14.110
 only they should not be satiated
