grade<00:00:16.520> set<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.640> clippers<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.410> I've<00:00:19.410> got<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> I

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
grade set of clippers and I've got a I

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.269 
grade set of clippers and I've got a I
guess<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.970> blade<00:00:21.570> on<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:22.100> which<00:00:23.100> is

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
guess it's a a blade on it which is

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.920 
guess it's a a blade on it which is
supposed<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.820> leave<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.269> guess<00:00:24.449> about<00:00:24.689> that

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
supposed to leave I guess about that

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.189 
supposed to leave I guess about that
much<00:00:25.170> there<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:26.310> I'm<00:00:26.730> going<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.140> flip<00:00:28.140> it

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
much there so I'm going to just flip it

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.589 
much there so I'm going to just flip it
on<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.650> give<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.310> try<00:00:29.580> hopefully<00:00:30.420> I'll<00:00:30.570> be

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
on and give it a try hopefully I'll be

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.659 
on and give it a try hopefully I'll be
in<00:00:30.869> frame<00:00:31.230> i<00:00:31.560> don't<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:31.980> if<00:00:32.070> i<00:00:32.160> will<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.399> not

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
in frame i don't know if i will or not

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.060 
in frame i don't know if i will or not
but<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.360> try<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.469> over<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> sink

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
but I'm going to try this over the sink

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.810 
but I'm going to try this over the sink
here<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:36.200> guess<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.590> starters<00:00:37.980> I'm<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.640> going

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
here I guess for starters I'm just going

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.740 
here I guess for starters I'm just going
to<00:00:38.850> come<00:00:39.059> right<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.570> what's<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:43.879> wow

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.280 

it's<00:00:48.750> quite<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> bunch<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.350> hair<00:00:49.559> there<00:00:50.510> so

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
it's quite a bunch of hair there so

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.540 
it's quite a bunch of hair there so
keep<00:00:53.860> on<00:00:54.100> fire<00:00:55.080> the<00:00:56.080> one<00:00:56.230> over<00:00:56.940> each<00:00:57.940> area<00:00:59.550> it's

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
keep on fire the one over each area it's

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.400 
keep on fire the one over each area it's
probably<00:01:01.120> gonna<00:01:01.510> be<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.690> mess<00:01:01.930> when<00:01:02.170> i'm<00:01:02.320> done

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
probably gonna be a mess when i'm done

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.410 
probably gonna be a mess when i'm done
but<00:01:05.410> it<00:01:05.830> can't<00:01:06.160> be<00:01:06.310> any<00:01:06.460> worse<00:01:06.520> than<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:06.970> is<00:01:07.180> now

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
but it can't be any worse than it is now

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.450 
but it can't be any worse than it is now
I<00:01:07.450> guess<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.170> worst<00:01:08.380> case<00:01:08.620> scenario<00:01:09.130> i'll

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
I guess the worst case scenario i'll

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.170 
I guess the worst case scenario i'll
just<00:01:09.670> take<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:10.000> all<00:01:10.150> off<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.610> you<00:01:12.790> should<00:01:12.970> gave

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
just take it all off and you should gave

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.570 
just take it all off and you should gave
my<00:01:13.360> head<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.700> I'm<00:01:16.000> just<00:01:16.180> coming<00:01:16.510> up<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.720> back

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
my head but I'm just coming up the back

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.250 
my head but I'm just coming up the back
as<00:01:18.580> you<00:01:18.640> can<00:01:18.940> see<00:01:19.740> long<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.920> here<00:01:21.130> falling<00:01:21.700> down

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
as you can see long it here falling down

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.960 
as you can see long it here falling down
I'm<00:01:23.260> not<00:01:23.410> even<00:01:23.680> gonna<00:01:23.800> worry<00:01:24.370> about<00:01:24.520> it<00:01:24.880> i'm

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
I'm not even gonna worry about it i'm

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.460 
I'm not even gonna worry about it i'm
just<00:01:25.030> gonna<00:01:25.300> let<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.479> fall<00:01:25.780> on<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:26.080> floor<00:01:26.110> and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
just gonna let it fall on the floor and

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.740 
just gonna let it fall on the floor and
squeeze<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:26.860> up<00:01:26.920> later<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:31.000> it's<00:01:31.150> coming<00:01:31.990> off

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
squeeze it up later but it's coming off

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:50.720 
squeeze it up later but it's coming off
all<00:01:34.750> kinds<00:01:35.410> of<00:01:35.470> hair<00:01:35.650> coming<00:01:35.950> off<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.160> me<00:01:36.430> now

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:25.850 

oh<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.900> high<00:01:52.020> setting<00:01:52.410> number<00:01:52.770> one

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.320 

that<00:02:26.670> seems<00:02:26.970> pretty<00:02:27.270> easy<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:28.320> done<00:02:29.330> over

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
that seems pretty easy it's done over

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.500 
that seems pretty easy it's done over
each<00:02:30.450> other<00:02:30.750> over<00:02:31.200> our<00:02:31.380> down<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.970> certainly

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
each other over our down it's certainly

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.650 
each other over our down it's certainly
not<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> tutorial<00:02:34.050> by<00:02:34.980> Amy

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.720 

pretty<00:02:42.230> easy<00:02:42.440> I've<00:02:42.740> seen<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.160> done<00:02:43.430> on<00:02:43.490> a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
pretty easy I've seen this done on a

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.710 
pretty easy I've seen this done on a
couple<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.120> other<00:02:44.270> YouTube<00:02:44.690> videos<00:02:45.140> and

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
couple of other YouTube videos and

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.710 
couple of other YouTube videos and
thought<00:02:47.720> i<00:02:47.750> would<00:02:48.140> put<00:02:48.350> myself<00:02:49.570> through<00:02:50.570> this

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
thought i would put myself through this

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.809 
thought i would put myself through this
guy

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.849 

seems<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.659> be<00:02:54.689> doing<00:02:54.930> pretty<00:02:55.109> good<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
seems to be doing pretty good on the

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:13.800 
seems to be doing pretty good on the
side<00:02:56.099> for<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:56.700> my<00:02:56.849> support

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:35.000 

knock<00:03:14.810> off<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.080> top<00:03:15.439> I<00:03:15.680> guess

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.740 

oh<00:03:35.069> wow<00:03:36.650> there<00:03:37.650> we<00:03:37.860> go<00:03:41.120> this<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.329> no<00:03:42.480> turning

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
oh wow there we go this is no turning

00:03:42.750 --> 00:04:14.309 
oh wow there we go this is no turning
back<00:03:42.900> now<00:03:43.379> huh

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.490 

and<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.159> guess<00:04:15.370> it's<00:04:15.609> just<00:04:15.840> keep<00:04:16.840> going<00:04:17.169> through

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
and I guess it's just keep going through

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.729 
and I guess it's just keep going through
I<00:04:18.090> guess<00:04:19.090> I'm<00:04:19.269> going<00:04:19.389> to<00:04:19.449> have<00:04:19.509> to<00:04:19.630> wet<00:04:20.320> my<00:04:20.530> hair

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
I guess I'm going to have to wet my hair

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.670 
I guess I'm going to have to wet my hair
is<00:04:21.570> throw<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:22.660> over<00:04:22.960> because<00:04:23.139> I'm<00:04:23.440> probably

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
is throw it over because I'm probably

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.189 
is throw it over because I'm probably
getting<00:04:24.100> some<00:04:24.280> real<00:04:24.639> uneven<00:04:25.630> looking<00:04:25.720> stuff

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
getting some real uneven looking stuff

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.020 
getting some real uneven looking stuff
on<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.530> top<00:04:26.710> but<00:04:27.039> it's<00:04:27.190> definitely<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.850> lot

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
on the top but it's definitely a lot

impressed in this you know and and

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.680 
impressed in this you know and and

going<00:06:37.870> to<00:06:37.930> probably<00:06:38.200> keep<00:06:38.650> doing<00:06:38.950> this<00:06:39.100> if<00:06:39.940> you

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
going to probably keep doing this if you

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.900 
going to probably keep doing this if you
look<00:06:40.210> at<00:06:40.300> the<00:06:40.450> back<00:06:40.660> here<00:06:40.690> I<00:06:41.320> screwed<00:06:42.280> up<00:06:42.430> and<00:06:42.670> I

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
look at the back here I screwed up and I

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.540 
look at the back here I screwed up and I
took<00:06:43.840> a<00:06:43.990> big<00:06:44.200> gouge<00:06:44.470> out<00:06:44.740> of<00:06:44.890> the<00:06:44.980> back<00:06:45.160> so<00:06:45.520> I

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
took a big gouge out of the back so I

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.280 
took a big gouge out of the back so I
ended<00:06:45.880> up<00:06:46.000> having<00:06:46.210> to<00:06:46.510> come<00:06:46.750> all<00:06:46.990> the<00:06:47.170> way<00:06:47.230> up

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
ended up having to come all the way up

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.590 
ended up having to come all the way up
here<00:06:47.470> and<00:06:47.980> I'm<00:06:48.430> actually<00:06:48.640> cheated<00:06:49.240> on<00:06:49.330> that

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
here and I'm actually cheated on that

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.120 
here and I'm actually cheated on that
when<00:06:49.780> I<00:06:49.810> actually<00:06:50.110> had<00:06:50.470> my<00:06:50.620> neighbor<00:06:50.860> helped

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
when I actually had my neighbor helped

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.620 
when I actually had my neighbor helped
me<00:06:51.280> but<00:06:51.460> I<00:06:51.490> think<00:06:51.760> the<00:06:51.880> next<00:06:52.150> time<00:06:52.300> what<00:06:52.540> I'm

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:52.630 
me but I think the next time what I'm

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.930 
me but I think the next time what I'm
going<00:06:52.780> to<00:06:52.810> do<00:06:53.020> when<00:06:53.830> I<00:06:53.860> get<00:06:54.310> ready<00:06:54.490> to<00:06:54.640> do<00:06:54.910> that

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
going to do when I get ready to do that

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.030 
going to do when I get ready to do that
again<00:06:55.390> is<00:06:55.630> I'm<00:06:55.870> going<00:06:55.990> to<00:06:56.050> take<00:06:56.260> some<00:06:56.470> masking

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
again is I'm going to take some masking

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.430 
again is I'm going to take some masking
tape and<00:06:57.490> just<00:06:58.300> put<00:06:58.510> masking<00:06:58.930> tape<00:06:59.170> across

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
tape and just put masking tape across

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.050 
tape and just put masking tape across
the<00:06:59.560> back<00:06:59.920> because<00:07:00.130> it's<00:07:00.430> really<00:07:00.730> hard<00:07:00.940> to

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
the back because it's really hard to

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.360 
the back because it's really hard to
judge<00:07:01.330> where<00:07:01.660> you're<00:07:01.840> at<00:07:02.020> and<00:07:02.290> also<00:07:02.890> I<00:07:03.070> didn't

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370 
judge where you're at and also I didn't

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.190 
judge where you're at and also I didn't
