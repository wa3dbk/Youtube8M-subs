these<00:04:53.319> though<00:04:53.559> because<00:04:53.769> the<00:04:54.009> mat<00:04:54.249> since<00:04:54.639> it's

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
these though because the mat since it's

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.359 
these though because the mat since it's
made<00:04:54.939> of<00:04:54.999> felt<00:04:55.360> you<00:04:56.349> know<00:04:56.829> you<00:04:56.889> move<00:04:57.159> a<00:04:57.189> little
