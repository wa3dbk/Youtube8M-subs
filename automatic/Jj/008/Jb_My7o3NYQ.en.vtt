00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hi this is the second part of the build

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.510 
hi this is the second part of the build
log<00:00:02.879> while<00:00:03.210> trying<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.720> design<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.680> custom

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
log while trying to design a custom

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.030 
log while trying to design a custom
board<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.330> fits<00:00:06.600> inside<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:07.170> gameboy<00:00:07.710> advance

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
board that fits inside a gameboy advance

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.419 
board that fits inside a gameboy advance
SP<00:00:08.250> case<00:00:09.110> so<00:00:10.110> behind<00:00:10.469> me<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.830> case<00:00:11.219> I'm

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
SP case so behind me is the case I'm

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.730 
SP case so behind me is the case I'm
going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.730> use<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.750> taken<00:00:13.170> apart<00:00:13.290> right<00:00:13.710> now

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
going to use is taken apart right now

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.550 
going to use is taken apart right now
and<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.700> original<00:00:15.570> Game<00:00:16.350> Boy<00:00:16.379> Advance

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
and I have the original Game Boy Advance

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.510 
and I have the original Game Boy Advance
bored<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:18.500> so<00:00:19.500> far<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.920> design<00:00:20.279> has

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
bored in here and so far this design has

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.820 
bored in here and so far this design has
been<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.850> very<00:00:21.060> tedious<00:00:21.390> because<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
been the very tedious because I have to

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.160 
been the very tedious because I have to
measure<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.880> exact<00:00:24.240> positions<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.869> all<00:00:25.019> these

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
measure the exact positions of all these

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.450 
measure the exact positions of all these
buttons<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.269> all<00:00:27.269> these<00:00:27.510> other<00:00:27.570> components

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
buttons and all these other components

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.040 
buttons and all these other components
so<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:29.609> you've<00:00:29.789> seen<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> first<00:00:30.449> part<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.929> this

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
so if you've seen the first part of this

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.720 
so if you've seen the first part of this
build<00:00:31.349> log<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.769> may<00:00:31.920> be<00:00:31.980> wondering<00:00:32.309> why<00:00:32.610> he's

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
build log you may be wondering why he's

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.639 
build log you may be wondering why he's
taking<00:00:33.090> me<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.360> long<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.750> finish<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.230> design

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
taking me so long to finish this design

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.299 
taking me so long to finish this design
and<00:00:35.360> there<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.480> several<00:00:36.750> reasons<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:38.100> first

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
and there are several reasons the first

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.830 
and there are several reasons the first
reason<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.879> I've<00:00:39.360> had<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> lot<00:00:39.780> of

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
reason is that I've had a lot of

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
reason is that I've had a lot of
problems<00:00:40.379> finding<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> parts<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.399> need<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
problems finding the parts that I need I

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.220 
problems finding the parts that I need I
primarily<00:00:42.840> use<00:00:43.230> digi-key<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.329> have

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
primarily use digi-key and I just have

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.490 
primarily use digi-key and I just have
had<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> lot<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> problems<00:00:47.430> finding<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.500> exact

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
had a lot of problems finding the exact

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.000 
had a lot of problems finding the exact
parts<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:51.030> would<00:00:51.270> fit<00:00:51.809> inside<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.559> Game<00:00:52.980> Boy

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
parts that would fit inside the Game Boy

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.770 
parts that would fit inside the Game Boy
Advance<00:00:53.190> case<00:00:54.590> for<00:00:55.590> example<00:00:55.680> these<00:00:56.780> switches

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
Advance case for example these switches

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.560 
Advance case for example these switches
for<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> L&amp;R<00:00:58.920> buttons<00:00:59.340> they<00:01:00.180> need<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> be

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
for the L&amp;R buttons they need to be

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.770 
for the L&amp;R buttons they need to be
right<00:01:01.199> angle<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.940> they<00:01:02.940> need<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.449> very

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
right angle and they need to be very

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.840 
right angle and they need to be very
thin<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.739> had<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> lot<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.309> trouble<00:01:05.670> finding

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
thin and I had a lot of trouble finding

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.450 
thin and I had a lot of trouble finding
those<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.570> also<00:01:07.290> these<00:01:07.590> back<00:01:07.890> connectors

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
those and also these back connectors

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.469 
those and also these back connectors
they<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.140> any<00:01:10.350> larger<00:01:10.979> than<00:01:11.820> these

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
they can not be any larger than these

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.719 
they can not be any larger than these
because<00:01:13.049> there's<00:01:13.260> plastic<00:01:13.799> surrounding

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
because there's plastic surrounding

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.590 
because there's plastic surrounding
these<00:01:15.360> connectors<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.140> case<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.600> there

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
these connectors on the case and there

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.210 
these connectors on the case and there
are<00:01:18.689> several<00:01:18.960> other<00:01:19.110> connectors<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.920> here

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
are several other connectors on here

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.749 
are several other connectors on here
that<00:01:20.540> had<00:01:21.540> problems<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:23.040> buttons<00:01:23.430> I

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
that had problems with the buttons I

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.630 
that had problems with the buttons I
couldn't<00:01:24.479> find<00:01:24.750> buttons<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.159> are<00:01:26.189> Allart

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
couldn't find buttons that are Allart

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.060 
couldn't find buttons that are Allart
that<00:01:26.909> are<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.299> large<00:01:27.509> as<00:01:27.750> these<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.890> only

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that are as large as these like only

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.190 
that are as large as these like only
five<00:01:29.340> small<00:01:29.700> ones<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.450> used<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:30.960> like

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
five small ones that are used for like

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.390 
five small ones that are used for like
this<00:01:31.520> start<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.670> select<00:01:32.820> button<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.479> this

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
this start and select button and this

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.210 
this start and select button and this
backlight<00:01:35.400> bunny

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
backlight bunny

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.150 
backlight bunny
the<00:01:36.760> second<00:01:37.120> reason<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.480> that<00:01:37.540> I<00:01:37.990> have<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.410> make

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
the second reason is that I have to make

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.220 
the second reason is that I have to make
the<00:01:39.340> footprints<00:01:39.910> for<00:01:40.060> all<00:01:40.210> these<00:01:40.420> new<00:01:40.780> parts

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
the footprints for all these new parts

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.650 
the footprints for all these new parts
in<00:01:41.440> keek<00:01:41.770> head<00:01:42.010> and<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:43.030> takes<00:01:43.240> up<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.510> lot<00:01:43.630> of

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
in keek head and that takes up a lot of

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.310 
in keek head and that takes up a lot of
time<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.670> third<00:01:45.910> reason<00:01:46.120> is<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:46.510> I<00:01:47.080> have

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
time and the third reason is that I have

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.870 
time and the third reason is that I have
to<00:01:47.470> do<00:01:47.680> a<00:01:47.980> lot<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:48.910> measuring<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:51.580> get<00:01:51.730> the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
to do a lot of measuring to get the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.760 
to do a lot of measuring to get the
exact<00:01:52.180> positions<00:01:52.660> of<00:01:52.780> all<00:01:52.900> these<00:01:53.080> buttons<00:01:53.350> and

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
exact positions of all these buttons and

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.940 
exact positions of all these buttons and
other<00:01:53.950> components<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:56.290> takes<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.680> lot<00:01:56.890> of

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
other components and that takes a lot of

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.390 
other components and that takes a lot of
time<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.520> need<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.880> make<00:01:58.870> sure<00:01:58.900> it's<00:01:59.290> a<00:01:59.500> you<00:02:00.250> know

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
time I need to make sure it's a you know

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.910 
time I need to make sure it's a you know
precise<00:02:00.850> or<00:02:01.210> else<00:02:01.360> all<00:02:01.570> make<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.470> board<00:02:02.740> and

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
precise or else all make the board and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.890 
precise or else all make the board and
it<00:02:03.010> will<00:02:03.100> be<00:02:03.190> all<00:02:03.340> screwed<00:02:03.700> up<00:02:03.820> another<00:02:04.660> reason

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
it will be all screwed up another reason

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.570 
it will be all screwed up another reason
is<00:02:05.110> that<00:02:05.170> i'm<00:02:05.470> not<00:02:05.500> spending<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:06.100> whole<00:02:06.250> lot<00:02:06.310> of

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
is that i'm not spending a whole lot of

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.969 
is that i'm not spending a whole lot of
time<00:02:06.760> in<00:02:06.910> this<00:02:06.970> project<00:02:07.420> because<00:02:07.679> it's<00:02:08.679> a<00:02:08.800> long

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
time in this project because it's a long

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.850 
time in this project because it's a long
term<00:02:09.250> project<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:10.149> i<00:02:10.660> didn't<00:02:11.350> want<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.620> rush

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
term project and i didn't want to rush

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.699 
term project and i didn't want to rush
through<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.250> really<00:02:12.550> quick<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.209> my<00:02:13.470> last<00:02:14.470> video

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
through it really quick in my last video

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.380 
through it really quick in my last video
i<00:02:14.890> said<00:02:15.280> i<00:02:15.310> wanted<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.850> have<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.150> board

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
i said i wanted to have the board

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.300 
i said i wanted to have the board
completely<00:02:16.840> finished<00:02:17.230> but<00:02:17.890> i<00:02:17.920> haven't<00:02:18.250> even

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
completely finished but i haven't even

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.490 
completely finished but i haven't even
gotten<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.790> far<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:20.020> i<00:02:20.080> have<00:02:20.350> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
gotten that far but i have the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.580 
gotten that far but i have the
components<00:02:21.160> on<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.850> board<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:23.020> footprints

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
components on the board the footprints

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.160 
components on the board the footprints
done<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.130> they're<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.790> dirt<00:02:25.000> exact<00:02:25.630> positions

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
done and they're in dirt exact positions

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.050 
done and they're in dirt exact positions
so<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.610> took<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.209> lot<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.420> time<00:02:28.750> in<00:02:28.959> itself<00:02:30.060> ok

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
so that took a lot of time in itself ok

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.940 
so that took a lot of time in itself ok
so<00:02:31.120> let's<00:02:31.450> take<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.660> look<00:02:31.870> at<00:02:31.990> my<00:02:32.020> design<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.680> far

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
so let's take a look at my design so far

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.570 
so let's take a look at my design so far
ok<00:02:33.730> here<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.300> board<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.170> far<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.770> know<00:02:36.370> it

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
ok here is the board so far I know it

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.580 
ok here is the board so far I know it
looks<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.850> little<00:02:37.000> bit<00:02:37.209> messy<00:02:37.600> but<00:02:37.630> let<00:02:38.560> me

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
looks a little bit messy but let me

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.949 
looks a little bit messy but let me
remove<00:02:39.010> these<00:02:39.310> ICS<00:02:42.209> one<00:02:43.209> thing<00:02:43.450> I'm<00:02:43.660> worried

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
remove these ICS one thing I'm worried

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.110 
remove these ICS one thing I'm worried
about<00:02:43.989> is<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.500> these<00:02:44.769> are<00:02:45.070> these<00:02:45.519> chips<00:02:45.910> are

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
about is that these are these chips are

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.840 
about is that these are these chips are
very<00:02:46.450> large<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:48.250> think<00:02:48.489> I'm<00:02:48.580> going<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.730> have

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
very large and I think I'm going to have

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.520 
very large and I think I'm going to have
a<00:02:48.910> lot<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.209> trouble<00:02:49.630> getting<00:02:49.660> them<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.200> fit

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
a lot of trouble getting them to fit

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.180 
a lot of trouble getting them to fit
inside<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:51.130> case<00:02:52.200> ok<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:53.260> here<00:02:53.680> are<00:02:53.860> all<00:02:53.890> the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
inside that case ok so here are all the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.479 
inside that case ok so here are all the
components<00:02:54.550> in<00:02:54.940> their<00:02:55.120> precise<00:02:55.630> positions

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
components in their precise positions

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.350 
components in their precise positions
meaning<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.970> measured<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:59.370> the<00:03:00.370> original

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
meaning that I measured the the original

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.140 
meaning that I measured the the original
board<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.170> placed<00:03:02.769> all<00:03:03.100> these<00:03:03.370> components<00:03:03.550> in

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
board and placed all these components in

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.410 
board and placed all these components in
the<00:03:04.690> exact<00:03:05.080> same<00:03:05.290> places<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:07.030> when<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.299> last

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
the exact same places so when the last

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.300 
the exact same places so when the last
video<00:03:07.690> someone<00:03:08.170> said<00:03:08.410> why<00:03:08.440> don't<00:03:08.739> you<00:03:08.950> use<00:03:09.070> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
video someone said why don't you use the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.860 
video someone said why don't you use the
original<00:03:09.760> parts<00:03:10.060> from<00:03:10.299> an<00:03:10.450> old<00:03:10.630> gameboy

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
original parts from an old gameboy

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.380 
original parts from an old gameboy
advance<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.700> thought<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:13.030> was<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.209> pretty

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
advance and I thought that was a pretty

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.520 
advance and I thought that was a pretty
good<00:03:13.660> idea<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.860> what<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.130> wanted<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.549> do<00:03:15.760> was<00:03:16.530> use

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
good idea so what I wanted to do was use

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.870 
good idea so what I wanted to do was use
the<00:03:17.799> parts<00:03:18.489> from<00:03:18.610> a<00:03:18.820> gameboy<00:03:19.330> advance<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.880> be

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
the parts from a gameboy advance and be

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.390 
the parts from a gameboy advance and be
able<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.269> use<00:03:22.540> new<00:03:22.989> parts<00:03:23.410> from<00:03:23.680> digikey<00:03:24.190> on

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
able to use new parts from digikey on

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.390 
able to use new parts from digikey on
the<00:03:24.519> board<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.030> if<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.080> want<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.830> use

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
the board so if you want to you can use

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.430 
the board so if you want to you can use
the<00:03:27.640> digi<00:03:28.060> key<00:03:28.269> parts<00:03:28.630> or<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.930> can<00:03:29.049> just<00:03:29.170> rip

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
the digi key parts or you can just rip

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.500 
the digi key parts or you can just rip
them<00:03:29.560> off<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.040> they'll<00:03:30.760> game<00:03:31.000> boy<00:03:31.180> advance

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
them off and they'll game boy advance

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.770 
them off and they'll game boy advance
and<00:03:31.750> use<00:03:31.989> those<00:03:32.590> parts<00:03:32.950> also<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:34.330> know<00:03:34.450> so

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
and use those parts also you know so

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.009 
and use those parts also you know so
basically<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.799> board<00:03:36.040> would<00:03:36.310> have

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
basically the board would have

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.350 
basically the board would have
footprints<00:03:38.019> for<00:03:38.530> both<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:39.610> old<00:03:39.790> parts<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.269> the

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
footprints for both the old parts in the

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.449 
footprints for both the old parts in the
new<00:03:40.480> parts<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.830> turned<00:03:42.070> out<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.340> be

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
new parts and that turned out to be

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.140 
new parts and that turned out to be
incredibly<00:03:42.580> difficult<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:44.170> do<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.910> what<00:03:46.060> I've

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
incredibly difficult to do so what I've

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.910 
incredibly difficult to do so what I've
decided<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.599> do<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.959> just<00:03:47.200> use<00:03:47.500> parts<00:03:47.860> from

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
decided to do is just use parts from

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.390 
decided to do is just use parts from
digi-key<00:03:48.490> only

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
digi-key only

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.619 
digi-key only
and<00:03:50.079> for<00:03:51.079> the<00:03:51.319> bat<00:03:51.500> connector<00:03:52.090> I'm<00:03:53.090> just<00:03:53.360> using

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
and for the bat connector I'm just using

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.750 
and for the bat connector I'm just using
standard<00:03:54.170> 0.1<00:03:54.829> inch<00:03:55.099> pin<00:03:55.459> headers<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:56.409> these

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
standard 0.1 inch pin headers and these

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.390 
standard 0.1 inch pin headers and these
this<00:03:58.760> connector<00:03:59.450> is<00:03:59.689> for<00:04:00.049> to<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.890> arts<00:04:01.220> as

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
this connector is for to you arts as

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.819 
this connector is for to you arts as
well<00:04:01.879> as<00:04:02.209> power<00:04:02.680> for<00:04:03.680> my<00:04:03.860> ftdi<00:04:04.430> boards<00:04:04.970> and

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
well as power for my ftdi boards and

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.789 
well as power for my ftdi boards and
this<00:04:06.829> is<00:04:07.010> actually<00:04:07.519> a<00:04:07.549> vga<00:04:08.180> out<00:04:08.510> I'm<00:04:09.500> going<00:04:09.709> to

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
this is actually a vga out I'm going to

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.259 
this is actually a vga out I'm going to
have<00:04:10.040> because<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:10.430> want<00:04:10.609> to<00:04:10.670> be<00:04:10.730> able<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:11.030> hook

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
have because I want to be able to hook

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.470 
have because I want to be able to hook
this<00:04:11.450> up<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.659> a<00:04:11.780> monitor<00:04:12.019> also<00:04:12.470> and<00:04:13.359> the<00:04:14.359> way

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
this up to a monitor also and the way

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.069 
this up to a monitor also and the way
that's<00:04:14.720> going<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:14.959> work<00:04:15.109> is<00:04:15.319> that<00:04:15.349> a<00:04:16.389> no<00:04:17.389> db15

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
that's going to work is that a no db15

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.310 
that's going to work is that a no db15
connector<00:04:18.889> is<00:04:19.130> going<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.019> have<00:04:21.019> its<00:04:21.049> own

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
connector is going to have its own

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.370 
connector is going to have its own
connector<00:04:21.889> that<00:04:22.039> plugs<00:04:22.100> into<00:04:22.490> here<00:04:23.350> also<00:04:24.350> I

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
connector that plugs into here also I

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.950 
connector that plugs into here also I
have<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.949> lnr<00:04:25.580> switches<00:04:26.560> right<00:04:27.560> here<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.250> I

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
have the lnr switches right here and I

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.200 
have the lnr switches right here and I
needed<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.110> find<00:04:30.380> ones<00:04:30.620> that<00:04:30.860> were<00:04:31.280> very<00:04:31.580> thin

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
needed to find ones that were very thin

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.629 
needed to find ones that were very thin
not<00:04:32.990> too<00:04:33.050> high<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:34.070> know<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.370> had<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.610> be

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
not too high you know it had to be

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.900 
not too high you know it had to be
perfect<00:04:35.110> because<00:04:36.160> there's<00:04:37.160> plastic<00:04:37.520> that

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
perfect because there's plastic that

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.900 
perfect because there's plastic that
surrounds<00:04:38.510> this<00:04:38.630> whole<00:04:38.930> a<00:04:39.260> switch<00:04:39.949> so<00:04:40.669> if<00:04:40.789> it's

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
surrounds this whole a switch so if it's

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.360 
surrounds this whole a switch so if it's
too<00:04:41.030> big<00:04:41.270> is<00:04:41.449> going<00:04:41.539> to<00:04:41.630> hit<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.780> plastic<00:04:42.380> so<00:04:43.340> I

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
too big is going to hit the plastic so I

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.890 
too big is going to hit the plastic so I
spend<00:04:43.729> a<00:04:43.789> lot<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.970> time<00:04:44.090> trying<00:04:44.449> to<00:04:44.539> find<00:04:44.720> the

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
spend a lot of time trying to find the

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.320 
spend a lot of time trying to find the
right<00:04:45.020> button<00:04:45.289> and<00:04:45.729> actually<00:04:46.729> digi-key<00:04:47.180> is

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
right button and actually digi-key is

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.089 
right button and actually digi-key is
still<00:04:47.599> out<00:04:47.900> of<00:04:48.139> stock<00:04:48.380> they<00:04:48.680> said<00:04:48.889> they<00:04:49.009> were

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
still out of stock they said they were

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.760 
still out of stock they said they were
going<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.280> be<00:04:49.400> stock<00:04:49.729> in<00:04:49.970> stock<00:04:50.419> a<00:04:50.780> couple<00:04:51.710> of

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
going to be stock in stock a couple of

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.650 
going to be stock in stock a couple of
weeks<00:04:51.889> ago<00:04:52.130> but<00:04:52.639> they're<00:04:52.789> still<00:04:52.880> not<00:04:53.210> in<00:04:53.389> stock

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
weeks ago but they're still not in stock

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.439 
weeks ago but they're still not in stock
so<00:04:53.690> I'm<00:04:53.960> kind<00:04:54.169> of<00:04:54.199> worried<00:04:54.470> about<00:04:54.650> that<00:04:55.449> so

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
so I'm kind of worried about that so

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.480 
so I'm kind of worried about that so
instead<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:56.810> having<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:57.349> cartridge<00:04:57.770> slot<00:04:58.099> I'm

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
instead of having a cartridge slot I'm

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.029 
instead of having a cartridge slot I'm
actually<00:04:59.210> going<00:04:59.599> to<00:04:59.750> have<00:04:59.900> an<00:05:00.050> SD<00:05:00.260> card<00:05:00.470> in

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
actually going to have an SD card in

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.480 
actually going to have an SD card in
that<00:05:01.240> same<00:05:02.240> place<00:05:02.630> in<00:05:03.410> SD<00:05:03.560> card<00:05:03.949> slot<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.520> a

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
that same place in SD card slot and a

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.909 
that same place in SD card slot and a
connector<00:05:07.490> a<00:05:07.870> 0.1<00:05:08.870> inch<00:05:09.169> pin<00:05:09.710> header

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.930 
connector a 0.1 inch pin header
connector<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.990> this<00:05:11.990> will<00:05:12.169> be<00:05:12.349> for<00:05:12.789> you<00:05:13.789> no

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940

external boards for spi i squared C and
also<00:05:19.909> this<00:05:20.150> will<00:05:20.389> have<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:22.060> audio<00:05:23.060> jack<00:05:23.479> and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
also this will have the audio jack and

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.260 
also this will have the audio jack and
the<00:05:23.949> reason<00:05:24.949> that<00:05:24.979> I<00:05:25.280> need<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.610> put<00:05:25.849> the<00:05:26.000> audio

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
the reason that I need to put the audio

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.810 
the reason that I need to put the audio
jack<00:05:26.510> on<00:05:26.659> a<00:05:26.750> separate<00:05:27.050> board<00:05:27.260> is<00:05:27.409> that<00:05:27.820> there's

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
jack on a separate board is that there's

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.480 
jack on a separate board is that there's
like<00:05:29.090> no<00:05:29.330> room<00:05:29.720> on<00:05:29.960> this<00:05:30.169> entire<00:05:30.560> in<00:05:30.949> the<00:05:31.250> case

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
like no room on this entire in the case

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.360 
like no room on this entire in the case
to<00:05:31.940> put<00:05:32.210> an<00:05:32.389> audio<00:05:32.690> jack<00:05:32.720> I<00:05:33.289> wanted<00:05:34.099> to<00:05:34.159> put<00:05:34.310> it

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
to put an audio jack I wanted to put it

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.149 
to put an audio jack I wanted to put it
in<00:05:34.460> the<00:05:34.580> back<00:05:34.760> but<00:05:35.560> the<00:05:36.560> audio<00:05:36.680> jacks<00:05:37.039> were

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
in the back but the audio jacks were

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.029 
in the back but the audio jacks were
just<00:05:37.370> too<00:05:37.580> big<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.210> there's<00:05:39.080> plastic<00:05:39.440> you

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
just too big and there's plastic you

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.310 
just too big and there's plastic you
know<00:05:40.159> all<00:05:40.340> around<00:05:40.699> that<00:05:40.970> connector<00:05:41.479> so<00:05:41.810> it

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
know all around that connector so it

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.580 
know all around that connector so it
wouldn't<00:05:42.889> have<00:05:42.979> fit<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.960> power<00:05:44.960> switch<00:05:45.229> is<00:05:45.380> a

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
wouldn't have fit the power switch is a

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.490 
wouldn't have fit the power switch is a
slice<00:05:46.310> which<00:05:46.669> I<00:05:47.000> still<00:05:47.659> have<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:47.990> footprint

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
digikey so I'm using one of those are

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.890 
digikey so I'm using one of those are
three<00:06:17.960> ways<00:06:18.200> switches<00:06:19.000> so<00:06:20.000> you<00:06:20.120> can<00:06:20.420> like<00:06:20.630> you

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
three ways switches so you can like you

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.110 
three ways switches so you can like you
know<00:06:21.020> push<00:06:21.380> this<00:06:21.590> up<00:06:21.860> or<00:06:22.250> down<00:06:22.550> or<00:06:22.580> you<00:06:22.970> can

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
know push this up or down or you can

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.200 
know push this up or down or you can
press<00:06:23.360> it<00:06:23.420> in<00:06:23.750> and<00:06:24.520> you<00:06:25.520> know<00:06:25.640> it's<00:06:25.820> digital

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
press it in and you know it's digital

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.720 
press it in and you know it's digital
instead<00:06:26.480> of<00:06:26.570> analog<00:06:27.020> like<00:06:27.290> the<00:06:27.440> pot<00:06:27.680> so<00:06:28.460> this

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
instead of analog like the pot so this

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.130 
instead of analog like the pot so this
is<00:06:28.850> going<00:06:29.000> to<00:06:29.060> be<00:06:29.180> connected<00:06:29.420> directly<00:06:29.720> to<00:06:30.020> the

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
is going to be connected directly to the

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.470 
is going to be connected directly to the
microcontroller<00:06:31.120> which<00:06:32.120> is<00:06:32.270> going<00:06:32.420> to

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
microcontroller which is going to

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.790 
microcontroller which is going to
control<00:06:32.840> the<00:06:32.990> volume<00:06:33.610> here's<00:06:34.610> all<00:06:34.820> the<00:06:35.030> ICS

words pwm from the fpga but i'm going to

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.320 
words pwm from the fpga but i'm going to
feed<00:07:03.200> that<00:07:04.270> pwm<00:07:05.270> into<00:07:06.110> these<00:07:06.350> amplifiers<00:07:07.330> one

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
feed that pwm into these amplifiers one

the other one is for the headphones I

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.860 
the other one is for the headphones I
also<00:07:16.160> considered<00:07:16.760> using<00:07:16.970> a<00:07:17.210> separate<00:07:17.660> audio

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:17.870 
also considered using a separate audio

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.000 
also considered using a separate audio
deck<00:07:18.490> but<00:07:19.490> when<00:07:20.180> the<00:07:20.330> problems<00:07:20.720> was<00:07:20.930> I<00:07:21.320> needed

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010 
deck but when the problems was I needed

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.660 
deck but when the problems was I needed
an<00:07:22.250> output<00:07:22.760> for<00:07:23.180> the<00:07:23.530> onboard<00:07:24.530> speaker<00:07:24.950> and<00:07:25.220> I

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.670 
an output for the onboard speaker and I

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.440 
an output for the onboard speaker and I
needed<00:07:26.510> a<00:07:26.570> stereo<00:07:27.050> headphone<00:07:27.860> output<00:07:28.370> and<00:07:28.610> I

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:29.450 
needed a stereo headphone output and I

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.240 
needed a stereo headphone output and I
couldn't<00:07:29.630> really<00:07:29.750> find<00:07:30.140> one<00:07:30.440> that<00:07:30.680> you<00:07:30.920> know

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.250 
couldn't really find one that you know

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.580 
couldn't really find one that you know
fit<00:07:32.150> both<00:07:32.360> of<00:07:32.420> those<00:07:32.690> things<00:07:32.960> that<00:07:33.080> I<00:07:33.230> wanted

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590 
fit both of those things that I wanted

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.880 
fit both of those things that I wanted
and<00:07:34.360> all<00:07:35.360> these<00:07:35.510> green<00:07:35.840> components<00:07:36.440> are<00:07:36.590> the

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:36.890 
and all these green components are the

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.880 
and all these green components are the
components<00:07:37.700> on<00:07:38.030> the<00:07:38.150> bottom<00:07:38.480> of<00:07:38.600> the<00:07:38.720> board<00:07:38.960> so

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:39.890 
components on the bottom of the board so

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.880 
components on the bottom of the board so
I<00:07:39.920> have<00:07:40.130> all<00:07:40.280> the<00:07:40.430> switches<00:07:40.730> and<00:07:41.590> I<00:07:42.590> have<00:07:42.740> the

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:42.890 
I have all the switches and I have the

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.170 
I have all the switches and I have the
contacts<00:07:43.370> for<00:07:43.610> the<00:07:43.790> speaker<00:07:44.270> right<00:07:44.750> here<00:07:44.780> and

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:46.180 
contacts for the speaker right here and

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.650 
contacts for the speaker right here and
they<00:07:47.180> have<00:07:47.390> the<00:07:47.540> LCD<00:07:47.870> connector<00:07:48.410> and<00:07:49.360> also<00:07:50.360> the

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:50.660 
they have the LCD connector and also the

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.250 
they have the LCD connector and also the
LEDs<00:07:51.200> are<00:07:51.440> right<00:07:51.620> here<00:07:52.930> ok<00:07:53.930> that's<00:07:54.170> pretty

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:54.260 
LEDs are right here ok that's pretty

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.740 
LEDs are right here ok that's pretty
much<00:07:54.590> it<00:07:54.650> I<00:07:55.130> guess<00:07:55.820> I<00:07:56.000> can<00:07:56.180> show<00:07:56.390> you<00:07:56.450> the

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:56.750 
much it I guess I can show you the

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.810 
much it I guess I can show you the
schematic<00:07:57.470> but<00:07:57.650> there's<00:07:57.800> not<00:07:57.920> much<00:07:58.130> on<00:07:58.430> there

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:58.820 
schematic but there's not much on there

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.080 
schematic but there's not much on there
it's<00:07:59.150> just<00:07:59.890> you<00:08:00.890> know<00:08:00.980> all<00:08:01.130> the<00:08:01.280> components<00:08:01.610> on

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.090 
it's just you know all the components on

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.760 
it's just you know all the components on
here<00:08:02.750> nothing<00:08:03.650> is<00:08:03.770> actually<00:08:04.390> routed<00:08:05.390> yet<00:08:05.770> ok

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:06.770 
here nothing is actually routed yet ok

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.560 
here nothing is actually routed yet ok
on<00:08:06.890> the<00:08:06.980> next<00:08:07.220> video<00:08:07.370> I<00:08:07.490> hope<00:08:07.730> to<00:08:07.910> have<00:08:08.120> all<00:08:08.390> the

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:08.570 
on the next video I hope to have all the

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.950 
on the next video I hope to have all the
traces<00:08:08.840> routed

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 
traces routed

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.260 
traces routed
and<00:08:10.050> the<00:08:10.319> board<00:08:10.560> pretty<00:08:10.800> much<00:08:11.009> complete<00:08:11.520> to

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.270 
and the board pretty much complete to

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.279 
and the board pretty much complete to
send<00:08:12.600> to<00:08:12.720> the<00:08:12.810> manufacturer<00:08:13.699> so<00:08:14.699> I<00:08:15.270> hope<00:08:16.110> you

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:16.289 
send to the manufacturer so I hope you

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:18.170 
send to the manufacturer so I hope you
found<00:08:16.410> this<00:08:16.590> interesting<00:08:17.030> thanks<00:08:18.030> for

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180
