I'm<00:04:06.240> a<00:04:06.330> little<00:04:06.360> surprised<00:04:06.870> as<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.410> took<00:04:07.590> that

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
I'm a little surprised as I took that

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.710 
I'm a little surprised as I took that
risk<00:04:07.980> there<00:04:08.190> because<00:04:08.460> what<00:04:09.090> he<00:04:09.150> did<00:04:09.360> is<00:04:09.480> he<00:04:09.510> put

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
risk there because what he did is he put

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.060 
risk there because what he did is he put
himself<00:04:09.840> on<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.140> edge<00:04:10.260> but<00:04:10.470> he<00:04:10.620> gave<00:04:10.740> docking

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
himself on the edge but he gave docking

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.430 
himself on the edge but he gave docking
people<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.310> bit<00:04:11.640> ly<00:04:11.820> cross<00:04:12.090> him<00:04:12.240> off<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:12.660> as<00:04:13.290> you

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
people a bit ly cross him off and as you

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.600 
people a bit ly cross him off and as you
can<00:04:13.560> see<00:04:13.590> he's<00:04:13.800> really<00:04:14.010> suffering<00:04:14.310> for<00:04:14.490> that

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
can see he's really suffering for that

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.860 
can see he's really suffering for that
because<00:04:14.730> he<00:04:14.880> just<00:04:15.000> lost<00:04:15.210> his<00:04:15.300> sock<00:04:15.480> at<00:04:15.660> forty

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870

five percent and gave dr. Cooper back to

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.289 
five percent and gave dr. Cooper back to
stage<00:04:17.549> he<00:04:17.700> probably<00:04:17.850> would've<00:04:18.090> been<00:04:18.180> better

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299
