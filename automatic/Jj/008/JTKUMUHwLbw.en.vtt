00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:05.299
 He knows the first transfer is no longer gaining a win-win in the process 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.460
 There he is likely to stay Blizzard Entertainment 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.259
 Outrageously fast 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.599
 it was too fast just to get out quickly 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.070
 Company or 30 years 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.619
 I can not make good ground on Simon Ammann 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.359
 Simon Ammann could have found him guilty of third place 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.289
 the two hackers pay off from 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.210
 four points 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.620
 Simon Ammann on Wolfgang Loitzl in the house of Dior can already at the moment 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.360
 lost 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.450
 130 years old 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.490
 Starting position for the second round only shows good behavior 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.810
 tomorrow evening 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.300
 that is however open 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.620
 developed at a very high level only 130 euros 5 meters so 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.400
 we are the little chain that is currently in the church 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.250
 he was missing something 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.520
 the winner of the last tour Dr also here Mr stay stretch 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.280
 won a year ago 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.100
 Wolfgang 90 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.450
 19 morning star flavors but on 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.740
 I believe one for the four is asked 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.229
 there nothing Andreas Kofler because the distances are so great research 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.909
 but the jump of Andi Kofler but also short hair is also possible 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.860
 in Duisburg the 2nd 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.140
 b 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.560
 Klein had Wolfgang Nolze 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.939
 rightly he says I still dismissed every lawsuit and that demonstrated 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.100
 also 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.100
 134 meters that's the top now 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.420
 four times the 19 once the 90 number 5 and once the stock won 5 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.420
 Children's values ​​in a year better said he was in the first round 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.120
 almost too fast up there he wanted to do too much the same way 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.130
 been 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.290
 something went wrong and now 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.990
 would have the comparatively more time and already he has the jump to 135 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.689
 set and the leadership 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.780
 Trier the strings in front and an op is still coming 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.650
