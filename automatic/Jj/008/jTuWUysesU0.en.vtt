hey<00:00:00.510> guys<00:00:00.719> as<00:00:00.989> you<00:00:01.020> probably<00:00:01.290> know<00:00:01.560> 3dmark<00:00:02.250> is

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hey guys as you probably know 3dmark is

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.160 
hey guys as you probably know 3dmark is
available<00:00:02.790> cross<00:00:03.000> platform<00:00:03.510> which<00:00:03.720> gives<00:00:03.959> us

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
available cross platform which gives us

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.320 
available cross platform which gives us
the<00:00:04.319> ability<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.859> test<00:00:05.069> iOS<00:00:05.549> devices<00:00:05.879> directly

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
the ability to test iOS devices directly

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.780 
the ability to test iOS devices directly
with<00:00:06.899> Android<00:00:07.319> devices<00:00:07.589> now<00:00:08.280> it's<00:00:08.429> mainly<00:00:08.639> a

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
with Android devices now it's mainly a

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.580 
with Android devices now it's mainly a
graphics<00:00:09.330> benchmark<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.019> we'll<00:00:10.139> be<00:00:10.260> testing

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
graphics benchmark so we'll be testing

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.470 
graphics benchmark so we'll be testing
out<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.830> GPU<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.880> wanted<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.210> make<00:00:12.330> this

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
out the GPU and I wanted to make this

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.360 
out the GPU and I wanted to make this
video<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.780> test<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.290> google<00:00:13.500> nexus<00:00:13.769> 7<00:00:14.250> 2013

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
video to test the google nexus 7 2013

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.330 
video to test the google nexus 7 2013
and<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.450> apple<00:00:15.780> ipad<00:00:15.929> mini<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.890> first<00:00:17.130> test

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
and the apple ipad mini the first test

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.849 
and the apple ipad mini the first test
here<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.670> an<00:00:17.760> opengl<00:00:18.390> 2.0<00:00:18.900> benchmark<00:00:19.590> now<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
here is an opengl 2.0 benchmark now the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.590 
here is an opengl 2.0 benchmark now the
test<00:00:20.220> itself<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.730> actually<00:00:20.850> rendered<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.480> an

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
test itself is actually rendered to an

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.050 
test itself is actually rendered to an
off-screen<00:00:21.869> buffer<00:00:22.230> at<00:00:22.800> 720p<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.910> then

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
off-screen buffer at 720p and then

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.670 
off-screen buffer at 720p and then
scales<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> output<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.080> fit<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> native

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
scales the output to fit the native

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.040 
scales the output to fit the native
resolution<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.400> your<00:00:26.580> device<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.779> test

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
resolution of your device so this test

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.810 
resolution of your device so this test
on<00:00:28.230> both<00:00:28.410> devices<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:29.099> actually<00:00:29.429> rendered<00:00:29.730> at

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
on both devices is actually rendered at

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.479 
on both devices is actually rendered at
720p<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.199> actual<00:00:31.320> display<00:00:31.859> resolution

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
720p so the actual display resolution

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.310 
720p so the actual display resolution
doesn't<00:00:32.820> affect<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> end<00:00:33.450> result<00:00:33.840> so

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
doesn't affect the end result so

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.720 
doesn't affect the end result so
straight<00:00:34.559> away<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> Nexus

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
straight away you can see that the Nexus

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
straight away you can see that the Nexus
7<00:00:35.969> has<00:00:36.000> taken<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.540> lead<00:00:36.719> now<00:00:36.930> don't<00:00:37.200> forget<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
7 has taken a lead now don't forget the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.680 
7 has taken a lead now don't forget the

whereas the iPad Mini has been out for

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.889 
whereas the iPad Mini has been out for
about<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.640> year<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:42.300> should<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.600> seeing<00:00:42.780> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
about a year so we should be seeing a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.959 
about a year so we should be seeing a
refresh<00:00:43.320> soon<00:00:43.559> nonetheless<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
refresh soon nonetheless you can see the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
refresh soon nonetheless you can see the
frame<00:00:45.210> rate<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> Nexus<00:00:45.960> 7<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.410> lot

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
frame rate on the Nexus 7 is a lot

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.110 
frame rate on the Nexus 7 is a lot
smoother<00:00:47.280> we're<00:00:47.399> pretty<00:00:47.579> much<00:00:47.730> hitting<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
smoother we're pretty much hitting the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.139 
smoother we're pretty much hitting the
frame<00:00:48.329> limiter<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.870> 720p<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:50.070> around<00:00:50.460> 59<00:00:50.879> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
frame limiter at 720p it's around 59 to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.580 
frame limiter at 720p it's around 59 to
60<00:00:51.390> FPS<00:00:51.840> pretty<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> whole<00:00:52.440> time

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
60 FPS pretty much the whole time

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.279 
60 FPS pretty much the whole time
whereas<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> iPad<00:00:54.030> Mini<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.329> struggling<00:00:55.140> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
whereas the iPad Mini is struggling you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.689 
whereas the iPad Mini is struggling you
can<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> there<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> frame<00:00:56.280> rate<00:00:56.520> is

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
can see that there the frame rate is

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.209 
can see that there the frame rate is
sometimes<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> 12<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.020> 15<00:00:58.440> sometimes<00:00:59.039> even

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
sometimes in the 12 to 15 sometimes even

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.580 
sometimes in the 12 to 15 sometimes even
dipping<00:00:59.640> into<00:00:59.789> single<00:01:00.329> figures<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.289> it's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
dipping into single figures so it's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.950 
dipping into single figures so it's
pretty<00:01:01.890> much<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.550> massive<00:01:02.969> difference<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.539> so

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
pretty much a massive difference here so

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.000 
pretty much a massive difference here so
I'm<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.350> keep<00:01:04.439> skipping<00:01:04.710> through

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
I'm just going to keep skipping through

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.530 
I'm just going to keep skipping through
the<00:01:05.100> benchmark<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> video<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.420> going

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the benchmark here as the video is going

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.240 
the benchmark here as the video is going
to<00:01:06.630> get<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> little<00:01:06.960> bit<00:01:07.170> boring<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.100> can

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
to get a little bit boring and you can

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.460 
to get a little bit boring and you can
see<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> nexus<00:01:09.000> 7<00:01:09.210> 2013<00:01:09.330> again<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.380> very

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
see here the nexus 7 2013 again is very

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.020 
see here the nexus 7 2013 again is very
smooth<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.189> pretty<00:01:11.369> much<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> frame

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
smooth it's pretty much on the frame

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.270 
smooth it's pretty much on the frame
limiter<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.510> whole<00:01:12.659> time<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.439> ipad<00:01:13.830> mini<00:01:13.860> on

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
limiter the whole time the ipad mini on

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830 
limiter the whole time the ipad mini on
the<00:01:14.400> same<00:01:14.610> section<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> test<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.659> see

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the same section of the test you can see

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.140 
the same section of the test you can see
is<00:01:16.080> very<00:01:16.380> slow<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.830> down<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> 10<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> 15

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
is very slow it down in the 10 to 15

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.060 
is very slow it down in the 10 to 15
frames<00:01:18.390> per<00:01:18.570> second<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.470> there<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.740> pretty

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
frames per second so there is a pretty

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.620 
frames per second so there is a pretty
massive<00:01:20.340> difference<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.180> terms<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
massive difference here in terms of the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.420 
massive difference here in terms of the
hardware<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:22.740> are<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.860> results<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
hardware so here are the results for the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.130 
hardware so here are the results for the
first<00:01:23.610> test<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> nexus<00:01:24.930> 7

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
first test and you can see the nexus 7

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.859 
first test and you can see the nexus 7
2013<00:01:25.310> easily<00:01:26.310> beats<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.700> ipad<00:01:27.030> mini<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.720> can

2013 easily beats the ipad mini you can
see<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> ipad<00:01:28.229> scores<00:01:29.329> 2895<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.600> nexus<00:01:30.960> 7

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
see the ipad scores 2895 the nexus 7

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.319 
see the ipad scores 2895 the nexus 7
scores<00:01:31.619> maxed<00:01:32.220> out<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.640> we've<00:01:32.759> actually<00:01:32.880> maxed

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
scores maxed out so we've actually maxed

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.969 
scores maxed out so we've actually maxed
out<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.600> test<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> check<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
out this test here if you check out the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.679 
out this test here if you check out the
actual<00:01:35.310> graphics<00:01:35.820> tests<00:01:36.060> themselves<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.570> can

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
actual graphics tests themselves you can

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.499 
actual graphics tests themselves you can
see<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> Nexus<00:01:37.259> 7<00:01:37.500> has<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.680> much<00:01:37.979> higher<00:01:38.009> FPS<00:01:38.579> so

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
see the Nexus 7 has a much higher FPS so

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.760 
see the Nexus 7 has a much higher FPS so
here<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.720> go<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> second<00:01:40.380> test<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
here we go with the second test that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.620 
here we go with the second test that
3dmark<00:01:41.280> gives<00:01:41.490> us<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.270> essentially

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
3dmark gives us and this is essentially

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.270 
3dmark gives us and this is essentially
the<00:01:42.780> same<00:01:42.990> as<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.290> first<00:01:43.470> test<00:01:43.770> except<00:01:44.189> it's

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the same as the first test except it's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
the same as the first test except it's
rendered<00:01:44.700> off-screen<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.329> 1080p<00:01:45.689> instead<00:01:46.259> of

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
rendered off-screen at 1080p instead of

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.069 
rendered off-screen at 1080p instead of
720p<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.759> more<00:01:48.450> pixels<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
720p so it's going to be more pixels to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.800 
720p so it's going to be more pixels to
push<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> more<00:01:50.040> demanding<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> GPU<00:01:51.299> now

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
push and more demanding for the GPU now

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.210 
push and more demanding for the GPU now
you<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.079> see<00:01:52.229> here<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.710> crashed<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.189> on

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
you can see here that it crashed out on

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.580 
you can see here that it crashed out on
the<00:01:53.670> ipad<00:01:54.060> mini<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.360> i<00:01:54.720> tried<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.170> two<00:01:55.439> or

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the ipad mini and i tried this two or

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.560 
the ipad mini and i tried this two or
three<00:01:55.829> times<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.790> crashed<00:01:57.060> out<00:01:57.240> every

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
three times and it crashed out every

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.120 
three times and it crashed out every
time<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:58.020> i<00:01:58.049> don't<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.409> why<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.920> maybe

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
time now i don't know why this is maybe

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.080 
time now i don't know why this is maybe
it's<00:01:59.369> because<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.700> doesn't<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.060> quite

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
it's because it doesn't have quite

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.959 
it's because it doesn't have quite
enough<00:02:00.329> RAM<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.110> do<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.460> crashed<00:02:02.790> out

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
enough RAM to do this but it crashed out

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.880 
enough RAM to do this but it crashed out
on<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.210> 1080p<00:02:03.600> test<00:02:03.960> every<00:02:04.290> time<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.770> we're

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
on the 1080p test every time so we're

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.200 
on the 1080p test every time so we're
not<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.399> any<00:02:05.549> results<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.119> this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
not going to get any results for this

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.809 
not going to get any results for this
you<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.750> see<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.320> Nexus<00:02:07.950> 7<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.489> frame

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
you can see on the Nexus 7 the frame

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.490 
you can see on the Nexus 7 the frame
rate<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.179> pretty<00:02:09.420> smooth<00:02:09.810> obviously<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.349> not

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
rate is pretty smooth obviously it's not

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.140 
rate is pretty smooth obviously it's not
quite<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> smoother<00:02:11.160> 720p<00:02:11.849> because<00:02:12.030> it's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
quite a smoother 720p because it's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.940 
quite a smoother 720p because it's
pushing<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.510> lot<00:02:12.629> more<00:02:12.780> pixels

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
pushing a lot more pixels

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.130 
pushing a lot more pixels
but<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.700> does<00:02:14.970> pretty<00:02:15.180> well<00:02:15.300> nonetheless<00:02:15.660> so

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
but it does pretty well nonetheless so

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.720 
but it does pretty well nonetheless so
let's<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.590> skip<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.920> results<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.459> see<00:02:17.580> what

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
let's just skip the results and see what

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.160 
let's just skip the results and see what
happens<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.239> here<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.480> go<00:02:18.510> with<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.810> results

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
happens so here we go with the results

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.110 
happens so here we go with the results
of<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.410> off<00:02:19.500> screen<00:02:19.860> 1080p<00:02:20.160> test<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.000> can

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
of the off screen 1080p test and you can

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.190 
of the off screen 1080p test and you can
see<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.300> nexus<00:02:21.720> 7<00:02:21.959> scores<00:02:22.970> 7175<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.599> FPS<00:02:25.019> is

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
see the nexus 7 scores 7175 the FPS is

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.479 
see the nexus 7 scores 7175 the FPS is
aren't<00:02:25.470> quite<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:25.680> high<00:02:25.950> as<00:02:26.010> when<00:02:26.280> we<00:02:26.400> were

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
aren't quite as high as when we were

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.220 
aren't quite as high as when we were
doing<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.760> 720p<00:02:27.330> test<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:27.870> that's<00:02:27.989> pretty

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
doing the 720p test but that's pretty

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.140 
doing the 720p test but that's pretty
obvious<00:02:28.379> nonetheless<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.430> performance<00:02:30.030> is

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
obvious nonetheless the performance is

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.850 
obvious nonetheless the performance is
still<00:02:30.360> pretty<00:02:30.540> good<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.140> again<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.470> couldn't

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
still pretty good and again I couldn't

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.110 
still pretty good and again I couldn't
get<00:02:31.980> any<00:02:32.099> results<00:02:32.519> out<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.790> ipad<00:02:33.090> mini

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
get any results out of the ipad mini

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.180 
get any results out of the ipad mini
this<00:02:33.599> last<00:02:33.870> test<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.260> completely<00:02:34.769> off<00:02:34.890> screen

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
this last test is completely off screen

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.680 
this last test is completely off screen
it<00:02:35.370> doesn't<00:02:35.610> have<00:02:35.790> limitations<00:02:36.239> like

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
it doesn't have limitations like

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.960 
it doesn't have limitations like
vertical<00:02:37.200> sync<00:02:37.410> or<00:02:37.590> display<00:02:37.920> resolution<00:02:38.519> so

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
vertical sync or display resolution so

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.460 
vertical sync or display resolution so
there's<00:02:39.209> nothing<00:02:39.330> capping<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.989> performance

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
there's nothing capping the performance

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.559 
there's nothing capping the performance
here<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.730> probably<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.090> best<00:02:42.269> test

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
here so this is probably the best test

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.550 
here so this is probably the best test
to<00:02:42.720> actually<00:02:42.989> see<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.260> performance

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
to actually see the performance

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.869 
to actually see the performance
difference<00:02:44.040> here<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.430> we're<00:02:44.549> just<00:02:44.580> going<00:02:44.760> to

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
difference here so we're just going to

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.550 
difference here so we're just going to
go<00:02:44.940> ahead<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.360> skip<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.840> results<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.410> here

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
go ahead and skip to the results so here

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.780 
go ahead and skip to the results so here
we<00:02:46.650> go<00:02:46.680> with<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.950> results<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.519> can<00:02:47.670> see

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
we go with the results and you can see

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.199 
we go with the results and you can see
