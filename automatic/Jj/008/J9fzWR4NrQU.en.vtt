00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.139
 why different vocal forms for that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.930
 to make people confused or so just not on 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.880
 in fact, everything is not so simple silently turning 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.890
 I do n't always want to cheat on my own 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.450
 In fact, I can say for sure about it 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.840
 one of the most important things in culture 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.110
 drinking wine in a glass can really kill 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.809
 wine is really just completely spoil 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.270
 his perceptions and you will think why 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.629
 I gave money for this bottle and just 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.640
 think what a mess 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:51.110
 visually forest i will tell madrid scientific 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.579
 approach to making the shape of the glass 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.230
 applied not long ago from the middle 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.260
 last century and foundational 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.379
 own moment for this 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:10.110
 perception appeared passion and lord 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:13.220
 the bolt itself to the wine and until the summer guru 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.020
 glass guru in general is the oldest 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.119
 own family in europe which 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.250
 engaged in the manufacture of glass they are not 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.310
 they invented the kinescope did not take 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.490
 came up with automotive glass 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.990
 actually got to 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.659
 for a glass and applied scientific scientific 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.880
 approach and why because using these 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.439
 talked about what we have 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.820
 language and in general our body of liters. 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.510
 proper 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.880
 language is divided into zones and perceptions 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:52.680
 some zones of individual things that is 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.050
 there salt bitterness sweetness yes she is important 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.479
 for holistic perception of wine is very 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.350
 important at what angle and which is better 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.680
 settings 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.380
 but there is this leg at what angle and with 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.679
 how thick does this wine fall 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.340
 why yes because there are different styles 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.989
 you have very powerful daytime wines yes 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.550
 if we talk about reds there are light wines 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.319
 actually we tried it today 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.450
 it would seem two red wines but they 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.239
 completely different in style though they are 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.950
 not dramatically right now that's not very 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:32.140
 radically different there is much 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.870
 more and more more different yes then 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.730
 there is guilt there is right very powerful there is 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.530
 very light red wines like 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.349
 stress they also behave differently 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.640
 in a glass 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.250
 accordingly the shape of the glass called 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.560
 intended to emphasize the virtues of 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.450
 of any sort, but for example 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.190
 talk generally about lutezh when they 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.880
 specially designed for flash drives 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.490
 name that is a glass of sparkling 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.590
 the blame 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.000
 sparkling for sparkling wine is still very 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.400
 it is important to show the game of bubbles 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.880
 for example, you know that in a clean new 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.680
 a good glass of champagne and can 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.450
 good regular champagne can 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.730
 play a day before that is whether your not that 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.050
 called bubble game bubble game 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.290
 i.e. there is a bubble. bubbles can 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.940
 actually a day to play in a glass is 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.810
 also a certain indicator well I see 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.910
 specifically took another such series a series of yes 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.950
 these wine glasses are specially invented 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.930
 in order to be able to take with you 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.940
 on a picnic so that you can in the grass 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.540
 set so that they do not fall but the most 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.520
 important it cups here look and here the bowl 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.150
 and here the bowl she plays a very big 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.690
 role and example here is a chart like 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.430
 She recommends the manufacturer for 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.200
 tight ball are given 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.440
 dense ball are given that is it is a bowl for 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.800
 white wines from Chardonnay grapes 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.470
 who are powerful southern but this bowl 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.490
 it would seem they look like but this bowl is for 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.570
 more simply 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.490
 oh well they seem so wide this bowl 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.770
 for your own pinot noir award and up 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.870
 beer style that is red 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:19.120
 grape variety is very thin very 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:22.240
 elegant give very very difficult and 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.400
 very aristocratic and red wines this 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.830
 one of the most difficult grape varieties 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.010
 not for cultivation listen and why 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.980
 then here burmese I see wait here 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.780
 accordingly here which she 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.880
 Naturally in each bowl are going to 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.340
 different flavor for each variety 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.320
 grapes actually analyzed 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.300
 what are the flavors going in their own way and 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.490
 respectively every every cup 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.770
 helps to collect the right scent for 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.080
 so that we fully appreciate in sjow 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.020
 army of aromatic ladies in this class 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.740
 and plus to everything this bowl allows us 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.930
 right 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.090
 actually serve the same but in the mouth 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.550
 to his own mouth stressed 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.860
 this is sort of statistics that's honest to you 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.470
 say we do tasting when we 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.930
 try 7 completely different wines by 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.810
 the style of the seven different shapes of the glass and 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.230
 we for fun just put plastic 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.080
 a cup yet 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.300
 and that's the one that's just been and still is our 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.650
 the most common cheapest 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.770
 most such bad glasses and re such 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.940
 the balls are far from Moscow such she sang 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.060
 thick glass 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.380
 that's when a man could not next 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.160
 man just comes to us on 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.720
 tasting he is really on his own experience 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.580
 understand that only one form of glass 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.810
 works for one style 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:47.420
 because in some glass of wine can 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.380
 start a bitter taste in some wine glass 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.640
 can precisely be very acid 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.010
 unpleasant for perception and 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.880
 that's for sure i tell you fairy tales i 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.250
 a follower 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.810
 that the house was sure to 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.420
 several glass shapes 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.810
 and if a person is keen on wine I think 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.280
 I drink wine very often 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.340
 many different shapes of glasses right 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.320
 some kind of hysteria begins yes 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.240
 when you start looking for the wrong 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.919
 a glass like he should be right 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.410
 plug the gavin about yourself 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.570
 absolutely not good in this glass 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.790
 you start to experiment and it happens 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.150
 find some unusual shape 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:28.680
 which emphasizes this particular wine 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.680
 wine is paradise on specialty
