 hello people welcome to this one 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.029
 tutorial how to build faster in 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.779
 Minecraft or faster can build whatever you like 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.510
 that you need new construction 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.559
 it's just an idea so we are now 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.500
 minecraft 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.630
 and what you need is the ex anger 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.940
 exxon for red edit 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.020
 and you need blackpool i'll leave it 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.550
 just see 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.830
 Imagine you have a little rookie 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.260
 made from different types of items 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.269
 like a store crack stonebridge 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.340
 and stone we see in feel and mossinkoff 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.650
 stone we see a stone we have too 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.660
 regular normal cobblestone 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.510
 and to do all this manually 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.410
 places that just take a lot of time 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.930
 so i have a very nice way 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.820
 found to do this faster 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.920
 well imagine we just make 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.850
 all black well you make a kind 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.100
 from 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.239
 environmental area how the how your god 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.989
 should look like 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.850
 well that is possible on different 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.190
 Ways to make him a little blocky 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.270
 make you can be a little small make you 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.250
 can make a little bigger 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.570
 Imagine this of course does not look 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.760
 but I will explain how 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.670
 that then finally looks like you are going 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.680
 make some small ones off the ground 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.090
 Well imagine I got here so quickly 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.490
 made something for a while 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.560
 this is all very fast of course and 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.600
 that is actually a cave for you 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.460
 in quick build then bundle and then 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.740
 actually that you have to linger from well 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.299
 wants to come to the block 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.799
 ok well imagine I have one here 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.270
 piece of god the beautiful music on the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.540
 background so I'll make it neat 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.270
 even now a broom and such 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.290
 we conclude that here nicely to this that you 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.119
 I was late 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.479
 ok well if you have such a piece right 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.540
 then select with the expert 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.909
 just serve one corner and the other 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 corner we select here 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.060
 I would make it a little high because we 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.170
 have lived a little high 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.149
 so then you do slash slash audience 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.250
 place space 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.740
 black so black meaning it is it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.659
 what we have selected and color 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.060
 then you fill in 89 the pants with 1.89 the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.020
 flour and two comma steam 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.500
 comma google store 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.050
 and we click enter and you will see that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.910
 all the black stone is mixed 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.500
 but all kinds of colors so this 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.540
 actually a much easier way 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.819
 to make a big one and to finish it 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.040
 could you take a look at my slash 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.410
 So we click to save the steam 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.489
 Rick and the couple chair and you would still be off 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.950
 and sometimes a little weak 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.170
 to make it less blocky 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.360
 make you get some more layers 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.769
 and floor height 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.319
 well i hope you still have handy tutorial 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.360
 found and will certainly follow channel 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.760
 for more handy tutorials about it 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.829
 build faster in minecraft 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.989
 and i would say keep playing me 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.459

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.459
