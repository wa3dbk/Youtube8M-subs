00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
one you can wear it nice and long since

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.349 
one you can wear it nice and long since
it's<00:03:39.919> a<00:03:39.980> heavier<00:03:40.280> bead<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:41.030> could<00:03:41.180> wear<00:03:41.329> it

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
it's a heavier bead you could wear it

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.330 
it's a heavier bead you could wear it
longer<00:03:41.599> on<00:03:41.810> your<00:03:41.840> chest<00:03:42.260> but<00:03:42.769> all<00:03:42.889> it<00:03:43.040> takes<00:03:43.069> is

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
longer on your chest but all it takes is

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.800 
longer on your chest but all it takes is
a<00:03:43.400> bail<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:43.969> a<00:03:44.030> head<00:03:44.209> pin<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.599> a<00:03:44.629> couple

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
a bail and a head pin and a couple

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.449 
a bail and a head pin and a couple
little<00:03:45.140> beads<00:03:45.349> and<00:03:45.860> then<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.040> can<00:03:46.189> attach<00:03:46.430> it

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
little beads and then you can attach it

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.199 
little beads and then you can attach it
to<00:03:46.760> chain<00:03:47.000> or<00:03:47.150> whatever<00:03:47.390> you<00:03:47.510> have<00:03:47.689> at<00:03:47.810> home

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
to chain or whatever you have at home

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.000 
to chain or whatever you have at home
so<00:03:48.659> hopefully<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.049> gives<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.319> an<00:03:49.439> idea<00:03:49.590> for

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
so hopefully this gives you an idea for

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.830 
so hopefully this gives you an idea for
if<00:03:50.099> you<00:03:50.189> have<00:03:50.370> some<00:03:50.609> big<00:03:50.849> chunks<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.420> beads<00:03:51.689> and

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
if you have some big chunks of beads and

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.209 
if you have some big chunks of beads and
you're<00:03:51.959> not<00:03:52.079> exactly<00:03:52.200> sure<00:03:52.650> what<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.859> do<00:03:53.069> it

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:53.219 
you're not exactly sure what to do it

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:55.399 
you're not exactly sure what to do it
one<00:03:53.790> bead<00:03:54.000> standing<00:03:54.390> alone<00:03:54.629> might<00:03:54.900> just<00:03:55.170> do<00:03:55.379> it

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
one bead standing alone might just do it

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.259 
one bead standing alone might just do it
and<00:03:55.859> if<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.400> have<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.549> chance<00:03:56.819> to<00:03:56.939> check<00:03:57.120> out
