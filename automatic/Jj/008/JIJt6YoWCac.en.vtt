00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.300
 yes there is already projects park of 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.809
 microsoft according to the manufacturer 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.150
 upcoming editor and games revolution 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.800
 we gambled the beta on the pc 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.470
 but the whole thing should be later on the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.810
 xbox one come out arm is currently running 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.670
 just closed beta and here we show 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.590
 short the most important elements below 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.960
 other that's called crossroads 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.990
 mode and here you finally play 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.759
 something like an action roleplay 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.770
 but with the fine pinch that one 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.879
 yourself decides what to do next 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.160
 happens here you can see for example 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.670
 just like the game automatically after 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.200
 we placed that in front of the enemy 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.360
 automatically just get away 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.160
 band and you can all the others 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.250
 Things decide for example wifi opponents grab 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.149
 what am I looking for at all or what 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.260
 now here's even the boss of the story 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.570
 Of course we decide here for the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.670
 quite classic and then shoot too 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.580
 the playful is the very thin but 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.530
 should show only what actually with 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.950
 the editor behind the projects park 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.299
 putting everything into action is in truth 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.880
 the whole thing is similar to 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.890
 the big planet it's a game though 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.810
 actually an experimental kit 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.280
 you can do a hell of a lot with that 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.560
 especially you are really clean 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.299
 Foxy and for this is this crossroads 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.250
 something even later from the developers 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.290
 After the beta is extended of course 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.659
 just a little bit for example around here 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.340
 just to collect meat you have yourself 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.930
 also selected one can just say I 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.549
 I want to seek a passion or me 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.790
 want to look for meat or something 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.350
 the other way here you can see the editor 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.600
 is she the simple one 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.000
 Variant means you can be from the game 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.040
 even something like a floor space 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.500
 produce can choose between just 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.119
 here is a very flat level mountains 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.470
 or you take for example such a 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.119
 Flusslandschaft I decide 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.240
 now here for a very flat 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.939
 level and then I can decide too 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.270
 if I want to have a forest now desert 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.000
 or just something closer to the desert altogether 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.580
 important you have to say something because 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.770
 Although rotex park is a free 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.930
 number so both perpetrators and later 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.620
 Of course, microsoft has to 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.299
 earn money 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.810
 and that's what you do about some elements 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.040
 for example, about these deserts 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.870
 background you can only choose that 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.819
 if you bought it before that can 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.580
 you just make it in game currency with the 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.140
 one can earn oneself over several 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.459
 chapmans and so on or just have to 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.900
 invest real money 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.819
 that a bit too bad, too 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.920
 afterwards then when you look at the things 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.569
 other players want to gamble on 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.670
 hope that you even the 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.500
 already has elements or you can only do them 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.140
 with his spark time and this limited 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.760
 play per day means if other dlc 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.560
 buy has to hope that they do 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.340
 says enough home to gamble 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.530
 that is very problematic 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.180
 much cooler we like there already just 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.709
 the editor himself 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.650
 you can see it here I 've got it 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.140
 The built looks quite normal simple 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.510
 and now I can meditate here 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.879
 and for that he has such a brain and there 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.310
 all his scripts and his 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.810
 whole behavioral stored like 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.819
 I'll show you later 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.159
 First of all to the simple things 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.909
 is there such a bio motor of it 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.099
 Pretty cool 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.720
 So you decide to try 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.489
 Go for a template and then 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.840
 say if i'm here with my brush 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.060
 go over it and the landscape will be 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.950
 automatically a forest painted there I have to 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.650
 So not every tree individually stand 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.209
 but what could be done later 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.620
 even more sets for example too 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.690
 to add a city 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.849
 I do, however small, can zeh 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.560
 also influence and try 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.389
 then at the touch of a button, whatever 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.959
 in real time, if all that 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.959
 is working 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.670
 my hero can swim here too 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.800
 I could stop now 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.840
 he swims fast he slowly floats 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.100
 Can not swim details can 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.250
 Of course you change as well 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.460
 For this one takes here this sculptor 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.320
 editor 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.700
 this is similar to the typical ones 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.200
 play peter molyneux 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.570
 So you can go up the landscape here 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.340
 and move down like from dust and 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.560
 then they followed with various 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.960
 paint brushes once with photoshop 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.490
 or similar has handled the view there 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.560
 immediately through it then gives here 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.270
 different material surfaces and the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.310
 program will be displayed automatically 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.810
 over it works wonderful and 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.530
 simply you can size the brush 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.480
 the brushes change intensity and what 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.520
 also very cool and important is below 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.440
 this orange bar he sees there 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.820
 in the end, that's all you have 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.220
 has done in the last few minutes 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.410
 and with that forward and rewind 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.210
 you then why you to everything again 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.980
 undo or back to the front 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.840
 So you do not make any mistakes 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.340
 the whole level is destroyed but one 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.340
 can undo everything 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.860
 very practical and generally everything 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.690
 very easy to handle, I think for 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.480
 such a powerful tool because if you look at yourself 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.280
 think about what other editors or 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.680
 real development programs with the 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.180
 the game will be done like this 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.550
 this is really necessary here 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.960
 very intuitive and then came great too 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.270
 For example, things build with it 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.860
 so it was here and happy star wars 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.570
 fans of course if you made something like that 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.700
 he is not here now 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.490
 functional but he looks a lot 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.720
 imposing and also shows something there 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.840
 everything is possible if you look 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.760
 really pure fox cool wise exists 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.980
 projects park also from the community and 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.020
 there you can free and right 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.150
 quickly all the masterpieces of 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.190
 download community and here to 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.660
 for example, then play a tetris what 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.919
 Of course it is very simple but still 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.169
 fascinating if you think about it 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.850
 that must be the camera up 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.770
 turned and actually a normal 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.000
 level as we have seen it before the 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.340
 my absolute favorite game here 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.120
 so far from the community has also been great 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.560
 reviews 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.480
 you really only have to go white 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.860
 and match the black cube 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.110
 but that looks really cool and 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.700
 now comes when you do not look like that 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.730
 You can easily do what is done 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.400
 press edit and then finally in 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.530
 to see the thing rumbasteln also exactly 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.030
 here is, for example, the speaker 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.050
 for music the levels are 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.669
 with each other 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.199
 arranges because why the camera since 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.080
 in fact only by flying to the next 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.729
 level you can see which scripps there 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.830
 you can do everything individually 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.960
 Click on Copy to select 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.460
 really cool so you really see how 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.919
 it was done so you can do that in the 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.990
 look purely mechanical and that is before 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.759
 everything is important if you like 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.789
 example here at this missile command 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:21.470
 would like to understand how it works 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.870
 most important tool of the Rotex market 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.449
 that works the prob editor 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.940
 So the one who finally brains 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:31.129
 So the whole ki of the individual things 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.080
 controls and that is actually this 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.729
 quite simple for all a bit 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.969
 had to do with logic in their lives 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:39.560
 there is a principle if so 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:41.060
 something happens then that should 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.190
 You can say that, for example 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.650
 when the left mouse button is pressed 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.319
 then you shoot or here you see 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.449
 For example, if the hells are below zero 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:53.569
 then falls an explosion 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:56.270
 played and the scala so the size 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.409
 from my tower is so small the 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.330
 in the end he disappears and 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.949
 It explodes and you can do things like that 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.960
 There is a lot of work going on there 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:05.029
 just very intuitive and also 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.310
 ultimately for everyone who is just as logical 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:08.900
 Mathematics and such things get along, too 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.300
 really feasible 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.310
 you just have to grow in and then 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.930
 you can even build such things here 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.610
 that is my other 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.460
 favorite game from the beta that is 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:22.069
 namely also fang offs park one 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.319
 nice fake the current crytek 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:25.879
 slaughter for the xbox horn sees 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.819
 Of course quite impressive 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:31.069
 But it's really amazingly cool 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:33.710
 So there are really such light beats 

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:35.960
 Heavy punches finishing moves and such 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.500
 continue and that's really real 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.500
 impressive 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.169
 and as always in blacksburg if something to him 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.449
 you do not like it, you just go there and 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:54.190
 paints for example in other soil 

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:55.990
 in the arena, even if I am so much here 

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.900
 bumbling clock but just to watch 

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:01.180
 show it is always my therefore synonymous 

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.340
 conclusion after the beta that can correctly 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.720
 be cool if microsoft no rip off 

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.720
 politics starts
