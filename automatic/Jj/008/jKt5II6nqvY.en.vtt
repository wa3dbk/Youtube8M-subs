c6 that sort of transmission right and
but<00:00:32.140> it's<00:00:32.290> not<00:00:32.470> just<00:00:32.740> for<00:00:32.890> fuel<00:00:33.100> economy<00:00:33.340> these

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
but it's not just for fuel economy these

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.120 
but it's not just for fuel economy these
are<00:00:33.850> heavy-duty<00:00:34.180> parts<00:00:34.750> for<00:00:34.930> high<00:00:35.110> speed<00:00:35.650> drag

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
are heavy-duty parts for high speed drag

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.340

Steve<00:00:38.680> we<00:00:38.830> do<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:40.120> I<00:00:40.330> mean<00:00:40.510> in<00:00:40.630> the<00:00:40.780> booth<00:00:40.900> this

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
Steve we do and I mean in the booth this

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.660 
Steve we do and I mean in the booth this
year<00:00:41.200> we<00:00:41.560> of<00:00:41.680> course<00:00:41.890> have<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.130> drag<00:00:42.490> weight

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
year we of course have to drag weight

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.550 
year we of course have to drag weight
cars<00:00:43.000> because<00:00:43.390> Drag<00:00:43.720> Week<00:00:43.900> was<00:00:44.080> epic<00:00:44.380> this

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
cars because Drag Week was epic this

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.410 
cars because Drag Week was epic this
year<00:00:44.830> and<00:00:44.980> we'll<00:00:45.370> go<00:00:45.460> into<00:00:45.610> that<00:00:45.730> in<00:00:45.880> a<00:00:46.030> second

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
year and we'll go into that in a second

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.750 
year and we'll go into that in a second
but<00:00:46.600> yeah<00:00:46.750> gear<00:00:47.020> vendors<00:00:47.290> basically<00:00:47.740> pits<00:00:48.010> you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
but yeah gear vendors basically pits you

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.780 
but yeah gear vendors basically pits you
know<00:00:48.880> all<00:00:49.180> your<00:00:49.390> classic<00:00:50.020> muscle<00:00:50.350> car<00:00:50.710> era<00:00:50.950> for

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
know all your classic muscle car era for

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.840 
know all your classic muscle car era for
speeds<00:00:52.300> because<00:00:52.990> it<00:00:53.290> was<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.530> close<00:00:53.980> ratio<00:00:54.310> era

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
speeds because it was a close ratio era

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.030 
speeds because it was a close ratio era
of<00:00:55.030> four<00:00:55.270> speeds<00:00:55.630> not<00:00:56.020> just<00:00:56.320> automatics<00:00:56.800> for

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
of four speeds not just automatics for

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.830 
of four speeds not just automatics for
speeds<00:00:57.310> and<00:00:57.490> a<00:00:57.820> manual<00:00:58.150> transmission<00:00:58.329> suit

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
speeds and a manual transmission suit

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.660 
speeds and a manual transmission suit
that's<00:00:59.140> right<00:00:59.350> yeah<00:00:59.560> so<00:01:00.070> if<00:01:00.160> you've<00:01:00.460> got<00:01:00.610> a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
that's right yeah so if you've got a

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.479 
that's right yeah so if you've got a
classic<00:01:01.060> muscle<00:01:01.450> car<00:01:01.840> and<00:01:02.200> and<00:01:02.680> you<00:01:03.220> grew<00:01:03.460> up

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
classic muscle car and and you grew up

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.059 
classic muscle car and and you grew up
with<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.269> you<00:01:04.629> know<00:01:05.079> how<00:01:05.350> those<00:01:05.740> close

00:01:06.059 --> 00:01:06.069 
with that you know how those close

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:08.010 
with that you know how those close
ratios<00:01:06.520> really<00:01:06.850> make<00:01:06.999> the<00:01:07.149> car<00:01:07.329> perform<00:01:07.749> and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
ratios really make the car perform and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.599 
ratios really make the car perform and
so<00:01:08.530> you<00:01:08.590> don't<00:01:08.770> want<00:01:08.859> to<00:01:09.039> put<00:01:09.159> in<00:01:09.249> a<00:01:09.340> wider

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:09.609 
so you don't want to put in a wider

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:11.489 
so you don't want to put in a wider
ratio<00:01:10.240> corporate<00:01:10.929> average<00:01:11.049> fuel<00:01:11.200> economy

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:15.270

you'd<00:01:13.270> rather<00:01:13.390> have<00:01:13.569> overdrive<00:01:14.079> behind<00:01:14.890> that

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
you'd rather have overdrive behind that

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.459 
you'd rather have overdrive behind that
close<00:01:15.819> ratio<00:01:16.060> trans<00:01:16.509> and<00:01:16.749> that's<00:01:17.139> same<00:01:17.350> with

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
close ratio trans and that's same with

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:18.870 
close ratio trans and that's same with
the<00:01:17.560> automatics<00:01:18.039> which<00:01:18.189> were<00:01:18.340> which<00:01:18.670> we're
