00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 Congratulations, Renan, you're the winner of the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.919
 first funk is your grandmother home and if 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.410
 beautiful love number one you won 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.710
 because we thought your video 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.269
 was the best in argumentation 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.410
 I wanted to say congratulations to many others. 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.900
 people who sent us to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.560
 example the koschina silas who spoke of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.180
 I used to nauseate in Japan the face I speak 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.519
 You have to understand that I have now forgotten the name 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.199
 which was one of the best productions very 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.470
 well argued also more people 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.920
 he judged that the renan made an argument 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.410
 that's the way it's better and I like it 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.300
 willingness to read kôroku no masters indicates 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.450
 for the renan and for the next ones that will 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.600
 send video to people on fam quest 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.670
 the renan the problem was not the camera 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.350
 because the camera is kind of bad but then 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.640
 it's not because you're not required to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.039
 buy camera bag or cause 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.780
 these but the framework is better and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.379
 cool, I want to be a more 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.020
 Nice and maybe less time for description 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.250
 and more opinion time 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.430
 a lot of people sent you a video that is 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.250
 basically writing the work only 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.930
 Talking happened, this happens and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.490
 I went out that year 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.740
 So we want the opinion of who knows 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.619
 What is your opinion about the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.970
 work you want to talk to renan 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.830
 You made a good argument to us. 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.100
 I like very much people will read the Croatian. 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.509
 expanded the quest fan this May 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.040
 It's kind of hard because people are not 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.090
 I'm late, I 'm putting it now. 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.759
 At the end of the month 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.869
 So it works out for June, I go. 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.909

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.119

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.790

 I give you a prize for beauty then 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.259
 stay there with the renan talking about coconut not 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.259
 basketball 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 juca 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.659
 hello my name is ana era that is the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.659
 pet 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.879
 I will speak today about body on the boat . 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.980
 manga is that the trade flee brand of the torch 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.810
 and holding a season of 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.060
 anime and they were going to win a second 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.329
 season an earlier sequence 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.290
 the manga he sold or smoked up to the mood of 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.230
 last year 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.269
 however after the launch it became 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.659
 bomb sales start selling so much 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.939
 how big for example tonic issue 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:54.000
 including the procon of so many volumes of 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:56.840
 Last year it surpassed only 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.609
 naruto of black volumes and linkedin had 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.739
 beginning with the language I admit that 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.010
 they had enough prejudice with manga 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.769
 I followed jamp and basketball 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.579
 do not forget sporting was never mine 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.700
 strong 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.120
 I was never one of the champions, for example. 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.400
 place was practically in test era 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.590
 Fun to kill, I never got cracked. 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.949
 for what then where's always 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.810
 I avoided watching but it worries a lot 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:27.269
 he was very positive and I'm going to start 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.849
 stay here because you put the bill on the 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.299
 victory of the basketball team that was 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.489
 top and it will come accompanied by 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.400
 a generation of projects of five large 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.699
 was known as a generation 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.189
 two miracles and a lack of guards who 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:46.620
 there was a fantastic feeling fmi 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:50.790
 he tried to raise found the problem of 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.129
 next series the team 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.129
 He separated the group has a way 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.889
 peculiar to 3 of all his roles 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.549
 is to prove to others that the 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:05.579
 playing basketball can be effective and 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:09.180
 or prove that hitting him is the way 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.199
 correct to play, I want to prove the 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.599
 play 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:15.590
 is not a way for him to go for the attack 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.150
 he is our interesting support 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.220
 At this point we have a protagonist 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.970
 who does not want to do things for him 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.910
 same 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.990
 He wants to lead the team to victory. 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.139
 What a very interesting thing. 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.100
 when nine staff 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:34.010
 the beautiful pact he is in prison the more I lecture 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.919
 and no one notices it he does not scream it 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.430
 picture represents then really is 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:43.280
 accustomed to uribe is talking to 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.949
 Naruto gong a good time he is 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.560
 completely opposite this character in the 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:52.040
 new school that starts the anime it goes 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.520
 to get big beach taiba tiger do not get 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.229
 realized that you do not know yourself funny - 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.710
 this new college by knows kagame 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:04.400
 taiga a player of great stature and 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.220
 much humidity basketball crowds that is with 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.580
 participate in it is a game of shadows 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.520
 they play that is the light and the shadow 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.229
 him stronger then the 5 plus the 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.380
 basketball relationship all two 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.450
 last is also the main reason 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.479
 with a lot of people implies with the series 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.850
 saying that she is dreaming and hi is not is 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.729
 a common film like any other with the 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.950
 friendship above all else is the 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.419
 Speed ​​was a little on the bridge service 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:37.430
 and anime staff realizes that it sells 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.000
 books with a password there only 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.889
 To give x- ray and joy to the girl. 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.970
 anime victory but did not interfere in anything 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.349
 the quality of the rectum and has very 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.740
 ignorant to give ball to this 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:54.229
 in the most expensive of the targa the group begins to 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.080
 certain prior rules and show 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.120
 for them to appear the pineapple is 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.700
 interesting and can work out 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.160
 he even changes some of them 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.960
 can show that they have staff is 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.180
 important in basketball 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.810
 there is something very obvious it is true that 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.780
 it is very obvious a clear consensus mt passes 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.900
 even convinced that you really 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.789
 reason for now individually and this 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.370
 It is very interesting this invitation 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:26.930
 universe it purpose when the universe 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.160
 sound causes here can compare with the 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.890
 andres 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.650
 that combat is a quasi- 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:36.230
 supernatural and even and I like 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.690
 of supernatural schools we have 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:42.410
 players to be waived 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:44.960
 I find this unrealistic 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.480
 we must and must now copy the quality 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.700
 of others and players who have eyes 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.220
 can see the whole court 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.680
 all saves any virtual invitation 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:57.770
 way deaf but you're like to try 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.140
 a win and it gets very interesting 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.590
 as to who in fact is text that 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.590
 has received 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.850
 I recommend crow's proposal that he is 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.280
 funny 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.020
 he delivers the basic proposal was she 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:16.460
 who made an interesting enmity of the 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.890
 mind that it was fun to know the whole 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.470
 time I've been reading everything we have to 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:24.680
 keep looking, thanks every minute 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.940
 so a series like this is a team that gives 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.030
 I like to follow 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.880
 so you should really let go 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:35.380
 Prejudice that I have I say prejudice 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:40.970
 in the word of a pre-concept 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:42.230
 told you do not know something is playing in the 

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.960
 your ignorance 

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.160
 then the force and argue that even what 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.770
 Do you think about her? 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.200
 I say you will not then repent 

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:55.960
 well she said my name is renan 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.960
 weak and that was the fantastic
