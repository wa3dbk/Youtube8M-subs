I<00:00:02.689> think<00:00:03.689> it<00:00:03.840> was<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.310> good<00:00:05.310> response<00:00:05.730> for<00:00:05.970> us<00:00:06.089> I

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
I think it was a good response for us I

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.179 
I think it was a good response for us I
mean<00:00:06.390> when<00:00:07.109> things<00:00:07.319> aren't<00:00:07.529> going<00:00:07.649> well<00:00:07.859> and

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
mean when things aren't going well and

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.549 
mean when things aren't going well and
in<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.910> city<00:00:09.150> got<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> lot<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.630> overanalyzing

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
in the city got a lot of overanalyzing

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.049 
in the city got a lot of overanalyzing
going<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.219> think<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.490> was<00:00:11.580> nice<00:00:11.730> for<00:00:12.000> us

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
going on so I think it was nice for us

going on so I think it was nice for us
to<00:00:12.230> kind<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.349> put<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.710> little<00:00:14.340> streak<00:00:15.210> or

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
to kind of put that little streak or

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.090 
to kind of put that little streak or
everyone<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.750> call<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.049> bad<00:00:16.680> play<00:00:16.920> behind

everyone to call it that bad play behind
us<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.580> now<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.060> build<00:00:18.210> on<00:00:18.359> this

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
us and now we have to just build on this

us and now we have to just build on this
and<00:00:18.720> try<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> find<00:00:19.500> some<00:00:19.740> consistency<00:00:21.710> same

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710

well um are our mentality tonight was

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.560 
well um are our mentality tonight was
just<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.660> battle<00:00:31.619> i<00:00:31.710> guess<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.450> that<00:00:33.450> was

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
just to battle i guess and and that was

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.229 
just to battle i guess and and that was
our<00:00:33.719> main<00:00:33.989> focus<00:00:34.559> keep<00:00:34.800> 25<00:00:35.370> shots<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.969> under

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
our main focus keep 25 shots and under

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
against us and we're pretty cool so that

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.660 
against us and we're pretty cool so that
we<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.790> thought<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.180> place<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.420> very<00:00:39.629> solid<00:00:40.200> game

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
we I thought we place a very solid game

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.040 
we I thought we place a very solid game
have<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.790> figured<00:00:42.000> out<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.210> way<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.450> block<00:00:42.780> out

not worry about that and worry about

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.450 
not worry about that and worry about
what<00:01:12.720> we're<00:01:12.840> doing<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.290> James<00:01:14.100> was

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
what we're doing in there James was

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.090 
what we're doing in there James was
there<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> sense<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.060> urgency<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.799> was<00:01:16.799> based

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
there a sense of urgency that was based

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.490 
there a sense of urgency that was based
almost

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
almost

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.860 
almost
um<00:01:19.250> well<00:01:19.880> again<00:01:20.090> we<00:01:20.240> weren't<00:01:20.450> happy<00:01:20.660> with<00:01:20.750> the

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
um well again we weren't happy with the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.510 
um well again we weren't happy with the
way<00:01:20.930> we<00:01:20.960> play<00:01:21.230> but<00:01:21.440> I<00:01:21.470> think<00:01:21.710> again<00:01:21.950> when

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
way we play but I think again when

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.770 
way we play but I think again when
you're<00:01:22.640> playing<00:01:22.850> smart<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.360> don't<00:01:23.510> have<00:01:23.630> to

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
you're playing smart you don't have to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.450 
you're playing smart you don't have to
you<00:01:24.170> can<00:01:24.200> work<00:01:24.500> smarter<00:01:24.680> too<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:25.250> you'll<00:01:25.370> have

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
you can work smarter too so you'll have

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.830 
you can work smarter too so you'll have
to<00:01:25.550> start<00:01:25.700> running<00:01:25.910> around<00:01:26.240> out<00:01:26.420> there<00:01:26.450> and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
to start running around out there and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.960 
to start running around out there and
again<00:01:27.650> we've<00:01:27.830> talked<00:01:28.130> about<00:01:28.280> working<00:01:28.550> harder

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
again we've talked about working harder

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.130 
again we've talked about working harder
but<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:29.150> think<00:01:29.390> again<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:29.720> comes<00:01:29.810> down<00:01:29.930> to

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
but I think again it comes down to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.960 
but I think again it comes down to
working<00:01:30.410> smarter<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.010> when<00:01:31.160> you're<00:01:31.310> when<00:01:31.880> you

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
working smarter and when you're when you

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.570 
working smarter and when you're when you
know<00:01:32.090> you're<00:01:32.510> gonna<00:01:32.630> play<00:01:32.870> smart<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:34.310> makes

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
know you're gonna play smart it makes

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.920 
know you're gonna play smart it makes
the<00:01:34.670> game<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:34.820> lot<00:01:34.940> easier<00:01:37.600> got<00:01:38.600> much<00:01:38.750> better

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
the game a lot easier got much better

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.690 
the game a lot easier got much better

in third period in your eyes what's been

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.950 
in third period in your eyes what's been
the<00:01:42.740> difference<00:01:42.920> in<00:01:43.250> sort<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.610> last<00:01:43.960> yeah

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
the difference in sort of the last yeah

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.350 
the difference in sort of the last yeah
right<00:01:45.260> um<00:01:45.680> I<00:01:45.740> think<00:01:46.700> we're<00:01:46.820> just<00:01:46.850> keep<00:01:47.210> it

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
right um I think we're just keep it

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.320 
right um I think we're just keep it
simple<00:01:47.390> where<00:01:47.990> we<00:01:48.800> keep<00:01:49.369> our<00:01:49.550> forecheck<00:01:50.030> going

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
simple where we keep our forecheck going

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.109 
simple where we keep our forecheck going
I<00:01:50.420> think<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:51.229> that's<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.590> big<00:01:51.710> reason<00:01:51.920> why<00:01:52.160> we

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
I think and that's a big reason why we

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.580 
I think and that's a big reason why we
can<00:01:53.270> spend<00:01:53.509> some<00:01:53.600> time<00:01:53.930> in<00:01:54.050> their<00:01:54.170> zone<00:01:54.410> and

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
can spend some time in their zone and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.469 
can spend some time in their zone and
kill<00:01:54.770> some<00:01:54.979> time<00:01:55.160> because<00:01:55.369> if<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:55.970> if<00:01:56.360> you're

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
kill some time because if you if you're

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.910 
kill some time because if you if you're
just<00:01:56.630> backing<00:01:56.899> in<00:01:57.200> your<00:01:57.350> zone<00:01:57.530> that's<00:01:57.770> when

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
just backing in your zone that's when

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.680 
just backing in your zone that's when
they're<00:01:58.040> gonna<00:01:58.130> get<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.910> lot<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.119> shots<00:01:59.390> and
