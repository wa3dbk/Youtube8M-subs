core<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.669> quad<00:00:32.969> core<00:00:33.210> processor<00:00:33.270> by

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
core and it's a quad core processor by

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.020 
core and it's a quad core processor by
the<00:00:34.079> way<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.340> said<00:00:35.520> before<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the way and as I said before it's the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.750 
the way and as I said before it's the
LGA<00:00:36.450> 1155<00:00:37.290> slot<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.250> 95<00:00:38.670> watt<00:00:38.969> actual

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
LGA 1155 slot and it's a 95 watt actual

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.160 
LGA 1155 slot and it's a 95 watt actual
processor<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.480> let's<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.719> ahead<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.020> this

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
processor so let's go ahead and get this

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.720 
processor so let's go ahead and get this
sucker<00:00:43.410> open<00:00:43.649> now<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:43.980> those<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.579> who

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
have never opened up a processor box

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.840 
have never opened up a processor box
before<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.010> good<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.670> that

yeah<00:01:28.080> let's<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.650> bought<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> whole<00:01:29.100> box

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
yeah let's just bought the whole box

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.580 
yeah let's just bought the whole box
them<00:01:29.570> pull<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> whole<00:01:30.869> box<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.439> can

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
them pull out the whole box as you can

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.749 
them pull out the whole box as you can
see<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> includes<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.729> processor<00:01:33.720> fan<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
see it includes the processor fan and

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.010 
see it includes the processor fan and
what<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:35.970> about<00:01:36.090> Intel<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.600> actually<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
what I like about Intel is actually do a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.810 
what I like about Intel is actually do a
good<00:01:37.170> job<00:01:37.229> packaging<00:01:37.979> these<00:01:38.130> things<00:01:38.400> because

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
good job packaging these things because

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
good job packaging these things because
it's<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.150> one<00:01:39.509> nice<00:01:39.810> little<00:01:39.990> cardboard<00:01:40.380> getup

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770

it's all one nice little cardboard getup
and<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.090> point<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.470> know

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and at this point you can just you know

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.109 
and at this point you can just you know
it's<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.920> matter<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.220> okay<00:01:44.670> let's<00:01:45.000> go

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it's just a matter of okay let's go

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.450 
it's just a matter of okay let's go
ahead<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.450> pull<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.530> fan<00:01:46.860> shake<00:01:47.310> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
ahead and pull out the fan shake it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.090 
ahead and pull out the fan shake it
upside<00:01:47.759> down<00:01:47.810> got<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.229> there<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
upside down got that out of there and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340 
upside down got that out of there and
then<00:01:50.220> when<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> processor<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.630> can

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
then when I get out the processor I can

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.800 
then when I get out the processor I can
just<00:01:52.619> yeah<00:01:53.640> should<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.329> minute<00:01:54.420> flip

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
just yeah should be just a minute flip

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.100 
just yeah should be just a minute flip
it<00:01:54.930> over<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.100> go<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:57.329> then<00:01:57.719> I've<00:01:57.899> got

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it over there you go and then I've got

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.830 
it over there you go and then I've got
my<00:01:58.369> processor<00:01:59.369> now<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.420> those<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.719> have

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
my processor now for those of you have

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.780 
my processor now for those of you have
never<00:02:00.930> installed<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.560> processor<00:02:02.159> before<00:02:02.520> it's

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
never installed a processor before it's

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.359 
never installed a processor before it's
it's<00:02:03.570> kind<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.259> easy<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.770> am<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> be

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it's kind of easy to do I am going to be

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.010 
it's kind of easy to do I am going to be
doing<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.640> video<00:02:05.850> series<00:02:06.090> soon<00:02:06.450> about<00:02:06.750> sides
