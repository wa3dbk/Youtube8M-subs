00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.660
 Breaststroke is the most complicated swimming style 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.950
 although it looks simpler than gray and every kid is first to learn 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.499
 the perfect technique quite difficult to implement 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.150
 most important is the right rhythm 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.840
 One of them pulls a Russian on the train, followed by a strong kick 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.079
 missed a long dress 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.789
 It is important that we offset the time during movement but optimally 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.319
 Matched with each other, that one dress IT and thus better 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.250
 to come forward 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.220
 on 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.580
 Frankfurt 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.199
 more 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.150
 to recognize in slow motion 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.790
 the suit goes to the chest 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.790
 The legs begin to bump when he is almost done 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.700
 In doing so, the arms will stay far forward and west to the ears 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 means 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.980
 The first exercise is perfect for a powerful kick 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.660
 For the right water situation, your hands are on a board 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.670
 so you can concentrate better on the right technique 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.240
 Make sure your knees do not go too far apart and your feet 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 Turned outward, butt over the side to the rear 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.930
 Here you can see the kick of the legs with breathing 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.050
 both countries are holding the board 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.670
 "The head needs to close with its legs in the water 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.400
 If they breathe, the slide bearing would be in the water as long as possible 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.460
 I show here an exercise that can double hit 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.460
 that means coming on a train two leg beats 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.240
 Bramel 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.250
 Rheine 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.930
 legs 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.470
 receipt 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.470
 Here we see the double leg bump in the water 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.229
 Poor Rheine 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.530
 This has the consequence that one learns the optimal jump in the same time 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.649
 take 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.649
 Make sure that your arms are firmly attached to the competences 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.389
 we see a typical mistake here called a sign 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.459
 the error is visible because the exercise is on the back 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.829
 the knees go apart like a scissor 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.469
 The chin is also too far on the chest and then too deep in the post 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.199
 Here is Franziska right 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.599
 Head and body lie flat on the water 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.599
 The legs perform powerful push-like movements 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:03.099
 In this exercise, it is about the knees together and possibly under 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.099
 Stay water 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.169
 rank 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.519
 I explain Franziska what Peer mother what I have just not true 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.509
 Teltow relation is too deep 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.509
 that slows down 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.899
 the beautiful on the monitor Industries to see a very good stretch 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.329
 in the next crisis Gainey's elbow is too far back 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.139
 so they can not be brought forward in front of the chest 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.359
 8th 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.809
 Dr 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:44.699
 d 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.699
 Finally, I make it right momentum again 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.229
 I speak for a long time the drive is powerful 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.189
 In slow motion, the elbows become tight in front of the chest 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.189
 merged and then close far forward 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.899
 Professionals try to get over their bookkeeping in 4er 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:08.709
 immerse 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.919
 Nat 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.919
 Dr 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.199
 the hefty leg bump quarters that I might get in so far maybe 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.389
 catapulted forward
