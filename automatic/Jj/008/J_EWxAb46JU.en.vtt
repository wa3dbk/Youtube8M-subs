00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.080
 I will give you some tips 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.210
 to make up 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.890
 if you have blond hair all 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.210
 first at the level of the colors it is necessary 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.679
 know that there are colors that knows 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.349
 more white- haired than others 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.320
 so for your makeup avoid the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.020
 brown tones on the other hand favored for 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.430
 your face the pink tones and bages 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
 very clear that they will illuminate 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.150
 your entire face is as well 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.550
 will match with the bright color 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.560
 of your hair finally at the level of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.779
 others preferred colors eyelids 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.450
 nude in rather cold tones so 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.860
 like the khaki the gray or even the black 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.469
 you can also wear 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.690
 light nude colors such as beige or 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.070
 pink on the lips 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.649
 we will also choose colors 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.780
 very very clear indeed the colors 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.430
 flashy or dark tend to have a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.260
 effect any match on blond hair 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.930
 especially if you have colored hair 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.000
 blond so to show you today 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.590
 some examples I have already applied a 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
 foundation that is a very color 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.370
 very clear as clear as the rest of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.629
 my skin because when we are blond we have 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.039
 often very clear skin it is 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.960
 important to choose a foundation 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.320
 adapted to the color of his skin 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.750
 so then to continue our face 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.430
 so we're going to apply a blush to 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.310
 cheeks and I choose it in a hue 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.200
 very very clear very pink and like this 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.960
 sign the goal being to bring a small 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.250
 little freshness in the face 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.259
 so we really apply it all 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.380
 gently like these using a 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.909
 big powder brush like this one on 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.100
 gives a very very light layer 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.210
 since remove it and not to see 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.500
 that there are several layers of makeup 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.030
 that's a healthy glow was on 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.619
 which brings out a little bit the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.130
 clear face of the girls who have the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.130
 Blond hair 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:52.310
 then we will apply an illuminator 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.170
 so in fact the playoffs are 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.610
 often creamy textures that one applies 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.189
 on certain areas of the face for 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.810
 illuminate the face this will help to 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.030
 make your face very bright 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.069
 capture the light that is also put 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.799
 forward by blond haired so me 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.810
 I choose a product like these 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.610
 I apply with my finger on zones 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:20.549
 strategic like the bridge of the nose again 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:26.489
 the top of the cheekbone as well as the 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:28.079
 below the eyebrow so once 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.180
 you have grossly applied the 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.829
 product you just faded always at 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.260
 finger you can also do it at 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.360
 using a brush so on the nose on 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.950
 do not go down too much or too much 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.319
 sides because the goal is really to capture 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.390
 the light on the area that is the most 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:49.129
 exposed we blur everything at the level of 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.129
 cheekbones and eyebrow 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.450
 so here it is with its light zones 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.129
 gives an effect quite glowy as much 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.450
 which is very very pretty and in addition 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.110
 quite in the makeup trend 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.580
 of the moment so at the level of the lips I 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.920
 will apply something in agreement 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.170
 with the blush that we put so I 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.090
 choose a very hot pink lipstick 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.360
 clear that's what will go the wall to 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.360
 blondes 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:32.629
 in the same way I do not apply a 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:33.110
 touch the tunes so finally at the level of 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.840
 eyes 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.940
 I'm going to apply a pretty color 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.620
 clear so using a brush like 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.910
 this one and you can choose 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.230
 any eyebrush 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.000
 so for starters I'm going to apply 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.750
 a very light color and a little bit 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.160
 pink so this sign color and I 'm going 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.500
 apply it on all of my 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.500
 mobile and fixed eyelid 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.700
 so we just avoid the area we have 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.989
 already laid of the illuminator posed this fort 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.969
 on the entire eyelid will allow 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.299
 to unify the color of the skin on the 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.299
 eyelid 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.210
 then always with the slim I'm going 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.950
 come create a very small area 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.140
 shaded using a color that will be 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.540
 particularly particularly well 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.570
 to blondes so I was going that color 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.310
 if that is a gray any 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.080
 metal grill will do it 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.730
 the important thing is to really choose a 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.280
 cold color so in which the 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.920
 bunkers on tomorrow or so below tuna 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.220
 red are almost non-existent 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:56.220
 come apply it here so in the hollow 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:05:00.050
 of the eye in tiny touches have 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.050
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.349
 and so once we get that we come 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:14.789
 faded with a big brush 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:16.830
 faded by like this one so we 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.189
 only blends the upper part 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.189
 of the eye 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.970
 so here to finish this makeup 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.380
 ideal for blondes 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.930
 you just have to apply a 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.090
 little bit of mascara so we recapitulate 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.370
 for blondes opted for colors 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.199
 cold and especially especially for your 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.090
 face for very very soft colors 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.270
 because that's really what will put you in 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.270
 before
