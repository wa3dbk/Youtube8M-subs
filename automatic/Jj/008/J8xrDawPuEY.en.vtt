 sporting that close of lines that close 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.270
 en bloc the Canadian team did not know

 and attention reaches Canada will also be 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.650
 say that the team from canada out there 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.390
 is a little more tired the 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.990
 Lamb care lose serves the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.990

 to notice what we have been saying 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.080
 very bad but very bad the output of the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.610
 goalkeeper who in the end did not even bet 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.650
 much more lacked perhaps a little more 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.240
 of strategy and knowing when to close 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.940
 also lines and close spaces for 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.890
 look around for a much more play 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.750
 interesting in offensive situation 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.080

 also lines and close spaces for 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.970
 look around for a much more play 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.480
