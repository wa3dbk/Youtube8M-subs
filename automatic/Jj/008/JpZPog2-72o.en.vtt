00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
of that you have to shorten it a little

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
of that you have to shorten it a little
bit<00:01:22.830> otherwise<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.520> would<00:01:23.640> become<00:01:23.939> too<00:01:24.150> long

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
bit otherwise it would become too long

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.230 
bit otherwise it would become too long
so<00:01:25.290> I've<00:01:25.409> started<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.950> create<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.549> sample<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
so I've started to create the sample and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.350 
so I've started to create the sample and
trimmed<00:01:27.689> off<00:01:27.930> an<00:01:28.229> inch<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.280> half<00:01:29.310> from<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
lower edge of the pocket so I've started

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.080

to<00:01:32.670> trim<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:34.170> you'd<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.880> 1/4<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.000> an

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
to trim this and then you'd so 1/4 of an

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
to trim this and then you'd so 1/4 of an
inch<00:01:36.150> seam<00:01:36.450> allowance<00:01:36.680> turn<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.799> right-side

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
inch seam allowance turn it right-side

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.760 
inch seam allowance turn it right-side
out<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.689> sample<00:01:40.200> has<00:01:40.320> been<00:01:40.380> turned

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.109 
out and this sample has been turned
right-side<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.610> see<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.850> put<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> little
