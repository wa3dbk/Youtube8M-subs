00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.710
 Hello 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.559
 today I bring you a video about the chai 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.230
 ling is about a very fine delineated by 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.269
 inside the hidden eye many already what 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.250
 you know what you use as a complement to 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.540
 your usual eye makeup but 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.010
 in this case I bring the timeline and how 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.530
 own makeup on the catwalk has been 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.100
 seen as a trend of 2014 a 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.470
 very natural makeup or go 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.379
 makeup but not notice much that 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.079
 you're makeup in my mouth does some 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.469
 days I talked about this trend and I promised 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.600
 upload a video of the execution of this 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.120
 very natural makeup 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.940
 unamid cream or foundation 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.370
 a little bit of translucent powder for 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.710
 notify a little bit and a little 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.730
 Contouring the face with powders 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.520
 bronzers 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.369
 some lips 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.409
 a little and in the eyes the famous 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.259
 internal delineation and our 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.829
 must-have mascara 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.829
 we would be without her 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.560
 or as the more expensive Anglo-Saxons say 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.360
 what good yes without more camera that can 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.510
 be or the mask or it can be the most 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.510
 cheap 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.680
 and I do not roll more I pass the video 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.909
 for the realization of this technique 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.659
 We can use any of these 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.300
 products 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.300
 Eyeliner this is time to jal 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.210
 the line the marker 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.250
 Weiner is the liquid 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.960
 or in gel type 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.189
 and this one came with his little brush 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.189
 Apply 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.990
 I'm going to choose the pencil 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.470
 because it's more practical for me this is very 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:06.220
 creamy and it is very easy to apply it is 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.780
 apply in a moment 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.940
 although you can see that the eye 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.560
 left I've already drawn it 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.040
 appreciates the difference in one eye 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.040
 the other 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.800
 and well it's about 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.440
 delineate the lash line and by the 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.000
 holes that remain between them is not 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.580
 exactly the water line though 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.620
 Naturally you can do it too 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:40.980
 just right by the tabs he touches 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.599
 a more intense eye effect if it comes out 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.150
 a little bit of product like in this case 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.989
 It is cleaned so that the eyelid 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.989
 see makeup free 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.730
 and we apply mascara 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.730
 this is the spelled light 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:14.130
 and this would be the technique itself in this 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.160
 case I do not wear makeup alone in the 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.410
 victim and a little color powder 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.980
 sorry a little tanning powder in 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.980
 the cheekbones 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:31.780
 but the correct thing would be to take her face 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:36.940
 well made with the base 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.400
 and with the correctors if necessary 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:45.129
 which in my case would be necessary 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:48.369
 obviously but as it was about 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:53.669
 show the eye technique has not given me 

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:53.669
 nor time to prepare more complexion 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.950
 can also be given on the line 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.430
 lower eyelashes but in my case 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.820
 I prefer if in the case of doing something to 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.710
 do the water line because if I do 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.940
 only the lash line gives me the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:24.150
 feeling that towards the round eye and 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:26.610
 not be in favor and that's how it would be 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.920
 in case of hector want a matrix a 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:34.620
 little more intense with with the line of 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:36.390
 water in this makeup is very appropriate 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.830
 for second occasions how can it be 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.110
 a work trista or any event 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.110
 which is not appropriate and we have varied 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.099
 i 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.720
 if you liked shared benito up
