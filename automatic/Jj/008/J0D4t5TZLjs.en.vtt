and I saw a video from one individual
who<00:00:16.650> designed<00:00:17.310> his<00:00:18.119> backup<00:00:18.720> unit<00:00:19.080> his

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
who designed his backup unit his

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.410 
who designed his backup unit his
portable<00:00:20.310> backup<00:00:20.699> unit<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.210> looked

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
portable backup unit and it looked

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.720

pretty<00:00:21.630> good<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.320> took<00:00:22.890> some<00:00:23.070> ideas<00:00:23.250> from

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
pretty good so I I took some ideas from

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970 
pretty good so I I took some ideas from
him<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.420> kind<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.140> know<00:00:25.170> incorporated

him and I kind of you know incorporated
into<00:00:26.160> my<00:00:26.430> own<00:00:26.580> design<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:27.269> simply

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
into my own design just simply

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.130 
into my own design just simply
redesigned<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.710> what<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> did<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.689> went

redesigned it and what I did was I went
and<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.320> got<00:00:31.500> another<00:00:32.120> battery<00:00:33.120> box<00:00:33.329> got<00:00:34.079> this

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and I got another battery box got this

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.530 
and I got another battery box got this
battery<00:00:34.530> box<00:00:34.739> from<00:00:35.010> advanced<00:00:35.340> advanced<00:00:36.210> auto

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
battery box from advanced advanced auto

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.770 
battery box from advanced advanced auto
and<00:00:37.309> that<00:00:38.309> holds<00:00:38.610> my<00:00:38.760> 115<00:00:39.420> amp<00:00:39.629> hour<00:00:39.750> battery

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and that holds my 115 amp hour battery

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.190 
and that holds my 115 amp hour battery
and<00:00:40.500> then<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.860> simply<00:00:41.010> mounted<00:00:41.579> my<00:00:42.200> 1800

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
and then I just simply mounted my 1800

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.260 
and then I just simply mounted my 1800
watt<00:00:43.379> zan<00:00:44.129> tracks<00:00:45.140> probiotic<00:00:46.140> SW<00:00:46.969> to<00:00:47.969> the

dolly<00:00:49.140> okay<00:00:50.070> looking<00:00:50.730> at<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.170> that

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
dolly okay looking at this you see that

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
dolly okay looking at this you see that
it's<00:00:52.590> pretty<00:00:52.800> simple<00:00:53.070> pretty<00:00:53.430> simplistic<00:00:54.210> on

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
it's pretty simple pretty simplistic on

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.750 
it's pretty simple pretty simplistic on
the<00:00:54.629> back<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.320> mounted<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.309> charge

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the back here I mounted a charge

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.660 
the back here I mounted a charge
controller<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.710> this<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.010> PWM<00:00:59.640> charge

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
controller and this is a PWM charge

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.090 
controller and this is a PWM charge
controller<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.590> connected<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.010> my

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
controller and it's connected to my

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.759 
controller and it's connected to my
battery<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.090> also<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
battery and I also have you know a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.850 
battery and I also have you know a
connection<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.610> solar<00:01:05.939> panels<00:01:06.350> if<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.560> wanted

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
connection for solar panels if I wanted

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.100 
connection for solar panels if I wanted
to<00:01:07.950> connect<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.600> front<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:14.330> have<00:01:15.330> both

actually plug in some other device to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.270 
actually plug in some other device to
run<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.829> off<00:01:35.009> 12-volt<00:01:35.520> power<00:01:36.740> with<00:01:37.740> these<00:01:37.950> two

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
run it off 12-volt power with these two

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.880 
run it off 12-volt power with these two
terminals<00:01:38.939> here<00:01:39.329> what<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.710> also

hook the hook the battery up to these

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.940 
hook the hook the battery up to these
terminals<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.670> it'll<00:01:54.540> give<00:01:54.720> me<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.439> extra

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
terminals and it'll give me the extra

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100 
terminals and it'll give me the extra
capacity<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.450> kind<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.719> breaking<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
capacity but just kind of breaking it

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.190 
capacity but just kind of breaking it
down<00:01:58.259> again<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> battery<00:01:59.729> box<00:02:00.200> that
