 fruit and is wrongly identified 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.630
 like the poisonous Brazilian wandering spider 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.350
 the fruit shipments that arrive from 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.060

 big spider with a face of few friends 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.480
 these animals that hide among the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.210
 bananas and other fruits from 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.129
 South america that are sent to kingdom 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.489
 united and us can cause true

 fainting in fact all kinds of

 schools evacuated homes and stores 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.539
 have rejected whole shipments as 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.500
 it happened in milwaukee wisconsin usa in 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.890
 2013 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.400
 and the perfect spider venom to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.880
 make pesticides and all this happens 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.490
 according to experts because it is assumed 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.360
 right away that the stowaways are the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.270
 called Brazilian wandering spiders the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.700
 genre font eu tree to a species that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.670
 inhabits the tropic of central america 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.690
 and from the south and that is very aggressive and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.800
 Poisonous, however, is not always 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.520
 Truth is often spiders 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.950
 harmless that are not identified 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.920
 correctly as explained by the expert in 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.390
 spiders are rick meter from the university 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.330
 from california now retired poking that 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.000
 I already suspected that it is not usual for 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.750
 wandering spiders end up in North America 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.810
 in fruit shipments it was decided to 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.409
 study that if they did 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.680
 in this way he analyzed all the information 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.860
 available asked the importers 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.020
 for any related incident and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.700
 spent eight years studying the case whose 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.780
 results will be published in the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.819
 journal of medical entomologist journal 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.400
 total recorded 135 spiders of which 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.420
 only if they turned out to be the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.670
 gender speech according to better ones 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.670
 more are usually found in these 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.269
 shipments are the ventral heteropoda 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.920
 and spit it out news japan on sis in 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.780
 reality explains is not so usual 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.739
 find a spider between 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.720
 bananas that he bought he has known 15 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.730
 cases a year the problem of this fear 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.660
 related to spiders is that it can 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.120
 cause true economic damage 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.350
 since whole shipments may not 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.030
 reach their 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.000
 if someone identifies a spider as 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.000
 belonging to one of the most 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 dangerous
