00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:48.690

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.149
 back and they stared at me 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.450
 back and I think that I have a 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.910
 back like and they asked me how 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.830
 It's gone if I see that I left and I did not 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.780
 they learned from me how to ask 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.420
 correctly 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.760
 Nestor you are already the king of the morning and I 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.490
 modestly I say I have always been the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.350
 king or better a prince if also 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.060
 I heard that July gave me so hard 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.180
 snail outlet that's why the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.770
 vallesanos if you go for a chain that 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.370
 I can not give the name only the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.370
 initials 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.959
 Ardent said since we could not bring them 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.250
 to laugh what we bring to anything 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.680
 they arrived in July I knew it would make them 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.090
 so much needed but not so that as a sign of 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.090
 protest july will resign 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.910
 said crazy paschal and gabriel with you 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.160
 three does not become one and in my sentence today 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.050
 that's how I came up with inventing myself 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.730
 time of intention exists that invented 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.040
 now 20 I invented it I invented 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.560
 practically the radio and I invented a 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.080
 program in the afternoon 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.660
 vox populi that is like with humorists 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.080
 by calling them in some way and with a 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.819
 driver now it occurred to me last night 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.430
 pondering inventing a program for 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.280
 Saturdays at one in the afternoon where 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.150
 talk to former footballers like that 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.330
 if the program would be called chocolate 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.330
 blue 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:53.930
 coffee one of the two I'm in that 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:55.940
 disjunctive but equally yes imbecile up 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.989
 then this I have not been able to control my DNA 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:05.420
 will be that I return hernÃ¡n already had 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.360
 secured their kingdoms further tomorrow 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.010
 could have done an equal program with 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.299
 certain tone like the one that is 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.299
 undoubtedly has july 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:23.030
 I have the car because he dissembled 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.400

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.620
 it was july you're putting web the 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.630
 It has issues but it was being disputed 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.210
 people who did not even have seniority 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.340
 in the no matter the type and we send it 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.960
 burn and we get another very serious one for 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.770
 the mam pocket idiot sir a service 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.770
