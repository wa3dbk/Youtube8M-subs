00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.260
 scientific research and 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.840
 technological applications link 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.150
 very diverse disciplines the developments 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.650
 in a branch of sciences impact 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.900
 many times in other areas of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.430
 knowledge the progress of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.280
 information technology and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.500
 tics communications enabled the 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.840
 medicine could move beyond the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.330
 traditional face- to- face attention with 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 emergence of telemedicine is 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.309
 Telemedicine called the use of tics 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.589
 to provide remote medical care 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.559
 through a large number of practices 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.539
 for example a person who suffers some 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.399
 chronic disease can have a 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.929
 constant monitoring through 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.440
 measurement and monitoring of some 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.989
 parameters of your body like glucose 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.940
 heart rate and blood pressure 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.190
 a health center can store all 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.870
 the clinical data of a patient send 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.269
 those that require a specialist that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.510
 resides elsewhere for analysis and 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.129
 manage a query using it 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.040
 medical videoconference of great 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.570
 experience can support advise and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.520
 advise colleagues in the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.600
 diagnosis of your patients so 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.479
 remote 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.299
 Telemedicine is not a substitute for 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.490
 face-to-face medical care but a 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.460
 way to complement and assist her 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.380
 improving the speed of attention 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.100
 precocity of the diagnoses and the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.750
 effective monitoring of treatments 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.850
 before him in his commitment to innovation 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.490
 and their commitment to the well-being of 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.149
 Uruguay develops jointly with 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.009
 does the program plant by him it 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.470
 they deliver doctors from the first level of 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.210
 Personal computers attention with the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.369
 which can be accessed through the network 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.550
 Antel cellular to the clinical history 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.069
 of your patients to continue their treatment and 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.069
 coordinate studies and future consultations
