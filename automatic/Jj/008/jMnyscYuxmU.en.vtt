00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.280
 how important are the trailers 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.240
 during the tour for life 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.240
 for the riders they are very bad 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.800
 important there are a total of 120 trailers 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
 including one to the next campsite 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.189
 is going to build up the camp and the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.289
 other the riders on the route follows and 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.210
 the riders also sees on the checkpoints 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:33.030
 bread and food from the picture and lots 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.680
 encouragement gives what do they have it 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.680
 most needed the riders of the front 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.570
 basically needs a lot of encouragements that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.339
 they especially need them 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.900
 and in addition of course that there is extra 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.729
 food and drink because the check will be yours 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.199
 sees a few things 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.760
 but so much is burned on one 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.220
 day and drank so much that the the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.199
 support vehicles in this 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.489
 they are also all volunteers yes 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.869
 at least they are all volunteers 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.159
 I haven't paid for a trailer yet 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:58.049
 but I assume that all 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.729
 are volunteers who are connected 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.260
 there is also a real part in the team 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.330
 feeling the team often together 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.610
 sponsored and also for 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.850
 their is this ultimate end of tour for 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.470
 life 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.330
 preparation what is it 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.200
 most important that the team needs yours 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.390
 has 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.070
 especially drink a lot of socializing 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.659
 I think on the way 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.119
 loud music now and then a bit of you 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.490
 a tasty snack baguette with 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.710
 brienne this would go fine 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.929
 mask but are to drink with water 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.200
 and then are satisfied so quickly that everything 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.939
 each other is on the way and I have to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.859
 being busy on time is not so easy 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.819
 give a little spirit to what you eat 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:37.520
 pizza bananas 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:40.369
 cola chocolate milk 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.750
 tasty orange every day time too 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.490
 another cake 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.710
 always an apple pie usually and then 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.469
 something else from angry syrup and cream 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.469
 why because they don't like mint 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.759
 you're the camping team that's right 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.280
 and so what is the first to appreciate 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.580
 need it when arriving here 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.590
 care a fixed place so nothing more 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.569
 do it yourself and if she wants something 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.209
 after recovery helps if 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.040
 natural number one recovery shake 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.110
 recovery shake and that 's it there 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.330
 contains stuff that helps with rapid recovery 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.739
 after the ride why a legal 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.420
 making all very legal just like in 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.140
 the tour is the same 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.060
 types of stuff banana strawberry and shake 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.830
 a chocolate and every time they 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.360
 coming in very much to cook the marco 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.520
 nice bar is you 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.440
 and then they come up again 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.760
 forces of response is of course again 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.950
 super dinners 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.620
 then I can't compete with nature coline 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.110
 chips we roots first and must ask 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.110
 a beer wine 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.540
 a baguette percent there 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.280
 plus homogeneity in the groups because me 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.390
 can't do without them and their can't 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.050
 without me 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.050
 recall it 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.760
 don't think there is being able to 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.390
 following cars are incredibly important 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.580
 for their 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.260
 for motivation for food and drink and 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.220
 without trailers you actually have none 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.709
 tour for life 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.030
 as follows water thank you be it yourself 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.160
 who want to cycle along 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.540
 yes very happy maybe next year 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.800
 accidentally have now injured 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.630
 member of the team that maybe tomorrow 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.290
 does not drive and then drive tomorrow anyway 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.060
 one Keers 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.500
 i come and come on the ride to all the proof 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.209
 I then not in turn 2 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.280
 a step or two the thing I like 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.440
 no this time I go I have the 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.760
 model of the cyclist in one and I cycle 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.079
 already one to the carnival and the rest 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.310
 nowhere can go very well what they 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.920
 I could not do it myself 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.070
 look there I really need something 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.070
 to do
