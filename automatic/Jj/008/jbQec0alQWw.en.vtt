hi<00:00:45.480> everyone

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
hi everyone

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.700 
hi everyone
last<00:00:46.650> week<00:00:46.830> I<00:00:46.950> made<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.430> video<00:00:47.700> about<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:49.470> video

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
last week I made a video about the video

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.690 
last week I made a video about the video
is<00:00:49.830> called<00:00:50.060> toxic<00:00:51.060> rain<00:00:51.360> killing<00:00:51.960> plants

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
is called toxic rain killing plants

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.880 
is called toxic rain killing plants
Wisconsin<00:00:53.700> and<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.810> reason<00:00:55.140> why<00:00:55.290> I<00:00:55.350> made<00:00:55.680> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
Wisconsin and the reason why I made it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.990 
Wisconsin and the reason why I made it
is<00:00:56.040> because<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.490> had<00:00:57.000> been<00:00:57.920> seeing<00:00:58.920> reports<00:00:59.730> all

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
is because I had been seeing reports all

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.500 
is because I had been seeing reports all
over<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.540> nation<00:01:00.720> and<00:01:01.140> even<00:01:01.610> in<00:01:02.610> Canada<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
over the nation and even in Canada and

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.540 
over the nation and even in Canada and
Germany<00:01:04.070> about<00:01:05.720> strange<00:01:06.720> holes<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:08.010> people's

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
Germany about strange holes in people's

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.050 
Germany about strange holes in people's
plants<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:10.050> plants<00:01:10.650> dying<00:01:10.980> and<00:01:13.100> this<00:01:14.100> weird

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
plants and plants dying and this weird

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.380 
plants and plants dying and this weird
things<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.160> decided<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
things going on so I decided to go and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.250 
things going on so I decided to go and
look<00:01:18.600> into<00:01:18.900> my<00:01:19.590> own<00:01:19.890> backyard<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.510> I<00:01:21.690> noticed

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
look into my own backyard and I noticed

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.560 
look into my own backyard and I noticed
the<00:01:23.160> same<00:01:23.190> things<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> were<00:01:24.240> being<00:01:24.420> reported

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the same things that were being reported

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.150 
the same things that were being reported
on<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.979> different<00:01:26.280> videos<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.130> I

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
on the different videos so what I

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.140 
on the different videos so what I
decided<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.750> actually<00:01:31.380> take<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.369> pH<00:01:33.119> test

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
decided to do is actually take a pH test

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.859 
decided to do is actually take a pH test
of<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:35.040> rain<00:01:35.310> water<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.090> compare<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
of the rain water and compare that to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.010 
of the rain water and compare that to
the<00:01:37.170> bottled<00:01:37.890> water<00:01:38.010> my<00:01:38.670> tap<00:01:39.210> water<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.869> at

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the bottled water my tap water I have at

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.480 
the bottled water my tap water I have at
home<00:01:40.260> and<00:01:40.820> actually<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:42.180> coffee<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:42.840> for

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
home and actually have coffee just for

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.490 
home and actually have coffee just for
shoots<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.729> grins<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.700> pH<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.810> testing

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
shoots and grins the pH is not testing

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.430 
shoots and grins the pH is not testing
for<00:01:49.530> anything<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.910> toxic<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:52.460> anything

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
for anything that is toxic or anything

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.350 
for anything that is toxic or anything
other<00:01:55.440> than<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:57.390> pH<00:01:57.929> level<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.770> water

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
other than the pH level of the water

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.090 
other than the pH level of the water
pure<00:02:00.360> water<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:02.039> scale<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.300> seven<00:02:04.110> anything

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
pure water is a scale of seven anything

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.330 
pure water is a scale of seven anything
less<00:02:05.640> than<00:02:05.910> that<00:02:05.970> is<00:02:06.509> acid<00:02:07.320> anything<00:02:07.979> more

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
less than that is acid anything more

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.390 
less than that is acid anything more
than<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.090> alkaline<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:11.330> I'm<00:02:12.330> going<00:02:12.750> to

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
than that is alkaline so I'm going to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.600 
than that is alkaline so I'm going to
let's<00:02:14.400> start<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:14.880> coffee<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:15.960> these<00:02:16.170> I

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
have these pH strips I got on eBay for a

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.650 
have these pH strips I got on eBay for a
couple<00:02:21.960> bucks<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.260> pack<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:24.260> and

this<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.450> filtered<00:02:43.870> tap<00:02:44.140> water<00:02:44.400> right<00:02:45.400> here

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:05.910 

this<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:52.690> bottled<00:02:53.140> water<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:05.170> is<00:03:05.410> rain

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
this is bottled water and this is rain

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.790 
this is bottled water and this is rain
water<00:03:06.190> from<00:03:06.400> last<00:03:06.670> night<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.390> wasn't<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:08.140> it

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
water from last night it wasn't it it

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.770 
water from last night it wasn't it it
wasn't<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.280> big<00:03:09.520> storm<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.630> was<00:03:10.840> rain<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:12.780> it

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
wasn't a big storm but it was rain so it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.300 
wasn't a big storm but it was rain so it
wasn't<00:03:14.110> didn't<00:03:14.320> seem<00:03:14.470> like<00:03:14.620> ahead<00:03:14.770> it<00:03:15.220> was

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
wasn't didn't seem like ahead it was

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.400 
wasn't didn't seem like ahead it was
coming<00:03:15.850> in<00:03:15.970> from<00:03:16.090> any<00:03:16.270> particular<00:03:16.600> region<00:03:17.110> of

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
coming in from any particular region of

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.010 
coming in from any particular region of
the<00:03:19.710> world<00:03:20.710> but<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.820> want<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.120> clutch<00:03:22.600> anyways

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
the world but you want to clutch anyways

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.060 
the world but you want to clutch anyways
all<00:03:23.500> right<00:03:24.240> we'll<00:03:25.240> check<00:03:25.420> that<00:03:25.450> chemical<00:03:26.070> ok

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
all right we'll check that chemical ok

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.110 
all right we'll check that chemical ok
so<00:03:27.130> it's<00:03:28.000> been<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.240> couple<00:03:28.780> minutes<00:03:29.550> just<00:03:30.550> long

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
so it's been a couple minutes just long

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.979 
so it's been a couple minutes just long
enough<00:03:31.180> for<00:03:31.420> me<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:31.720> get<00:03:31.840> an<00:03:31.959> ice<00:03:32.140> cold<00:03:32.440> frosty

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
enough for me to get an ice cold frosty

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.890 
enough for me to get an ice cold frosty
so<00:03:34.989> this<00:03:35.290> is<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.950> rainwater<00:03:36.480> again<00:03:37.480> from<00:03:37.690> last

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
so this is the rainwater again from last

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.250 
so this is the rainwater again from last
night

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.640 

I<00:03:45.390> would<00:03:46.390> say<00:03:48.000> subscribe<00:03:49.000> just<00:03:49.299> do<00:03:50.260> this<00:03:50.470> with

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
I would say subscribe just do this with

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.530 
I would say subscribe just do this with
the<00:03:50.769> camera<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:52.290> would<00:03:53.290> say<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.680> pops<00:03:53.920> maybe<00:03:54.310> a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
the camera I would say it pops maybe a

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.080 
the camera I would say it pops maybe a
six<00:03:55.540> or<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.930> five

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
six or a five

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:05.900 
six or a five
so<00:03:58.090> look<00:03:58.239> like<00:03:58.390> DJs<00:04:04.440> alright

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
so look like DJs alright

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:30.210 
so look like DJs alright
this<00:04:06.910> is<00:04:07.120> bottled<00:04:07.599> water<00:04:21.539> bottled<00:04:22.539> water<00:04:29.220> say

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
this is bottled water bottled water say

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.740 
this is bottled water bottled water say
bottle<00:04:30.550> does<00:04:32.130> looks<00:04:33.130> maybe<00:04:33.910> at<00:04:34.150> seven<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:34.660> a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
bottle does looks maybe at seven and a

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:43.469 
bottle does looks maybe at seven and a
half<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:35.500> think<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.699> would<00:04:36.850> be<00:04:36.880> fair<00:04:42.479> filtered

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
half I think that would be fair filtered

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:55.650 
half I think that would be fair filtered
tap<00:04:43.810> water<00:04:52.680> seven<00:04:53.820> again<00:04:54.820> maybe<00:04:55.060> seven<00:04:55.539> and<00:04:55.630> a

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
tap water seven again maybe seven and a

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.260 
tap water seven again maybe seven and a
half<00:04:55.690> or<00:04:56.139> so<00:04:59.190> and<00:05:00.190> this<00:05:00.520> is<00:05:00.580> actually<00:05:01.120> the

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
half or so and this is actually the

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.089 
half or so and this is actually the
coffee<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:03.610> according<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.180> my<00:05:04.300> little

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
coffee and according to my little

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:11.100 
coffee and according to my little
research<00:05:07.650> coffee<00:05:08.650> is<00:05:09.039> actually<00:05:09.669> has<00:05:10.450> a<00:05:10.479> pH

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
research coffee is actually has a pH

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:26.879 
research coffee is actually has a pH
value<00:05:11.169> of<00:05:14.370> five<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:16.500> six<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.800> half<00:05:17.830> or<00:05:18.520> so

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.610 

and<00:05:27.889> I<00:05:28.039> would<00:05:28.220> say<00:05:29.680> that<00:05:30.680> would<00:05:30.830> probably<00:05:31.129> be

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
and I would say that would probably be

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.760 
and I would say that would probably be
you<00:05:33.620> know<00:05:34.009> I<00:05:34.039> would<00:05:34.430> say<00:05:34.669> maybe<00:05:34.909> a<00:05:35.060> five<00:05:35.770> five

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
you know I would say maybe a five five

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:47.309 
you know I would say maybe a five five
and<00:05:37.069> a<00:05:37.129> half<00:05:38.139> that<00:05:39.139> looks<00:05:39.349> like<00:05:40.810> okay

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:56.800 

different<00:05:48.319> are<00:05:48.439> these<00:05:54.219> the<00:05:55.219> bottom<00:05:55.639> strip<00:05:56.060> is

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
different are these the bottom strip is

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:06.240 
different are these the bottom strip is
coffee<00:05:57.490> the<00:05:58.490> top<00:05:58.759> strip<00:05:59.180> is<00:05:59.330> rain<00:05:59.569> water<00:06:05.199> so

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
coffee the top strip is rain water so

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.360 
coffee the top strip is rain water so
you<00:06:07.250> guys<00:06:07.430> tell<00:06:07.819> me<00:06:07.849> what<00:06:08.659> do<00:06:08.750> you<00:06:08.840> think

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:30.259 
have these new strips see test

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:37.149 
have these new strips see test
everything<00:06:30.590> now<00:06:33.789> and<00:06:34.789> beer<00:06:35.680> beer<00:06:36.680> is<00:06:36.830> supposed

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:37.159 
everything now and beer beer is supposed

everything now and beer beer is supposed
to<00:06:37.279> be<00:06:37.400> a<00:06:37.430> 4.5<00:06:45.279> according<00:06:46.279> to<00:06:46.460> my<00:06:46.610> research

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:12.680 

yeah<00:07:04.889> six<00:07:06.599> beers<00:07:07.599> a<00:07:07.720> 4.5<00:07:09.720> yeah<00:07:10.720> I<00:07:11.430> can<00:07:12.430> see<00:07:12.580> that

Emily I said beers but a 4.5 I'll just

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.070 
Emily I said beers but a 4.5 I'll just
mix<00:07:24.009> for<00:07:24.220> the<00:07:24.310> coffee<00:07:24.580> so<00:07:25.509> you<00:07:25.599> can<00:07:25.750> tell<00:07:25.960> us<00:07:26.050> a

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 
mix for the coffee so you can tell us a

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.370 
mix for the coffee so you can tell us a
little<00:07:26.139> bit<00:07:26.259> different<00:07:26.680> that's<00:07:27.610> next<00:07:27.880> to<00:07:28.150> the

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 
little bit different that's next to the

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.800 
little bit different that's next to the
rain<00:07:29.380> water<00:07:29.590> so<00:07:30.310> in<00:07:30.729> either<00:07:30.880> case<00:07:31.030> the<00:07:31.630> rain

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
rain water so in either case the rain

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.469 
rain water so in either case the rain
water<00:07:32.080> is<00:07:32.349> still<00:07:32.740> more<00:07:33.669> acidic<00:07:34.210> than<00:07:34.360> the

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 
water is still more acidic than the

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:36.960 
water is still more acidic than the
bottled<00:07:34.870> water<00:07:35.110> or<00:07:35.229> the<00:07:35.650> filtered<00:07:36.069> water<00:07:36.220> this

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:36.970 
bottled water or the filtered water this

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.879 
bottled water or the filtered water this
particular<00:07:37.360> rain<00:07:37.780> water<00:07:38.080> sample<00:07:38.560> that<00:07:38.650> I<00:07:38.710> have

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:38.889 
particular rain water sample that I have

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:40.770 
particular rain water sample that I have
taken<00:07:39.069> is<00:07:39.400> more<00:07:39.610> acidic<00:07:40.000> than<00:07:40.030> than<00:07:40.659> the

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:40.780 
taken is more acidic than than the

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.909 
taken is more acidic than than the
bottled<00:07:41.080> water<00:07:41.340> already<00:07:42.340> over<00:07:42.759> now
