of time and I lost a second little pain

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.820 
of time and I lost a second little pain
of<00:05:34.110> it<00:05:34.700> searching<00:05:35.700> for<00:05:36.120> it<00:05:36.240> right<00:05:36.420> now<00:05:36.830> where

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
of it searching for it right now where

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.950 
of it searching for it right now where
is<00:05:38.190> it

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
is it

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:51.050 
is it
butt<00:05:40.319> butt<00:05:41.130> itches<00:05:45.560> other<00:05:46.560> it<00:05:46.830> is<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:50.460> fans<00:05:50.759> in

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
butt butt itches other it is the fans in

00:05:51.060 --> 00:06:05.779 
butt butt itches other it is the fans in
iron<00:05:51.810> are<00:05:52.110> very<00:05:52.949> small<00:06:01.910> in<00:06:03.319> comparison<00:06:04.789> that

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
iron are very small in comparison that

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:10.059 
iron are very small in comparison that
was<00:06:05.940> it<00:06:06.090> with<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.539> gold<00:06:06.810> line<00:06:07.400> so<00:06:08.400> yeah<00:06:08.580> I

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:10.069 
was it with the gold line so yeah I

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.749 
was it with the gold line so yeah I
guess<00:06:11.069> go<00:06:11.610> is<00:06:12.289> iron<00:06:13.289> is<00:06:13.590> more<00:06:13.800> useful<00:06:14.460> than

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
guess go is iron is more useful than

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.909 
guess go is iron is more useful than
cool<00:06:15.090> so<00:06:15.330> yeah<00:06:15.509> it's<00:06:16.080> only<00:06:16.289> natural<00:06:16.440> there

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
cool so yeah it's only natural there

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.999 
cool so yeah it's only natural there
would<00:06:17.130> be<00:06:17.160> nothing<00:06:18.060> not<00:06:18.720> as<00:06:18.960> much<00:06:19.470> of<00:06:19.770> it<00:06:20.240> yeah

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009
