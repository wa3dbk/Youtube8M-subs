I'll<00:00:16.830> tailor<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.430> operation<00:00:17.970> make<00:00:18.180> sure<00:00:18.330> that

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
I'll tailor the operation make sure that

happens<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:19.230> make<00:00:19.650> an<00:00:19.800> incision<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.820> take

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
happens we make an incision and we take

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.120 
happens we make an incision and we take
the<00:00:21.180> hip<00:00:21.330> completely<00:00:21.900> out<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.230> joint<00:00:22.439> once<00:00:22.980> we

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the hip completely out of joint once we

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.849 
the hip completely out of joint once we
get<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.430> apart<00:00:23.960> we<00:00:24.960> remove<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> ball<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
get it apart we remove the ball on a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.720 
get it apart we remove the ball on a
typical<00:00:26.160> hip<00:00:26.970> replacement<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:28.619> take<00:00:29.400> us<00:00:29.550> off

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
typical hip replacement just take us off

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.359 
typical hip replacement just take us off
and<00:00:30.029> cut<00:00:30.779> across<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.230> bone<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
and cut across the bone in the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.299 
and cut across the bone in the
appropriate<00:00:32.969> area<00:00:33.300> remove<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.930> ball<00:00:34.280> then<00:00:35.280> we

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
appropriate area remove the ball then we

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.610 
appropriate area remove the ball then we
work<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> socket<00:00:36.300> part<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.840> hip<00:00:37.020> we

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
work on the socket part of the hip we

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.220 
work on the socket part of the hip we
put<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> new<00:00:38.129> surface<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.879> replace<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> worn

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
put a new surface to replace the worn

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.260 
put a new surface to replace the worn
down<00:00:40.440> cartilage<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.700> then

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
down cartilage that we have and then

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.020 
down cartilage that we have and then
after<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.559> turn<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.160> replacing<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.789> ball

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
after that we turn to replacing the ball

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.470 
after that we turn to replacing the ball
itself<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:46.770> common<00:00:47.250> ones<00:00:47.969> over<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.360> over

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
itself the common ones over and over

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.549 
itself the common ones over and over
would<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:49.110> basically<00:00:50.180> infection<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.559> blood

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
would be basically infection a blood

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.590 
would be basically infection a blood
clot<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:53.039> occur<00:00:53.820> or<00:00:54.860> some<00:00:55.860> goal<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:57.000> met<00:00:57.300> as

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
clot can occur or some goal not met as

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
comfortable that they've been heard so

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.620

you've<00:01:12.510> got<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.960> get<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.369> joint<00:01:14.369> surface

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
you've got to get the joint surface

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.260 
you've got to get the joint surface
correctly<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.140> fully<00:01:16.350> restored<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.150> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
correctly and fully restored you have to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420 
correctly and fully restored you have to
get<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.600> length<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.710> leverage<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
muscles around the hip correctly

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.270

adjusted<00:01:23.990> they<00:01:24.990> can't<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.409> off<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.860> bit

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
adjusted they can't be off a little bit

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
adjusted they can't be off a little bit
and<00:01:26.759> that's<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.420> leg<00:01:27.869> length<00:01:28.140> it's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
and that's not just leg length it's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.310 
and that's not just leg length it's
thing<00:01:29.579> called<00:01:29.790> offset<00:01:30.060> -<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.869> has<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.170> do

thing called offset - that has to do
with<00:01:31.500> how<00:01:32.189> far<00:01:32.520> away<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.030> center<00:01:33.450> movement<00:01:33.869> is

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229

Ceramics smoother is why you would would

Ceramics smoother is why you would would
