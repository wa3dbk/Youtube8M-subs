00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.010 
this is a shortage or this is the fringe
where<00:04:56.490> this<00:04:56.610> is<00:04:56.670> the<00:04:56.820> red<00:04:56.970> zone<00:04:57.000> if<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:57.810> put

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
where this is the red zone if you put

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.450 
where this is the red zone if you put
the<00:04:58.110> ball<00:04:58.260> there<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.920> would<00:04:59.070> expect<00:04:59.340> that

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
the ball there you would expect that

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.820 
the ball there you would expect that
they<00:04:59.670> would<00:04:59.850> it<00:05:00.450> would<00:05:00.600> conjure<00:05:01.440> an<00:05:01.530> image<00:05:01.590> in

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
they would it would conjure an image in

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.260 
they would it would conjure an image in
their<00:05:01.920> mind<00:05:01.980> of<00:05:02.340> what<00:05:02.460> defenses<00:05:02.910> were<00:05:03.000> playing

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
their mind of what defenses were playing

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.180 
their mind of what defenses were playing
what<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:03.900> offense<00:05:04.260> is<00:05:04.380> doing<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.770> us<00:05:04.920> and<00:05:05.100> vice

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
what the offense is doing to us and vice

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.580 
what the offense is doing to us and vice
versa<00:05:05.460> so<00:05:06.450> it's<00:05:06.810> a<00:05:06.900> little<00:05:07.020> bit<00:05:07.110> harder<00:05:07.440> when

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
versa so it's a little bit harder when

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.200 
versa so it's a little bit harder when
you<00:05:07.680> just<00:05:07.860> put<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.070> ball<00:05:08.220> down<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:08.550> during

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
you just put the ball down and during

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.610 
you just put the ball down and during
the<00:05:09.300> moment<00:05:09.990> of<00:05:10.050> it<00:05:10.140> because<00:05:10.290> they're<00:05:10.410> playing

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
the moment of it because they're playing

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.260 
the moment of it because they're playing
they're<00:05:10.770> playing<00:05:10.980> and<00:05:11.430> they<00:05:11.670> forget<00:05:12.120> where

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
they're playing and they forget where

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.850 
they're playing and they forget where
they<00:05:12.360> are<00:05:12.480> in<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.630> field<00:05:12.750> so<00:05:13.050> that's<00:05:13.710> the
