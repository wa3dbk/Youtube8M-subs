doesn't<00:03:40.870> get<00:03:41.050> any<00:03:41.140> bigger<00:03:41.290> cuz<00:03:41.769> I'd<00:03:41.920> be<00:03:42.040> even

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
doesn't get any bigger cuz I'd be even

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.130 
doesn't get any bigger cuz I'd be even
more<00:03:42.430> unfair<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:42.970> everybody<00:03:43.269> else<00:03:43.450> but<00:03:44.080> for

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
more unfair and everybody else but for

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.410 
more unfair and everybody else but for
the<00:03:44.320> majority<00:03:44.860> I<00:03:45.070> think<00:03:45.400> he's<00:03:45.910> got<00:03:46.209> have

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
the majority I think he's got have

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.570 
the majority I think he's got have
another<00:03:46.720> 20<00:03:47.140> 25<00:03:47.230> percent<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:47.920> get<00:03:47.980> but<00:03:48.160> I<00:03:48.190> think

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
another 20 25 percent to get but I think

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.160 
another 20 25 percent to get but I think
you<00:03:48.730> know<00:03:48.790> he's<00:03:49.090> already<00:03:49.330> a<00:03:49.450> fantastic<00:03:49.690> player

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
you know he's already a fantastic player

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.840 
you know he's already a fantastic player
but<00:03:50.410> there's<00:03:50.769> huge<00:03:50.950> growth<00:03:51.250> in<00:03:51.370> this<00:03:51.489> game<00:03:51.700> is

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
but there's huge growth in this game is

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.090 
but there's huge growth in this game is
huge<00:03:51.970> growth<00:03:52.209> in<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:52.390> game<00:03:52.570> in<00:03:52.750> terms<00:03:52.900> of

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
huge growth in this game in terms of

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.960 
huge growth in this game in terms of
communication<00:03:54.100> understanding<00:03:54.580> space<00:03:54.760> and

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
communication understanding space and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.160 
communication understanding space and
that<00:03:55.060> just<00:03:55.239> comes<00:03:55.360> from<00:03:55.660> playing<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.019> game

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
that just comes from playing the game

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.420 
that just comes from playing the game
and<00:03:56.290> playing<00:03:56.470> more<00:03:56.620> games<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:57.040> actually

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
and playing more games and actually

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.250 
and playing more games and actually
playing<00:03:57.610> having<00:03:57.880> more<00:03:58.030> cups<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.420> going<00:03:59.140> to

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
playing having more cups and going to

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.479 
playing having more cups and going to
quarter-final<00:03:59.769> adolescent<00:04:00.130> doing<00:04:00.340> those

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
quarter-final adolescent doing those

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.920 
quarter-final adolescent doing those
sort<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.700> things<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.209> awareness<00:04:01.660> levels

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
sort of things the awareness levels

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.600 
sort of things the awareness levels
growing<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.500> think<00:04:02.530> that's<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.430> big<00:04:03.580> thing

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
growing and I think that's the big thing

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.860 
growing and I think that's the big thing
for<00:04:03.850> money<00:04:04.030> was<00:04:04.239> if<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:04.390> could<00:04:04.480> continue<00:04:04.810> to

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
for money was if you could continue to

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.570 
for money was if you could continue to
grow<00:04:05.050> at<00:04:05.200> that<00:04:05.230> including<00:04:05.650> performing<00:04:06.160> and

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
grow at that including performing and

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
grow at that including performing and
the<00:04:06.670> sky's<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:06.910> limit<00:04:07.030> from<00:04:07.300> really

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
the sky's the limit from really

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.970 
the sky's the limit from really
potentially<00:04:07.959> he's<00:04:08.350> amazed<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.709> best<00:04:08.860> of<00:04:08.950> a

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
potentially he's amazed the best of a

work ethic as well which is learnt

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.840 
work ethic as well which is learnt
through<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.530> English<00:04:20.709> system<00:04:20.859> I<00:04:21.100> mean<00:04:21.220> it

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
through the English system I mean it

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.260 
through the English system I mean it
sort<00:04:22.419> of<00:04:22.840> an<00:04:23.470> ideal<00:04:23.800> combination<00:04:24.370> of<00:04:24.820> both

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
sort of an ideal combination of both

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.909 
sort of an ideal combination of both
both<00:04:25.720> cultures<00:04:26.169> I<00:04:26.229> suppose<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:26.650> white<00:04:26.800> both

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
both cultures I suppose and white both

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.469 
both cultures I suppose and white both
rugby<00:04:27.190> cultures<00:04:27.490> in<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.640> way

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
rugby cultures in a way

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.929 
rugby cultures in a way
and<00:04:29.439> yeah<00:04:29.710> he's<00:04:29.830> got<00:04:29.979> so<00:04:30.069> much<00:04:30.159> potential<00:04:30.490> it's

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:30.939 
and yeah he's got so much potential it's

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:32.520 
and yeah he's got so much potential it's
quite<00:04:31.150> scary<00:04:31.270> but<00:04:31.689> I<00:04:31.930> think<00:04:32.289> it's<00:04:32.409> very

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
quite scary but I think it's very

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.510 
quite scary but I think it's very
important<00:04:32.889> to<00:04:32.949> remember<00:04:33.009> he's<00:04:33.280> still<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.460> young

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
important to remember he's still a young

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.879 
important to remember he's still a young
man<00:04:33.669> he's<00:04:33.999> only<00:04:34.120> 21<00:04:34.419> years<00:04:34.689> old<00:04:34.810> he's<00:04:35.469> not<00:04:35.740> been

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
man he's only 21 years old he's not been

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.489 
man he's only 21 years old he's not been
playing<00:04:36.129> firstly<00:04:36.789> Bobby<00:04:36.999> for<00:04:37.240> that<00:04:37.360> long<00:04:37.539> and

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:38.499 
playing firstly Bobby for that long and

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.619 
playing firstly Bobby for that long and
he's<00:04:38.710> going<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:38.889> make<00:04:38.979> mistakes<00:04:39.069> solely<00:04:39.759> this

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
he's going to make mistakes solely this

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.209 
he's going to make mistakes solely this
year<00:04:40.870> maybe<00:04:41.199> even<00:04:41.289> next<00:04:41.560> year<00:04:41.620> he's<00:04:41.919> not<00:04:42.069> to<00:04:42.159> be

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
year maybe even next year he's not to be

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.100 
year maybe even next year he's not to be
the<00:04:42.310> finished<00:04:42.550> article<00:04:42.789> but<00:04:43.479> I<00:04:43.509> suspect<00:04:43.749> come

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
the finished article but I suspect come

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.330 
the finished article but I suspect come
the<00:04:44.199> next<00:04:44.319> World<00:04:44.529> Cup<00:04:44.620> he'll<00:04:44.919> be<00:04:45.039> somewhere

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
the next World Cup he'll be somewhere

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.920 
the next World Cup he'll be somewhere
somewhere<00:04:45.999> close<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.210> be<00:04:46.449> in<00:04:46.569> the<00:04:46.629> finished

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
somewhere close to be in the finished

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.869 
somewhere close to be in the finished
article<00:04:47.139> and<00:04:47.409> that's<00:04:47.560> potentially<00:04:48.460> that's<00:04:48.729> a

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
article and that's potentially that's a

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:55.920 
article and that's potentially that's a
huge<00:04:49.210> huge<00:04:49.569> weapon<00:04:50.169> treatment
