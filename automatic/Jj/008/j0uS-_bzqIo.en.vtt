00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.360 

and<00:00:00.210> I<00:00:00.900> apply<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.199> principle<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.890> pretty

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
and I apply this principle to pretty

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.130 
and I apply this principle to pretty
much<00:00:02.490> everything<00:00:02.909> I<00:00:03.000> play<00:00:03.240> with<00:00:03.659> my<00:00:03.899> feet

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
much everything I play with my feet

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.470 
much everything I play with my feet
especially<00:00:04.740> on<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.920> bass<00:00:05.040> drum<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.940> just

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
especially on the bass drum I just

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.570 
especially on the bass drum I just
believe<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:07.109> sounds<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.710> lot<00:00:07.919> more<00:00:07.980> musical<00:00:08.460> and

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
believe it sounds a lot more musical and

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.759 
believe it sounds a lot more musical and
more<00:00:08.670> interesting<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.870> play<00:00:09.990> dynamic<00:00:10.620> bass

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
more interesting to play dynamic bass

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.950 
more interesting to play dynamic bass
drum<00:00:11.040> patterns<00:00:11.340> than<00:00:11.519> just<00:00:11.820> Undine<00:00:12.630> amick

very static and boring ones just to demo
this<00:00:18.320> huge<00:00:19.320> difference<00:00:19.800> if<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.670> played<00:00:21.830> 16

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
this huge difference if I just played 16

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.230 
this huge difference if I just played 16
notes<00:00:23.570> without<00:00:24.570> any<00:00:24.869> accents<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:25.439> any<00:00:25.560> dynamic

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
notes without any accents or any dynamic

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.280 
notes without any accents or any dynamic
wave<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.630> sounds<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:32.630> and<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:34.110> some

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
wave it sounds like this and for some

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.010 
wave it sounds like this and for some
things<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.190> great<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.750> play<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
things this is great but if I play the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.680 
things this is great but if I play the
dynamic<00:00:37.559> pattern<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.730> sounds<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.239> lot

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
dynamic pattern I think it sounds a lot

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
dynamic pattern I think it sounds a lot
more<00:00:39.750> musical<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.410> interesting<00:00:40.890> although

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
more musical and interesting although

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.229 
more musical and interesting although
it's<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> same<00:00:42.230> rhythmic<00:00:43.230> pattern<00:00:44.239> simply

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it's the same rhythmic pattern simply

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.450 
it's the same rhythmic pattern simply
placing<00:00:46.079> accents<00:00:46.620> makes<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.039> sounds<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> lot

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
placing accents makes it sounds a lot

00:00:47.460 --> 00:01:03.910 
placing accents makes it sounds a lot
more<00:00:47.520> interesting

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.090 

and<00:01:05.810> also<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.140> fact<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.440> I'm<00:01:07.619> constantly
