bollywood's<00:00:43.880> I<00:00:43.970> think<00:00:44.180> we<00:00:44.240> have<00:00:44.360> actually

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
bollywood's I think we have actually

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.880 
bollywood's I think we have actually
talked<00:00:44.780> about<00:00:44.810> the<00:00:44.990> Bollywood<00:00:45.350> before<00:00:45.650> this

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
talked about the Bollywood before this

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.610 
talked about the Bollywood before this
one<00:00:46.130> called<00:00:46.520> Wootton<00:00:46.910> that<00:00:47.060> I<00:00:47.180> kind<00:00:47.420> of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
one called Wootton that I kind of

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.660 
one called Wootton that I kind of
discovered<00:00:48.620> when<00:00:48.890> I<00:00:48.920> was<00:00:49.070> wandering<00:00:49.250> down<00:00:49.550> one

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
discovered when I was wandering down one

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.830 
discovered when I was wandering down one
of<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.820> factories<00:00:50.240> and<00:00:50.330> that's<00:00:50.450> what<00:00:50.630> it<00:00:50.720> was

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
of the factories and that's what it was

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.510 
of the factories and that's what it was
my<00:00:51.110> first<00:00:51.350> looked<00:00:51.620> at<00:00:51.710> it<00:00:51.770> I<00:00:51.860> thought<00:00:52.340> it<00:00:52.430> was

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
my first looked at it I thought it was

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.980 
my first looked at it I thought it was
swamp<00:00:52.760> ash<00:00:52.970> to<00:00:53.090> be<00:00:53.150> going<00:00:53.450> through<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.810> grain

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
swamp ash to be going through the grain

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.380 
swamp ash to be going through the grain
was<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:54.530> again<00:00:54.890> very<00:00:55.070> very<00:00:55.490> light<00:00:55.700> very<00:00:55.730> very

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
was so again very very light very very

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.930 
was so again very very light very very
acoustic<00:00:56.990> and<00:00:57.370> it<00:00:58.370> turned<00:00:58.640> out<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.790> actually

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
acoustic and it turned out to actually

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.090 
acoustic and it turned out to actually
be<00:00:59.390> a<00:00:59.420> Chinese<00:00:59.780> Tamil<00:01:00.380> that's<00:01:00.560> actually<00:01:00.860> used

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
be a Chinese Tamil that's actually used

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.620 
be a Chinese Tamil that's actually used
on<00:01:01.250> one<00:01:01.370> area<00:01:01.580> for<00:01:01.730> instance<00:01:02.000> over<00:01:02.540> the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
on one area for instance over the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.110 
on one area for instance over the
centuries<00:01:03.080> called<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.710> guzheng<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.730> we

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
centuries called the guzheng so we

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.640 
centuries called the guzheng so we
actually<00:01:05.270> made<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.660> body<00:01:05.810> in<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.140> varnish<00:01:06.410> it

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
actually made the body in a varnish it

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.810 
actually made the body in a varnish it
worked<00:01:06.860> out<00:01:06.980> really<00:01:07.160> well<00:01:07.250> because<00:01:07.400> it's<00:01:07.760> a

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
worked out really well because it's a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.790 
worked out really well because it's a
nice<00:01:08.000> light<00:01:08.450> weight<00:01:08.650> and<00:01:09.650> it<00:01:09.800> cocked<00:01:10.010> on<00:01:10.160> a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
nice light weight and it cocked on a

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:33.780 
nice light weight and it cocked on a
sister<00:01:12.800> which<00:01:13.280> is<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.520> grateful<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:31.270> if
