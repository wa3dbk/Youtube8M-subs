there<00:00:00.830> there<00:00:01.160> appears<00:00:01.490> to<00:00:01.550> be<00:00:01.670> some

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:02.469 
there there appears to be some

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.990 
there there appears to be some
consideration<00:00:03.469> by<00:00:03.649> the<00:00:03.709> White<00:00:03.979> House<00:00:04.160> to

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
consideration by the White House to

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.019 
consideration by the White House to
phasing<00:00:05.810> these<00:00:05.960> out<00:00:06.200> and<00:00:06.560> that's<00:00:06.800> why<00:00:07.130> this

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
phasing these out and that's why this

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.680 
phasing these out and that's why this
strike<00:00:08.389> on<00:00:09.070> Massoud<00:00:10.070> is<00:00:10.459> quite<00:00:10.849> interesting<00:00:11.419> I

just checked today and I found that

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.230 
just checked today and I found that
there<00:00:14.240> has<00:00:14.360> been<00:00:14.389> only<00:00:14.780> one<00:00:15.230> other<00:00:15.530> strike

raises<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:40.940> very<00:00:41.000> interesting<00:00:41.150> question<00:00:41.540> about

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
raises a very interesting question about

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.889 
raises a very interesting question about
the<00:00:42.380> politics<00:00:42.860> behind<00:00:43.300> this<00:00:44.300> strike<00:00:44.660> on

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
the politics behind this strike on

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.110 
the politics behind this strike on
Massoud<00:00:45.290> well<00:00:45.980> that<00:00:46.130> that<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.520> very

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
Massoud well that that is very

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.180 
Massoud well that that is very
interesting<00:00:47.720> what<00:00:47.870> are<00:00:48.050> what<00:00:48.380> is<00:00:48.770> the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
interesting what are what is the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.549 
interesting what are what is the
politics<00:00:49.610> then<00:00:49.940> here<00:00:50.270> I<00:00:50.300> mean<00:00:50.630> are<00:00:51.410> these

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
politics then here I mean are these

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.630 
politics then here I mean are these
strikes<00:00:51.890> being<00:00:52.100> carried<00:00:52.399> out<00:00:52.460> with<00:00:52.550> the

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
strikes being carried out with the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.400 
strikes being carried out with the
support<00:00:52.730> of<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.390> Pakistani<00:00:53.840> officials

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
support of the Pakistani officials

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.290 
support of the Pakistani officials
perhaps<00:00:54.680> behind<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.340> scenes<00:00:55.640> or<00:00:55.970> is<00:00:56.090> this<00:00:56.239> the

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
perhaps behind the scenes or is this the

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.240 
perhaps behind the scenes or is this the
u.s.<00:00:56.660> trying<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:56.989> undermine<00:00:57.250> Pakistani

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
u.s. trying to undermine Pakistani

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.130 
u.s. trying to undermine Pakistani
government<00:00:58.910> attempts<00:00:59.270> to<00:00:59.420> reach<00:00:59.600> out<00:00:59.840> to<00:00:59.870> the

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
government attempts to reach out to the

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.280 
government attempts to reach out to the
Pakistani<00:01:00.559> Taliban<00:01:00.739> I<00:01:01.960> think<00:01:02.960> it's<00:01:03.110> the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
Pakistani Taliban I think it's the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.580 
Pakistani Taliban I think it's the
latter<00:01:03.469> I<00:01:03.649> think<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.570> first<00:01:05.570> of<00:01:05.720> all<00:01:05.840> we<00:01:06.350> do

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
latter I think that first of all we do

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.039 
latter I think that first of all we do
know<00:01:06.860> that<00:01:07.340> indeed<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.210> Pakistani<00:01:08.960> military

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
know that indeed the Pakistani military

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.010 
know that indeed the Pakistani military
is<00:01:09.620> quite<00:01:09.920> opposed<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.420> way<00:01:11.570> in<00:01:11.720> which<00:01:11.870> the

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
is quite opposed to the way in which the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.390 
is quite opposed to the way in which the
United<00:01:12.290> States<00:01:12.320> has<00:01:12.710> been<00:01:12.920> carrying<00:01:13.250> out

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
United States has been carrying out

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.820 
United States has been carrying out
these<00:01:13.640> strikes<00:01:14.000> without<00:01:14.630> giving<00:01:15.440> the

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
these strikes without giving the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.149 
these strikes without giving the
Pakistani<00:01:16.580> military<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:17.930> veto<00:01:18.470> over<00:01:19.040> the

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
Pakistani military a veto over the

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.300 
Pakistani military a veto over the
targeting<00:01:19.720> which<00:01:20.720> is<00:01:20.950> precisely<00:01:21.950> because

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
targeting which is precisely because

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.850 
targeting which is precisely because
they<00:01:22.850> have<00:01:23.000> been<00:01:23.150> targeting<00:01:23.860> primarily

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
they have been targeting primarily

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.700 
they have been targeting primarily
overwhelmingly<00:01:25.610> those<00:01:26.590> militants<00:01:27.590> in

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
overwhelmingly those militants in

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.219 
overwhelmingly those militants in
Pakistan<00:01:28.190> who<00:01:28.430> have<00:01:28.640> actually<00:01:29.060> made<00:01:29.930> peace

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
Pakistan who have actually made peace

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.230 
Pakistan who have actually made peace
with<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.590> government<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.490> who<00:01:31.760> were<00:01:31.939> more

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
with the government and who were more

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.890 
with the government and who were more
interested<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.320> fighting<00:01:33.830> in<00:01:34.040> Afghanistan<00:01:34.939> so

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
interested in fighting in Afghanistan so

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.070 
interested in fighting in Afghanistan so
I<00:01:35.930> think<00:01:36.200> in<00:01:36.500> fact<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:37.070> is<00:01:37.280> indeed<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:38.210> policy

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
I think in fact it is indeed a policy

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.020 
I think in fact it is indeed a policy
which<00:01:39.290> is<00:01:39.470> aimed<00:01:39.680> at<00:01:40.930> disrupting<00:01:41.979> the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
which is aimed at disrupting the

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.399 
which is aimed at disrupting the
Pakistani<00:01:44.030> government's<00:01:44.570> policy<00:01:45.140> of

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
Pakistani government's policy of

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.929 
Pakistani government's policy of
offering<00:01:46.400> peace<00:01:47.270> talks<00:01:47.540> with<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.049> Taliban

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
offering peace talks with the Taliban

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.240 
offering peace talks with the Taliban
and<00:01:49.939> I<00:01:50.600> would<00:01:50.990> add<00:01:51.140> that<00:01:51.170> this<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.830> second

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
and I would add that this is the second

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.240 
and I would add that this is the second
time<00:01:52.430> in<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.729> past<00:01:52.759> seven<00:01:53.390> years<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:54.680> the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
time in the past seven years that the

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.740 
time in the past seven years that the
United<00:01:55.549> States<00:01:55.580> has<00:01:55.909> carried<00:01:56.270> out<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.420> drone

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
United States has carried out a drone

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.140 
United States has carried out a drone
strike<00:01:56.960> in<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:58.100> immediate<00:01:58.490> aftermath<00:01:58.640> of

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
signals by one side of the other that

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.920 
signals by one side of the other that
there<00:02:01.820> were<00:02:01.909> going<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.270> be<00:02:02.360> peace<00:02:02.600> talks

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930

Pakistani government so the u.s. has in
