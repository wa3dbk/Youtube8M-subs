00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the game and what people I know have

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.820 
the game and what people I know have
been<00:02:09.270> telling<00:02:09.569> me<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:10.020> really<00:02:10.379> in-depth

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
been telling me that a really in-depth

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.590 
been telling me that a really in-depth
the<00:02:10.979> nodes

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
the nodes

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.210 
the nodes
what's<00:02:11.780> been<00:02:11.900> going<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:12.170> with<00:02:12.230> updates<00:02:12.680> coding

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
what's been going on with updates coding

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.310 
what's been going on with updates coding
sources<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.790> all<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.060> stuff<00:02:14.540> I'm<00:02:14.900> guessing

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
sources and all that stuff I'm guessing

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.630 
sources and all that stuff I'm guessing
though<00:02:15.410> if<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.650> were<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.830> see<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.010> comedy<00:02:16.370> club

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
though if it were to see a comedy club

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.520 
though if it were to see a comedy club
it<00:02:16.820> would<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.360> something<00:02:17.840> more<00:02:17.990> like<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.230> movie

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
it would be something more like a movie

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.930 
it would be something more like a movie
theater<00:02:18.770> where<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.070> would<00:02:19.190> go<00:02:19.340> in<00:02:19.580> there<00:02:19.760> and

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
theater where you would go in there and

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.990 
theater where you would go in there and
watch<00:02:20.900> some<00:02:21.230> AI<00:02:21.500> or<00:02:22.010> two<00:02:22.160> or<00:02:22.310> three<00:02:22.460> AIS<00:02:22.790> maybe

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
watch some AI or two or three AIS maybe

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.730 
watch some AI or two or three AIS maybe
even<00:02:23.300> an<00:02:23.390> AI<00:02:23.570> character<00:02:24.020> you'd<00:02:24.200> hear<00:02:24.410> on<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
even an AI character you'd hear on the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.130 
even an AI character you'd hear on the
radio<00:02:24.950> or<00:02:25.430> some<00:02:26.090> sort<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.360> personality<00:02:27.110> or

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
radio or some sort of personality or

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.380 
radio or some sort of personality or
something<00:02:27.770> his<00:02:28.250> AI<00:02:28.520> characters<00:02:29.030> actually

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
something his AI characters actually

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.600 
something his AI characters actually
even<00:02:29.780> Laszlo<00:02:30.200> or<00:02:30.320> somebody<00:02:30.650> performing<00:02:31.430> in

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
even Laszlo or somebody performing in

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.670 
even Laszlo or somebody performing in
that<00:02:31.820> comedy<00:02:32.300> club<00:02:32.450> but<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.440> would<00:02:33.530> definitely

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
that comedy club but it would definitely

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.800 
that comedy club but it would definitely
be<00:02:33.920> most<00:02:34.310> likely<00:02:34.490> a<00:02:34.820> eyes<00:02:35.180> performing<00:02:35.660> maybe

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
be most likely a eyes performing maybe

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.240 
be most likely a eyes performing maybe
there<00:02:35.990> would<00:02:36.140> be<00:02:36.170> some<00:02:36.290> place<00:02:36.710> for<00:02:36.890> players<00:02:37.160> to

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
there would be some place for players to

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.250 
there would be some place for players to
get<00:02:37.460> up<00:02:37.580> there<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.850> tell<00:02:38.060> jokes<00:02:38.330> but<00:02:38.810> my<00:02:38.960> best

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
get up there and tell jokes but my best

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.050 
get up there and tell jokes but my best
guess<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.770> we're<00:02:40.100> going<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> be<00:02:40.400> watching<00:02:40.610> AI

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
guess is we're going to be watching AI

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.600 
guess is we're going to be watching AI
performances<00:02:41.960> in<00:02:42.110> game<00:02:42.950> generated

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.370 
performances in game generated
characters<00:02:44.060> maybe<00:02:44.300> even<00:02:44.660> something<00:02:45.170> on

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
characters maybe even something on

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.140 
characters maybe even something on
screen<00:02:45.710> but<00:02:46.130> if<00:02:46.220> there<00:02:46.340> were<00:02:46.430> also<00:02:46.610> be<00:02:46.790> you

screen but if there were also be you

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.540 
screen but if there were also be you
know<00:02:47.270> in<00:02:47.510> there<00:02:47.720> probably<00:02:47.990> drinks<00:02:48.890> stuff<00:02:49.460> to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
know in there probably drinks stuff to

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.800 
know in there probably drinks stuff to
hang<00:02:49.700> out<00:02:49.820> with<00:02:49.940> friends<00:02:50.150> kind<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.510> like<00:02:50.690> the

hang out with friends kind of like the
