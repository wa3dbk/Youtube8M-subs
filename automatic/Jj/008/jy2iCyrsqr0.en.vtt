frail<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.240> this<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.800> some<00:00:50.100> people<00:00:50.490> use

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
frail with this one but some people use

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.660 
frail with this one but some people use
all<00:00:51.030> three<00:00:51.450> for<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> cluck

some<00:00:53.670> people<00:00:54.030> use<00:00:54.330> these<00:00:54.630> two<00:00:54.930> four<00:00:55.140> o'clock

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320

I've<00:00:55.650> seen<00:00:56.280> people<00:00:56.640> who<00:00:56.700> use<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.660> for

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
I've seen people who use this one for

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.060 
I've seen people who use this one for
the<00:00:58.650> frail<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.100> these<00:01:00.030> two<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.450> the<00:01:00.510> clock

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070

you<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.630> have<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.990> pick<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> fingers<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
you just have to pick the fingers that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.640 
you just have to pick the fingers that
you're<00:01:05.309> comfortable<00:01:05.549> with<00:01:06.530> when<00:01:07.530> I'm

you're comfortable with when I'm

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.100 
you're comfortable with when I'm
plucking<00:01:07.980> I<00:01:08.370> almost<00:01:08.670> always<00:01:09.150> use<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:09.750> index

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
plucking I almost always use my index

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.490 
plucking I almost always use my index
finger<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.620> play<00:01:11.510> when<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.840> plucking<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
finger to play when I'm not plucking I

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.920 
finger to play when I'm not plucking I
have<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.980> tendency<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.670> move<00:01:15.240> back<00:01:15.510> and<00:01:15.540> forth

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
between these two you have to figure out

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.820 
between these two you have to figure out
what<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.630> now<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.810> exaggerating<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
what you like now I'm exaggerating the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
what you like now I'm exaggerating the
motion<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.370> clock<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.200> order<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:26.490> make<00:01:26.670> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
motion on the clock in order to make it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.330 
motion on the clock in order to make it
clearer<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.530> later<00:01:28.800> I'll<00:01:29.040> play

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
clearer but a little later I'll play

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.280 
clearer but a little later I'll play
some<00:01:29.670> where<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> don't<00:01:30.240> exaggerate<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> motion

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
some where I don't exaggerate the motion

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
some where I don't exaggerate the motion

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
you'll be able to see that it's actually

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.289 
you'll be able to see that it's actually
a<00:01:33.630> very<00:01:33.990> small<00:01:34.110> motion<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:36.870> clock<00:01:38.299> starts

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
a very small motion the clock starts

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.800 
a very small motion the clock starts
with<00:01:39.510> a<00:01:39.540> normal
