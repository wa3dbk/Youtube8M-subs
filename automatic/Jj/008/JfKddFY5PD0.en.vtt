the object and trees so what we do is we

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.410 
the object and trees so what we do is we
need<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.890> copy<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:29.280> paste<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.760> definitions

I've<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.849> made<00:03:12.030> specifically<00:03:12.599> for<00:03:12.690> this

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
I've just made specifically for this

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.370 
I've just made specifically for this
tutorial<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.650> I'll<00:03:13.769> paste<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.310> there<00:03:16.220> and

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
what I will do is I'll do the same again

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.660 
what I will do is I'll do the same again
but<00:03:22.319> for<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.650> global<00:03:23.040> cedar<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.430> need<00:03:23.579> to

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
but for the global cedar so I need to

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.220 
but for the global cedar so I need to
find<00:03:24.109> 5200<00:03:25.109> 4<00:03:25.639> so<00:03:27.500> 5200<00:03:28.500> 4<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:29.959> need<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.079> copy

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
find 5200 4 so 5200 4 I need to copy

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.069 
find 5200 4 so 5200 4 I need to copy
that<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.880> put<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.329> global<00:03:33.690> scenery

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
that and put it in the global scenery

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.530 
that and put it in the global scenery
off<00:03:35.780> so<00:03:36.780> now<00:03:37.160> what<00:03:38.160> looks<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:38.549> two<00:03:38.970> identical

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
off so now what looks like two identical

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.659 
off so now what looks like two identical
files<00:03:39.690> black<00:03:40.139> and<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.739> know<00:03:40.889> then<00:03:41.519> this

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
files black and so you know then this

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.400 
files black and so you know then this
holds<00:03:42.290> references<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.620> default<00:03:44.010> scenery

holds references to the default scenery
not<00:03:46.410> photo<00:03:46.859> scenery<00:03:47.430> but<00:03:47.910> also<00:03:48.090> holds

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
not photo scenery but also holds

gonna call that the same doesn't have to

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:46.980 
gonna call that the same doesn't have to
be<00:04:35.980> but<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:36.370> will<00:04:36.580> do<00:04:45.450> now<00:04:46.450> what<00:04:46.630> that's<00:04:46.750> doing

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
be but I will do now what that's doing

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:55.380 
be but I will do now what that's doing
is<00:04:47.170> it's<00:04:47.350> creating<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.770> text<00:04:48.100> file<00:04:54.300> now<00:04:55.300> what

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
is it's creating the text file now what

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.730 
is it's creating the text file now what
you<00:04:55.480> can<00:04:55.600> see<00:04:55.750> is<00:04:55.870> it's<00:04:56.020> created<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.470> same

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
you can see is it's created the same

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.550 
you can see is it's created the same
file<00:04:57.040> name<00:04:57.210> it's<00:04:58.210> created<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:58.810> text<00:04:59.110> file<00:04:59.260> which

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
file name it's created a text file which

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.740 
file name it's created a text file which
allows<00:04:59.710> you<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.280> now<00:05:00.520> see<00:05:01.150> what's<00:05:01.360> inside<00:05:01.570> that

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
allows you to now see what's inside that

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.790 
allows you to now see what's inside that
DSF<00:05:02.320> fail

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
DSF fail

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.010 
DSF fail
so<00:05:03.430> if<00:05:03.490> I<00:05:03.580> double<00:05:03.670> click<00:05:03.850> on<00:05:04.090> that<00:05:04.240> that<00:05:04.540> is<00:05:04.720> now

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
so if I double click on that that is now

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.100 
so if I double click on that that is now
what<00:05:05.710> is<00:05:05.920> inside<00:05:06.310> now<00:05:07.090> it<00:05:07.390> looks<00:05:07.540> like<00:05:07.750> it's<00:05:08.020> a

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
what is inside now it looks like it's a

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.580 
what is inside now it looks like it's a
bit<00:05:08.910> full<00:05:09.910> of<00:05:10.060> writing<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:10.720> it<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.140> there's<00:05:11.530> a

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
bit full of writing and it and there's a

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.550 
bit full of writing and it and there's a
lot<00:05:11.710> of<00:05:11.890> information<00:05:12.160> in<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.610> year<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:14.410> we

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
lot of information in the year and we

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.150 
lot of information in the year and we
need<00:05:14.680> to<00:05:14.800> do<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:15.010> same<00:05:15.250> now<00:05:15.490> for<00:05:16.590> 12<00:05:17.590> tops<00:05:17.830> area

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
need to do the same now for 12 tops area

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.980 
need to do the same now for 12 tops area
but<00:05:18.310> this<00:05:18.400> one<00:05:18.610> isn't<00:05:18.880> compressed<00:05:19.450> so<00:05:19.960> I

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
but this one isn't compressed so I

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.690 
but this one isn't compressed so I
wanted<00:05:20.230> to<00:05:20.320> drag<00:05:20.740> that<00:05:20.980> and<00:05:21.160> put<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.340> in<00:05:21.490> there

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
wanted to drag that and put it in there

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.870 
wanted to drag that and put it in there
and<00:05:22.600> it<00:05:22.750> just<00:05:22.780> creates<00:05:23.170> a<00:05:23.260> text<00:05:23.590> file

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
and it just creates a text file

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.300 
and it just creates a text file
underneath<00:05:25.170> and<00:05:26.170> it<00:05:26.350> always<00:05:26.530> does<00:05:26.920> a<00:05:26.950> text

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
underneath and it always does a text

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.450 
underneath and it always does a text
file<00:05:27.490> in<00:05:27.790> the<00:05:28.450> same<00:05:28.630> folder<00:05:28.690> as<00:05:29.470> the<00:05:30.010> original

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
file in the same folder as the original

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.160 
file in the same folder as the original
file<00:05:30.700> so<00:05:31.270> you<00:05:31.330> need<00:05:31.570> that's<00:05:31.750> why<00:05:31.900> you<00:05:31.960> need<00:05:32.140> to

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
file so you need that's why you need to

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.240 
file so you need that's why you need to
have<00:05:32.320> two<00:05:33.690> folders<00:05:34.690> open<00:05:35.290> so<00:05:35.680> if<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:35.920> open<00:05:36.040> up

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
have two folders open so if I open up

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.060 
have two folders open so if I open up
that<00:05:36.310> one<00:05:36.690> you'll<00:05:37.690> end<00:05:37.840> up<00:05:37.930> with<00:05:38.140> another<00:05:38.650> text

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
that one you'll end up with another text

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.490 
that one you'll end up with another text
file<00:05:39.250> open<00:05:40.120> and<00:05:41.010> that<00:05:42.010> is<00:05:42.160> now<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:44.290> photo

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
file open and that is now the photo

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
file open and that is now the photo
scenery<00:05:46.050> so<00:05:47.050> what<00:05:47.380> you<00:05:47.440> can<00:05:47.590> see<00:05:47.740> now<00:05:47.770> is<00:05:48.160> this

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
scenery so what you can see now is this

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.120 
scenery so what you can see now is this
is<00:05:48.670> all<00:05:48.850> the<00:05:49.470> property<00:05:50.470> this<00:05:50.770> should<00:05:50.950> have<00:05:51.040> the

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
is all the property this should have the

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.490 
is all the property this should have the
same<00:05:51.310> properties<00:05:52.140> slightly<00:05:53.140> different

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
same properties slightly different

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.530 
same properties slightly different
revisions<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:54.130> so<00:05:54.310> on<00:05:54.460> but<00:05:55.090> what<00:05:55.240> you've<00:05:55.390> got

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
revisions and so on but what you've got

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.830 
revisions and so on but what you've got
is<00:05:56.100> references<00:05:57.100> now<00:05:57.310> to<00:05:57.370> the<00:05:58.240> terrain<00:05:58.570> tiles

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
is references now to the terrain tiles

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.980 
is references now to the terrain tiles
now<00:05:59.140> this<00:05:59.290> is<00:05:59.440> the<00:05:59.650> terrain<00:06:00.100> files<00:06:00.580> for<00:06:01.420> photo

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
now this is the terrain files for photo

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.970 
now this is the terrain files for photo
scenery<00:06:02.530> and<00:06:03.000> this<00:06:04.000> is<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.270> terrain<00:06:04.480> files

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
scenery and this is the terrain files

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.210 
scenery and this is the terrain files
for<00:06:05.980> the<00:06:06.460> global<00:06:07.020> default<00:06:08.020> scenery<00:06:08.470> we<00:06:09.040> want

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
for the global default scenery we want

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.710 
for the global default scenery we want
to<00:06:09.310> ignore<00:06:09.760> that<00:06:09.970> we<00:06:10.210> don't<00:06:10.360> want<00:06:10.480> to<00:06:10.510> copy

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
to ignore that we don't want to copy

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.240 
to ignore that we don't want to copy
them<00:06:10.990> over<00:06:11.140> here<00:06:11.560> because<00:06:11.860> if<00:06:11.920> we<00:06:11.980> do<00:06:12.100> we'll

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
them over here because if we do we'll

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.860 
them over here because if we do we'll
end<00:06:12.370> up<00:06:12.490> not<00:06:12.670> see<00:06:12.880> you<00:06:12.940> in<00:06:13.000> the<00:06:13.120> photo<00:06:13.300> Xena

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
end up not see you in the photo Xena

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.500 
end up not see you in the photo Xena
so<00:06:14.500> what<00:06:14.620> we<00:06:14.710> need<00:06:14.830> to<00:06:14.860> do<00:06:15.040> is<00:06:15.310> scroll<00:06:15.610> down<00:06:15.850> to

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
so what we need to do is scroll down to

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.900 
so what we need to do is scroll down to
where<00:06:16.660> it<00:06:16.840> starts<00:06:17.170> to<00:06:17.290> say<00:06:17.470> polygons<00:06:18.100> probably

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
where it starts to say polygons probably

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.410 
where it starts to say polygons probably
got<00:06:19.080> now<00:06:20.080> to<00:06:20.470> do<00:06:20.620> the<00:06:20.740> same<00:06:20.950> on<00:06:20.980> here<00:06:21.420> you

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
got now to do the same on here you

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.660 
got now to do the same on here you
notice<00:06:22.630> that<00:06:22.930> it<00:06:23.110> ends<00:06:23.620> at<00:06:23.710> terrain<00:06:24.040> and<00:06:24.550> then

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
notice that it ends at terrain and then

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.130 
notice that it ends at terrain and then
goes<00:06:24.790> to<00:06:24.820> polygon<00:06:25.300> so<00:06:25.450> we<00:06:25.540> need<00:06:25.660> to<00:06:25.750> go<00:06:25.870> to<00:06:25.930> the

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
goes to polygon so we need to go to the

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.430 
goes to polygon so we need to go to the
bottom<00:06:26.350> of<00:06:26.440> terrain<00:06:26.830> on<00:06:27.550> this<00:06:28.210> side<00:06:28.810> here<00:06:29.170> now

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
bottom of terrain on this side here now

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.650 
bottom of terrain on this side here now
you<00:06:30.310> see<00:06:30.580> it's<00:06:30.670> a<00:06:30.730> lot<00:06:30.820> more<00:06:31.000> tiles<00:06:31.330> because

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
you see it's a lot more tiles because

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.590 
you see it's a lot more tiles because
it's<00:06:31.960> our<00:06:32.140> photos<00:06:32.710> well<00:06:33.580> to<00:06:33.730> see<00:06:33.880> you<00:06:33.940> know<00:06:34.060> so

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
it's our photos well to see you know so

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.840 
it's our photos well to see you know so
sometimes<00:06:34.840> you<00:06:35.110> just<00:06:35.140> need<00:06:35.380> to<00:06:35.530> drag<00:06:35.850> don't

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:36.850 
sometimes you just need to drag don't

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.100 
sometimes you just need to drag don't
pick<00:06:36.940> down<00:06:37.090> this<00:06:37.210> is<00:06:37.330> what<00:06:37.450> the<00:06:37.570> tricky<00:06:37.870> part

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
pick down this is what the tricky part

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.040 
pick down this is what the tricky part
is

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
is

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.469 
is
find<00:06:39.229> the<00:06:39.349> end<00:06:39.500> of<00:06:39.710> it<00:06:40.090> sometimes<00:06:41.090> it<00:06:41.300> is<00:06:41.449> just

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
find the end of it sometimes it is just

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.719 
find the end of it sometimes it is just

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
the same place you can see that those

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.580 
the same place you can see that those
terrain<00:06:50.090> finals<00:06:50.509> and<00:06:50.659> there<00:06:50.870> needs<00:06:51.409> training

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
terrain finals and there needs training

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.230 
terrain finals and there needs training
files<00:06:51.889> in<00:06:52.039> there<00:06:52.220> now<00:06:52.610> you<00:06:52.699> will<00:06:52.849> see<00:06:53.090> that

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
files in there now you will see that

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.809 
files in there now you will see that
there<00:06:53.389> is<00:06:53.419> actually<00:06:53.930> polygon<00:06:54.830> definition

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:55.819 
there is actually polygon definition

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.029 
there is actually polygon definition
therefore<00:06:56.090> beaches<00:06:56.659> and<00:06:56.780> roads<00:06:57.020> and<00:06:57.889> this

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 
therefore beaches and roads and this

00:06:58.039 --> 00:06:59.559 
therefore beaches and roads and this
one's<00:06:58.280> got<00:06:58.460> beaches<00:06:58.909> but<00:06:59.090> then<00:06:59.270> you've<00:06:59.389> got<00:06:59.539> a
