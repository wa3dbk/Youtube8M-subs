00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
okay if you're watching my progress in

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.370 
okay if you're watching my progress in
real<00:00:02.850> time<00:00:03.149> then<00:00:03.480> you've<00:00:03.689> probably<00:00:03.720> noticed

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
real time then you've probably noticed

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.840 
real time then you've probably noticed
that<00:00:04.589> things<00:00:04.859> have<00:00:05.009> slowed<00:00:05.250> down<00:00:05.430> quite<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.759> bit

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
that things have slowed down quite a bit

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.750 
that things have slowed down quite a bit
it<00:00:06.540> went<00:00:06.870> from<00:00:07.109> very<00:00:07.620> nice<00:00:07.980> working<00:00:08.580> whether

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
it went from very nice working whether

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.020 
it went from very nice working whether
to<00:00:09.179> very<00:00:09.480> cold<00:00:09.809> quickly<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:10.889> my<00:00:11.670> garage<00:00:11.969> is

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
to very cold quickly so my garage is

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.660 
to very cold quickly so my garage is
unheated<00:00:12.540> I'm<00:00:13.380> not<00:00:13.679> really<00:00:13.830> able<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.280> stay<00:00:14.490> out

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
unheated I'm not really able to stay out

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.070 
unheated I'm not really able to stay out
there<00:00:14.880> for<00:00:15.059> seven<00:00:15.389> or<00:00:15.480> eight<00:00:15.599> hours<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> day

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
there for seven or eight hours a day

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.990 
there for seven or eight hours a day
even<00:00:16.619> with<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.770> space<00:00:17.070> heater<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.490> garage<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.940> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
even with a space heater the garage is a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.580 
even with a space heater the garage is a
little<00:00:18.240> too<00:00:18.359> big<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.960> really<00:00:19.199> make<00:00:19.380> much

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
little too big for to really make much

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.000 
little too big for to really make much
of<00:00:19.619> an<00:00:19.830> effect<00:00:20.510> but<00:00:21.510> I'm<00:00:21.810> actually<00:00:22.320> pretty<00:00:22.710> far

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
of an effect but I'm actually pretty far

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.609 
of an effect but I'm actually pretty far
along<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> project<00:00:24.000> right<00:00:24.539> now<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:25.080> have

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
along on the project right now I have

along on the project right now I have
the<00:00:26.070> rear<00:00:26.310> battery<00:00:26.699> rack<00:00:27.260> almost<00:00:28.260> completely

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
on a lid I may raise it up a little

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.770 
on a lid I may raise it up a little
higher<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.730> pretty<00:00:32.969> much<00:00:33.210> finished<00:00:33.420> I

the<00:00:44.940> next<00:00:45.120> couple<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.629> days<00:00:45.899> both<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the next couple of days both of the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.650 
the next couple of days both of the
front<00:00:47.160> racks<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.820> completely<00:00:48.390> finished

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
front racks will be completely finished

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.110 
front racks will be completely finished
and<00:00:49.050> installed<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:50.700> all<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and installed and then all of the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.540 
and installed and then all of the
batteries<00:00:51.600> will<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.899> put<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.620> secured<00:00:53.219> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
batteries will be put in and secured so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.490 
batteries will be put in and secured so
that<00:00:53.579> they<00:00:53.820> can't<00:00:54.030> bounce<00:00:54.329> around<00:00:54.719> their<00:00:55.079> fall

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that they can't bounce around their fall

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.849 
that they can't bounce around their fall
out<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> car<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.219> any<00:00:56.340> way<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.859> I've

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
out of the car in any way so really I've

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.090 
out of the car in any way so really I've
done<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.370> lot<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.760> in-between<00:01:00.620> time<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> lot<00:01:02.039> of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
done a lot of in-between time a lot of

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.000 
done a lot of in-between time a lot of
the<00:01:02.399> wiring<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.120> things<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.480> my<00:01:04.049> gauges<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the wiring for things like my gauges and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.120 
the wiring for things like my gauges and
my<00:01:05.880> heater<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> heater<00:01:07.320> switch<00:01:07.590> things

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
my heater and the heater switch things

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.210 
my heater and the heater switch things
like<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:09.600> few<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.350> things<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> car

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
like that a few little things on the car

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.950 
like that a few little things on the car
that<00:01:11.400> i<00:01:11.460> noticed<00:01:11.610> weren't<00:01:11.970> working<00:01:12.330> whether

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
that i noticed weren't working whether

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
I'm s Upton up when I took the dash

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.609 
I'm s Upton up when I took the dash
apart<00:01:15.600> or<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.229> weren't<00:01:16.530> working

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
apart or they just weren't working

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.260 
apart or they just weren't working
before<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.310> didn't<00:01:17.580> notice<00:01:17.729> i<00:01:18.030> don't<00:01:18.210> know

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
before and I didn't notice i don't know

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.899 
before and I didn't notice i don't know
but<00:01:18.390> i<00:01:18.479> fixed<00:01:18.720> those<00:01:18.960> things<00:01:19.229> two<00:01:19.470> things<00:01:20.310> like

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
but i fixed those things two things like

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.880 
but i fixed those things two things like
the<00:01:21.180> little<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.259> call<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.560> cigar

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the little what they call the cigar

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
the little what they call the cigar
lighter<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.850> i<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:24.750> smoke<00:01:24.869> so

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
lighter but you know i don't smoke so

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.690 
lighter but you know i don't smoke so
obviously<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.280> be<00:01:26.340> used<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
obviously it's just going to be used to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.130 
obviously it's just going to be used to
maybe<00:01:26.960> charge<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.140> cell<00:01:28.350> phone<00:01:28.759> fix<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.110> got<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
maybe charge a cell phone fix that got a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.899 
maybe charge a cell phone fix that got a
lot<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.380> little<00:01:31.590> things<00:01:31.680> taken<00:01:32.280> care<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
lot of little things taken care of and

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.420 
lot of little things taken care of and
really<00:01:33.720> once<00:01:33.990> these<00:01:34.200> battery<00:01:34.619> racks<00:01:35.009> are

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
really once these battery racks are

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.310 
really once these battery racks are
finished<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> batteries<00:01:36.750> are<00:01:36.900> all<00:01:37.049> in

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
finished and the batteries are all in

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.190 
finished and the batteries are all in
then<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.939> come<00:01:39.150> down<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.450> wiring

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
then it's going to come down to wiring

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.230 
then it's going to come down to wiring
everything<00:01:40.799> together<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.880> have

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
everything together I really I have

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.719 
everything together I really I have
everything<00:01:43.159> we<00:01:44.159> can't<00:01:44.369> think<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.579> any

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
everything we can't think of any

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.889 
everything we can't think of any
component<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.570> need<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.840> purchase<00:01:46.850> or

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
component that I need to purchase or

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.899 
component that I need to purchase or
really<00:01:48.899> even<00:01:48.930> any<00:01:49.430> electrical<00:01:50.430> parts<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
really even any electrical parts that I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:51.770 
really even any electrical parts that I
need<00:01:51.060> I'm<00:01:51.180> sure<00:01:51.329> there'll<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.600> couple

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
need I'm sure there'll be a couple

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.270 
need I'm sure there'll be a couple
miscellaneous<00:01:52.470> things<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> have<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.250> my

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
miscellaneous things but I have all my

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.359 
miscellaneous things but I have all my
relays<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.829> power<00:01:56.009> steering

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
relays I have the power steering

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
relays I have the power steering
pressure<00:01:57.270> line<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.719> had<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.290> custom

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
pressure line I had to have custom

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.139 
pressure line I had to have custom
fabricated<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.490> all<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.909> stuff

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
fabricated I have all of that stuff

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.969 
fabricated I have all of that stuff
ready<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:00.960> ready<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.590> put<00:02:01.829> together

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
ready it's all ready to be put together

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.370 
ready it's all ready to be put together
and<00:02:02.310> wired<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.969> if<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.229> these

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and wired and if I can get these

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.280 
and wired and if I can get these
batteries<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:06.210> part<00:02:06.570> completed<00:02:07.170> in

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
batteries in and that part completed in

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.380 
batteries in and that part completed in
the<00:02:07.350> next<00:02:07.439> couple<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.950> days<00:02:08.160> then<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.360> it's

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the next couple of days then really it's

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.850 
the next couple of days then really it's
just<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.750> matter<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.020> how<00:02:10.110> much<00:02:10.319> time<00:02:10.590> am<00:02:10.770> I

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
just a matter of how much time am I

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.670 
just a matter of how much time am I
going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.069> have

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
going to have

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.979 
going to have
to<00:02:13.680> put<00:02:14.250> towards<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.760> project<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.599> how<00:02:15.690> cold

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
to put towards this project and how cold

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.660 
to put towards this project and how cold
is<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.170> going<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.560> for<00:02:16.800> me<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:17.519> out<00:02:17.550> there

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
is it going to be for me to be out there

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.110 
is it going to be for me to be out there
working<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.480> cold<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:19.290> maybe<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.580> few<00:02:20.910> days

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
working in the cold but maybe a few days

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.850 
working in the cold but maybe a few days
of<00:02:21.300> wiring<00:02:21.540> obviously<00:02:22.019> there'll<00:02:22.560> be<00:02:22.590> some

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
of wiring obviously there'll be some

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.500 
of wiring obviously there'll be some
testing<00:02:23.310> things<00:02:23.519> out<00:02:23.700> I'm<00:02:23.970> sure<00:02:24.180> there'll<00:02:24.480> be

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
testing things out I'm sure there'll be

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.900 
testing things out I'm sure there'll be
some<00:02:25.110> things<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.650> will<00:02:25.920> need<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.190> redo<00:02:26.550> or

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
some things that will need to redo or

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.309 
some things that will need to redo or
some<00:02:27.180> things<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.660> don't<00:02:27.900> have<00:02:28.110> quite

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
some things that I don't have quite

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.309 
some things that I don't have quite
right<00:02:29.299> just<00:02:30.299> because<00:02:30.510> no<00:02:30.690> project<00:02:31.170> goes

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
right just because no project goes

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.380 
right just because no project goes
completely<00:02:31.739> without<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.340> hitch<00:02:32.549> but<00:02:32.819> I'm

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
completely without a hitch but I'm
