00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
which we'll be looking at later so we

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.030 
which we'll be looking at later so we
turn<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.840> later<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.530> get<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> carving

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040

catapult

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
catapult

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.510 
catapult
this<00:01:52.890> catapult<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:55.040> look<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.340> has

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
this catapult can look like it has

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.630 
this catapult can look like it has
simulated<00:01:57.000> wheels<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.930> all<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.190> it<00:01:59.430> can

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
simulated wheels on this all so it can

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.580 
simulated wheels on this all so it can
be<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.660> standalone<00:02:01.350> unit<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.790> then<00:02:03.230> see<00:02:04.230> if<00:02:04.500> you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
be a standalone unit and then see if you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.740 
be a standalone unit and then see if you
put<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:04.980> back<00:02:05.220> oh<00:02:06.800> yeah<00:02:07.800> you<00:02:07.860> can<00:02:08.160> watch<00:02:08.750> the

Boulder Boulder is quite small and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.470 
Boulder Boulder is quite small and
