00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.080

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.960
 the ingredients screen write down the 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.950
 very well a cake box of 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.590
 vanilla a cup of evaporated milk 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.039
 half a cup of evaporated milk one 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.489
 spoonful of vanilla extract 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.480
 state of cream to beat half a cup of 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.940
 powdered sugar 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.090
 three sliced bananas 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.670
 instant za of powdered cookies 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.920
 Mary cookies that are the most common and 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.630
 easier as they are pulverized very easy 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.790
 in a blender 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.080
 you put some cookies and they are made 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.750
 powders and can not crush them 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.250
 put them in a bag and it looks good 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.290
 already as well as a delicious powder that 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.910
 it will be the crispy part of this cake 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.610
 so what we are going to do first is 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.890
 very simple you are going to mix the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.430
 ingredients for the vanilla cake 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.680
 I do not like to make life easier for 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.600
 the recipes seem simple and I think 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.460
 which is a step that we are shortening very 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.650
 important then you follow 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.990
 instructions for the cake box 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.910
 that there are many stores where they sell 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.520
 mix the boxes for super cake 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.680
 economic and find them buy the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.350
 surely you know what I mean 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.710
 then we are going to pour our mix 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.830
 in a rectangular or square mold of 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.920
 preference then let's warm up 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.320
 our oven at 350 degrees and we're going to 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.830
 Bake for approximately 45 minutes 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.750
 you follow the instructions 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.300
 your cake then since it's cold and 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.090
 perfectly baked let's leave it 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.580
 cool down and we're going to take it down here 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.430
 we already have our cake desmolda dow and 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.020
 we will make a very interesting trick 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.360
 notice that this cake will remind you 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.060
 to the cake of three milks but it has 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.910
 Long and good silver will be richer 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.890
 then with a stick or a straw we go 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.800
 to make holes 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.470
 let's bore our cake 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.750
 so be it much simpler at the time 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.030
 to absorb the milk that we are going to 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.760
 put does not know how rich is a 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.930
 cake very easy to make and the truth 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.700
 that I think everyone can 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.550
 like I like to bake a lot with 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.550
 banana because it's very economical very 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.430
 accessible there is always the fruit 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.590
 the cheapest market and you know that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.660
 it also has a lot of potassium is great 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.730
 has a lot of fiber the truth that it is a 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.620
 excellent way that you too 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.090
 start your day as banana action already with 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.850
 that's going to have some energy 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.010
 then we have condensed milk and 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.420
 Evaporated milk already reminds you of a 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.450
 little bit true the cake of three milks 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.760
 and we're going to put a little vanilla 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.660
 I 'm also going to put some liquor on 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.150
 brandy would be excellent truth 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.610
 then what are we going to do 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.060
 have a little patience and do it 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.549
 slowly we have to let the cake 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.250
 absorb the milk slowly if it does 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.689
 inside your mold is fine is 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.180
 perfect because that's not the way 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.189
 spilling milk for nowhere and 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.049
 absorbs it then it's a matter of 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.079
 time puts the spoonfuls wait 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.780
 about two or three minutes and follows 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.760
 putting all the milk and is 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.329
 delicious sweet if it is that you are the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.069
 cake and it will be delicious 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.700
 then it reminds you of evaporated milk 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.930
 condensed milk and vanilla since you 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.940
 has finished putting the most 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.079
 amount of milk that we can go to 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.299
 put the banana we are going to make slices 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:51.879
 of banana trying to be uniform 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:54.680
 you'll see why so fresh banana 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:58.579
 delicious I do not know why I like it so much 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.260
 I find it a very easy dessert to eat 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.750
 it is not that 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.329
 taste that says no to me I do not like no no 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.269
 I know I think most of us like the 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:11.920
 banana and let's put it on the 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:15.310
 cake we will make a layer 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.980
 of banana as we are seeing what 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.400
 rich truth how easy everyone in 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.340
 house can do it there and more now 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.280

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.130

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.070

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.940

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.500
 cupcake how is it so I know what 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.450
 I recommend that you do it 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.520
 look let's do the following we have 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.290
 cream to beat I have been asked what 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.850
 is the cream to beat in the 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.070
 you will find it in the supermarket 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.260
 refrigerated area there will be the cream 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.210
 to beat like that is going to say the legend and 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.550
 you have to beat the cool chill 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.020
 It's very important to beat about 5 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.090
 minutes with the electric mixer 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.130
 preference so you do not get tired and 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.650
 then he will add sugar he will 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.050
 put about half a cup of 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.760
 sugar by the end of the cream 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.980
 in this fluffy way 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.250
 delicious that is special for this 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.830
 cake then cream to beat and 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.350
 icing sugar from my vanilla village without 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.570
 no problem or some kind of liquor 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:27.080
 it also looks good then with a 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.080
 spatula let's cover our cake 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:33.909
 You already know that the pastry is in detail 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:36.819
 of a little time then you 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:38.529
 do it in a house with all the love of 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.049

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:43.479
 and sweetie there is that is the 

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:45.399
 most important ingredient I think if I do not 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.589

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:50.679

 it is imagined that we already cover all the 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.729
 cake and the last step is to put cookie 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.810
 is the cookie that we have powdered 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.750
 raise a touch of anise 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.550
 crispy and I think it was the final touch 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.040

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.200
