 the urgency about housing and

 at all times we were on precariousness 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.970
 actually the only link that clikeco common 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.140
 and constant between HIV aids and precariousness 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.690
 and we usually say a béziade 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.820
 that AIDS is still there but that the 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.070

 chronic pathology and who lives in 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.140
 extremely precarious conditions 30% 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.220
 our audience today 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.019
 are without income 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.970
 a peculiarity at the base there are you 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.250
 know we have time that's what 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.900
 characterizes a little bit our our 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.510
 comprehensive support is that we will 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.549
 to be able to travel at the pace and with 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.950

 to basile is it's also to take in 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.490
 account the past of people their 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.729
 course 1 what they were before their 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.909
 identity is not their status of sdf or 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.049
 precarious staff 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.130
 many of the people who have who 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.119
 push the bathing door for the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.880
 first time are people who have 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.710
 lost all confidence and is finally 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.119
 that have lost all hope is that they 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.770
 leaves finally fall is when your 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.120
 with the arrival in fact new 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.470
 treatments 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.320
 people there is a new able 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.570
 to be able to rework their conditions 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.210
 their life expectancy being 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.370
 improved they have as and when 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.770
 does he want to take back a 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.970
 activity is both the hiv is not 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.250
 a disease like any other 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.500
 which holds is a disease that 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.440
 is stigmatizing especially in 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.830
 professional integration 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.300
 the idea is to take the time with 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.040
 people so we will support 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.050
 psychologically we will support 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.330
 financially we will make help 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.810
 of transport aids 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.940
 we will also help on taxes 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.860
 regularization then to a whole job 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.170
 on self-esteem on reinsurance 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.540
 which is that they did also with the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.220
 psychologist then it 's not just the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.890
 migrants there are also people who 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.870
 really have very long life paths 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.280
 marginalized we are really in this 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.630
 comprehensive support with two 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.500
 large dimensions 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.300
 the individual dimension 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.500
 individual accompaniment and then 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.420
 that's the collective dimension aspect 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.040
 and friendly and so that's what we 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.210
 found on the places of reception then the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.220
 departure is volunteers who have 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.450
 rotates maziade gradually he 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.860
 are teams of professionals who have 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.000
 who came to join us but he 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.170
 none the less there are cases 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.580
 the volunteers and that these volunteers 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.990
 are very engaged and the employees 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.890
 by the way on thirteen then engaged on 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.260
 basis there are two globally there are 70 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.140
 80 active volunteers first role of the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.960
 volunteer based Iliad that is listening 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.220
 really the first principle of action 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.480
 bazilia militant determination a 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.250
 AIDS Association 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.810
 today it's complicated to say that 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.750
 because the financiers tell us that 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.400
 hiv pathologies like the others and 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.360
 we continue to believe that hiv 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.560
 is not a pathology like 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.930
 others from a pure point of view 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.650
 treatment yes but everything else around 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.180
 the whole social and human aspect is very 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.560
 very different selections clearly 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.000
 it is our main private financier 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.409
 it's a partner who 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.090
 essential for béziade is a 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:41.239
 historical partner too and it's a 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.379
 partner who is a huge confidence 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.569
 in base there are names of a huge 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.489
 trust in action for many 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.870
 reasons because in the process they 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.500
 have the same vision as us of the fight 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.379
 against AIDS 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.310
 they have the same vision as we in the 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.799
 support in the concept of 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.569
 comprehensive care and then are 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.220
 people and his set an association that 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.930
 helps a lot on the ground and so they 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.739
 give us financial help for 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.359
 people who do not have 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.049
 resources that allows us to fund 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.780
 the meal here is so the help of those 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.010
 of action and is essential because 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.480
 that she is no longer funding all these 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.200
 aid is more financed by 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.200
 public authorities today 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.720
 he 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.370
 trial 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.409
 on the 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.140
 2 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:13.310
 to me 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.310
 a nightmare 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.790
 and that's all 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.810
 and if 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.810
 so everything 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.680
 accor to fear
