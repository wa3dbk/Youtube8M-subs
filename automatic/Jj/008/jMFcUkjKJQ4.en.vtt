want to talk about how to inflate a
bicycle<00:00:05.100> tire<00:00:05.310> I'm<00:00:06.120> now<00:00:06.299> going<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.509> be

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
bicycle tire I'm now going to be

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.890 
bicycle tire I'm now going to be
demonstrating<00:00:06.779> with<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.529> skate<00:00:08.280> on<00:00:08.490> Tay<00:00:08.900> which

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
demonstrating with a skate on Tay which

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.070 
demonstrating with a skate on Tay which
is<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> road<00:00:10.440> bike<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.700> has<00:00:11.849> Presta<00:00:12.570> valves

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
is a road bike and it has Presta valves

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.289 
is a road bike and it has Presta valves
so<00:00:13.950> if<00:00:14.160> you're<00:00:14.309> looking<00:00:14.639> for<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.910> other<00:00:15.059> type

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
so if you're looking for the other type

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.010 
so if you're looking for the other type
of<00:00:15.540> valve<00:00:15.719> your<00:00:15.990> traditional<00:00:16.680> fatter<00:00:17.550> valve

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
of valve your traditional fatter valve

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.260 
of valve your traditional fatter valve
those<00:00:19.560> are<00:00:19.710> pretty<00:00:20.160> self-explanatory<00:00:20.490> but

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
those are pretty self-explanatory but

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.840 
those are pretty self-explanatory but
these<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.720> daunting<00:00:22.289> at<00:00:22.470> first<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
these can be daunting at first so the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.769 
these can be daunting at first so the
first<00:00:24.029> thing<00:00:24.180> you're<00:00:24.300> going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> notice<00:00:24.630> when

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
first thing you're going to notice when

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.830 
first thing you're going to notice when
you<00:00:24.930> zoom<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:26.150> well<00:00:27.150> when<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.390> get<00:00:27.539> close

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
you zoom in well when you get close

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.400 
you zoom in well when you get close
rather<00:00:28.170> you're<00:00:29.039> going<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> see<00:00:29.490> this

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
rather you're going to see this

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.799 
rather you're going to see this
weird-lookin<00:00:31.410> valve<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:33.149> lot<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.510> people

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
weird-lookin valve and a lot of people

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.690 
weird-lookin valve and a lot of people
often<00:00:34.050> mess<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.829> because<00:00:35.040> they<00:00:35.340> don't<00:00:35.460> realize

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
often mess up because they don't realize

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.660 
often mess up because they don't realize
you<00:00:36.030> got<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> unscrew<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.110> tip<00:00:37.670> you

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you got to unscrew this so this tip you

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.549 
you got to unscrew this so this tip you
can<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.000> right<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.210> there's<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> tip

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.670 

unscrew<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:45.840> say<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.289> see<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> gap

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
unscrew it and say now you can see a gap

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.900 
unscrew it and say now you can see a gap
between<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.399> piece<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.850> piece

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
between that piece and that piece

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.869 
between that piece and that piece
because<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.750> extended<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:50.280> important

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
because it's extended that's important

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.799 
because it's extended that's important
because<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.660> you're

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
because if you don't do that you're

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.819 
because if you don't do that you're
going<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.050> able<00:00:52.110> put<00:00:52.289> air<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:52.590> tire

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
going to be able put air in your tire

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.260 
going to be able put air in your tire
and<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.940> equally<00:00:54.329> important<00:00:54.870> before<00:00:55.110> you

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
and are equally important before you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.599 
and are equally important before you
before<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.510> begin<00:00:57.870> putting<00:00:58.079> air<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.710> look

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
before you begin putting air in it look

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.840 
before you begin putting air in it look
around<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.180> edge<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.690> your<00:01:00.899> tire<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.850> see

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
around the edge of your tire and see

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.679 
around the edge of your tire and see
what<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> maximum<00:01:03.359> psi<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.939> mine's<00:01:05.939> these

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
what the maximum psi is mine's these

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.260 
what the maximum psi is mine's these
particular<00:01:07.229> tires<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.189> 120<00:01:08.729> psi

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
particular tires I have here are 120 psi

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.289 
particular tires I have here are 120 psi
so<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.619> keep<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:10.979> about<00:01:11.070> 110<00:01:11.670> psi

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
so I like to keep it at about 110 psi

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.109 
so I like to keep it at about 110 psi
and<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.740> always<00:01:14.689> always<00:01:15.689> air<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.470> up

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
and up and I always always air it up

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.670 
and up and I always always air it up
before<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.150> arrive<00:01:18.509> because<00:01:18.810> especially<00:01:19.560> with

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
before I arrive because especially with

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.160 
before I arrive because especially with
a<00:01:19.710> road<00:01:19.950> bike<00:01:20.270> these<00:01:21.270> tires<00:01:21.570> even<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.080> they

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
a road bike these tires even if they

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.920 
a road bike these tires even if they
don't<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.409> any<00:01:23.030> many<00:01:24.030> imperfections<00:01:24.360> in

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
don't have any many imperfections in

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.020 
don't have any many imperfections in
them<00:01:25.049> they<00:01:25.710> tend<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> lose<00:01:26.520> they're<00:01:26.729> quite

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
them they tend to lose they're quite

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.789 
them they tend to lose they're quite
rapidly<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.229> first<00:01:28.500> thing<00:01:28.619> you're<00:01:28.710> going

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
rapidly so the first thing you're going

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.539 
rapidly so the first thing you're going
to<00:01:28.860> want<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.460> by<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.579> way<00:01:29.790> I'm<00:01:29.939> using<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
to want to do and by the way I'm using a

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.030 
to want to do and by the way I'm using a
hurricane<00:01:32.549> team<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.360> got<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.409> pump<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.829> few

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
hurricane team I got this pump a few

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.030 
hurricane team I got this pump a few
well<00:01:35.340> several<00:01:35.850> years<00:01:35.909> back<00:01:36.329> from<00:01:37.040> performance

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
well several years back from performance

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.819 
well several years back from performance
bike<00:01:38.280> comm<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.829> it's<00:01:40.829> got<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:42.829> pressure

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
bike comm and it's got a a pressure

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.030 
bike comm and it's got a a pressure
gauge<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.479> so<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.869> lot<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.560> these<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.950> these

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
gauge on it so a lot of these and these

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
gauge on it so a lot of these and these
vary<00:01:47.310> among<00:01:47.670> brands<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.329> I'll<00:01:49.079> put<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
vary among brands but I'll put that

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.130 
vary among brands but I'll put that
little<00:01:49.740> red<00:01:49.979> indicator<00:01:50.490> right<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:51.140> 110

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
little red indicator right about 110

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.649 
little red indicator right about 110
because<00:01:52.710> that's<00:01:52.979> one<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.579> now<00:01:54.450> this

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
because that's one on one for now this

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.630 
because that's one on one for now this
air<00:01:54.930> obvious<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.680> tire<00:01:55.920> obviously<00:01:56.430> already

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
air obvious this tire obviously already

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.870 
air obvious this tire obviously already
has<00:01:56.850> air<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.500> show<00:01:58.740> why<00:01:59.670> it's

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
has air in it but just to show why it's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.819 
has air in it but just to show why it's
important<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> air<00:02:00.750> up<00:02:00.930> daily<00:02:01.320> you'll<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:01.680> how

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
important to air up daily you'll see how

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
you ought to see your air pressure

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.670 
you ought to see your air pressure
actually<00:02:26.480> I'm<00:02:26.780> going<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.960> put<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.410> phone

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
actually I'm going to put this phone

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.250 
actually I'm going to put this phone
down<00:02:27.710> because<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.310> didn't<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:29.050> didn't<00:02:30.050> properly

down because I didn't I didn't properly

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.220 
down because I didn't I didn't properly
engage<00:02:30.770> that<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:31.250> bear<00:02:31.430> with<00:02:31.610> me<00:02:31.810> I'm<00:02:32.810> filming

without my film career yeah I'm still
here<00:02:39.940> okay<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.270> got<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.630> on<00:02:41.840> there<00:02:45.820> usually

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
here okay so I got that on there usually

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.090 
here okay so I got that on there usually
what<00:02:47.090> I'll<00:02:47.150> do<00:02:47.270> I'll<00:02:47.390> do<00:02:47.540> one<00:02:47.750> pump<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.380> now

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
what I'll do I'll do one pump and now

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.920 
what I'll do I'll do one pump and now
this<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.460> an<00:02:49.580> accurate<00:02:50.000> representation<00:02:50.480> what

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
this is an accurate representation what

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.390 
this is an accurate representation what
the<00:02:51.020> pressure<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:51.680> right<00:02:51.800> around<00:02:51.950> 100

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
the pressure is it's right around 100

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.940 
the pressure is it's right around 100
psi<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.560> since<00:02:54.560> yesterday<00:02:55.070> I<00:02:55.100> lost<00:02:56.530> about<00:02:57.530> 10

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
psi so since yesterday I lost about 10

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.150 
psi so since yesterday I lost about 10
psi<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:03.470> know<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.680> doesn't<00:03:03.800> have<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:03.980> be

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
psi and you know it doesn't have to be

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.860 
psi and you know it doesn't have to be
dead-on<00:03:04.640> but<00:03:05.740> I'm<00:03:06.740> getting<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.070> close<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:08.000> 110

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
dead-on but I'm getting it close to 110

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.610 
dead-on but I'm getting it close to 110
psi<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.710> then<00:03:10.370> once<00:03:10.580> you're<00:03:10.730> done<00:03:11.470> put<00:03:12.470> that

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
psi and then once you're done put that

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.290 
psi and then once you're done put that
down<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:12.920> pop<00:03:13.100> that<00:03:13.310> off<00:03:13.460> and<00:03:13.730> be<00:03:13.850> sure<00:03:14.270> to

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
down and pop that off and be sure to

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.950 
down and pop that off and be sure to
screw<00:03:14.810> your<00:03:15.880> screw<00:03:16.880> your<00:03:17.030> Presta<00:03:17.510> valve<00:03:17.690> back

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
screw your screw your Presta valve back

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.040 
screw your screw your Presta valve back
down<00:03:18.200> or<00:03:18.410> you'll<00:03:18.530> leak<00:03:19.420> now<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.450> lot<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.780> people

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
down or you'll leak now a lot of people

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.740 
down or you'll leak now a lot of people

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
prefer to to install the little nipple

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.470 
prefer to to install the little nipple
covers<00:03:27.110> on<00:03:27.350> these<00:03:27.530> Presta<00:03:28.040> valves<00:03:28.480> and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
covers on these Presta valves and

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.840 
covers on these Presta valves and
honestly<00:03:29.990> I<00:03:30.020> don't<00:03:30.170> is<00:03:30.950> just<00:03:31.280> an<00:03:31.370> extra<00:03:31.670> piece

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
honestly I don't is just an extra piece

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.060 
honestly I don't is just an extra piece
I<00:03:32.000> got<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.240> take<00:03:32.390> off<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:32.930> I'm<00:03:33.830> personally

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
I got to take off and I'm personally

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.570 
I got to take off and I'm personally
convinced<00:03:34.730> they<00:03:34.850> don't<00:03:36.130> they<00:03:37.130> don't<00:03:37.340> help

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
convinced they don't they don't help

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.050 
convinced they don't they don't help
with<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.120> air<00:03:38.750> retention<00:03:39.530> of<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:40.370> tires<00:03:40.640> so

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
with the air retention of the tires so

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.600 
with the air retention of the tires so
that's<00:03:41.990> just<00:03:42.230> my<00:03:42.350> own<00:03:42.410> opinion<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:43.040> lot<00:03:43.460> of

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
that's just my own opinion a lot of

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.950 
that's just my own opinion a lot of
people<00:03:43.790> say<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.000> should<00:03:44.330> use<00:03:44.570> them<00:03:44.690> because

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
people say you should use them because

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.960 
people say you should use them because
it<00:03:45.080> will<00:03:45.170> keep<00:03:45.260> dirt<00:03:45.530> off<00:03:45.740> of<00:03:45.770> there<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.250> you

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
it will keep dirt off of there and you

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.570 
it will keep dirt off of there and you
know<00:03:47.150> obviously<00:03:47.180> dirt<00:03:47.960> if<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.100> got<00:03:49.220> on<00:03:49.370> there

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
know obviously dirt if it got on there

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.430 
know obviously dirt if it got on there
then<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:49.940> when<00:03:50.330> you<00:03:50.420> pump<00:03:50.660> your<00:03:50.780> tire<00:03:51.050> it<00:03:51.290> could

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
then it when you pump your tire it could

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.950 
then it when you pump your tire it could
get<00:03:51.560> inside<00:03:51.710> your<00:03:52.130> tube<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.760> if<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.840> was

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
get inside your tube and if it was

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.600 
get inside your tube and if it was
something<00:03:53.990> sharp<00:03:54.470> if<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:54.770> create<00:03:55.130> punctures

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
something sharp if you create punctures

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.820 
something sharp if you create punctures
so<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:56.150> mean<00:03:56.750> there<00:03:56.870> is<00:03:56.900> a<00:03:57.020> reason<00:03:57.380> those<00:03:57.530> nipple

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
so I mean there is a reason those nipple

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.430 
so I mean there is a reason those nipple
covers<00:03:58.100> exist<00:03:58.520> but<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.030> then<00:03:59.960> I'll<00:04:00.110> repeat

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
covers exist but and then I'll repeat

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.590 
covers exist but and then I'll repeat
the<00:04:00.590> process<00:04:00.830> for<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.400> back<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:02.090> it's<00:04:02.510> the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
the process for the back and it's the

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.190 
the process for the back and it's the
same<00:04:02.840> type<00:04:03.080> of<00:04:03.110> tire<00:04:03.470> so<00:04:03.890> I'll<00:04:04.490> do<00:04:05.030> 110<00:04:05.510> psi<00:04:06.020> on

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
same type of tire so I'll do 110 psi on

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.440 
same type of tire so I'll do 110 psi on
it<00:04:06.320> as<00:04:06.470> well<00:04:06.790> thanks<00:04:07.790> for<00:04:07.850> watching<00:04:07.940> hope<00:04:08.420> you
