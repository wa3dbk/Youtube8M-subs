00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
insert a particular number we'll insert

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:43.880 
insert a particular number we'll insert
our<00:00:32.759> number<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.649> well<00:00:34.649> 8<00:00:38.300> 815<00:00:39.649> 26<00:00:41.059> okay<00:00:42.890> go

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
our number here well 8 815 26 okay go

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.970 
our number here well 8 815 26 okay go
back<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.219> settings<00:00:44.899> now<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.410> assign<00:00:46.770> an

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
back to settings now you can assign an

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.060 
back to settings now you can assign an
activator<00:00:47.610> action<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.930> call<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.770> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
activator action to call now so you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.560 
activator action to call now so you
probably<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.579> activator<00:00:51.090> already

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
probably have activator already

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.529 
probably have activator already
installed<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.260> your<00:00:52.530> device<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.300> want<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
installed on your device so we want to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
installed on your device so we want to
tap<00:00:55.020> anywhere<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.730> let's<00:00:57.000> say<00:00:58.100> shake<00:00:59.100> our

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
tap anywhere and let's say shake our

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.439 
tap anywhere and let's say shake our
device<00:00:59.809> see<00:01:00.809> we're<00:01:01.050> shake<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.309> is

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
device see we're shake it there it is

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.899 
device see we're shake it there it is
you<00:01:03.449> want<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> sign<00:01:03.870> call<00:01:04.260> now<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> shake<00:01:05.070> our

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
you want to sign call now to shake our

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.210 
you want to sign call now to shake our
device<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.479> basically<00:01:07.229> whenever<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.010> shake

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
device so basically whenever we shake

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.980 
device so basically whenever we shake
our<00:01:08.340> device<00:01:08.610> we're<00:01:09.210> gonna<00:01:09.330> call<00:01:09.570> jailbreak

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
our device we're gonna call jailbreak

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.590 
our device we're gonna call jailbreak
movies<00:01:10.320> phone<00:01:11.100> number<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:12.240> pretty<00:01:12.420> much<00:01:12.540> how

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
movies phone number it's pretty much how

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.740 
movies phone number it's pretty much how
it<00:01:12.869> boils<00:01:13.140> down<00:01:13.220> let's<00:01:14.220> see<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.939> let's<00:01:15.570> give<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it boils down let's see so let's give it

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:27.719 
it boils down let's see so let's give it
a<00:01:15.840> shot<00:01:20.240> see<00:01:21.240> call<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:22.549> call

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.340 

all<00:01:28.210> right<00:01:28.329> so<00:01:28.630> it's<00:01:28.780> calling<00:01:28.960> jailbreak

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
all right so it's calling jailbreak

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.060 
all right so it's calling jailbreak
movies<00:01:30.659> that's<00:01:31.659> pretty<00:01:31.960> much<00:01:32.079> it<00:01:32.289> so<00:01:32.530> that's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
movies that's pretty much it so that's

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.940 
movies that's pretty much it so that's
how<00:01:33.159> call<00:01:33.399> networks<00:01:33.759> it's<00:01:34.030> pretty<00:01:34.240> cool<00:01:34.950> you

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
how call networks it's pretty cool you

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.020 
how call networks it's pretty cool you
can<00:01:35.979> see<00:01:36.250> where<00:01:36.399> this<00:01:36.460> would<00:01:36.520> come<00:01:36.789> in<00:01:36.880> handy

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
can see where this would come in handy

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.580 
can see where this would come in handy
especially<00:01:37.299> if<00:01:37.750> you<00:01:37.840> call<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.200> same<00:01:38.380> people
