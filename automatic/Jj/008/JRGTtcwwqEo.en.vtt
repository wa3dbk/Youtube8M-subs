what<00:00:53.519> I<00:00:53.550> realize<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.480> actually<00:00:54.809> all

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
what I realize know as but actually all

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.349 
what I realize know as but actually all
players<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.059> look<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
players and so but if you look at the

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.200 
players and so but if you look at the
integration<00:00:58.170> that's<00:00:58.739> near<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.489> fifty-fifty

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
integration that's near not fifty-fifty

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.209 
integration that's near not fifty-fifty
we<00:01:00.930> play<00:01:01.109> passive<00:01:01.469> scrubs<00:01:01.739> which<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.100> what

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
we play passive scrubs which is what

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.790 
we play passive scrubs which is what
veterans<00:01:02.699> tend<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> play<00:01:03.440> that's<00:01:04.440> partly

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
veterans tend to play that's partly

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.410 
veterans tend to play that's partly
because<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.160> the<00:01:05.309> experience<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:05.940> we<00:01:06.119> could

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
because of the experience so we could

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.820 
because of the experience so we could
have<00:01:06.539> boys<00:01:06.720> playing<00:01:07.140> their<00:01:07.259> first<00:01:07.410> second
