 not hurt in the absolute majority of 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:02.059
 people in photos 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:05.360
 touching the first one heel in the sun 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.750
 there is a minority of the people they 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.509
 a person on the tip of the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.350
 time that the village neighborhood already runs at the tip 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.350
 foot 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.140
 This is deeper and people come back

 short distances or Chinese proofs of 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.399
 speed but it's from iff people do 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.950
 this to run new long distance and 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.590
 I'm also doing critical internet 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.220
 hear the friend talk that it is better to run 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.959
 All right then I'll change my beaded 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.110
 to come on tiptoe 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.970
 they are not very natural things right 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.080
 my opinion a person that he

 Runaway is the way she feels 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.600
 more comfortable

 person can suffer media minutes is 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.009
 dress and eat 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.780
