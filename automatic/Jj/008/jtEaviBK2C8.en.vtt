00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.630
 among friends many greetings from 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.880
 serafinomassoni today is Saturday 7 February 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.330
 2009 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:21.170
 let's talk about the value of life because a 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:25.650
 young man of the web whose name is alessandro 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.609
 I think the opinions seem to me 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.710
 I apologize if I'm not mistaken, whose nick name and 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.370
 entropy entropy I am certainly wrong 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.730
 I know it's called alessandro alessandro 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:46.940
 forge alessandro forge has me 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:50.460
 sent a letter to the letter e 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.600
 let's say that in the present it makes me understand 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.410
 that he google wants to understand what i am 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.480
 deep radical real motifs for i 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.420
 which is so much resistance towards 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.400
 I know of the question 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.130
 of the artificial feeding of eluana 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.369
 englaro not in the question of 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.360
 living will that because it is there a 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.900
 elia saw also saw mine 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.689
 previous film Giorgio Napolitano 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.270
 outing and it means me ok we go to 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.240
 alessandro the question asks me 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.280
 forgione seems to me adias entropy 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.770
 but why why why not 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.990
 he rightly satisfies he does not 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.130
 satisfied with what appears in 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.750
 surface wants to go deep 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.170
 we can go deep into dear card 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.159
 dear friend alessandro the van I think 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.840
 alias entropy entropy other is dear to me 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.409
 where I will not make a serious speech 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.990
 you are ready you are ready and you are ready 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.610
 to make a serious talk about value 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:04.110
 of life 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:09.229
 well ready you part charity is neither a 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.319
 value and not a negative value it lives 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:17.769
 simply 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:19.719
 ie point and just clear well and see 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.719
 too this year it had yes but because there 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:25.719
 we call life one a value 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:28.840
 convention is a cover that life 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.889
 have a value is a convention that 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.620
 we now get there 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:34.090
 it's a pack is exactly like 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.359
 we determined that the north pole 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.609
 what is up there and the south pole 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.230
 what is down there but we could also 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.730
 establish who on the contrary 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.870
 and so we have established that life 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.639
 we invented one as we have 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.549
 established humanity will agree 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:54.639
 from the beginning she agreed 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.250
 humanity is that the company has value is 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:59.079
 a convention because if per se the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.049
 life is not is neither a value nor a 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.419
 no value life is all there is 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.760
 but how did the idea arise that the 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:09.459
 life is a value 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.540
 how many times I've already told you but you have to 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.669
 read with the wonderful work of 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.729
 push philosopher push 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:20.939
 spiritualist the do-gooder does not 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:24.159
 Catholic spiritualist materialist 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:27.159
 Jew converted to Catholicism exempts 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:32.019
 I'm in there are people there are written 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:36.819
 spingsteen spirituality so let's start the 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.590
 mouth to all those who will seek the 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.069
 controversy between material spirituality and 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.189
 of people and simeri person the title 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:49.799
 of his work and the two sources of the 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:54.040
 moral and religion where he explains 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:56.379
 very sharply than when it develops 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.759
 in men consciousness consciousness 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.079
 consciousness 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.419
 at the end, conscience does not have 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.239
 necessarily an ethical connotation 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.780
 morality means conscience writes 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.819
 awareness awareness 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.189
 awareness of being a world when 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.049
 in humanity it develops with the new 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.709
 after new organ that new function 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.620
 which is called consciousness awareness 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.389
 ability to reflect to reflect of 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.310
 split into a mirror 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.990
 because only men recognize us 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.780
 in a mirror that a dog owns 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.240
 put them in your mouth a beautiful bone and it 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.300
 He puts it in front of a mirror lu believe 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.039
 another dog is another dog not 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.349
 recognizes another's own image 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.699
 dog and maybe even jump on him for 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.569
 take that other place too 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.919
 see in the mirror 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:47.159
 then when consciousness is born or how 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.949
 awareness of how to reflect again 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:53.389
 mirroring bodies you know what it is 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:57.120
 notice the men realize that 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:00.150
 they are born and then they must die while 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.009
 any animal that knows these things the 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.340
 animals neither know nor see 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:08.460
 the animals die there and that's it 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.810
 they arrive have no conscience or if there is 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.180
 they have it so low 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.969
 that does not bring non- lay annoyance instead 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:19.319
 we consciousness is a new function 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:22.050
 what bothers you is that it bothers because 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.909
 we are the only ones in this world 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.259
 poor wretches we are the only ones a 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:30.839
 to know that you are sentenced to death by 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.539
 to be on death row 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:36.539
 then they said people and they had two 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:41.750
 humanity had only two choices 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:44.099
 roads or mass suicide or 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.279
 here it is the cunning of nature 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:53.300
 the cunning of the co- inventing of 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:56.279
 mortality inventing mortality ie 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.430
 names have invented religions have 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:02.659
 invented one of caves and have 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.219
 established that life is a value 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:07.979
 then this thing that life is a 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:10.649
 value and a convention is one 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.750
 custom so strongly rooted 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:15.689
 that people have even forgotten the 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:20.189
 fact that life is a value because of 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:23.009
 an ancient convention an old one 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:25.500
 old convention and think that the 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.389
 life is a value in and of itself is a 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.000
 value a value a value there are 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.840
 forgotten about that ancient convention 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.660
 original 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:37.560
 humanity has established I have not here 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.690
 we don't want to commit suicide no 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.699
 however, we must live to live we must 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.790
 give a living value but look at it 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:48.330
 same blog wrote that sentence 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:52.050
 wonderful that if you want to enjoy yours 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.000
 own value you must have was divo 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.150
 categorical must assign a value 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.979
 also to the world that is us 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.449
 the world is neither a modern nor undone 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:02.840
 we say that we attribute a value to the 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.700
 world to be able to live in peace 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.460
 here dear friend dear the stroke is wanted 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.139
 go to the bottom of egypt 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.690
 there is always the matter of 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.150
 our sister bodily death does not go there 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.760
 to die you don't make us die dear not 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.010
 we are happy to die then we have 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.650
 invented we all invented and 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.479
 let us forget about the neighboring one 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.789
 to the convention and when it is involved 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:29.430
 in the marked by the later patriarchy 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:33.360
 came the belief that the convention 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:37.220
 number one for which we have 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:40.289
 established that life is not a value 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.240
 and then millennia and millennia and millennia 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:45.360
 after millennia we are no more 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.820
 remember that it is a convention is fine 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.830
 here too there would be many other things 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.440
 to say however my dear friend I wanted 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.840
 satiate your first acquaintance 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.530
 agreement dear friend look at that anyway 

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.270
 life is beautiful and you can live well 

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:04.229
 even if the value of life one 

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:05.789
 convention but see dear friends thanks to 

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:08.270
 all of you many greetings from
