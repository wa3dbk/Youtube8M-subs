00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.150
 the arrival of the other viewers to the dealers themselves 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.650
 continue to develop elias not to healing 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
 Kraft today unraveled awesome 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.100
 pirate ship which is located 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.200
 my usual place where I review different 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.300
 fashion any garbage in general, this structure 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.220
 my ship which I redid 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.050
 dynamite now he is very explosive 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.730
 and over there is a ship which 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.530
 absolutely not redistribution you can 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.870
 look like it is there 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.250
 awesome this is the best big paint 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.830
 ship which has some hefty 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.660
 front harpoon healthier lower to this 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.940
 skull do not know like someone 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.280
 the deer that run while the skeleton stacks 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.780
 Overall a very unusual thing here is 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.970
 a lot of different buttons 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.220
 which I would not advise you to press 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.350
 because by pressing the ship button 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.970
 may just explode for default 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.620
 these buttons should work for ejection 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.450
 various suffered as far as I understand 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.850
 braids so that you can shoot somewhere 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.040
 so this is some awesome hold here by 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.410
 idea kept some kind of rake on this 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.410
 added something else so hold where 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.210
 guns where's the guns below the gun something 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.550
 vaguely reminiscent of ears 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.860
 what's inside within us is nothing 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.840
 but in theory would have to lie dynamite 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.000
 or some balls like motma balls 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.830
 which could fly and pay to 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.570
 there bomb but apple push this 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.440
 the button did not dare to click and 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.750
 dream others liked 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.640
 I think I'm in the boat on shoving 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.680
 various balls could you can 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.299
 shoot if it works out okay 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.430
 Now let's see what we have there 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.770
 on top of this ship located damn 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.720
 where the hell is the exit here is very easy 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.210
 get lost so finally found a way out 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.340
 bolts buildings whisper siren what 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.140
 your sails are beautiful indeed 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.590
 very very beautiful sail this 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.630

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.340
 an hour through the pages of my sham hope 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.710

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.840
