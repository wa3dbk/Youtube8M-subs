00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.760 
damage not gonna kill you now another
thing<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.810> keep<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:36.990> mind<00:01:37.049> too<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> ads

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
thing to keep in mind too is the ads

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
thing to keep in mind too is the ads
aren't<00:01:38.250> gonna<00:01:38.490> spawn<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> left<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.780> see

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
aren't gonna spawn in to the left to see

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.179 
aren't gonna spawn in to the left to see
where<00:01:40.110> i<00:01:40.140> am<00:01:40.259> right<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.560> left<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> me

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
where i am right now the left to me

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.530 
where i am right now the left to me
there's<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.549> room<00:01:41.820> where<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.000> initially<00:01:42.329> come

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
there's a room where you initially come

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.389 
there's a room where you initially come
in<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.229> they're<00:01:43.649> not<00:01:43.770> going<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.950> come<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.220> of

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
in that they're not going to come out of

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.069 
in that they're not going to come out of
there<00:01:44.520> unless<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.060> venture<00:01:45.509> into<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.899> room

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
there unless you venture into that room

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.260 
there unless you venture into that room
I<00:01:46.229> guess<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.619> kind<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:48.149> know

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
I guess it's kind of like the you know

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.149 
I guess it's kind of like the you know
the<00:01:48.420> cheese<00:01:48.780> room<00:01:49.079> right<00:01:49.530> before<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.950> kill

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the cheese room right before you kill

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.429 
the cheese room right before you kill
fog<00:01:50.579> off<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.329> summoning<00:01:51.750> pits<00:01:51.869> where<00:01:52.229> if

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
fog off on the summoning pits where if

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.319 
fog off on the summoning pits where if
you<00:01:52.590> go<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.829> room<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.119> choose

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
you go to that room and you all choose

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
you go to that room and you all choose
them<00:01:54.479> from<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.020> Shrieker<00:01:55.500> comes<00:01:55.740> out

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
them from there the Shrieker comes out

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.249 
them from there the Shrieker comes out
and<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.700> also<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.450> think<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.719> wizard<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.079> two

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
and then also I think a wizard or two

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.050 
and then also I think a wizard or two
and<00:01:58.439> then<00:01:58.560> once<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.460> back<00:01:59.610> off<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.820> little

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and then once you just back off a little

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.789 
and then once you just back off a little
bit<00:02:00.210> they<00:02:00.420> disappear<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> same

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
bit they disappear I think it's the same

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.249 
bit they disappear I think it's the same
thing<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.430> also<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:03.049> was<00:02:04.049> shown

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
thing with this one also I was shown

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.170 
thing with this one also I was shown

hoping this comes up as a nice bowl soon

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.220 
hoping this comes up as a nice bowl soon
could<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:37.700> imagine<00:02:37.879> if<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.299> came<00:02:38.480> up<00:02:38.510> with

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
could you imagine if this came up with

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.410 
could you imagine if this came up with
solar<00:02:39.829> solar<00:02:40.280> burn<00:02:40.640> on<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.909> you<00:02:41.030> know<00:02:41.120> Eazy

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
solar solar burn on it you know Eazy

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.210 
solar solar burn on it you know Eazy
would<00:02:41.659> be<00:02:41.720> come<00:02:42.409> in<00:02:42.560> here<00:02:42.739> with<00:02:42.890> basically

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
would be come in here with basically

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.770 
would be come in here with basically
what<00:02:43.370> I'm<00:02:43.459> using<00:02:43.609> here<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:44.120> my<00:02:44.299> trusty

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
what I'm using here just my trusty

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.899 
what I'm using here just my trusty
vision<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.709> confluence<00:02:46.099> as<00:02:46.549> well<00:02:46.700> as<00:02:46.790> my

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
vision of confluence as well as my

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.240 
vision of confluence as well as my
icebreaker<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:48.139> course<00:02:48.409> the<00:02:48.709> vex

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
icebreaker and of course the vex

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.399 
icebreaker and of course the vex
terrific<00:02:49.819> last<00:02:50.030> but<00:02:50.299> if<00:02:50.569> it<00:02:50.750> does<00:02:50.900> come<00:02:50.959> up<00:02:51.109> for

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
terrific last but if it does come up for

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.839 
terrific last but if it does come up for
a<00:02:51.440> nightfall<00:02:51.889> I<00:02:52.040> would<00:02:52.250> just<00:02:52.280> stick<00:02:52.639> with<00:02:52.790> the

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
a nightfall I would just stick with the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.280 
a nightfall I would just stick with the
vision<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.120> confluence<00:02:53.480> because<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.989> just<00:02:54.079> as

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
vision of confluence because it just as

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.199 
vision of confluence because it just as
way<00:02:54.709> more<00:02:54.859> impact<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.549> I<00:02:55.670> just<00:02:55.940> think<00:02:56.090> it's

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
way more impact and I just think it's

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.240 
way more impact and I just think it's
easier<00:02:56.480> for<00:02:56.540> long-range<00:02:57.470> situations<00:02:58.159> like

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
easier for long-range situations like

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.559 
easier for long-range situations like
this<00:02:58.430> when<00:02:58.639> I'm<00:02:58.730> trying<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.180> stay<00:02:59.359> away<00:02:59.510> from

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
this when I'm trying to stay away from

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.599 
this when I'm trying to stay away from
