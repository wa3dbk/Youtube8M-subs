will mount to the lathe carriage and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.600 
will mount to the lathe carriage and
then<00:00:30.840> these<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.080> slots<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.800> tie<00:00:32.099> wrap<00:00:32.399> to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.010 
hold a cable across the top of this
bracket<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.780> out<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.260> way<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.850> i

bracket so it's out of the way and i
actually<00:00:40.020> did<00:00:40.350> all<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> processes<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
actually did all the processes on the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.639 
actually did all the processes on the
top<00:00:41.700> i<00:00:41.910> did<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.270> chamfering<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.020> each<00:00:43.140> hole<00:00:43.410> i

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
top i did the chamfering of each hole i

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.959 
top i did the chamfering of each hole i
did<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> counter<00:00:44.250> bores<00:00:44.460> who<00:00:44.700> did<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
did the counter bores who did the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.330 
did the counter bores who did the
through<00:00:45.180> holes<00:00:45.420> i<00:00:45.780> did<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> chamfer<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
through holes i did a chamfer on the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.150 
through holes i did a chamfer on the
edge<00:00:47.520> i<00:00:48.000> did<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:50.600> profile<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.020> entered<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.039> on

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
edge i did the profile and entered in on

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.529 
edge i did the profile and entered in on
the<00:00:53.280> corner<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:54.030> i<00:00:54.059> always<00:00:54.210> heard<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the corner because i always heard the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.540 
the corner because i always heard the
corners<00:00:54.899> or<00:00:55.020> where<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.890> should<00:00:56.100> come<00:00:56.309> in

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
corners or where it you should come in

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.310 
corners or where it you should come in
instead<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.239> straight<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:57.809> easier<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
instead of a straight and it's easier to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.040 
instead of a straight and it's easier to
hide<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.160> tool<00:00:59.370> mark<00:00:59.670> where<00:01:00.050> introduces

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
hide the the tool mark where introduces

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.990 
hide the the tool mark where introduces
itself<00:01:01.440> into<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.120> material<00:01:03.120> there<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
itself into the material there is a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
itself into the material there is a
somewhere<00:01:06.000> right<00:01:06.180> here<00:01:06.360> where<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> started

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
somewhere right here where I started

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.160 
somewhere right here where I started
there<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:08.420> well<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> thought<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:10.020> was<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
there is a well I thought there was a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
there is a well I thought there was a
market<00:01:10.710> some<00:01:10.950> point<00:01:11.159> though<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.640> right

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
market some point though it is right

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.890 
market some point though it is right
here<00:01:13.970> do<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.060> really<00:01:15.240> look<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.869> can

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
here do you really look at it you can

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.440 
here do you really look at it you can
see<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.290> anyway<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.670> turned<00:01:17.939> out<00:01:18.060> alright<00:01:18.270> I

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
see it anyway it turned out alright I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.170 
see it anyway it turned out alright I
did<00:01:18.750> all<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> work<00:01:19.619> from<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.159> side<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.670> then

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
did all the work from this side and then

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.480 
did all the work from this side and then
I<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.450> flipped<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> part<00:01:22.110> over<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.650> in

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
I just flipped the part over and in

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.760 
I just flipped the part over and in
milled<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> end<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.900> until<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> part<00:01:25.590> was

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
milled the end of it until the part was

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.600 
milled the end of it until the part was
revealed<00:01:26.750> I've<00:01:27.750> been<00:01:28.049> cutting<00:01:28.979> around<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
revealed I've been cutting around the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.429 
revealed I've been cutting around the
perimeter<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> parts<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.600> dropping<00:01:31.079> them<00:01:31.110> out

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
perimeter of parts and dropping them out

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.039 
perimeter of parts and dropping them out
only<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.310> find<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.909> last<00:01:33.329> part<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
only to find that that last part as it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.289 
only to find that that last part as it
cuts<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> way<00:01:34.650> ends<00:01:35.579> up<00:01:35.700> knocking<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
cuts to the way ends up knocking the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.789 
cuts to the way ends up knocking the
part<00:01:36.509> across<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:37.079> bit<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.439> ends<00:01:37.619> up

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
part across a little bit and ends up

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.819 
part across a little bit and ends up
putting<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.189> tool<00:01:38.400> mark<00:01:38.840> in<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.350> edge<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.680> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
putting a tool mark in the edge of it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.440 
putting a tool mark in the edge of it
none<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.280> knew<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:41.670> had<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.030> prettier

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
none I knew there had to be a prettier

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.030 
none I knew there had to be a prettier
way<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.079> didn't<00:01:43.619> mess<00:01:43.770> with<00:01:43.829> your

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
way to do it that didn't mess with your

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.609 
way to do it that didn't mess with your
nice<00:01:44.340> machine<00:01:44.640> finishes<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.500> my

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
nice machine finishes and this was my

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.889 
nice machine finishes and this was my
first<00:01:47.329> successful<00:01:48.329> thing<00:01:50.210> with<00:01:51.210> no<00:01:51.450> problems

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
first successful thing with no problems

visual<00:02:02.219> thing<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.670> uh<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.119> don't<00:02:03.780> know<00:02:03.930> how<00:02:04.110> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
visual thing and uh I don't know how to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.230 
visual thing and uh I don't know how to
measure<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.829> surface<00:02:05.070> differences<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.000> I

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
measure the surface differences but I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.260 
measure the surface differences but I
sure<00:02:06.600> can't<00:02:06.869> feel<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> bare<00:02:07.469> hand

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270
