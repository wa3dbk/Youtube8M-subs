00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.430 
the iPad which is not bad at all

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
especially because the ipad weighs about

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.710 
especially because the ipad weighs about
at<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.920> point<00:02:17.159> five<00:02:17.400> pounds<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.569> going
