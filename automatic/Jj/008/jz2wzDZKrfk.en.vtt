with this build is that uh this right
here<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.500> isn't<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.280> great<00:00:41.460> against<00:00:41.700> dealing

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
here it isn't that great against dealing

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.430 
here it isn't that great against dealing
with<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.149> many<00:00:42.360> sunken<00:00:42.870> zar<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> go<00:00:43.320> up

with this many sunken zar going to go up

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.380 
with this many sunken zar going to go up
but<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:44.280> doesn't<00:00:44.640> seem<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:44.789> he<00:00:45.030> has<00:00:45.149> enough

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
but it doesn't seem like he has enough

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.500 
but it doesn't seem like he has enough
either<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.930> oh<00:00:45.960> no<00:00:46.829> he<00:00:47.070> has<00:00:47.340> enough<00:00:47.700> he<00:00:48.180> doesn't

play<00:01:10.350> from<00:01:10.380> Casey<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.890> gotta<00:01:11.130> say<00:01:11.340> very

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
play from Casey I gotta say very

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.960 
play from Casey I gotta say very
impressive<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.140> far<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.500> entire<00:01:13.890> game<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.189> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
impressive so far this entire game and I

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.310 
impressive so far this entire game and I
I<00:01:15.450> gotta<00:01:15.960> say<00:01:17.119> it's<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.570> too<00:01:18.810> bad<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.020> he's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
I gotta say it's it's too bad that he's

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.710 
I gotta say it's it's too bad that he's
not<00:01:19.530> more<00:01:19.830> consistent<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.610> games<00:01:21.509> like

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
not more consistent because games like

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.390 
not more consistent because games like
this<00:01:21.869> openings<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:22.890> very<00:01:23.189> very

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
this openings like this are very very

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.429 
this openings like this are very very
clever<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> even<00:01:24.780> though<00:01:24.869> they're<00:01:25.110> very

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
clever and even though they're very

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.980 
clever and even though they're very
ancient<00:01:25.970> who<00:01:26.970> says<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.659> there's

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
ancient who says that you know there's

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.660 
ancient who says that you know there's
nothing<00:01:28.229> wrong<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.409> ancient<00:01:28.770> strategies<00:01:29.430> in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
nothing wrong with ancient strategies in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.960 
nothing wrong with ancient strategies in
starcraft<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.750> mean<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.579> following<00:01:32.579> back<00:01:32.759> on

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
starcraft I mean just following back on

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.060 
starcraft I mean just following back on
them<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.930> know<00:01:33.960> old<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.530> become<00:01:34.799> new

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
them can be you know old can become new

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.679 
them can be you know old can become new
again<00:01:35.490> because<00:01:35.820> nobody<00:01:36.119> does<00:01:36.329> things<00:01:36.570> like

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
again because nobody does things like

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.109 
again because nobody does things like
this<00:01:36.920> especially<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> map<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:38.909> not

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
this especially on a map that's not

standard like this one there are huge

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.350 
standard like this one there are huge
advantages<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.700> doing<00:01:41.820> something<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.240> this

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.630 
advantages of doing something like this
especially<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.560> factory<00:01:43.950> float<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.460> saw

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
especially that factory float as we saw

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.240 
especially that factory float as we saw
although<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.840> seemed<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.409> fire<00:01:46.829> fest<00:01:47.100> did

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
although it seemed like fire fest did

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.639 
although it seemed like fire fest did
detect<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> last<00:01:48.000> minute<00:01:48.320> it's<00:01:49.320> still

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
detect it at the last minute it's still

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.859 
detect it at the last minute it's still
he<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:50.909> he<00:01:51.060> didn't<00:01:51.329> before<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:51.840> and

he you know he didn't before then and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.749 
he you know he didn't before then and
it's<00:01:52.290> possible<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.920> definitely<00:01:53.340> sneak<00:01:53.610> this

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it's possible to definitely sneak this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's possible to definitely sneak this
kind<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.350> kind<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.590> trickery

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
kind of you know this kind of trickery

into<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> back<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.820> zerg<00:01:57.299> basis<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.259> anyway<00:01:58.770> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
into the back of zerg basis so anyway it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.940 
into the back of zerg basis so anyway it
looks<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:01.380> base<00:02:01.590> here

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
looks like is going to be one base here

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.330 
looks like is going to be one base here
and<00:02:02.130> all<00:02:02.520> men<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.060> he<00:02:03.180> gonna<00:02:03.299> go<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.930> oh<00:02:04.340> wow

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.970 
still impressive nonetheless um and
right<00:03:15.030> now<00:03:15.120> we're<00:03:15.299> seeing<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.689> dropship<00:03:16.470> with

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
right now we're seeing a dropship with

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.830 
right now we're seeing a dropship with
right<00:03:17.220> there<00:03:17.430> being<00:03:17.760> loaded<00:03:18.000> up<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.540> don't

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
right there being loaded up I don't

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.089 
right there being loaded up I don't
think<00:03:18.930> fire<00:03:19.319> fist<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.650> going<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.829> be<00:03:19.889> prepared

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
think fire fist is going to be prepared

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.550 
think fire fist is going to be prepared
for<00:03:20.220> this<00:03:20.459> either<00:03:20.730> he<00:03:21.389> does<00:03:21.660> have<00:03:21.900> one<00:03:22.169> sunken

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
for this either he does have one sunken

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.589 
for this either he does have one sunken
in<00:03:22.650> his<00:03:22.769> main<00:03:22.949> but<00:03:23.579> uh<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:24.180> know<00:03:24.299> we'll<00:03:24.569> see

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
in his main but uh you know we'll see

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.360 
in his main but uh you know we'll see
where<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.109> strop<00:03:25.349> ship<00:03:25.530> goes<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:25.980> probably

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
where the strop ship goes it probably

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.970 
where the strop ship goes it probably
will<00:03:26.519> find<00:03:26.790> at<00:03:26.940> least<00:03:27.030> one<00:03:27.150> vulnerable<00:03:27.750> spot

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
will find at least one vulnerable spot

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.379 
will find at least one vulnerable spot
somewhere<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.790> these<00:03:30.209> two<00:03:30.329> bases

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
somewhere in this in these two bases

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.759 
somewhere in this in these two bases
they<00:03:33.389> might<00:03:33.569> go<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:33.989> natural<00:03:34.409> and<00:03:34.590> it

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
they might go for the natural and it

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.530 
they might go for the natural and it
might<00:03:34.949> actually<00:03:35.069> go<00:03:35.340> right<00:03:35.579> for<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.030> back<00:03:36.329> of

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
might actually go right for the back of

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.390 
might actually go right for the back of
the<00:03:36.599> natural<00:03:36.750> expansion<00:03:37.169> that<00:03:38.099> would<00:03:38.250> be<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
the natural expansion that would be the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.339 
the natural expansion that would be the
best<00:03:38.430> position<00:03:38.730> although<00:03:39.150> he<00:03:39.840> seems<00:03:40.230> like

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
best position although he seems like

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.439 
best position although he seems like
he's<00:03:40.530> going<00:03:40.739> right<00:03:40.980> for<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.190> main<00:03:41.370> he's<00:03:42.209> get

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
he's going right for the main he's get

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.569 
he's going right for the main he's get
spotted<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:43.440> looks<00:03:43.590> like<00:03:43.889> these<00:03:44.040> mutants

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
spotted and it looks like these mutants

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.599 
spotted and it looks like these mutants
okay<00:03:44.879> farfus<00:03:45.599> does<00:03:45.930> have<00:03:46.470> his<00:03:46.799> wits<00:03:47.250> about<00:03:47.400> him

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
okay farfus does have his wits about him

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.879 
okay farfus does have his wits about him
he<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.030> going<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.269> spot<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.810> he<00:03:49.409> probably<00:03:49.650> will

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
he is going to spot and he probably will

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.770 
he is going to spot and he probably will
take<00:03:50.099> out<00:03:50.280> these<00:03:50.639> Marines<00:03:51.180> however<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.690> looks

take out these Marines however it looks

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.939 
take out these Marines however it looks
like<00:03:51.959> Casey<00:03:52.199> might<00:03:52.470> be<00:03:52.560> thinking<00:03:52.799> about<00:03:52.829> a

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
like Casey might be thinking about a

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.159 
like Casey might be thinking about a
frontal<00:03:53.370> attack<00:03:53.489> also<00:03:53.879> while<00:03:54.870> all<00:03:55.019> this<00:03:55.109> is

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
frontal attack also while all this is

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.830 
frontal attack also while all this is
going<00:03:55.290> on<00:03:55.530> okc<00:03:55.979> retreating<00:03:56.459> he<00:03:56.699> is<00:03:56.819> gonna<00:03:57.000> this

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
going on okc retreating he is gonna this

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.780 
going on okc retreating he is gonna this
lose<00:03:58.440> his<00:03:58.590> entire<00:03:58.889> attack<00:03:59.190> force<00:03:59.519> here

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
lose his entire attack force here

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.089 
lose his entire attack force here
without<00:04:00.120> doing<00:04:00.479> any<00:04:00.690> damage<00:04:00.959> five<00:04:01.470> racks<00:04:01.829> is

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
without doing any damage five racks is

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.520 
without doing any damage five racks is
up<00:04:02.280> for<00:04:02.549> Casey<00:04:02.760> Wow<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.540> picking<00:04:04.199> up<00:04:04.319> an

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
up for Casey Wow and picking up an

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.849 
up for Casey Wow and picking up an
expansion<00:04:05.280> finally<00:04:05.849> but<00:04:06.359> this<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.109> definitely

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
expansion finally but this is definitely

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.180 
expansion finally but this is definitely
a<00:04:08.120> almost<00:04:09.120> all<00:04:09.329> in<00:04:09.540> situation<00:04:10.139> if<00:04:10.799> he<00:04:11.069> was

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
a almost all in situation if he was

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.740 
a almost all in situation if he was
playing<00:04:11.430> against<00:04:11.819> a<00:04:11.909> zerg<00:04:11.940> with<00:04:12.359> a<00:04:12.389> stronger

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
playing against a zerg with a stronger

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.149 
playing against a zerg with a stronger
economy<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:13.229> would<00:04:13.349> been<00:04:13.530> an<00:04:13.680> all-in

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
economy it would been an all-in

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.520 
economy it would been an all-in
situation<00:04:14.699> already<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.629> the<00:04:16.019> fact<00:04:16.440> that

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
situation already but the fact that

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.500 
situation already but the fact that
matter<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.829> he<00:04:17.070> has<00:04:17.220> done<00:04:17.430> some<00:04:17.729> damage<00:04:17.760> and

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
matter is he has done some damage and

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.990 
matter is he has done some damage and
and<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:19.650> know<00:04:19.680> he<00:04:19.949> has<00:04:20.099> prevented<00:04:20.430> himself

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
and you know he has prevented himself

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.180 
and you know he has prevented himself
from<00:04:21.180> gain<00:04:21.359> damage<00:04:21.779> which<00:04:21.959> is<00:04:22.109> no<00:04:22.560> small<00:04:22.620> feat

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
from gain damage which is no small feat

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.339 
from gain damage which is no small feat
you<00:04:23.610> know<00:04:23.729> when<00:04:23.849> you<00:04:23.940> don't<00:04:24.150> have<00:04:24.270> turrets<00:04:24.779> but
