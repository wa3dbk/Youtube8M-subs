this thing we needed to get a scrapyard
salvo<00:06:57.480> last<00:06:58.110> turn<00:06:58.740> I<00:06:59.040> think<00:06:59.340> though<00:07:05.240> yeah<00:07:06.240> all

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450 
salvo last turn I think though yeah all

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.910 
salvo last turn I think though yeah all
right<00:07:06.570> I<00:07:06.720> think<00:07:07.170> we<00:07:07.260> can<00:07:07.410> seat<00:07:07.590> here<00:07:07.770> yeah

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:07.920 
right I think we can seat here yeah

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.080 
right I think we can seat here yeah
that's<00:07:08.820> unfortunate<00:07:09.390> er<00:07:09.450> that's<00:07:09.870> unfortunate

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
that's unfortunate er that's unfortunate

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:17.270 
that's unfortunate er that's unfortunate
so<00:07:12.090> let's<00:07:12.510> go<00:07:12.690> to<00:07:12.750> round<00:07:13.140> two<00:07:16.190> what<00:07:17.190> do<00:07:17.250> you

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 
so let's go to round two what do you

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.710 
so let's go to round two what do you
think<00:07:17.370> we<00:07:17.550> bring<00:07:17.790> in<00:07:18.000> for<00:07:18.210> this<00:07:18.300> matchup

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 
think we bring in for this matchup

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.160 
think we bring in for this matchup
definitely<00:07:19.680> the<00:07:19.830> ancient<00:07:20.220> grudges<00:07:20.370> yeah

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.170

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.170 
that scrapyard salvo seems like it's

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.690 
that scrapyard salvo seems like it's
gonna<00:07:34.290> be<00:07:34.440> good<00:07:34.620> though<00:07:34.830> yeah<00:07:35.400> I've<00:07:35.580> late

Double H all white deck steam today so
we<00:07:47.730> can<00:07:47.820> probably<00:07:48.030> take<00:07:48.180> out<00:07:48.330> some<00:07:48.570> faithless

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.170 
we can probably take out some faithless

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.370 
we can probably take out some faithless
looting<00:07:49.410> for<00:07:49.920> aging<00:07:50.250> grudges<00:07:51.110> cuz<00:07:52.110> we<00:07:52.230> don't

really want to lower artifact count that
much<00:07:54.380> data<00:07:55.380> sitting<00:07:55.800> is<00:07:56.280> probably<00:07:58.130> our<00:07:59.130> least

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 
much data sitting is probably our least

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.940 
much data sitting is probably our least
impactful<00:08:00.720> card<00:08:00.990> although<00:08:01.500> we<00:08:01.590> could<00:08:01.740> take
