00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
that because you had a lot of chatter in
this<00:01:45.930> danielle<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.530> start<00:01:46.770> thinking<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
this danielle you start thinking and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.190 
this danielle you start thinking and
what<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.670> I'm<00:01:47.850> some<00:01:48.090> place<00:01:48.299> else<00:01:48.479> may<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.899> other

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
what if I'm some place else may be other

stuff<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> case<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:52.950> all

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
stuff and it's just not the case we all

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.649 
stuff and it's just not the case we all
love<00:01:53.399> them<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.909> all<00:01:54.000> want<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.240> play<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.540> him

especially me
so<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:57.060> tell<00:01:57.270> when<00:01:57.650> young<00:01:58.650> when<00:01:58.770> he's<00:01:58.920> down

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
so I can tell when young when he's down

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.700 
so I can tell when young when he's down
and<00:01:59.400> when<00:02:00.270> enough<00:02:00.510> is<00:02:00.600> enough<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.140> mean<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> think

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and when enough is enough I mean I think

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.160 
and when enough is enough I mean I think
you<00:02:01.800> went<00:02:02.130> through<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> first<00:02:02.580> phase<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.390> you

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
you went through the first phase and you

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.480 
you went through the first phase and you
know<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.410> he<00:02:04.470> kind<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.770> played<00:02:04.980> through<00:02:05.280> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
know and he kind of played through that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.280 
know and he kind of played through that
and<00:02:05.700> came<00:02:05.970> out<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.690> then<00:02:06.810> he<00:02:07.050> gets

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and came out of that and then he gets

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.410 
and came out of that and then he gets
hit<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.530> another<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:08.160> until<00:02:08.670> he's<00:02:08.970> down<00:02:09.180> and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
hit with another one until he's down and

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.639 
hit with another one until he's down and
this<00:02:09.540> is<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> little<00:02:09.930> harder<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.170> overcome<00:02:10.229> we

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
this is a little harder to overcome we

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.650 
this is a little harder to overcome we
got<00:02:10.770> two<00:02:10.920> big<00:02:11.100> games<00:02:11.310> coming<00:02:11.580> up<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.630> want

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
thinking about it he still won't be

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.430 
thinking about it he still won't be
thinking<00:02:15.180> about<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.540> sure<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:15.990> at<00:02:16.170> least<00:02:16.290> he
