and I think what we've kind of realized

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.259 
and I think what we've kind of realized
after<00:00:50.379> all<00:00:50.559> these<00:00:50.799> demos<00:00:51.309> like<00:00:51.580> dozens<00:00:52.120> and

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
after all these demos like dozens and

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.060 
after all these demos like dozens and
dozens<00:00:52.360> of<00:00:52.900> demos<00:00:53.320> is<00:00:54.720> just<00:00:55.720> really<00:00:56.589> capturing

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
dozens of demos is just really capturing

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.560 
dozens of demos is just really capturing
the<00:00:57.250> moment<00:00:57.580> when<00:00:57.729> you're<00:00:57.850> writing<00:00:58.089> and

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
the moment when you're writing and

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.329 
the moment when you're writing and
that's<00:00:59.500> something<00:00:59.680> we're<00:00:59.920> learning<00:01:00.070> as

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
that's something we're learning as

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:01.979 
that's something we're learning as
songwriters<00:01:00.610> that<00:01:00.940> you<00:01:01.299> write<00:01:01.510> something<00:01:01.780> in

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
songwriters that you write something in

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.810 
songwriters that you write something in
a<00:01:02.049> moment<00:01:02.409> it<00:01:02.620> starts<00:01:03.070> with<00:01:03.190> like<00:01:03.309> a<00:01:03.369> folk<00:01:03.610> song

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
a moment it starts with like a folk song

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.820 
a moment it starts with like a folk song
with<00:01:04.119> just<00:01:04.330> a<00:01:04.420> vocal<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:04.930> just<00:01:05.080> guitar<00:01:05.440> and

with just a vocal and just guitar and

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.620 
with just a vocal and just guitar and
then<00:01:06.190> a<00:01:06.220> month<00:01:06.549> later<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:07.119> know<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.299> tore<00:01:07.600> a

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
then a month later you know you tore a

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.000

conviction<00:04:31.470> though<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.250> mean<00:04:32.460> sometimes<00:04:32.970> it's

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
conviction though I mean sometimes it's

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.340 
conviction though I mean sometimes it's
just<00:04:33.360> like<00:04:33.510> you<00:04:33.690> know<00:04:33.810> we'll<00:04:33.960> have<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.140> song

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
that we really believe in and then wait

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.580 
that we really believe in and then wait
five<00:04:36.090> people<00:04:36.450> telling<00:04:36.750> us<00:04:36.840> different<00:04:37.530> things

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
five people telling us different things

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.500 
five people telling us different things
and<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.430> can<00:04:38.640> kind<00:04:38.730> of<00:04:38.820> alter<00:04:39.150> your<00:04:39.360> own

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
and that can kind of alter your own

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.000 
and that can kind of alter your own
opinion<00:04:39.990> in<00:04:40.170> your<00:04:40.260> own<00:04:40.440> belief<00:04:40.740> in<00:04:40.920> yourself

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
opinion in your own belief in yourself

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.860 
opinion in your own belief in yourself
as<00:04:41.400> an<00:04:41.490> artist<00:04:41.640> you<00:04:42.030> start<00:04:42.240> saying<00:04:42.480> doubting

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
as an artist you start saying doubting

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.320 
as an artist you start saying doubting
yourself<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.500> that's<00:04:44.010> that's<00:04:44.880> what<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.150> think

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
yourself and that's that's what I think

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.850 
yourself and that's that's what I think
really<00:04:45.570> interferes<00:04:46.110> with<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.410> vision<00:04:46.710> and

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
really interferes with the vision and

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.220 
really interferes with the vision and
the<00:04:46.980> process<00:04:47.490> so<00:04:48.090> we<00:04:48.180> as<00:04:48.450> this<00:04:48.660> is<00:04:48.930> why<00:04:49.050> it's

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
the process so we as this is why it's

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
the process so we as this is why it's
good<00:04:49.350> we<00:04:49.500> have<00:04:49.620> each<00:04:49.740> other<00:04:49.890> because<00:04:50.130> we
