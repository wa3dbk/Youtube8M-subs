00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:21.239
 what 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.300
 standing 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 we do not want anymore 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.360
 we are now coming to the final stage of building our 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.740
 Publishing house 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.410
 several trades of the second test will have to intervene each to 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.420
 their level in accordance with the rules of art to guarantee a banal 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.620
 air permeability of the Baptist 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.900
 the joiner for the installation of door frames equipped with double glazing 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.860
 that kate acess 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.730
 the plasterer for the laying of the inner insulation consisting of bet Holland 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.880
 ps was constrained by 12 centimeters thick 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.439
 electrician including the installation of airtight enclosures 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.630
 the plumber heating engineer for the installation of gas condensing boiler 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.630
 natural solar water heater as well as the installation of the dual flow vmc 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.610
 and finally the roofer for laying solar collectors 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.880
 once these different jobs are completed the house will have to pass the 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.350
 airtightness test that will determine his house status of 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.630
 biscuits 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.100
 this text makes it possible to measure the airflows infiltrating buildings 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.020
 and to check the air permeability of the magnitude 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.640
 the early leakage flow to be less than 0 6 cubic meter per 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.200
 square meter per pair the luxury house doing a game 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.330
 which is built to encompass tormented which blocks 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.680
 and plasterboard 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.520
 so the measure of reality 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.610
 in front of the elysÃ©e 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.300
 for this study measure 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.300
 the remains of riding so we have a door 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.760
 equipped with a computer 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.780
 and we do more 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.310
 negotiations between inside and outside 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.300
 we make several levels 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
 17 in Paris is greater than 50 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.749
 our relationship 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.749
 your role more than the pill 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.889
 do it and the data 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.159
 in sharp decline by their share surface of cold parents 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:22.929
 in his call 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.419
 we had beaten her the lowest are kidnapped and 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.769
 all surfaces that face the outside 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.379
 the floors must be 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.719
 montreal air permeability measurement of a building 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.679
 this building is labeled bbc effinergie 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.679
 so the value has reached such a degree 06 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.909
 a value of 0 30 euro which was very low 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.169
 this value of 0 32 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.169
 it equates to roughly half the value 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.869
 from entrance to setif 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:56.469
 the documentary to close unanswered 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.449
 with an urgent appeal 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.369
 concerning real estate project 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:05.109
 single-handedly my entry into the rogers cup center a construction and sale 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.339
 the typical city on the one hand and after reflection and exchanges with our 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:11.959
 way we realized that a house had been left summer 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.979
 possible compared to our budget 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:18.379
 actually but in the future we proposed so house bbc so% en bloc 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.839
 concrete 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.569
 of bbc houses low consumption building that will allow us so 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.159
 enable us to save money 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.719
 at the level of the two seas jicha 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.499
 percent that allows me to benefit from a larger tax credit and 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.829
 so a zero rate loan so clearly more important what has 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.829
 allowed the club to realize the project 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:41.179
 it is perfectly possible today by using common materials of 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.929
 nearness economy as usual 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:47.289
 to access energy performance imposed by the label bbc 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:50.289
 effinergie and the next rt 2012 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.250
 the block concrete technical block perfectly illustrates this type of construction that 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:59.299
 meet the challenges of sustainable construction and participate in the reduction of 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.509
 the environmental impact 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.090
 everybody 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.919
 we indign ourselves we want we have to keep ourselves 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:18.069
 On the menu 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.069
 Menongue 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:28.939
 as we do not lead 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.960
 or two years or less
