started out playing point guard I didn't
play<00:01:42.180> any<00:01:42.360> position<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.020> really

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
play any position but that really

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.330 
play any position but that really
and<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.850> grown<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.990> my<00:01:46.170> teammate<00:01:47.159> in

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and I just grown with my teammate in

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.550 
and I just grown with my teammate in
high<00:01:47.490> school<00:01:47.790> Terrence<00:01:48.150> Ross<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.140> won<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
high school Terrence Ross and we won a

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.289 
high school Terrence Ross and we won a
state<00:01:50.070> championship<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.850> then<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.030> want<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
state championship and then I want to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.719 
state championship and then I want to
after<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.380> was<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.740> great<00:01:53.340> high<00:01:53.490> school

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
after that so it was a great high school

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.730 
after that so it was a great high school
career<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.659> fact<00:01:54.900> you're<00:01:55.080> a<00:01:55.140> left-hander

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
career the fact you're a left-hander

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.380 
career the fact you're a left-hander
does<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.190> still<00:01:56.430> sneak<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.970> people<00:01:57.299> even

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
does that still sneak up on people even

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.600 
does that still sneak up on people even
in<00:01:57.570> these<00:01:57.690> workouts<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.490> little

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
in these workouts I think it's a little

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.330 
in these workouts I think it's a little
different<00:01:59.820> guarding<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> left-handed<00:02:00.780> player

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
different guarding a left-handed player

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
different guarding a left-handed player
but<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.700> try<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.940> do<00:02:03.720> do<00:02:04.080> me<00:02:04.289> and<00:02:04.470> just<00:02:04.619> take

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
but I just try to do do me and just take

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.920 
but I just try to do do me and just take
what<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> defense<00:02:05.009> gives<00:02:05.490> me<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.940> caught<00:02:06.780> up

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
what the defense gives me I caught up

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.749 
what the defense gives me I caught up
with<00:02:06.960> Tony<00:02:07.170> Wroten<00:02:07.500> jr.<00:02:07.920> after<00:02:08.130> his<00:02:08.459> Golden

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
with Tony Wroten jr. after his Golden

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.760 
with Tony Wroten jr. after his Golden
State<00:02:08.970> workout<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.539> you're<00:02:10.200> from<00:02:10.410> Portland

Oregon<00:02:10.860> what<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.760> with<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> Pacific

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
Oregon what is it with the Pacific

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.080 
Oregon what is it with the Pacific
Northwest's<00:02:13.020> like<00:02:13.200> an<00:02:13.350> NBA<00:02:13.920> pipeline<00:02:14.489> yeah<00:02:15.060> I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
Northwest's like an NBA pipeline yeah I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.720 
Northwest's like an NBA pipeline yeah I
mean<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.540> think<00:02:15.630> we<00:02:16.620> really<00:02:16.920> get<00:02:17.250> after<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.640> up

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
mean I think we really get after it up

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.880 
mean I think we really get after it up
there<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.120> really<00:02:18.300> work<00:02:18.450> hard<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.709> try

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
there and really work hard and just try

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.710 
there and really work hard and just try
to<00:02:19.920> reach<00:02:20.160> our<00:02:20.310> dreams<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.000> do<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.540> by

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
to reach our dreams and we do that by

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.690 
to reach our dreams and we do that by
just<00:02:21.750> staying<00:02:22.140> together<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.650> think<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.010> North

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
just staying together I think the North

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.490 
just staying together I think the North
West<00:02:23.910> really<00:02:24.150> stays<00:02:24.420> together<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.080> you'll

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
West really stays together and you'll
