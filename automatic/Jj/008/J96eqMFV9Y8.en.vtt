00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
tricky section because there's quite a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.000 
tricky section because there's quite a
few<00:00:35.449> guys<00:00:35.720> hiding<00:00:36.050> in<00:00:36.440> those<00:00:36.589> warehouses<00:00:39.010> so

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
sure that you kill all them before you

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.299 
sure that you kill all them before you
run<00:00:43.220> through<00:00:47.590> but<00:00:48.590> there's<00:00:48.769> one<00:00:48.949> part<00:00:49.160> at<00:00:49.250> the

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
run through but there's one part at the

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.349 
run through but there's one part at the
end<00:00:49.370> of<00:00:49.460> this<00:00:49.550> level<00:00:49.820> that<00:00:49.910> I<00:00:50.000> just<00:00:50.179> absolutely

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
end of this level that I just absolutely

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.910 
end of this level that I just absolutely
love<00:00:50.960> that's<00:00:51.379> really<00:00:52.250> fun<00:00:52.579> that<00:00:53.149> uh<00:00:53.179> I<00:00:53.920> didn't

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
love that's really fun that uh I didn't

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.900 
love that's really fun that uh I didn't
figure<00:00:55.219> out<00:00:55.339> until<00:00:56.559> like<00:00:57.559> my<00:00:57.739> third<00:00:58.609> time

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
figure out until like my third time

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.869 
figure out until like my third time
playing<00:00:59.269> through<00:00:59.480> this<00:00:59.600> level<00:01:00.640> just<00:01:01.640> kind<00:01:01.850> of

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
playing through this level just kind of

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.639 
playing through this level just kind of
an<00:01:02.269> idea<00:01:02.480> that<00:01:02.749> pops<00:01:02.899> into<00:01:03.050> my<00:01:03.140> head<00:01:03.170> you'll

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
an idea that pops into my head you'll

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:12.060 
an idea that pops into my head you'll
see<00:01:03.859> it<00:01:03.949> in<00:01:03.980> a<00:01:04.100> second

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.950 

so<00:01:12.670> even<00:01:12.909> though<00:01:12.940> you're<00:01:13.120> using<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.480> silenced

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
so even though you're using a silenced

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.010 
so even though you're using a silenced
m4<00:01:14.380> right<00:01:14.590> here<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:16.180> enemy<00:01:16.420> is<00:01:16.450> still<00:01:16.720> know

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
m4 right here the enemy is still know

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.840 
m4 right here the enemy is still know
exactly<00:01:17.530> where<00:01:17.650> you<00:01:17.770> are<00:01:17.800> including<00:01:18.640> some

exactly where you are including some

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.090 
exactly where you are including some
dogs<00:01:19.120> which<00:01:19.780> is<00:01:19.930> a<00:01:19.960> pain<00:01:20.410> in<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.560> ass<00:01:20.740> you've

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
dogs which is a pain in the ass you've

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.580 
dogs which is a pain in the ass you've
got<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.550> kill<00:01:21.729> these<00:01:21.880> guys<00:01:21.940> quickly<00:01:22.479> but<00:01:23.470> your

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
got to kill these guys quickly but your

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.750 
got to kill these guys quickly but your
teammates<00:01:23.920> actually<00:01:24.160> did<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.340> for<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:24.580> there

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
teammates actually did it for you there

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.550 
teammates actually did it for you there
but<00:01:25.000> if<00:01:25.180> they<00:01:25.300> didn't<00:01:25.630> when<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.320> hear<00:01:26.440> those

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
but if they didn't when you hear those

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.500 
but if they didn't when you hear those
dogs<00:01:26.830> barking<00:01:27.280> at<00:01:27.369> you<00:01:27.490> just<00:01:28.000> get<00:01:28.180> ready<00:01:28.390> to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
dogs barking at you just get ready to

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.080 
dogs barking at you just get ready to
start<00:01:28.840> shooting<00:01:29.290> because<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:30.430> do<00:01:30.520> not<00:01:30.790> want

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
start shooting because you do not want

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.180 
start shooting because you do not want
those<00:01:31.240> dogs<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.750> jump<00:01:31.780> on<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.170> they're<00:01:32.619> really

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
those dogs to jump on you they're really

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.219 
those dogs to jump on you they're really
really<00:01:33.520> hard<00:01:33.790> to<00:01:33.940> fend<00:01:34.150> off<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.869> actually<00:01:38.140> get

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
really hard to fend off you actually get

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.219 
really hard to fend off you actually get
an<00:01:38.290> achievement<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:39.780> breaking<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.840> next<00:01:41.140> of

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
an achievement for breaking the next of

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.050 
an achievement for breaking the next of
one<00:01:41.350> of<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.500> dogs<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:45.700> an<00:01:45.789> achievement

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
one of the dogs and it's an achievement

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.490 
one of the dogs and it's an achievement
because<00:01:46.240> it's<00:01:46.509> actually<00:01:46.630> much<00:01:46.930> harder<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.350> do

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
because it's actually much harder to do

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.980 
because it's actually much harder to do
than<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.770> would<00:01:47.890> think<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:49.450> really<00:01:49.720> hard<00:01:49.869> to

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
than you would think it's really hard to

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.660 
than you would think it's really hard to
time<00:01:50.229> when<00:01:50.560> you<00:01:50.649> need<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.800> press<00:01:51.009> P<00:01:53.670> enemy

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
time when you need to press P enemy

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.840 
time when you need to press P enemy
neutralized<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:56.170> counter<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.220> dogs<00:01:57.430> attacks

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
neutralized to counter the dogs attacks

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.240 
neutralized to counter the dogs attacks
I<00:01:58.030> guess<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.300> can<00:01:58.450> say<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:59.200> after<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.740> clear

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
I guess you can say so after you clear

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.540 
I guess you can say so after you clear
out<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.880> base<00:02:01.060> or<00:02:01.420> at<00:02:02.140> least<00:02:02.289> what<00:02:02.530> looks<00:02:03.460> to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
out the base or at least what looks to

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.520 
out the base or at least what looks to
be<00:02:03.670> clear<00:02:04.030> there's<00:02:04.930> me<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.080> couple<00:02:05.259> trucks

your c4 as soon as the kilo for Foxtrot

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.270 
your c4 as soon as the kilo for Foxtrot
says<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.200> trucks<00:02:14.440> are<00:02:14.560> coming<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.920> start
