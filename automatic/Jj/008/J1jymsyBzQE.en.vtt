options and a deep weak side option and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.280 
options and a deep weak side option and
then<00:00:33.090> we're<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.750> center<00:00:34.050> is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
then we're going to have the center is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.889 
then we're going to have the center is
going<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.590> curl<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.610> direction<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.510> puck<00:00:36.719> is

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
going to curl the direction the puck is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.709 
going to curl the direction the puck is
going<00:00:36.989> for<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> secondary<00:00:38.040> passing<00:00:38.610> option<00:00:39.000> so

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
going for a secondary passing option so

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.500 
going for a secondary passing option so
in<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.960> case<00:00:40.399> with<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> puck<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:42.000> D<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.239> D

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
in this case with the puck going D to D

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.260 
in this case with the puck going D to D
from<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
from here to here what we have is the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.810 
from here to here what we have is the
option<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.960> puck<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.890> come<00:00:47.129> right<00:00:47.670> up

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
option for that puck to come right up

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.779 
option for that puck to come right up
here<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.559> right<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> left<00:00:50.399> winger

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
here to that right to the left winger

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.619 
here to that right to the left winger
and<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.660> again<00:00:52.230> right<00:00:53.100> back<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.210> Center

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and then again right back to that Center

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.410 
and then again right back to that Center
coming<00:00:54.870> through<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> middle<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> one

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
coming through the middle so this is one

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.439 
coming through the middle so this is one
simple<00:00:58.350> simple<00:00:58.739> option<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.879> doesn't<00:01:00.239> require

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
simple simple option it doesn't require

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.529 
simple simple option it doesn't require
a<00:01:00.539> whole<00:01:00.719> lot<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.820> whole<00:01:02.820> lot<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.210> thinking

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
a whole lot of a whole lot of thinking

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.200 
a whole lot of a whole lot of thinking
to<00:01:04.290> execute<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:05.850> very<00:01:06.000> effective

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
to execute but it's very effective

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.240 
to execute but it's very effective
because<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.840> gives<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> d<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> quick<00:01:07.830> strong

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
because it gives the d a quick strong

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.090 
because it gives the d a quick strong
side<00:01:08.549> outlet<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:10.229> next<00:01:10.560> option<00:01:10.890> we're<00:01:10.979> going

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
side outlet the next option we're going

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.340 
side outlet the next option we're going
to<00:01:11.159> show<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.960> we're<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.140> show<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
to show you is we're going to show you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.460 
to show you is we're going to show you
the<00:01:13.860> double<00:01:14.220> curl<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> double<00:01:15.180> curl<00:01:15.470> you

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the double curl so the double curl you

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.130 
the double curl so the double curl you
can<00:01:16.500> essentially<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.600> both<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:18.840> strong

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
can essentially have both your strong

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.280 
can essentially have both your strong
side<00:01:19.409> options<00:01:19.950> swinging<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.630> instead<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.170> in

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
side options swinging so instead of in

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.390 
side options swinging so instead of in
the<00:01:22.380> last<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.799> where<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.220> had<00:01:23.369> our

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the last one where we just had our

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.070 
the last one where we just had our
Center<00:01:23.850> swinging<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.750> our<00:01:24.869> left

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
Center swinging we can have our left

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.210 
Center swinging we can have our left
wing<00:01:25.259> swing<00:01:25.619> here<00:01:26.180> just<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.240> little<00:01:27.540> bit<00:01:27.780> more

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
wing swing here just a little bit more

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.890 
wing swing here just a little bit more
okay<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.310> you're<00:01:29.549> swinging<00:01:29.939> through<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
okay so you're swinging through here and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.280 
okay so you're swinging through here and
our<00:01:31.500> Center<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.860> gonna<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> same<00:01:32.640> thing

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
our Center is gonna do the same thing

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.560 
our Center is gonna do the same thing
he's<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.320> gonna<00:01:34.619> swing<00:01:34.950> down<00:01:35.450> towards<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
he's just gonna swing down towards the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.600 
he's just gonna swing down towards the
wall<00:01:37.909> this<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.090> gonna<00:01:39.240> drop<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:41.340> now

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
wall this is gonna drop in and now

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.060 
wall this is gonna drop in and now
you've<00:01:41.820> got<00:01:42.090> two<00:01:42.840> forwards<00:01:43.320> moving<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
you've got two forwards moving here a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.730 
you've got two forwards moving here a
lot<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.060> times<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.350> scenario

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
lot of times in this in this scenario

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.340 
lot of times in this in this scenario
the<00:01:47.460> weak<00:01:47.670> side<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.540> weak<00:01:48.689> side<00:01:48.869> wing<00:01:49.110> can

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the weak side the weak side wing can

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.289 
the weak side the weak side wing can
just<00:01:49.530> post<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.979> strong<00:01:50.310> side<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.119> head

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
just post up strong side and then head

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
Center swing through and we'll loop him

up<00:02:44.579> here<00:02:44.879> just<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.209> little<00:02:45.390> bit<00:02:45.629> more<00:02:46.400> drag<00:02:47.400> the

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
up here just a little bit more drag the

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.520 
up here just a little bit more drag the
line<00:02:47.700> down<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> little<00:02:49.519> about<00:02:50.519> there<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:52.470> you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
line down a little about there so you

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.379 
line down a little about there so you
would<00:02:52.799> have<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.190> strong<00:02:53.489> side<00:02:53.760> outlet<00:02:54.150> here

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
would have the strong side outlet here

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.180 
would have the strong side outlet here
but<00:02:54.870> what<00:02:54.989> we're<00:02:55.079> gonna<00:02:55.170> do<00:02:55.440> with<00:02:55.590> our<00:02:55.829> with

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
but what we're gonna do with our with

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.129 
but what we're gonna do with our with
our<00:02:56.220> right<00:02:56.579> wing<00:02:56.879> is<00:02:57.150> we're<00:02:57.569> gonna<00:02:57.690> keep<00:02:57.930> him

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
our right wing is we're gonna keep him

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.470 
our right wing is we're gonna keep him
as<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.409> stretch<00:02:58.769> option<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.519> what<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.180> mean<00:03:00.359> by

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
as a stretch option so what I mean by

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.149 
as a stretch option so what I mean by
that<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.959> he's<00:03:01.139> essentially<00:03:01.620> gonna<00:03:01.829> kind<00:03:02.099> of

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
that is he's essentially gonna kind of

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.619 
that is he's essentially gonna kind of
skate<00:03:02.430> out<00:03:02.579> towards<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.940> play<00:03:03.090> support<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
skate out towards the play support the

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.229 
skate out towards the play support the
play<00:03:03.810> at<00:03:03.959> first<00:03:04.670> but<00:03:05.670> then<00:03:05.819> he's<00:03:05.940> gonna<00:03:06.030> hit

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
play at first but then he's gonna hit

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.210 
play at first but then he's gonna hit
the<00:03:06.389> brakes<00:03:06.659> and<00:03:06.989> he's<00:03:07.590> gonna<00:03:07.709> look<00:03:07.950> for<00:03:08.010> a

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
the brakes and he's gonna look for a

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.490 
the brakes and he's gonna look for a
middle<00:03:08.489> seam<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.180> way<00:03:09.299> he<00:03:09.420> does<00:03:09.629> that<00:03:09.870> he

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
middle seam and the way he does that he

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.710 
middle seam and the way he does that he
comes<00:03:10.709> through<00:03:10.799> here<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.459> then<00:03:12.090> cuts<00:03:12.480> out

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
comes through here and then cuts out

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.740 
comes through here and then cuts out
deep<00:03:13.319> across<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.459> blue<00:03:14.700> line<00:03:14.970> so

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
deep across this blue line so

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.360 
deep across this blue line so
essentially<00:03:16.260> what<00:03:16.410> you're<00:03:16.560> looking<00:03:16.919> for<00:03:17.160> is

the advantages with this particular
neutral<00:03:30.449> zone<00:03:30.629> play<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:31.079> that<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:32.099> can<00:03:32.280> catch

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
neutral zone play is that you can catch

behind<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.699> defenseman<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.419> get<00:03:42.569> in<00:03:42.690> for<00:03:42.900> a

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
behind the defenseman and get in for a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.479 
behind the defenseman and get in for a
quick<00:03:43.139> break<00:03:43.410> away<00:03:43.709> or<00:03:43.889> at<00:03:43.980> least<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.280> good

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
quick break away or at least a good

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.539 
quick break away or at least a good
scoring<00:03:44.879> opportunity<00:03:45.629> it<00:03:46.319> also<00:03:46.500> forces<00:03:47.310> the

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
scoring opportunity it also forces the

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.000 
scoring opportunity it also forces the
defense<00:03:47.849> when<00:03:48.060> they<00:03:48.090> have<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.769> much<00:03:49.769> tougher

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
defense when they have a much tougher

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.150 
defense when they have a much tougher
gap<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.730> play<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:52.349> is<00:03:52.500> one<00:03:52.709> option

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
gap to play so this is one option

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.530 
gap to play so this is one option
the<00:03:53.370> last<00:03:53.579> option<00:03:53.849> we're<00:03:54.150> going<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.329> show<00:03:54.480> you

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
the last option we're going to show you

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.629 
the last option we're going to show you
here<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.440> going<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.739> be<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:56.069> strong<00:03:56.340> side

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
here is going to be the strong side

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.939 
here is going to be the strong side
stretch<00:03:57.000> which<00:03:57.449> is<00:03:57.659> it's<00:03:58.199> a<00:03:58.319> similar<00:03:58.709> concept

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
stretch which is it's a similar concept

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.069 
stretch which is it's a similar concept
again<00:03:59.609> you<00:03:59.790> can<00:03:59.940> have<00:04:00.120> your<00:04:00.329> right<00:04:00.540> wing<00:04:00.840> and

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
again you can have your right wing and

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.430 
again you can have your right wing and
your<00:04:01.709> Center<00:04:02.040> on<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.370> in<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:02.909> case<00:04:03.440> swinging

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
your Center on the in this case swinging

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.649 
your Center on the in this case swinging
wherever<00:04:04.709> you'd<00:04:04.889> like<00:04:04.919> but<00:04:05.609> we're<00:04:06.480> going<00:04:06.569> to

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
wherever you'd like but we're going to

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.599 
wherever you'd like but we're going to
change<00:04:06.930> our<00:04:07.139> left<00:04:07.379> wing<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:08.069> essentially<00:04:08.489> do

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
change our left wing to essentially do

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.780 
change our left wing to essentially do
that<00:04:08.790> same<00:04:09.060> route<00:04:09.359> that<00:04:10.229> the<00:04:10.650> other<00:04:10.889> that<00:04:11.639> the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
that same route that the other that the

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.909 
that same route that the other that the
right<00:04:11.940> wing<00:04:12.090> did<00:04:12.359> in<00:04:12.449> our<00:04:12.510> last<00:04:12.750> one<00:04:13.109> so<00:04:13.799> he's

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
right wing did in our last one so he's

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.140 
right wing did in our last one so he's
going<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.099> come<00:04:14.280> in<00:04:14.459> through<00:04:14.489> here

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
going to come in through here

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.300 
going to come in through here
he's<00:04:16.049> gonna<00:04:16.199> hit<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.500> brakes<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.070> he's<00:04:17.190> going

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
he's gonna hit the brakes and he's going

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.219 
he's gonna hit the brakes and he's going
to<00:04:17.400> hit<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:17.699> seam<00:04:17.970> again<00:04:18.180> across<00:04:18.599> this<00:04:18.989> blue

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
to hit this seam again across this blue

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.879 
to hit this seam again across this blue
line<00:04:19.469> so<00:04:20.459> it's<00:04:20.639> far<00:04:20.969> out<00:04:21.650> looking<00:04:22.650> for<00:04:22.680> a

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
line so it's far out looking for a

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.670 
line so it's far out looking for a
stretch<00:04:23.190> pass<00:04:23.490> here

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
stretch pass here

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.570 
stretch pass here
and<00:04:25.870> again<00:04:26.870> centers<00:04:27.350> can<00:04:27.530> curl<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:28.130> lot<00:04:28.460> of

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
and again centers can curl a lot of

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.280 
and again centers can curl a lot of
times<00:04:28.759> centers<00:04:29.180> will<00:04:29.270> just<00:04:29.419> curl<00:04:29.630> strong<00:04:29.990> side

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
times centers will just curl strong side

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.050 
times centers will just curl strong side
on<00:04:30.500> this<00:04:30.650> on<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:31.610> particular<00:04:31.820> rush<00:04:34.060> bring

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
on this on this particular rush bring

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.810 
on this on this particular rush bring
them<00:04:35.180> through<00:04:35.449> here<00:04:35.750> along<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.199> wall<00:04:36.699> just<00:04:37.699> to

them through here along the wall just to

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.540 
them through here along the wall just to
kind<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.360> see<00:04:38.630> where<00:04:39.560> exactly<00:04:39.620> he<00:04:40.340> would<00:04:40.460> be

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
kind of see where exactly he would be

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.740 
kind of see where exactly he would be
going<00:04:41.530> right-wing<00:04:42.789> again<00:04:43.789> they<00:04:44.150> can<00:04:44.330> post<00:04:44.509> up

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
going right-wing again they can post up

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.330 
going right-wing again they can post up
for<00:04:45.460> for<00:04:46.460> a<00:04:46.490> deep<00:04:46.699> option<00:04:47.240> for<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.509> D<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:47.900> case

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
for for a deep option for the D in case

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.800 
for for a deep option for the D in case
case<00:04:49.340> they<00:04:49.550> need<00:04:49.759> that<00:04:49.970> but<00:04:50.210> essentially<00:04:50.570> what

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
case they need that but essentially what

you're<00:04:50.930> looking<00:04:51.259> at<00:04:51.380> here<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:52.509> typically

you're looking at here is typically
you're<00:04:53.990> going<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.169> have<00:04:54.320> a<00:04:54.350> defenseman<00:04:54.860> who's

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
you're going to have a defenseman who's

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.430 
you're going to have a defenseman who's
trying<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.520> force<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:56.150> play<00:04:56.389> up<00:04:56.720> on<00:04:57.080> the

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
strong side so in this case that strong

strong side so in this case that strong
set<00:05:01.340> options<00:05:01.699> going<00:05:02.000> hopefully<00:05:02.720> getting<00:05:02.930> that

set options going hopefully getting that

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.159
