00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.509 
on top of the deck to hide the double
lift<00:02:24.150> say<00:02:24.780> was<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.200> your<00:02:25.410> card<00:02:25.519> obviously

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
lift say was this your card obviously

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.490

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
going to be right under it face up

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.830 
going to be right under it face up
because<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.750> double<00:02:31.140> lift<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:33.390> now<00:02:33.569> once

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840
