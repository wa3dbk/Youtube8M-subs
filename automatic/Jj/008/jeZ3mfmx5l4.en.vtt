00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.130 
hard to do and this will this will
strengthen<00:00:53.060> again<00:00:54.060> the<00:00:54.240> spine<00:00:54.630> the<00:00:54.960> inner

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
strengthen again the spine the inner

tendon ligaments around it and that's

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.740 
tendon ligaments around it and that's
what<00:00:59.340> keeps<00:00:59.490> it<00:00:59.670> strong<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:00.420> keep<00:01:00.600> it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
movements to recored innate my recording

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.870 
movements to recored innate my recording
my<00:01:18.290> my<00:01:19.290> abdominals<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.369> strengthened<00:01:20.760> him

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
my my abdominals and it strengthened him

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.920 
my my abdominals and it strengthened him

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.520 
this way well then she'll pull it back
so<00:02:15.120> she<00:02:15.420> always<00:02:15.660> checks<00:02:15.989> herself

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
so she always checks herself

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.590 
so she always checks herself
then<00:02:16.950> she<00:02:17.130> puts<00:02:17.489> her<00:02:17.580> head<00:02:17.760> down<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.180> counts

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
then she puts her head down and counts

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.690 
then she puts her head down and counts
to<00:02:18.720> five<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.410> then<00:02:19.680> when<00:02:19.920> she<00:02:20.070> counts<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.459> five

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
to five and then when she counts to five

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.750 
to five and then when she counts to five
then<00:02:21.450> she'll<00:02:21.750> roll<00:02:21.959> shimmy<00:02:22.950> back<00:02:23.100> over<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
then she'll roll shimmy back over to the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.090 
then she'll roll shimmy back over to the
other<00:02:23.850> side<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.560> stabilize<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.680> other<00:02:25.860> side

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
other side and stabilize that other side

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.830 
other side and stabilize that other side
and<00:02:26.340> we<00:02:26.430> usually<00:02:26.730> do<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.299> a<00:02:27.330> minute<00:02:27.420> to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
and we usually do this for a minute to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.539 
and we usually do this for a minute to
two<00:02:28.019> minutes<00:02:28.380> with<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> minute<00:02:28.980> or<00:02:29.100> two<00:02:29.280> minute

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
two minutes with a minute or two minute

two minutes with a minute or two minute
rest<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.970> between<00:02:30.330> there's<00:02:31.080> nothing<00:02:31.440> there's

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
rest in between there's nothing there's

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.500 
rest in between there's nothing there's
no<00:02:31.860> speed<00:02:32.250> about<00:02:32.549> this<00:02:32.760> thing<00:02:33.000> there's<00:02:33.360> no

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
no speed about this thing there's no

no speed about this thing there's no
strength<00:02:34.110> about<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.709> nothing<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.340> all

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
strength about this nothing it's all

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.030 
strength about this nothing it's all
about<00:02:36.110> strengthening<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.470> coordinating

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
about strengthening and coordinating

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.630 
about strengthening and coordinating
that<00:02:38.220> lower<00:02:38.489> or<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.780> abdominals<00:02:40.080> and

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
that lower or the abdominals and

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.699 
that lower or the abdominals and
strengthening<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.230> stability<00:02:43.230> muscles

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
strengthening the stability muscles

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.360 
strengthening the stability muscles
that's<00:02:44.250> fine<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:45.810> one<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.469> very<00:02:46.859> good

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
that's fine and this one is very good

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.849 
that's fine and this one is very good
for<00:02:47.959> for<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> lot<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.230> water<00:02:49.409> processors

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
for for a lot of water processors

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.140 
for for a lot of water processors
because<00:02:49.980> again<00:02:50.280> they<00:02:50.430> don't<00:02:50.519> have<00:02:50.849> that

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
because again they don't have that

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.910 
because again they don't have that
strength<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.719> that<00:02:51.750> lower<00:02:52.079> abdominals<00:02:52.739> and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
strength in that lower abdominals and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.610 
strength in that lower abdominals and
this<00:02:53.069> is<00:02:53.219> the<00:02:53.340> problem<00:02:53.840> why<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.900> bike<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.439> me

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
this is the problem why the bike to me

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.740 
this is the problem why the bike to me
rides<00:02:56.129> them<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.060> throws<00:02:57.480> them<00:02:57.629> around

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
rides them in and throws them around

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.410 
rides them in and throws them around
because<00:02:58.379> where<00:02:59.010> there's<00:02:59.310> separation<00:02:59.909> there's

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
because where there's separation there's

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.410 
because where there's separation there's
no<00:03:00.599> strength<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.769> what<00:03:02.400> they<00:03:02.519> do<00:03:02.579> is<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.209> shut

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
no strength so what they do is just shut

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.920 
no strength so what they do is just shut
it<00:03:03.450> off<00:03:03.689> by<00:03:04.159> by<00:03:05.159> tucking<00:03:05.790> there<00:03:06.120> but<00:03:06.299> when<00:03:06.810> you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
it off by by tucking there but when you

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.300 
it off by by tucking there but when you
tuck<00:03:07.139> your<00:03:07.170> butt<00:03:07.469> then<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.769> take<00:03:07.950> out<00:03:08.099> that

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
tuck your butt then you take out that

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.069 
tuck your butt then you take out that
separation<00:03:08.819> it's<00:03:09.180> like<00:03:09.329> welding<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.810> front

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
separation it's like welding the front

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.539 
separation it's like welding the front
end<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.439> rear<00:03:10.650> end<00:03:10.799> of<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:10.980> motorcycle

end to the rear end of the motorcycle

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.009 
end to the rear end of the motorcycle
you<00:03:11.730> have<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:12.120> have<00:03:12.269> separation<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.959> the

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
you have to have separation of the

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.929 
you have to have separation of the
motorcycle<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:14.010> have<00:03:14.189> to<00:03:14.340> have<00:03:14.459> separation

motorcycle you have to have separation

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:15.710 
motorcycle you have to have separation
in<00:03:15.209> two<00:03:15.329> hips

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
in two hips

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.020 
in two hips
that's<00:03:16.169> why<00:03:16.319> Bubba<00:03:16.620> rides<00:03:17.129> with<00:03:17.310> his<00:03:17.459> butt<00:03:17.669> out

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
that's why Bubba rides with his butt out

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.119 
that's why Bubba rides with his butt out
that's<00:03:18.419> why<00:03:18.540> Ricky<00:03:18.840> Charmichael<00:03:19.379> does<00:03:19.560> that's

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
that's why Ricky Charmichael does that's

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.690 
that's why Ricky Charmichael does that's
why<00:03:20.370> now<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:20.609> see<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.629> canard<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.769> also

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
why now you see a canard and also

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.670 
why now you see a canard and also
Villopoto<00:03:24.419> does<00:03:24.659> a<00:03:24.689> little<00:03:24.900> bit<00:03:25.109> straight

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
Villopoto does a little bit straight

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.800 
Villopoto does a little bit straight
back<00:03:25.889> hips<00:03:26.400> out<00:03:26.639> there's<00:03:27.000> separation<00:03:27.480> and

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
back hips out there's separation and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.809 
back hips out there's separation and
that's<00:03:28.379> that<00:03:28.650> next<00:03:28.919> level<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.280> speed<00:03:29.609> that

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
that's that next level of speed that

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:40.069 
that's that next level of speed that
people<00:03:30.180> can't<00:03:30.840> get<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:38.030> very<00:03:39.030> good<00:03:39.299> very<00:03:39.750> good

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
people can't get to very good very good

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.409 
people can't get to very good very good
so<00:03:40.500> again<00:03:40.769> nothing<00:03:41.069> too<00:03:41.370> exciting<00:03:41.700> nothing

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
too exciting and all but it's very

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.599 
too exciting and all but it's very
