00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.630
 but here are the new luxury of 34 and 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.510
 they are ready now 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.920
 the pilot sergei be badÃ­n said also 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.200
 is able to reach targets with the 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.090
 maximum precision from different 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.849
 types of maneuver under any 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.890
 weather condition and be day or 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.550
 Even though it's a two-seater but it's not 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.990
 so from one car next to the other the most 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.310
 recent generations of aircraft 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.460
 attack and sukhoi fighter-bomber 34 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.700
 arrived in the Rostov region there will be 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.620
 placed in service 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.740
 IUC today has a capacity for maneuver 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.830
 much wider than any other 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.940
 model a ceiling of 15,000 meters and a 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.129
 7,000 km distance range 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.640
 it differs from its predecessors of 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.379
 there are 34 luxury due to its greater reach 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.460
 new navigation equipment and its new 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.460
 weapons control system 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.090
 also has one of the largest 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.500
 flight covers of any aircraft of 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.740
 attack what allows the crew 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.229
 sit side by side as we saw 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.420
 and not in tandem and even stand up 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.420
 in combat flights especially 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.130
 long 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.049
 will be to come from the theater of 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.420
 operations because in combat nothing 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.770
 better than the seat belt well 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.439
 adjusted but it does not stop being interesting 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.830
 this new jewel of the panoply of the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.830
 Russian military vision 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.930
 meanwhile at a more earthly level 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.530
 things are still happening in ukraine already 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.530
 we will tell you 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.920
 d 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.720
 this is the pilot series and it says also 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.330
 is able to reach targets with 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.390
 true maximum precision 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.070
 and on any type of maneuvers not 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.160
 it has to be in a configuration in 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.470
 a proper position and can do it 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.550
 under any weather condition and 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.550
 day or night 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.069
 an interesting display rarely 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.400
 I had seen this model and for something 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.400
 they are showing 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.530
 the new generation of fighter pilots and 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.930
 of combat that are prepared for this 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.090
 unusual high performance model like 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.519
 fighter plane but where the pilots 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.050
 they go not in tandem one after the other 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.200
 but next to each other 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.300
 it is not often that they show the 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.310
 bionic clear that here is disconnected 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.940
 but as well as old instruments 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.160
 Analogs are also the new ones 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.380
 this bomber cause says other pilots 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.810
 of difference from their predecessors because 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.480
 at its greatest reach new teams of 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.200
 totally new navigation system 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.879
 gun control 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.270
 and has one of the largest 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.340
 flight decks 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.090
 that is, he was referring to that bad 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.239
 translation to the cabin 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.300
 that cabin on long trips to go 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.980
 or come from a theater operations up 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.830
 allows you to stand inside it 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.080
 quite wide nonetheless maneuver and 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.890
 behaves like any airplane 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.050
 last generation combat 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.730
 the interesting thing is the form of power 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.480
 interact side by side pilot and 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.350
 co-pilot and in terms of its power and its 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.670
 and its climb ratio and so 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.670
 skill is impeccable
