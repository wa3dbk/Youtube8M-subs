 united states will ask for a clarification of geophysics I do not think also that 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.650
 There is one of the first states that formed this noble country 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.460
 in a desire he fought for the freedom of people who wanted 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.410
 express your freedom in your religion in it your political ideas 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.580
 percent

 in good food and the Latinos we fight every day for our 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.990
 freedom also insists 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.830
 Of course I do love religious 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.910
 we want to transmit 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.860
 I like what I do and as 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.500
 a lot that 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.350
 and that this hot chili up here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.590
 I like to be difficult 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.010
 well I did not do something that I'm going to do ohl 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.520
 I could not go to a poor country 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.810

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.810
 that I have a very big emotion to go to that game 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.310
 who goes with those who choose will win or happy 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.479
 it looks obvious that if we do not have the feeling in activists like the workshop 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.250
 Puerto Rican 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.290
 from which they are concerned with organizing our concepts our values 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.900
 our cultural wealth 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.440
 nothing really happened in a country or in a city as wonderful as an entity 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.190
 own 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.190
 the Puerto Rican workshop has an impact that will continue to grow 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.290
 keep helping on what is based 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.330
 and feeling its repercussions through the years 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.929
 They inspire me 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:17.989
 neither Latinos nor Latinos living in the United States inspire me 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.199
 because we work more than anyone 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:25.079
 because we are more creative than anyone because we have more hope and faith than 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:25.869
 no one 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:29.209
 they inspire me every day to be what I was 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.290
 continue like this 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.309
 filipe this magnitude is to feel the pulse 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.589
