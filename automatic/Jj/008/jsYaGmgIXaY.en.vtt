00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.950
 objective of this video is to present the 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.730
 activity that we are going to do in the module 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.820
 1 the activity that is innovation 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.800
 educational usually practically the 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.710
 Most of the courses were focused on another 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.840
 type starts with a definition 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.600
 a definition of the subject of the course 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.599
 That definition is usually almost 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.370
 solemn full and also gives enough 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.620
 clues about what will be the 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.199
 course content as evidently 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.000
 the posts the definition has to 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.550
 be in accordance with what subsequently 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.610
 is going to develop in the course in this 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.559
 case we are not going to give that is a 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.120
 definition of educational innovation what 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.360
 what are we going to do is you are going to look 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.850
 on the internet in forums on articles in 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.320
 books where you want a definition of 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.540
 educational innovation but not one 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.610
 definition anyone is not worth the first 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.949
 definition that you find has to be 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.840
 a definition in which you are of 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.000
 according to what you put 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.829
 although we do not know right now of 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.270
 educational innovation yes that is true 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.189
 that what we can read in that 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.409
 definition can sound to us of sense 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.299
 common good then that definition what 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.119
 we're going to do is we're going to take the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.250
 let's share let's say why 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.399
 we agree on that in that 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.289
 definition and that we will leave it in 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.689
 This forum or network where 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.670
 we are going to put later what 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.069
 length of the course when we bring some 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.539
 three or four weeks let's give a 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.219
 own definition of what is 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.770
 educational innovation is to say every 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.970
 person will draw their own definition 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.560
 We will be trained to have 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.229
 pretty clear what innovation is 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.259
 We are going to define the educational 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.239
 write and we'll put it next to and from 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.590
 publicly shared form of 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.060
 this first one that we are going to do now 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.939
 same therefore what we are going to do 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.280
 is to contrast the first definition that 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.129
 we have put more the second definition 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.920
 more fruit of practice is the contrast 

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:05.450
 will give you an understanding of what 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.479
 what you thought was the innovation 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.610
 educational and what right now forgive 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.310
 right now when when you do 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.200
 part of the course because you think it's the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.940
 creative innovation therefore this 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.830
 first activity has two parts the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.140
 first now let's do now and the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.170
 second / or three weeks the steps 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.910
 concrete to carry out this activity 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.400
 is on the platform and also you 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.800
 will send an email and remembering these 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.800
 these steps or concrete actions 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.189
 ah
