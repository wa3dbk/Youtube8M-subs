squeaking and these are actually loose

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.790 
squeaking and these are actually loose
compared<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.690> how<00:02:08.810> they<00:02:09.020> were<00:02:09.050> because<00:02:09.590> I'm

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
compared to how they were because I'm

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.210 
compared to how they were because I'm
what<00:02:10.520> I<00:02:10.550> open<00:02:11.000> them<00:02:11.090> they<00:02:12.050> were<00:02:12.110> really<00:02:12.830> really

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
what I open them they were really really

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.000 
what I open them they were really really
tight<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.520> had<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.390> these<00:02:15.230> they'd<00:02:15.890> almost

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
tight I had to and these they'd almost

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.420 
tight I had to and these they'd almost
feel<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.610> just<00:02:16.640> was<00:02:17.269> glued<00:02:17.840> shut<00:02:18.430> just

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
feel like it just was glued shut just

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.390 
feel like it just was glued shut just
like<00:02:19.640> that

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
like that

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.089 
like that
and<00:02:20.810> can't<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:22.049> not<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.439> easy<00:02:22.650> trying<00:02:23.010> to

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
and can't it's not as easy trying to

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.949 
and can't it's not as easy trying to
break<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.370> free<00:02:23.489> because<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:24.209> way<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:24.510> swivel

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
break it free because the way the swivel

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.199 
break it free because the way the swivel
is<00:02:25.079> when<00:02:25.439> you<00:02:25.500> try<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.709> move<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.189> bicep<00:02:26.640> the

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
is when you try to move the bicep the

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.869 
is when you try to move the bicep the
shoulder<00:02:27.629> will<00:02:27.750> come<00:02:27.989> with<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:28.560> it's

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
shoulder will come with it so it's

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.250 
shoulder will come with it so it's

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
their spider-man figures don't have that

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.150 
their spider-man figures don't have that
kind<00:04:53.130> of<00:04:53.220> detail<00:04:54.080> as<00:04:55.080> speaking<00:04:55.950> about<00:04:56.100> the

kind of detail as speaking about the

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.960 
kind of detail as speaking about the
head<00:04:56.400> I'm<00:04:56.640> not<00:04:57.060> sure<00:04:57.320> exactly<00:04:58.610> what<00:04:59.610> it<00:04:59.760> is

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
head I'm not sure exactly what it is

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.140

about<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.720> face<00:05:01.290> but<00:05:02.250> something<00:05:02.760> just<00:05:02.790> seems

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
it might might be the case but yes

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.480 
it might might be the case but yes
something<00:05:14.520> just<00:05:14.730> doesn't<00:05:14.910> seem<00:05:15.270> quite<00:05:15.480> right

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490
