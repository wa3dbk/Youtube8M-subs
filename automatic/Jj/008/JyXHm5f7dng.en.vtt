feel<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.650> grab<00:00:49.949> hold<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.339> it<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
feel it and then grab hold of it and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.729 
feel it and then grab hold of it and
start<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.449> ease<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.080> out<00:00:54.290> go<00:00:55.290> slowly<00:00:55.620> because

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
start to ease it out go slowly because

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.680 
start to ease it out go slowly because
it's<00:00:56.010> still<00:00:56.160> attached<00:00:56.489> at<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.760> tail<00:00:57.089> end<00:00:57.120> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
it's still attached at the tail end so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.869 
it's still attached at the tail end so
we've<00:00:57.839> got<00:00:58.019> to<00:00:58.110> just<00:00:58.290> pull<00:00:58.559> gently<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.580> release

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
we've got to just pull gently to release

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.149 
we've got to just pull gently to release
that<00:01:00.059> tail<00:01:00.390> end<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:01.019> we<00:01:01.110> go<00:01:01.290> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:02.040> you

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
that tail end there we go and then you

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.729 
that tail end there we go and then you
can<00:01:02.309> D<00:01:02.489> head<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.970> devein<00:01:03.330> in<00:01:03.629> one<00:01:03.839> go<00:01:04.050> now<00:01:04.589> if

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
can D head and devein in one go now if

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.410 
can D head and devein in one go now if
it<00:01:04.860> does<00:01:05.070> break<00:01:05.370> you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.790> still<00:01:06.000> often<00:01:06.150> get

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it does break you can still often get

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.630 
it does break you can still often get
hold<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.020> pull<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:07.980> not

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
hold of it and pull it out so that's not

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.430 
hold of it and pull it out so that's not
too<00:01:08.880> much<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.210> problem<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.050> other<00:01:10.230> way

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
too much of a problem the other way

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.820 
too much of a problem the other way
though<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.210> toothpick<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.650> can

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
though is to get a toothpick or you can

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.850 
though is to get a toothpick or you can
even<00:01:14.070> use<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.580> kitchen<00:01:15.330> fork<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.620> do<00:01:16.800> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
even use a kitchen fork you can do it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.020 
even use a kitchen fork you can do it
with<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> shell<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:17.640> you're<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> those

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
with the shells on just bend it in half

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.390 
with the shells on just bend it in half
and<00:01:21.390> where<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> gap<00:01:22.350> between<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.040> shells<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and where the gap between the shells you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.220 
and where the gap between the shells you
can<00:01:23.550> get<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.760> the<00:01:23.820> flesh<00:01:24.060> go<00:01:24.480> in<00:01:24.750> underneath

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
can get to the flesh go in underneath

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.370 
can get to the flesh go in underneath
that<00:01:25.530> top<00:01:25.830> layer<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.310> flesh<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.260> can

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that top layer of flesh there so you can

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.500 
that top layer of flesh there so you can
see<00:01:28.620> hook<00:01:29.370> around<00:01:29.520> where<00:01:29.910> that<00:01:29.940> digestive

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
see hook around where that digestive

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.970 
see hook around where that digestive
tract<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> bit<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.230> a<00:01:31.260> crocheting<00:01:31.770> hook

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
tract is a bit like a crocheting hook

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.160 
tract is a bit like a crocheting hook
pull<00:01:32.550> it<00:01:32.580> up<00:01:32.820> until<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.390> get<00:01:33.510> enough<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
pull it up until you can get enough to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.660 
pull it up until you can get enough to
pull<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.620> your<00:01:34.740> fingers<00:01:35.040> don't<00:01:35.400> try<00:01:35.610> and

pull out with your fingers don't try and
go<00:01:35.790> all<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:35.970> way<00:01:36.090> with<00:01:36.300> a<00:01:36.330> toothpick<00:01:36.570> because

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
go all the way with a toothpick because

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.170 
go all the way with a toothpick because
it<00:01:36.930> will<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.170> cut<00:01:37.320> straight<00:01:37.530> through

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
it will just cut straight through

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.220 
it will just cut straight through
