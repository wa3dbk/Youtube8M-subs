the<00:00:05.670> Perplexus<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.390> 3d<00:00:06.990> maze<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.859> much

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
the Perplexus is a 3d maze this is much

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.180 
the Perplexus is a 3d maze this is much
a<00:00:08.130> sculpture<00:00:08.849> as<00:00:09.120> it<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:10.050> game<00:00:10.380> or<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.830> puzzle

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
a sculpture as it is a game or a puzzle

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.890 
a sculpture as it is a game or a puzzle
once<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.700> pick<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.000> up<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.269> cannot<00:00:12.599> put<00:00:12.809> it

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
once you pick it up you cannot put it

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.810 
once you pick it up you cannot put it
down<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.410> these<00:00:13.500> were<00:00:13.679> created<00:00:14.130> by<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> sculptor

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
down so these were created by a sculptor

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.829

from<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.139> time<00:00:16.379> he<00:00:16.590> was<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> little<00:00:16.859> kid

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
from the time he was a little kid

from the time he was a little kid
Michael<00:00:17.520> McGinnis<00:00:18.000> was<00:00:18.119> fascinated<00:00:18.960> by<00:00:19.199> mazes

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
Michael McGinnis was fascinated by mazes

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.250 
Michael McGinnis was fascinated by mazes
and<00:00:20.250> who<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.699> drawing<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.510> illustrating<00:00:22.080> them

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
and who is drawing and illustrating them

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.170 
and who is drawing and illustrating them
and<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.619> challenge<00:00:23.010> came<00:00:23.189> along<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:23.550> as<00:00:23.760> he

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and the challenge came along as as he

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.210 
and the challenge came along as as he
came<00:00:24.359> up<00:00:24.480> with<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.750> idea<00:00:24.960> how<00:00:25.740> could<00:00:25.920> he<00:00:26.039> make

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
came up with this idea how could he make

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.300 
came up with this idea how could he make
this<00:00:26.400> something<00:00:26.640> 3d<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.689> as<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> sculptor<00:00:28.980> too

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
this something 3d and as a sculptor too

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.250 
this something 3d and as a sculptor too
he<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:29.789> brought<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.359> element<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.080> this

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
he really brought that element to this

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.160 
he really brought that element to this
it's<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.099> continuous<00:00:33.059> maze<00:00:33.719> one

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
it's it's this continuous maze one

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.930 
it's it's this continuous maze one
continuous<00:00:34.829> loop<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.219> goes<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> on

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
continuous loop that goes on and on

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.819 
continuous loop that goes on and on
through<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.390> ball<00:00:36.840> now<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.530> cool<00:00:37.800> thing

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
through this ball now the cool thing

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.979 
through this ball now the cool thing
about<00:00:38.160> these<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.719> about

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
about these is that it's not about

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.709 
about these is that it's not about
winning<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:40.710> actually<00:00:41.250> about<00:00:41.719> perseverance

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
winning it's actually about perseverance

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.540 
winning it's actually about perseverance
and<00:00:42.899> continuing<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> challenge<00:00:43.829> yourself<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and continuing to challenge yourself and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.160 
and continuing to challenge yourself and
if<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.120> may<00:00:45.300> say<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.570> myself

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
if I may say so myself

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.410 
if I may say so myself
the<00:00:46.440> rookie<00:00:46.860> even<00:00:47.460> though<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.850> rookie<00:00:48.059> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the rookie even though it's a rookie it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420 
the rookie even though it's a rookie it
is<00:00:48.660> still<00:00:48.989> challenging<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.129> I'm<00:00:50.219> really

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
is still challenging but I'm really

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.939 
is still challenging but I'm really
working<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.660> single<00:00:52.260> object<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
working with is not a single object or a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.639 
working with is not a single object or a
sculpture<00:00:53.579> instead<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.660> concept<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
sculpture instead it's a concept and the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.400 
sculpture instead it's a concept and the
concept<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:57.000> pathways<00:00:57.809> that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
concept is that we have pathways that

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.380 
concept is that we have pathways that
intersect<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.219> allow<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.820> travel<00:01:00.270> from

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
intersect and allow you to travel from

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.119 
intersect and allow you to travel from
one<00:01:00.449> side<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.050> pathway<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.530> another<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
one side of a pathway to another and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.349 
one side of a pathway to another and
that's<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.399> makes<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.670> three-dimensional

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
that's what makes it three-dimensional

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.380 
that's what makes it three-dimensional
and<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> little<00:01:04.830> model<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and so I have a little model of that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.359 
and so I have a little model of that
idea<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> mobius<00:01:08.340> strip

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
idea it's not really a mobius strip

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.880 
idea it's not really a mobius strip
according<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> mathematician<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.439> think

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
according to a mathematician but I think

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.070 
according to a mathematician but I think
of<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.250> way<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:13.020> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
of it that way and as you can see if you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840 
of it that way and as you can see if you
start<00:01:13.260> from<00:01:13.409> black<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.520> move<00:01:14.700> around

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
start from black here I can move around

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.510 
start from black here I can move around
onto<00:01:15.689> green

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
onto green

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.270 
onto green
transferring<00:01:17.520> onto<00:01:17.880> blue<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:19.530> through

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
transferring onto blue and then through

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.450 
transferring onto blue and then through
red<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.820> back<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.810> black<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.680> ultimately

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
red and back to black and so ultimately

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.330 
red and back to black and so ultimately
every<00:01:23.939> surface<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.990> structure<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:26.009> be<00:01:26.040> used

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
every surface of a structure can be used

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.789 
every surface of a structure can be used
as<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> pathway<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.780> ongoing<00:01:28.049> learning

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
as a pathway it's that ongoing learning

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.590 
as a pathway it's that ongoing learning
process<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.640> really<00:01:29.880> makes<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.390> such<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
process that really makes it such a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.719 
process that really makes it such a
unique<00:01:31.110> experience<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.979> want<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> beat<00:01:32.520> this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
unique experience you want to beat this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.039 
unique experience you want to beat this
thing<00:01:32.790> at<00:01:33.240> first<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:33.990> supposed

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
thing at first you think it's supposed

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
thing at first you think it's supposed
to<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.290> down<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.619> way<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.549> just

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
to be down one way and then you just

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
to be down one way and then you just
twist<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.509> work<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.780> another<00:01:37.079> way<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
twist it and work it another way and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.380 
twist it and work it another way and
then<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.070> solve<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.090> really<00:01:39.360> think

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
then you solve it and I really think

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.539 
then you solve it and I really think
that's<00:01:39.750> why<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.229> great<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.829> all<00:01:40.950> ages

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that's why it's so great for all ages

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.789 
that's why it's so great for all ages
I've<00:01:41.790> seen<00:01:42.030> even<00:01:42.390> younger<00:01:42.720> kids<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.409> speaks

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
I've seen even younger kids you speaks

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.109 
I've seen even younger kids you speaks
the<00:01:43.979> rule<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.340> make<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> through<00:01:44.790> certain
