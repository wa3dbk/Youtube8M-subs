00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
I had to give her a warm bath and then

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.390 
I had to give her a warm bath and then
she<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.210> playing<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.990> kicking<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.650> having<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
she was playing and kicking and having a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.310 
she was playing and kicking and having a
good<00:01:20.520> old<00:01:20.670> time<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.150> now<00:01:21.240> she's<00:01:21.450> napping<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.290> I

you

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.770 

and<00:04:35.010> she<00:04:36.010> was<00:04:36.130> just<00:04:36.160> so<00:04:36.400> funny<00:04:36.639> like<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.270> mean

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
and she was just so funny like I mean

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.180 
and she was just so funny like I mean
she<00:04:37.960> didn't<00:04:38.169> really<00:04:38.260> care<00:04:38.470> for<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.710> toys<00:04:38.919> too

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
she didn't really care for the toys too

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.340 
she didn't really care for the toys too
much<00:04:39.340> obviously<00:04:39.910> but<00:04:40.660> she<00:04:40.840> loved<00:04:41.110> the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
much obviously but she loved the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.530 
much obviously but she loved the
wrapping<00:04:41.680> papers<00:04:42.070> but<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:42.940> think<00:04:43.150> next<00:04:43.300> year

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
wrapping papers but I think next year

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.090 
wrapping papers but I think next year
should<00:04:43.660> be<00:04:43.720> way<00:04:43.960> more<00:04:43.990> excited<00:04:44.560> about<00:04:44.620> toys

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
should be way more excited about toys

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.890 
should be way more excited about toys
and<00:04:45.720> more<00:04:46.720> understand<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.290> concepts<00:04:47.800> so

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
and more understand the concepts so

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.870 
and more understand the concepts so
