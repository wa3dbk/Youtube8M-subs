00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:16.590
 which is the biggest chick him 12 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:21.230
 11 days and less days 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:27.949
 small for him six days here they are already 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:33.300
 think something sizzle I like and 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:36.230
 look who and here shoots the same such 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.230
 big beautiful 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:58.360
 it's scary im somehow I take in hand 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:03.670
 a little stroking they calm down and 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.670
 will slowly get used to tame 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.300
 like this 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.220
 all if this is so long bring for 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.140
 hands they take on hands then 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.800
 calm down fall asleep little else they 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.570
 does not matter 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:42.510
 and that's such a beauty we have on 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.490
 the twelfth day this little one 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.030
 first biggest 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:57.060
 he is already clearly visible on the wings 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:02:01.890
 These needles feather here they are the same 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.930
 feathers grow quietly leg on 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.149
 head over there has seen such a crown 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.790
 korona grows but why little black ones I don't 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.860
 know never seen in cockatiels 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.920
 black little crown or dark little always 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.390
 blonde so i think that's all 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.830
 the plumage color will change 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.180
 because they will still fade and 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.080
 will grow all this will change here well 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.080
 not worth it yet 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.920
 how is it neatly neat 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:52.400
 first they hiss when they see me and 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:56.720
 then it gets used and everything is good little by little 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:01.540
 I will take for a while not to 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:10.510
