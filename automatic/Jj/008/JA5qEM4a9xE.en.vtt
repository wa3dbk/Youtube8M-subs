00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
seemed to have survived it well all that

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.060 
seemed to have survived it well all that
all<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.329> mine<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:40.110> drained<00:00:40.440> well<00:00:40.739> have

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
all of mine that have drained well have

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.860 
all of mine that have drained well have
had<00:00:41.190> no<00:00:41.399> bad<00:00:41.579> effects<00:00:41.969> from<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.329> rain<00:00:42.540> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
had no bad effects from the rain it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.380 
had no bad effects from the rain it
we've<00:00:43.320> got<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> good<00:00:43.680> crop<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.789> upside<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
we've got a good crop one upside to a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
we've got a good crop one upside to a
lot<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> rain<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> irrigation

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
lot of rain is that the irrigation

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.190 
lot of rain is that the irrigation
pivots<00:00:47.640> did<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> run<00:00:48.480> as<00:00:48.629> much<00:00:48.870> and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
pivots did not have to run as much and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.319 
pivots did not have to run as much and
that<00:00:49.230> saves<00:00:49.920> farmers<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> cost<00:00:51.000> of

that saves farmers on the cost of

that saves farmers on the cost of
growing<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> crop<00:00:52.160> they've<00:00:53.160> got<00:00:53.340> less<00:00:53.610> inputs

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
growing the crop they've got less inputs

my<00:00:57.960> cotton<00:00:58.289> crop<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.859> probably<00:00:59.280> was<00:00:59.760> all<00:00:59.940> set

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
my cotton crop I probably was all set

the<00:01:06.990> bottom<00:01:07.290> line<00:01:07.500> should<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> little

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the bottom line should be a little

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.770 
the bottom line should be a little
better<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.850> year<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.150> my<00:01:09.240> peanut<00:01:09.540> crop

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
better this year on my peanut crop

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
better this year on my peanut crop
because<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.830> hardly<00:01:11.310> any

irrigate this field to dig it and I've

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.289 
irrigate this field to dig it and I've
probably<00:01:16.950> watered<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:17.670> time<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.090> June

that's<00:01:18.659> probably<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> only<00:01:19.200> irrigation

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that's probably the only irrigation
