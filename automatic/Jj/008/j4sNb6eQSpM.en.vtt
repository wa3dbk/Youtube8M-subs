there's no double buzzing and make sure
that<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.270> moisture<00:02:38.780> isn't<00:02:39.050> collecting<00:02:39.230> it's

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
that that moisture isn't collecting it's

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:48.260 
that that moisture isn't collecting it's
just<00:02:39.830> going<00:02:40.069> through

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.370 

the<00:02:49.270> next<00:02:49.600> step<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:50.490> actually<00:02:51.490> doing<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.000> on

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
the next step is actually doing it on

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.420 
the next step is actually doing it on
your<00:02:53.380> mouthpiece<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:54.480> think<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.680> trumpet

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
your mouthpiece I think of the trumpet

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.080 
your mouthpiece I think of the trumpet
very<00:02:58.180> much<00:02:58.540> like<00:02:58.960> singing<00:02:59.590> the<00:03:00.310> trumpet<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.820> me

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
very much like singing the trumpet to me

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.750 
very much like singing the trumpet to me
is<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.480> speaker<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.410> I<00:03:03.220> think<00:03:03.460> of<00:03:03.610> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
is a speaker and I think of the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.620 
is a speaker and I think of the
mouthpiece<00:03:03.940> as<00:03:04.570> microphone<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.710> if<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.970> am<00:03:07.090> NOT

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
mouthpiece as microphone and if I am NOT

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.750 
mouthpiece as microphone and if I am NOT
singing<00:03:08.020> clearly<00:03:08.830> with<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.160> good<00:03:09.400> sound

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
singing clearly with a good sound

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.970 
singing clearly with a good sound
nothing<00:03:10.720> good<00:03:11.110> will<00:03:11.290> actually<00:03:11.710> come<00:03:11.950> through

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
nothing good will actually come through

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.980 
nothing good will actually come through
this<00:03:12.400> stuff<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:13.840> by<00:03:14.770> doing<00:03:14.830> that<00:03:15.510> free<00:03:16.510> buzzing

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
this stuff so by doing that free buzzing

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.590 
this stuff so by doing that free buzzing
by<00:03:17.560> going<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.100> doing<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:18.520> kind<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.060> Genesis

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
by going and doing this kind of Genesis

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.440 
by going and doing this kind of Genesis
exercise<00:03:20.170> creating<00:03:20.860> that<00:03:21.040> buzz<00:03:21.310> I'm<00:03:21.670> going<00:03:22.390> to

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
exercise creating that buzz I'm going to

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.120 
exercise creating that buzz I'm going to
go<00:03:22.630> ahead<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.020> create<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.410> very<00:03:23.680> pure

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
go ahead and create a very pure

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.330 
go ahead and create a very pure
beautiful<00:03:25.090> sound<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.560> unobstructed<00:03:26.860> by

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
beautiful sound that is unobstructed by

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.449 
beautiful sound that is unobstructed by
some<00:03:28.270> kind<00:03:28.480> of<00:03:28.540> inconsistency<00:03:29.380> that's<00:03:30.280> what

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
some kind of inconsistency that's what

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.570 
some kind of inconsistency that's what
I'm<00:03:30.550> hoping<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.850> do<00:03:31.830> I'll<00:03:32.830> just<00:03:32.890> simply<00:03:33.250> doing

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
I'm hoping to do I'll just simply doing

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:43.080 
I'm hoping to do I'll just simply doing
on<00:03:33.730> my<00:03:33.820> mouthpiece<00:03:34.060> now<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.850> notice

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
something that doing it very loud that's

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.300 
something that doing it very loud that's
not<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.660> intention<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.709> intention<00:03:48.160> is<00:03:48.280> to

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
not the intention the intention is to

00:03:48.310 --> 00:04:00.210 
not the intention the intention is to
focus<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.270> on<00:03:49.500> when<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.800> buzz<00:03:51.130> starts<00:03:59.220> that's

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
focus in on when that buzz starts that's

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
what I want the next step is to be able

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.770 
what I want the next step is to be able
to<00:04:04.360> control<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:06.100> buzz<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.700> want<00:04:07.570> to<00:04:07.660> make

tired<00:04:16.030> chops<00:04:16.540> a<00:04:17.470> lot<00:04:17.919> of<00:04:18.010> times<00:04:18.220> would<00:04:18.310> be<00:04:18.370> very

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
tired chops a lot of times would be very

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.390 
tired chops a lot of times would be very
stiff<00:04:19.060> there<00:04:19.390> dry<00:04:19.930> something<00:04:20.739> like<00:04:20.890> that<00:04:21.160> and

stiff there dry something like that and

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.060 
stiff there dry something like that and
it<00:04:21.850> will<00:04:21.970> actually<00:04:22.500> blow<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.530> lot<00:04:23.740> of<00:04:23.800> air

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
it will actually blow a lot of air

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.000 
it will actually blow a lot of air
through<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.700> then<00:04:24.910> just<00:04:25.240> snap<00:04:25.600> on<00:04:25.930> we<00:04:26.710> want<00:04:26.950> to
