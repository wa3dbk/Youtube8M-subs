we're not going to get in because
they're<00:00:18.900> very<00:00:19.109> involved<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.949> would<00:00:20.070> be<00:00:20.220> to

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
they're very involved that would be to

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.040 
they're very involved that would be to
install<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> custom<00:00:21.180> ROM<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.810> lot<00:00:22.020> of

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
install a custom ROM because a lot of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.689 
install a custom ROM because a lot of
custom<00:00:22.470> roms<00:00:22.619> out<00:00:22.859> there<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.189> very<00:00:23.400> lean<00:00:23.670> very

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
custom roms out there are very lean very

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.390 
custom roms out there are very lean very
light<00:00:24.269> tuned<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:25.140> performance<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.800> number

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
light tuned for performance and number

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.920 
light tuned for performance and number
two<00:00:26.580> would<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.000> overclock<00:00:27.449> your<00:00:27.570> phone

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you're an email and you flip to another

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.979 
you're an email and you flip to another
app<00:00:59.850> there<00:01:00.149> won't<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.359> an<00:01:00.480> annoying<00:01:00.840> animation

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

which<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:01.800> takes<00:01:02.010> time<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.699> system

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
which just takes time and system

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.509 
which just takes time and system
resources<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.110> doing<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.589> will<00:01:05.159> make<00:01:05.369> your

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
device feel a little bit faster let's

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.260 
device feel a little bit faster let's
jump<00:01:08.010> back<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> home<00:01:08.520> screen<00:01:08.729> another

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
jump back to the home screen another

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.149 
jump back to the home screen another
thing<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.170> disable<00:01:10.590> browser

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
thing you can do is disable browser

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.280 
thing you can do is disable browser
plugins<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.510> dump<00:01:12.689> into<00:01:12.869> your<00:01:13.049> browser

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
plugins so if you dump into your browser

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.310 
plugins so if you dump into your browser
and<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.189> into<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> settings<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:16.170> will

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and you go into the settings you will

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.789 
and you go into the settings you will
see<00:01:16.380> an<00:01:16.860> option<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.369> plugins<00:01:18.170> down<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.560> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
see an option for plugins down here and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
see an option for plugins down here and
what<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.430> doing<00:01:20.610> its<00:01:20.820> scanning<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> page

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
what this is doing its scanning the page

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.440 
what this is doing its scanning the page
to<00:01:21.720> determine<00:01:21.869> whether<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:22.890> any<00:01:23.490> for

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
to determine whether there are any for

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510 
to determine whether there are any for
example<00:01:24.750> flash<00:01:24.960> plugins<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.340> have

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
example flash plugins and so if you have

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.609 
example flash plugins and so if you have
always<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.119> set<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.780> will<00:01:27.930> always<00:01:28.259> load<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
always on set that will always load the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.200 
always on set that will always load the
flash<00:01:28.829> plugins<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.430> you'll<00:01:29.549> probably<00:01:29.700> get

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
flash plugins and you'll probably get

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.450 
flash plugins and you'll probably get
one<00:01:30.960> or<00:01:31.140> two<00:01:31.170> second<00:01:31.770> delays<00:01:32.040> your<00:01:32.280> device

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
one or two second delays your device

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.550 
one or two second delays your device
charged<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.909> pull<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.869> demand<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
charged to pull that in on demand is a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.620 
charged to pull that in on demand is a
good<00:01:34.770> option<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.159> most<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:36.090> will<00:01:36.360> allow<00:01:36.570> you

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
good option for most it will allow you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.719 
good option for most it will allow you
to<00:01:36.810> choose<00:01:37.229> whether<00:01:37.500> or<00:01:37.650> not<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.979> run<00:01:38.520> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
to choose whether or not to run a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.940

widgets<00:03:18.720> Twitter<00:03:18.989> widgets<00:03:19.410> etc<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:20.640> forth

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
widgets Twitter widgets etc and so forth

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.210 
widgets Twitter widgets etc and so forth
these<00:03:21.209> use<00:03:21.480> system<00:03:21.930> resources<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.739> they

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
these use system resources and they

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.610 
these use system resources and they
always<00:03:23.579> have<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.970> redraw<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.290> widgets

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
always have to redraw and the widgets

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.199 
always have to redraw and the widgets
are<00:03:25.769> more<00:03:26.010> complicated<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.850> system<00:03:27.180> to

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
are more complicated for the system to

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.460 
are more complicated for the system to
redraw<00:03:27.720> because<00:03:28.019> they<00:03:28.140> have<00:03:28.230> live<00:03:28.440> data

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
redraw because they have live data

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.470 
redraw because they have live data
elements<00:03:29.280> they're<00:03:29.459> streaming<00:03:29.730> information

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
elements they're streaming information

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.750 
elements they're streaming information
so<00:03:31.019> turn<00:03:31.290> those<00:03:31.470> off<00:03:31.620> if<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:31.920> can<00:03:32.160> another

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
so turn those off if you can another

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.060 
so turn those off if you can another
thing<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.630> would<00:03:33.870> help<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.410> Joe<00:03:34.560> Levi<00:03:34.890> made

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
thing that would help and Joe Levi made

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.800 
thing that would help and Joe Levi made
a<00:03:35.100> good<00:03:35.250> point<00:03:35.430> about<00:03:35.549> this<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.359> reduce<00:03:36.600> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
a good point about this is to reduce the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.990 
a good point about this is to reduce the
number<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.079> icons<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.859> have<00:03:38.040> icons<00:03:38.790> are<00:03:38.970> a

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
number of icons you have icons are a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.610 
number of icons you have icons are a
little<00:03:39.120> bit<00:03:39.329> complicated<00:03:39.690> they<00:03:40.079> require<00:03:40.440> the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
little bit complicated they require the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.770 
little bit complicated they require the
operating<00:03:41.040> system<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.549> draw<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.940> icons<00:03:42.570> a

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
operating system to draw the icons a

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.289 
operating system to draw the icons a
good<00:03:43.200> alternative<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.769> icon<00:03:44.100> our<00:03:44.489> folders<00:03:45.090> so

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
good alternative the icon our folders so

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.180 
good alternative the icon our folders so
you<00:03:45.359> can<00:03:45.540> make<00:03:45.690> multiple<00:03:46.109> folders<00:03:46.470> instead<00:03:47.100> of

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
you can make multiple folders instead of

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.920 
you can make multiple folders instead of
having<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.640> know<00:03:47.670> all<00:03:47.940> these<00:03:48.269> icons<00:03:48.450> like<00:03:48.780> I

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
having you know all these icons like I

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.160 
having you know all these icons like I
do

I could have four folders along the

I could have four folders along the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
apps like Twitter and Facebook

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.629 
apps like Twitter and Facebook
automatically<00:04:47.840> add<00:04:48.020> an<00:04:48.259> entry<00:04:48.440> here<00:04:48.979> and<00:04:49.130> by

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
automatically add an entry here and by

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.700 
automatically add an entry here and by
default<00:04:49.849> they<00:04:50.360> turn<00:04:50.660> on<00:04:50.990> which<00:04:51.289> is<00:04:51.440> kind<00:04:51.650> of

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
default they turn on which is kind of

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.180 
default they turn on which is kind of
silly

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
silly

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.100 
silly
so<00:04:52.610> you'll<00:04:52.789> find<00:04:52.970> your<00:04:53.210> tweets<00:04:53.539> are<00:04:53.690> updating

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
so you'll find your tweets are updating

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.629 
so you'll find your tweets are updating
automatically<00:04:54.770> but<00:04:54.949> that's<00:04:55.099> slowing<00:04:55.520> down

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
automatically but that's slowing down

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.610
