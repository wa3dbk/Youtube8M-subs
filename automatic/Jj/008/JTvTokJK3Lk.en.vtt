00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.330
 a band 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.899
 so we put a stencil on the 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.349

 below the fri then we take the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:36.060
 bottleneck to the effect one puts it names of the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:53.640

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.270
 with a white bombhamming buschini 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.630
 we're going to do and run down directly into 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:52.350
 below its recipes we take the 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:54.570

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.900
 world and we are 30 in the dispute 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.799
 blue a little white and on a surface 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.970
 plane could turn the mixtures and 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.450
 then you make me directly on 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.450

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:07.270
 on the live we do the same thing with 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:18.189
 a liner of a different color here 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:21.449
 it's gray so at the temple adjusts 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.449
 another layer of gloss varnish 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:26.729
