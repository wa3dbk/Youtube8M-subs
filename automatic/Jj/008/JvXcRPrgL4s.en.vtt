00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.510
 We are with Jonathan Bornstein for the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.820
 section ask in our networks 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.010
 social and let's start with this 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.260
 ask why you did not dedicate yourself to others 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.600
 most popular sports in the USA like the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.140
 baseball basketball or american football and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.509
 you chose soccer because when I was 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.919
 the child I really said all 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.720
 sports my dad from my coach and 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.260
 so my brother and I play all the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.420
 american football baseball basketball 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.840
 tennis everything but I always believe 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.970
 that I chose soccer because I do not 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.160
 It was so big to play soccer 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.890
 american and so tall to play 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.750
 basketball and baseball was a bit slow 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.390
 for me the truth because I was very much 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.300
 many times standing waiting for a play 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.480
 no football was perfect for me to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.090
 my size for my speed as a person 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.400
 the best is a very attractive child 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.930
 then football was very good for 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.450
 get out that energy 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.280
 and how do you feel about going back to the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.050
 ownership now with roosters 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.210
 querétaro I feel very well I feel 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:19.220
 that it was a very long process here in 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.520
 Mexico Tigers of trying to start 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.640
 play a starter again on a team but 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.800
 I'm finally playing again 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.280
 I feel very very well very smart I am 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.400
 grabbing confidence every day more and more 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.100
 I hope I can continue playing as 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.500
 owner in cheating evidence of the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.510
 choice to become a footballer and what was 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.570
 the hardest thing to become 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.870
 professional then when I started playing 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.420
 professional with chivas and from before in 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.830
 the university I played for forward and 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.530
 very much like extreme and reaching chivas 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.710
 berlin wanted me to play lateral 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.570
 left then it was a transition a 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.640
 little hard I think it was the most 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.440
 difficult in my career 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.150
 a professional nature 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.620
 and what is the most useful thing you have learned 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.620
 since he gets here to mexico 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.580
 thanks for the question but I think that 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.890
 you are Spanish the truth learning 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.680
 Spanish has changed my life in many 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.670
 Aspects I feel comfortable 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.530
 traveling between more countries in the world 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.440
 also in football it has attracted me as 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.410
 many many doors in terms of 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.540
 teams and a time of playing and arriving 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.760
 to a place and feel and feel comfortable 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.350
 so I think that learning the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.450
 culture and the language of 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.130
 and what do you like most about being in 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.190
 roosters 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.920
 I like the group the truth we have a 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.660
 very very good group here my classmates 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.130
 they are always cheerful 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.530
 we are always so living doing 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.450
 jokes also playing I feel very 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.950
 comfortable playing with them 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.800
 I think it's more things 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.200
 parents of roosters and how do you feel in 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.910

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.980

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.290
 of Querétaro because the city is very 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:27.620
 quiet and quiet and I really like it 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.830

 that you can go anywhere easily 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.370

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.140
 Very calm and I am very happy and that 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.390
 you feel when you are in the court of 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.010
 corrector to the corrector 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.560
 every time the road on the court 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.530

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.860
 the roosters there are always in front 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.440
 we played them in front of a lot of 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.890
 fans but if we have one of the best 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.410
 amateur fan groups here in mexico 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.859
 and every time we play there for me 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.350
 I feel very comfortable very very proud to 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.340
 make a rooster 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.760
 and you know how it was that you decided 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.820
 dedicate yourself to football and that I motivate you to 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.180
 be professional what did you say 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.120
 I have to be a footballer myself 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.830
 I studied at the university and I was 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.920
 playing in college at the same 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:49.160
 time and I always did not want to do 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.160
 like a job from 8 to 6 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.390
 I always wanted to do some sport 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.390
 professional 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.620
 I also gave myself as something good 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.860
 my dad worked very hard for my family 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.110
 for us children and already but that although 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.449
 they want to work as hard as he 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:17.509
 but we are sometimes they worked 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.509
 like 10 or 11 hours a day 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.439
 I do not want to work hard anymore, I have to 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:25.259
 dedicate myself to study and also play 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:27.990

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:32.150

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:47.939
