solar<00:00:33.950> panels<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:35.650> yeah<00:00:36.650> over<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:37.340> place

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
solar panels so yeah over to you place

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.870 
solar panels so yeah over to you place
right<00:00:38.830> solar<00:00:39.830> panels<00:00:40.010> they're<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.430> little<00:00:40.670> bit

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
right solar panels they're a little bit

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.119 
right solar panels they're a little bit
more<00:00:41.059> complicated<00:00:41.710> more<00:00:43.239> complicated<00:00:44.239> than<00:00:44.420> a

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
more complicated more complicated than a

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.850 
more complicated more complicated than a
the<00:00:46.129> wind<00:00:47.030> turbines<00:00:47.450> what<00:00:48.350> we<00:00:48.470> need<00:00:48.620> we<00:00:48.800> need

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
the wind turbines what we need we need

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.420 
the wind turbines what we need we need
to<00:00:49.040> make<00:00:49.160> some<00:00:49.340> generators<00:00:50.410> which<00:00:51.410> we<00:00:52.040> didn't

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
to make some generators which we didn't

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.540 
to make some generators which we didn't
find<00:00:53.360> any<00:00:53.660> of<00:00:53.960> this<00:00:54.079> stuff<00:00:54.230> or<00:00:55.130> we<00:00:55.250> got<00:00:55.400> the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
find any of this stuff or we got the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.390 
find any of this stuff or we got the
batteries<00:00:56.290> whilst<00:00:57.290> we<00:00:57.560> need<00:00:57.710> for<00:00:57.860> a<00:00:57.920> generator

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
batteries whilst we need for a generator

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.260 
batteries whilst we need for a generator
we<00:00:58.910> need<00:00:59.060> a<00:00:59.090> furnace<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:01.010> machine<00:01:01.489> block<00:01:01.880> so

god<00:04:04.800> no<00:04:04.920> that's<00:04:05.130> not<00:04:05.960> that's<00:04:09.200> right<00:04:10.200> um<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.190> I

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
god no that's not that's right um so I

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.220 
god no that's not that's right um so I
got<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.460> glass<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:12.240> got<00:04:12.630> I<00:04:13.520> think<00:04:14.930> right<00:04:15.930> we<00:04:16.049> got

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
got a glass I got I think right we got

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.650 
got a glass I got I think right we got
we<00:04:16.380> got<00:04:16.410> enough<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.769> make<00:04:16.890> one<00:04:17.269> right<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:18.540> this

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
we got enough to make one right so this

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.470 
we got enough to make one right so this
is<00:04:18.840> how<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.019> make<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:21.109> three<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.430> then<00:04:23.750> 12<00:04:24.750> and

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
is how you make it three and then 12 and

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.700 
is how you make it three and then 12 and
boom<00:04:27.480> solar<00:04:28.260> panel<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:30.080> so<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.260> coal

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
boom solar panel to that so it's coal

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.520 
boom solar panel to that so it's coal
dust<00:04:31.980> glass<00:04:32.900> electric<00:04:33.900> circuit<00:04:34.350> and

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
dust glass electric circuit and

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.430 
dust glass electric circuit and
generator<00:04:35.180> makes<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.510> solar<00:04:36.840> panel<00:04:37.050> right<00:04:37.290> we

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
generator makes a solar panel right we

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.460 
generator makes a solar panel right we
want<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.710> make<00:04:37.830> one<00:04:37.860> more<00:04:38.840> so<00:04:39.840> we<00:04:39.870> need<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.350> make

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
want to make one more so we need to make

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.550 
want to make one more so we need to make
a<00:04:40.710> generator<00:04:41.250> which<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:41.850> using<00:04:42.330> these<00:04:43.260> bad

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
a generator which is using these bad

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:54.140 
a generator which is using these bad
boys<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:46.110> take<00:04:46.560> them<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:52.770> we<00:04:53.040> got<00:04:53.190> them<00:04:53.430> you<00:04:54.030> got

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
boys so take them so we got them you got

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.840 
boys so take them so we got them you got
three<00:04:54.510> coal<00:04:54.750> dust<00:04:55.340> right<00:04:56.340> we've<00:04:56.580> got<00:04:56.610> enough

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850
