so<00:00:55.860> how<00:00:56.309> did<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.580> get<00:00:56.729> there<00:00:56.970> we<00:00:57.239> put<00:00:57.479> a<00:00:57.510> 3.5<00:00:58.260> eq

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
so how did we get there we put a 3.5 eq

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.700 
so how did we get there we put a 3.5 eq
motor<00:00:59.040> in<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> we<00:01:00.059> maintain<00:01:00.600> 260<00:01:01.559> horsepower

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
motor in it we maintain 260 horsepower

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.469 
motor in it we maintain 260 horsepower
and<00:01:03.320> 240<00:01:04.320> foot-pounds<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.309> torque<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.850> it

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and 240 foot-pounds of torque so it

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.240 
and 240 foot-pounds of torque so it
still<00:01:06.690> has<00:01:06.869> its<00:01:07.020> get-up-and-go<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.890> still<00:01:08.100> has

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
still has its get-up-and-go it still has

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.859 
still has its get-up-and-go it still has
the<00:01:08.369> power<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.670> people<00:01:09.060> want<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> fuel

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the power that people want but the fuel

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.649 
the power that people want but the fuel

the long slide system that we have
it's<00:02:24.070> just<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.700> flick<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:24.970> one<00:02:25.240> switch<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:25.960> the

systems onboard the car realized when a

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.970 
systems onboard the car realized when a
tire<00:03:22.210> is<00:03:22.420> losing<00:03:22.660> traction<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.380> will<00:03:23.680> split

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.890 
power from the front to back 50/50 the
benefit<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:27.850> if<00:03:28.209> your<00:03:28.360> tires<00:03:28.600> aren't

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
benefit is that if your tires aren't

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.900 
benefit is that if your tires aren't

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
losing traction you run in a front-wheel

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.110 
losing traction you run in a front-wheel
drive<00:03:30.940> mode<00:03:31.530> conserving<00:03:32.530> gas<00:03:32.820> but<00:03:33.820> for<00:03:34.030> those
