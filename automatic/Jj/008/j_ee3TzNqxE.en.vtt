 theme 5 planning stage 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.179
 the planning stage starts after 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.650
 the identification of the answers 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.169
 altered of a patient before a 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.029
 health problem is to say once 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.690
 The diagnoses of 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.640
 Nursing 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.000
 this stage will be developed in different 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.640
 phases on the one hand determination of 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.470
 priorities in certain occasions is 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.630
 impossible to treat all the answers 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.130
 altered at the same time being necessary 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.710
 perform a prioritization of 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.980
 problems establishing the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.660
 objectives or results of nursing 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.760
 once the priorities have been set 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.590
 will be chosen from the classification of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.570
 Nursing results not the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.210
 health results that we hope 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.430
 get in the patient's selection of 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.559
 nursing interventions or with 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.060
 In order to achieve these results , 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.890
 will select interventions 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.050
 nurses corresponding to the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.060
 classification for nursing nick 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.490
 solve the health problem 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.500
 to determine the results not that 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.630
 we hope to get and interventions 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.670
 nor what will we do to solve the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.369
 problem it is necessary to fix some 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.869
 priorities lower reflection than the 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.420
 dissatisfaction of needs 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.610
 basic causes the disease is more 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.490
 through the graphic representation of 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.570
 the needs in the form of a pyramid 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.369
 established that the needs more 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.570
 important or urgent 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.119
 they referred to the problems 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.189
 physiological however although we have 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.409
 in mind this pyramid will always be 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.299
 It is necessary to agree with the patient on 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.220
 relative importance of each diagnosis 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.560
 in order to deal with the most 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.270
 important considering 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.490
 only the theory of needs 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.189
 of maslow needs to be covered by 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.200
 order of importance would be needs 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:05.470
 physiological safety needs 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.250
 social needs self-esteem and 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.500
 self realisation 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.090
 after prioritizing the diagnoses that go 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.790
 to be treated it is necessary to select 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.190
 the results do not we intend 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.510
 get for each diagnosis the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.310
 classification of results of 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.050
 nursing is not a classification 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.030
 standardized results of the 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.920
 patient whose main 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.320
 objective to assess the effectiveness of 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.420
 Nursing interventions is understood 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.270
 as a result of nursing a state 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.860
 behavior or perception measured throughout 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.050
 of a continuum in response to 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.970
 nursing interventions every 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.560
 result has a group of 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.300
 indicators that are used to 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.940
 determine the patient's condition in 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.180
 relation to the result 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.670
 to measure this result is necessary 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.370
 specify the most sensitive indicators 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.020
 interventions of nurses 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.700
 results will not get the following

 of scale indicators of lakers and 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.290
 bibliography the importance of scale 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.390
 measurement is that the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.520
 results are looked at accurately and 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.960
 validity so that it can be examined 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.660

 grouped into 20 classes and 20 fields 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.349
 for choosing the results of

 nursing is not necessary to have in 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.760
 account the following premises must be 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.709
 take into account not only the diagnoses 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.690
 or health problems but the factors 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.720
 solved or at risk and the 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.670
 defining characteristics assess the 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.950
 personal characteristics of the patient 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.930
 since they can affect the selection of 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.330
 a result and to the extent that it can 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.190
 for that reason the characteristics 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.430
 of the patient should be mentioned as 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.720
 risk modification factors 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.900
 some examples would be the factors

 psychological and cognitive and so on 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.930
 patient preferences there are always 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.040
 have to take into account the preferences of the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.290
 patient when making decisions 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.110
 regarding the selection of results of 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.720
 Nursing is not only necessary to choose 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.310
 the results not that expected but it is 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.870
 that you must also choose the 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.820
 indicators belonging to those 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.440
 results that are useful and reliable 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.600
 to measure the effectiveness of 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.669
 nursing interventions for

 Performs a nursing professional

 desired result 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.500

 for the selection of interventions 

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:37.899
 most appropriate in our patient is 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:39.459
 It is necessary to take into account a series of 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:41.209
 factors 

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:43.779

 have to be specified before choosing the 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.889
 intervention will serve as criteria 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:54.310
 comparative to judge the success of a

 etiology and related symptoms 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.790
 with the diagnosis of nursing the

 results of interventions 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.080
 select based on diagnostics

 etiological factors when it is not 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.840
 possible to act on these is necessary 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.290
 treat the signs and symptoms 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.820
 scientific support of the intervention 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.260
 nursing professional who uses 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.580
 an intervention must be 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.150
 familiar with your base 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.190
 investigation 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.060
 possibility to use in practice 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.080
 an intervention 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.310
 knowledge and skills for 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.410
 perform the intervention 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.850
 of course the professional should be 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.680
 able to carry out the 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.140
 intervention taking into account these 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.870
 factors from a functional perspective 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.880
 the nurses interventions nic can 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.420
 be useful in the fields of promotion of 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.860
