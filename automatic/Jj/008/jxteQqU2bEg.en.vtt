slower ride gets boring okay so most

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.880

main<00:04:34.180> critique<00:04:34.390> nemesis<00:04:35.200> is<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.890> it's<00:04:36.070> rough

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
main critique nemesis is that it's rough

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.600 
main critique nemesis is that it's rough
but<00:04:37.150> it's<00:04:37.390> 16<00:04:37.780> years<00:04:38.020> old<00:04:38.230> as<00:04:38.380> well<00:04:38.560> so<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.580> can

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
but it's 16 years old as well so you can

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.690 
but it's 16 years old as well so you can
kind<00:04:40.030> of<00:04:40.120> forgive<00:04:40.419> it<00:04:40.570> for<00:04:40.720> that<00:04:40.810> somewhat<00:04:41.700> so

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
kind of forgive it for that somewhat so

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.010 
kind of forgive it for that somewhat so
this<00:04:42.850> is<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.090> part<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.480> review<00:04:43.660> where<00:04:43.990> I

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
this is the part of the review where I

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.080 
this is the part of the review where I
rate<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.560> ride<00:04:44.770> in<00:04:44.980> three<00:04:45.220> categories<00:04:45.430> and

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
rate the ride in three categories and

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.040 
rate the ride in three categories and
overall<00:04:46.900> first<00:04:47.500> visual<00:04:47.890> appeal<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.460> theme<00:04:48.700> I

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
overall first visual appeal and theme I

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.330 
overall first visual appeal and theme I
think<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.140> theming<00:04:50.500> on<00:04:50.650> nemesis<00:04:51.100> is

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
think the theming on nemesis is

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.820 
think the theming on nemesis is
fantastic<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.240> scenery<00:04:53.169> in<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.470> setting

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
fantastic and scenery in the setting

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.230 
fantastic and scenery in the setting
just<00:04:54.040> create<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.310> wonderfully<00:04:54.910> intense

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
just create a wonderfully intense

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.560 
just create a wonderfully intense
atmosphere<00:04:55.900> so<00:04:56.350> I'm<00:04:56.440> giving<00:04:56.770> it<00:04:56.860> nine<00:04:57.570> design

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570

brilliantly<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.960> build<00:05:05.140> anticipation<00:05:05.470> and

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
brilliantly to build anticipation and

the scenery interactions on the ride

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.400 
the scenery interactions on the ride
make<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.530> ride<00:05:08.740> even<00:05:09.100> better<00:05:09.640> and<00:05:10.419> thanks<00:05:11.380> to

the prompt dispatching of trains on this

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.790 
the prompt dispatching of trains on this
ride<00:05:13.419> you<00:05:13.690> won't<00:05:13.840> have<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.050> wait<00:05:14.320> too<00:05:14.350> long

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
ride you won't have to wait too long

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.760 
ride you won't have to wait too long
compared<00:05:15.250> to<00:05:15.400> some<00:05:15.580> others<00:05:15.880> at<00:05:16.150> alton<00:05:16.510> towers

compared to some others at alton towers

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.800 
compared to some others at alton towers
so<00:05:17.770> i'm<00:05:18.130> going<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.370> give<00:05:18.520> it<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.790> nine<00:05:19.270> the

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
so i'm going to give it a nine the

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.440 
so i'm going to give it a nine the
physical<00:05:20.110> ride<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:21.220> layout<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:21.550> nemesis<00:05:22.120> very

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
physical ride the layout of nemesis very

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.330 
physical ride the layout of nemesis very
well<00:05:22.660> put<00:05:22.870> together<00:05:23.020> producing<00:05:23.830> a<00:05:23.919> mixture<00:05:24.220> of

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
well put together producing a mixture of

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.250 
well put together producing a mixture of

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
fast transitions and strong g-forces

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.590 
fast transitions and strong g-forces
there<00:05:27.040> are<00:05:27.190> a<00:05:27.220> few<00:05:27.460> moments<00:05:27.640> of<00:05:27.940> roughness<00:05:28.360> but

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
there are a few moments of roughness but

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.959 
there are a few moments of roughness but
it's<00:05:28.780> worth<00:05:29.020> it<00:05:30.600> nine

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.969 

nemesis<00:05:34.969> is<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.150> first-class<00:05:35.659> ride<00:05:36.050> some<00:05:36.770> say

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
nemesis is a first-class ride some say

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.890 
nemesis is a first-class ride some say
it's<00:05:37.159> overrated<00:05:37.520> but<00:05:37.879> I<00:05:38.030> personally<00:05:38.539> think<00:05:38.719> he

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
it's overrated but I personally think he

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.230 
it's overrated but I personally think he
turns<00:05:39.110> a<00:05:39.229> high<00:05:39.409> ranking<00:05:39.860> for<00:05:40.069> its<00:05:40.159> design<00:05:40.370> it's

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
turns a high ranking for its design it's

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.999 
turns a high ranking for its design it's
certainly<00:05:41.659> not<00:05:41.870> perfect<00:05:41.930> but<00:05:42.560> all<00:05:42.710> of<00:05:42.860> its

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
certainly not perfect but all of its

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.159 
certainly not perfect but all of its
elements<00:05:43.129> seem<00:05:43.580> to<00:05:43.699> work<00:05:43.879> together<00:05:44.169> extremely

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
elements seem to work together extremely

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.619 
elements seem to work together extremely
well<00:05:45.349> and<00:05:45.590> for<00:05:46.159> that<00:05:46.249> I<00:05:46.460> give<00:05:46.759> nemesis<00:05:47.180> 9<00:05:47.449> out

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:47.629 
well and for that I give nemesis 9 out

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:56.820 
well and for that I give nemesis 9 out
of<00:05:47.659> 10
