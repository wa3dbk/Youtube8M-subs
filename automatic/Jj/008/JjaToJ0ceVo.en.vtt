 hi guys all came with you today show 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.440
 for you how you can transform a 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:15.330
 skirt that you no longer wear and a dress 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.660
 super cool whats learning then come 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.660
 with me 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.270
 You will need a skirt of a 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:29.349
 chain paste ruler and a pen to 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:33.340
 you score goal but leave the skirt well 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:37.120
 do the mending well and then you 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:41.640
 measure how much you intend to cut 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.640
 I cut 17 centimeters 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.960
 does the same thing on the other side 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.090
 measure how much you stayed there in the 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.880
 cantino but that to stay the same 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.520
 how much on the other side and then I just left 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.520
 17 cm well yes 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.570
 then you just get scissors and 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.490
 cut 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.520
 I advise you to cut a little bit 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.940
 under the pen is not be marked his 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.940
 fabric 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.940
 does the same thing on the other side 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.940
 is 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.560
 my skirt she already had a place for 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.000
 where will the rubber band that is is all 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.070
 world looking at you 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.450
 but if the person does not have it, it's just you 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.450
 folding and sewing 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.960
 in the case of mine in the place where the 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.890
 elastic I 'm just going to pass chain well 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.890
 simple is not 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.490
 Now you close the chain, just dress. 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.930
 You can put a little pen on your 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.930
 style has a more beautiful trim 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.040
