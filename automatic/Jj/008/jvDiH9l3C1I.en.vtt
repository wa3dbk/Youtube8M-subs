00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
think when the snake twirlers were first

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.300 
think when the snake twirlers were first
time<00:05:38.180> fixed<00:05:39.180> well<00:05:40.110> not<00:05:40.260> fixed<00:05:40.560> but<00:05:40.620> adjusted

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
they actually did quite well if you

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.000 
they actually did quite well if you
could<00:05:44.850> get<00:05:45.120> that<00:05:45.330> clean<00:05:45.810> frontal<00:05:46.560> or<00:05:46.740> better

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010

like<00:06:13.980> I<00:06:14.510> mean<00:06:15.510> the<00:06:15.900> problem<00:06:16.410> for<00:06:16.890> our

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
like I mean the problem for our

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.280 
like I mean the problem for our
guitarist<00:06:17.760> was<00:06:18.000> that<00:06:18.240> he<00:06:18.390> had<00:06:18.419> way<00:06:18.840> too<00:06:18.900> many

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
guitarist was that he had way too many

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:25.220 
guitarist was that he had way too many
or<00:06:19.680> he<00:06:20.490> didn't<00:06:20.760> have<00:06:20.850> enough<00:06:21.770> units<00:06:24.050> yes<00:06:25.050> he

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
or he didn't have enough units yes he

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.320 
or he didn't have enough units yes he
compared<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:25.830> boom<00:06:26.280> poles<00:06:26.520> from<00:06:26.730> poles<00:06:27.030> had

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
compared to boom poles from poles had

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.140 
compared to boom poles from poles had
more<00:06:27.780> infantry<00:06:28.350> and<00:06:28.620> cavalry<00:06:29.000> numbers<00:06:30.000> were

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
more infantry and cavalry numbers were

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.439 
more infantry and cavalry numbers were
fairly<00:06:30.390> equal

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
fairly equal

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.899 
fairly equal
and<00:06:31.599> my<00:06:32.139> rental<00:06:32.590> crushed<00:06:32.889> I<00:06:35.729> think<00:06:36.729> it's

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
and my rental crushed I think it's

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:42.719 
and my rental crushed I think it's
basically<00:06:37.659> comes<00:06:38.319> down<00:06:38.590> to<00:06:39.240> the<00:06:40.240> elephant
