00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.540
 when I say that nobody needs a small break and Automotive 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.220
 so it has a small upholstery deeply cut someone else so 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.390
 everything is like that

 was from censorship

 Nice Mozart and the colorful dog init goes that 7 percent 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.180
 for experiments 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.170
 so as to prevent emperors from pushing through

 the funny one like Janka and Beat the Heat is on -

 For me personally, it's the perfect and house forest for meet the

 Mother of the colonel with its diversity outstanding for

 opulent ambience of the large auditorium but exactly due to the 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.210
 Area decorated auditorium could be thought 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.610
 that some staging will be suppressed 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.180
 it is understandable he must now increasingly on the stage of such a 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.740
 House that is 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.240
 let it forget it was not that you set the deco black 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.480
 that one was last on stage 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.860

 Jer 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.609
 the 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.609
 all over 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.279
 he remember 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:35.069
 the renovation of the State Theater also took the occasion for fresh blood 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.400
 to bring it to the stage and that's what the staging sounds like 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.879
 with one thing 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.559
 that we have gotten the point as I now so that we all 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:48.339
 it should need an age I will expect them from us are the figures 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.529
 are quite good correspond to the old airport Vienna 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.149
 "We really have a fantastic atmosphere among each other 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:00.389
 they are all young and they are all very excited and excited 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:05.319
 Being able to work together is something that happens very rarely 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.779
 interesting finds 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:10.129
 Israel would 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.379
 Thus, the Salzburg State Theater underlines much more than one 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.009
 to be simple theater 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.760
 The main reason why we do that is a completely different wind 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.559
 June a new young ensemble remain committed 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:23.409
 the test could be the task of a city council 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.529
 To tie in young singers because to the waiver of subsidies could 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.469
 that can be seen 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:33.829
 and they have to catch five weeks and the Salzburger Landestheater exactly that 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.829
 right out 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.729
 more 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.159
 according to the guild, how do the singers of the outstanding Mozarteum come? 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.659
 Orchestra to be under the direction of Neo conductor Leo 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.659
 The musicians offer listening pleasure at the highest level 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:58.159
 which will read 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.290
 for me it is very clear you do not have to explain to them how you feel 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.249
 After all, game is basically the resort all I have to do is them and 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:08.969
 To find colors of the music 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:13.399
 the imagination of the orchestra is something very special in this case 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:14.609
 sponsored 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:15.709
 now is 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.939
 Some people see if it is happy and in July 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.639
 a great premiere of OMV's successful reopening 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.600
 The State Theater is thus nothing in the way and that would have the world 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.090
 mean lying wonderful chose exciting stories
