00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
so I have two products here which come

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.840 
so I have two products here which come
in<00:00:13.760> pots<00:00:14.410> cream<00:00:15.410> liner<00:00:15.680> and<00:00:16.040> I<00:00:16.430> have<00:00:16.550> a<00:00:16.580> gel

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
in pots cream liner and I have a gel

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.960 
in pots cream liner and I have a gel
liner<00:00:17.150> and<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:18.440> difference<00:00:19.340> is<00:00:19.580> obviously

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
liner and the difference is obviously

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.230 
liner and the difference is obviously
the<00:00:20.240> consistency<00:00:21.170> cream<00:00:22.070> liners<00:00:22.640> are<00:00:22.850> a<00:00:22.910> bit

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
the consistency cream liners are a bit

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.409 
the consistency cream liners are a bit
oily<00:00:23.450> oh<00:00:23.720> so<00:00:24.380> they<00:00:24.920> are<00:00:25.279> I<00:00:25.790> mean<00:00:26.060> it's<00:00:26.210> very

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
oily oh so they are I mean it's very

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.900 
oily oh so they are I mean it's very
much<00:00:26.540> like<00:00:26.900> using<00:00:27.410> a<00:00:27.680> cream<00:00:27.950> blush<00:00:28.160> or<00:00:28.520> a<00:00:28.580> gel

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
much like using a cream blush or a gel

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.269 
much like using a cream blush or a gel
blush<00:00:29.210> gels<00:00:30.110> will<00:00:30.619> contain<00:00:30.919> a<00:00:30.980> lot<00:00:31.189> more

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
blush gels will contain a lot more

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.050 
blush gels will contain a lot more
pigment<00:00:31.790> and<00:00:31.939> be<00:00:32.210> drier<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:32.810> more<00:00:33.140> lasting

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
pigment and be drier and more lasting

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.900 
pigment and be drier and more lasting
creams<00:00:35.060> will<00:00:35.720> be<00:00:35.840> oil-based<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:36.829> so<00:00:37.340> won't<00:00:37.790> be

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
creams will be oil-based and so won't be

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.280 
creams will be oil-based and so won't be
able<00:00:38.030> to<00:00:38.120> contain<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.570> same<00:00:38.750> amount<00:00:38.960> of

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
able to contain the same amount of

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.229 
able to contain the same amount of
pigment<00:00:39.560> so<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:40.370> might<00:00:40.489> have<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.730> go<00:00:40.970> over

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
pigment so you might have to go over

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.660 
pigment so you might have to go over
twice<00:00:41.540> but<00:00:42.350> there<00:00:42.530> are<00:00:42.620> a<00:00:42.650> lot<00:00:42.860> gentler<00:00:43.220> and

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
twice but there are a lot gentler and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.020 
twice but there are a lot gentler and
they<00:00:44.480> can<00:00:44.720> be<00:00:44.870> just<00:00:45.170> as<00:00:45.350> long<00:00:45.560> lasting<00:00:46.040> so

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
they can be just as long lasting so

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.390 
they can be just as long lasting so
really<00:00:47.360> it's<00:00:47.510> up<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:48.050> you<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:48.470> it's<00:00:48.620> down<00:00:49.190> to

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
really it's up to you and it's down to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.660 
really it's up to you and it's down to
your<00:00:49.550> technique<00:00:49.970> I<00:00:50.210> personally<00:00:51.110> prefer<00:00:52.100> cream

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
your technique I personally prefer cream

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.480 
your technique I personally prefer cream
liners<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.510> but<00:00:54.200> i<00:00:54.230> believe<00:00:54.350> that<00:00:54.650> gel<00:00:55.040> liners

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
liners and but i believe that gel liners

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.120 
liners and but i believe that gel liners

they<00:02:21.470> look<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.769> lot<00:02:21.950> thicker<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.150> can<00:02:23.330> go

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
they look a lot thicker and you can go

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.399 
they look a lot thicker and you can go
in<00:02:23.750> through<00:02:24.409> the<00:02:24.500> top<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.840> wiggle<00:02:27.140> it

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
in through the top and just wiggle it

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.500 
in through the top and just wiggle it
down<00:02:28.159> to<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.519> roots<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:30.760> will<00:02:31.760> stroke<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.329> down

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
down to the roots I will stroke it down

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.649 
down to the roots I will stroke it down
the<00:02:32.659> lashes<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:34.849> this<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.209> going<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.480> give<00:02:35.569> you

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
the lashes and this is going to give you

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.850 
the lashes and this is going to give you
that<00:02:35.780> really<00:02:36.290> great<00:02:36.860> basis<00:02:38.079> and<00:02:39.079> good<00:02:39.440> looking

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
that really great basis and good looking

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.660 
that really great basis and good looking
lashes<00:02:40.129> and<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:41.569> well-defined<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:43.370> brush

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
lashes and a well-defined I this brush

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.170 
lashes and a well-defined I this brush
is<00:02:43.940> quite<00:02:44.390> rubbish<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:45.620> doing<00:02:45.860> flicks<00:02:46.250> or<00:02:46.579> in

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
is quite rubbish for doing flicks or in

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.429 
is quite rubbish for doing flicks or in
the<00:02:47.269> corners<00:02:47.750> but<00:02:48.319> it<00:02:48.440> is<00:02:48.560> wonderful<00:02:49.400> for

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
the corners but it is wonderful for

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.619 
the corners but it is wonderful for
getting<00:02:51.439> in<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:51.769> that<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.939> there<00:02:53.090> we<00:02:53.180> go<00:02:53.209> once

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
getting in like that so there we go once

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.270 
getting in like that so there we go once
again<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:53.959> zoomed<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.560> for<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:54.829> and<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.069> can

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
again I zoomed in for you and you can

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.569 
again I zoomed in for you and you can
see<00:02:55.519> it<00:02:55.760> does<00:02:56.060> not<00:02:56.510> look<00:02:56.870> really<00:02:57.440> thick<00:02:57.680> if<00:02:58.340> I

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
see it does not look really thick if I

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.670 
see it does not look really thick if I
lift<00:02:58.819> up<00:02:59.060> those<00:02:59.209> lashes<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.750> can<00:02:59.959> see<00:03:00.260> I've

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
lift up those lashes you can see I've

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.220 
lift up those lashes you can see I've
not<00:03:01.310> gone<00:03:01.459> on<00:03:01.609> to<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.849> waterline<00:03:02.239> but<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:02.989> have

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
not gone on to the waterline but I have

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.890 
not gone on to the waterline but I have
gone<00:03:03.530> in<00:03:03.889> between<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.489> lashes<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:05.599> if<00:03:05.780> you

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
gone in between the lashes so if you

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.050 
gone in between the lashes so if you
just<00:03:06.139> want<00:03:06.319> a<00:03:06.470> really<00:03:06.739> natural<00:03:07.159> looking<00:03:07.639> liner

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
just want a really natural looking liner

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.390 
just want a really natural looking liner
then<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:08.870> might<00:03:09.109> be<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.440> technique<00:03:09.829> for<00:03:10.250> you

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
then this might be the technique for you

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.369 
then this might be the technique for you
so<00:03:11.359> now<00:03:11.510> we're<00:03:11.629> going<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.810> do<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.139> flick

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
so now we're going to do that flick

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.319 
so now we're going to do that flick
again<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:12.920> I'm<00:03:13.280> actually<00:03:13.400> going<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.819> use<00:03:13.909> the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
again and I'm actually going to use the

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.479 
again and I'm actually going to use the
long<00:03:14.540> tapered<00:03:15.109> brush<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:16.010> kind<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.280> takes

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
long tapered brush and I kind of takes

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.670 
long tapered brush and I kind of takes
several<00:03:16.760> sweeps<00:03:17.239> that's<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.720> now<00:03:18.230> you<00:03:18.319> can<00:03:18.440> see

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
several sweeps that's it now you can see

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.670 
several sweeps that's it now you can see
that<00:03:18.859> it's<00:03:19.010> dragging<00:03:19.549> slightly<00:03:20.349> so<00:03:21.349> what<00:03:21.530> we

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
that it's dragging slightly so what we

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.949 
that it's dragging slightly so what we
do<00:03:21.859> is<00:03:22.159> we<00:03:22.819> just<00:03:23.000> sort<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.389> short

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
do is we just sort of going short

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.460 
do is we just sort of going short
birthing<00:03:24.500> strokes<00:03:24.950> like<00:03:25.389> this<00:03:26.389> and<00:03:27.019> we<00:03:27.199> have

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
birthing strokes like this and we have

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.720 
birthing strokes like this and we have
to<00:03:27.709> get<00:03:27.970> down<00:03:28.970> between<00:03:29.299> those<00:03:29.750> lashes

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
to get down between those lashes

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.729 
to get down between those lashes
otherwise<00:03:31.730> it's<00:03:32.180> just<00:03:32.389> not<00:03:33.109> going<00:03:33.349> to<00:03:33.410> add<00:03:33.590> the

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
otherwise it's just not going to add the

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:41.800 
otherwise it's just not going to add the
definition<00:03:34.310> that<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.579> want<00:03:38.349> like<00:03:39.349> so<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:40.810> I

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
definition that you want like so and I

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.030 
definition that you want like so and I
take<00:03:42.109> it<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:43.730> can<00:03:43.940> see<00:03:44.500> when<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.620> look<00:03:45.829> very

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:37.209 
don't think it's appropriate for a

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:40.679 
don't think it's appropriate for a
general<00:06:38.139> day<00:06:38.349> look<00:06:38.849> my<00:06:39.849> sort<00:06:40.089> of<00:06:40.179> style<00:06:40.389> look

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:43.409 
general day look my sort of style look

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:01.509 
going out after work than just a quick

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.319 
going out after work than just a quick
application<00:07:01.869> and<00:07:02.829> to<00:07:03.519> the<00:07:03.610> waterline<00:07:03.879> just

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:04.329 
application and to the waterline just

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:06.029 
application and to the waterline just
gives<00:07:04.539> you<00:07:04.749> that<00:07:04.779> sort<00:07:05.139> of<00:07:05.229> more<00:07:05.469> dramatic

look so the correct way to do it is to

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:13.529 
look so the correct way to do it is to
gently<00:07:10.149> pull<00:07:10.599> down<00:07:11.169> the<00:07:11.439> eye<00:07:11.469> and<00:07:12.239> run<00:07:13.239> the
