 lies on the surface but is that hidden 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.110
 behind the iron curtain coach 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.960
 give scientific advice and all this but know how 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.970
 The project anatomy bodybuilding Alexei 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.080
 Rusakov 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.199
 lech hi hi hi air 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.580
 mud 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.600
 laid down well of course i would like to pump up 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.489
 to pump up and not be more so 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.780
 drischam you call these guys 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.610
 how am I yes such problems and crack you 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.610
 never called people because everything 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.220
 the fact that it is very impolite but necessary 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.299
 pump up unambiguous kiryan and kiryan 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.680
 and bags also exercise chest exercise 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.570
 1 bench press we finished the main 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.640
 the warm-up process now let's start with 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.430
 Michael and the first exercise will be with us 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.680
 bench press listen and how to understand a person 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.600
 the guy came so kind of healthy 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.970
 but genetically healthy hands from such 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.130
 heroes but they immediately for some reason 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.770
 cling to a lot of weight you know what 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.750
 the more cool you recommended 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.670
 Of course, starting with a small one at all . 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.170
 here everything is very simple really in 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.180
 first of all when you come to the gym 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.770
 and start exactly from scratch and when you have 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.720
 there would be no equipment 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.980
 you need to put the technique so 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.380
 actually you came to the hall 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.330
 the original set all the equipment you 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.270
 the coach said fine you start 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.260
 pick the weight accordingly 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.480
 warming up what is warming weight 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.980
 accordingly, it is an empty neck 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.990
 but some suppose I can not squeeze 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.760
 empty neck begin with dumbbells and further 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.800
 reach exactly the weight that you 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.200
 perform on 12 repetitions and 12 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.970
 reps goes as you can almost say 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.740
 in denial that is when you can no longer 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.069
 squeeze and helps you insure you 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.500
 man, this is your first working weight 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.450
 given everything is very simple you makes you 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.340
 come to the next nero fku again 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.409
 warm up the step between warming up 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.640
 repeat approaches at about 30 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.950
 percent of the working weight that you have 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.870
 initially as soon as you stretched 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.640
 reached again for the working weight which 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.590
 had you had a previous workout and 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.319
 accordingly it is already doing, and on 12 and 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.360
 14 times it tells you the body about 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.000
 that you adapted accordingly to you 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.770
 you need to increase the weight so that the muscle after 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.870
 weight gain adapted the same 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.450
 started growing once you actually 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.130
 done 14 times you know for sure it's your 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.660
 signal to the next workout to deliver 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.340
 weight more run it on 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.770
 certain number of repetitions you 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.810
 come say performed on 8 but 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.489
 the following deliver as well but you 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.760
 come to us only to practice 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.250
 its on 10 then on 12 and 12 it is exactly that 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.370
 mark when you need to make more weight 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:05.550
 I hope mechvod and quests repeat but not 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.810
 we need no problem 60 kilograms 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:15.519
 warm up weight prepared 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:17.610
 athlete when lowering the bar falls 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.709
 on the center of the chest 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.790
 correct wide grip 10 centimeters 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.610
 side of wrist to shoulder joint 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.190
 maximum secure grip closed 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.260
 neck falls into the ring between the fingers well 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.600
 Now I see Michael performs classical 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.820
 bench press puts the barbell in the middle 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.560
 Breasts actually presses confident principle 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.430
 it is clear that Misha is really once 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.920
 rocked or the weight keeps confident even I 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.140
 would say he breathes correctly last 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:53.860
 then rest 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:57.390
 inhale exhale inhale exhale to always exhale 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.390
 goes to the effort one more time 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.090
 easy gay remarks that exhortations 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.400
 Now I will tell here all seen footage 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.380
 how Misha breathed, I think everything seems clear 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.630
 it was shown there is a feature supposedly 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.280
 run a bit ahead to the boa game 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.170
 There should be good advice that 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.430
 principle does not explain or explain 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.110
 only one trainer who 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.420
 deals surrendered actually happens 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.790
 three types of breathing and, respectively, how 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.500
 would many people people even about this not 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.420
 think well know a lot of yogis about 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.640
 why is this disturbing breathing if you can 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.040
 listen again this is when he omits 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.220
 the barbell on the chest is doing everything right 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.960
 inhale well inhale he makes lips clenched 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.440
 tubule and makes it under strong 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.000
 pressure yes everyone says when they run 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.800
 you need to breathe a nose quickly 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.450
 let's say you know this before in 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.490
 childhood in the Soviet Union often 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.140
 it was then done belshina with famous 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.390
 not because so that only air 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.940
 warmed but the fact is that when 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.090
 you let you need oxygen and you 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.980
 breathe like open mouth yes you 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.880
 feel the belly just rise 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.060
 and belly down 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.400
 this is called low lower breath this 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.620
 when the diaphragm deflects the main 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.810
 muscle and fills the lungs with oxygen well 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.520
 only the bottom of the main part when you 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.040
 breathe your nose you can feel that 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.680
 you have a diaphragm goes ahead that is 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.810
 the top does not pull up the opposite 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.390
 there is just negative pressure here 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.130
 and the diaphragm controls it all so here 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.930
 when you already do not weigh more 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.600
 enough oxygen you need to breathe 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.840
 so that you fill your lungs completely 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.150
 not only not from the lungs but nose breathing you 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.300
 can't get so much oxygen 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.919
 so 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.390
 special is training well or such 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.240
 breath you do 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.370
 lips into a tube and make the air under 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.800
 pressure give the chest 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.770
 filled not only with lungs but also 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.249
 mid lung and upper lung 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.489
 Now I breathed 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:54.489
 even the head is not sated oxygen 

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:57.309
 further it is very correct 

00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:59.169
 breathing which leads to something wrong 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:01.329
 that hypertrophy is completely muscular 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.549
 Why is there enough tissue ? 

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:05.889
 oxygen will therefore very quickly begin 

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:07.659
 grow weight you have enough muscle oxygen 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.789
 can work and muscles can work 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:11.709
 because there comes a nervous momentum 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.369
 systems and the nervous system work themselves 

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:16.809
 on oxygen 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:18.879
 oxygen is no work there so I mean you 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.349
 remembered how to breathe correctly and now 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.479
 we switch to training 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:26.789
 Alexey where he will show his 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.789
 individual bench press workout 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.540
 at 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.580
 the program is supported by the company
