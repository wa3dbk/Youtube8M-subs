00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
honest we look at we've seen the gold

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.080 
honest we look at we've seen the gold
price<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.379> five<00:00:52.590> hundred<00:00:52.890> percent<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
price of five hundred percent and the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.889 
price of five hundred percent and the
silver<00:00:54.449> prices<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:55.260> rocking<00:00:55.770> keep<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> up

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
silver prices just rocking keep it up

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.029 
silver prices just rocking keep it up
well<00:00:57.899> they're<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.260> doing<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.649> very<00:00:58.680> good<00:00:58.890> job

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
well they're not doing a very good job

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.069 
well they're not doing a very good job
of<00:00:59.250> manipulating<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.210> because<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.719> moving

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
of manipulating it because it's moving

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.680 
of manipulating it because it's moving
substantially<00:01:01.680> higher<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.219> obviously<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
substantially higher now obviously the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
substantially higher now obviously the
central<00:01:04.080> bankers<00:01:04.500> want<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.949> keep<00:01:05.100> gold<00:01:05.430> down

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
central bankers want to keep gold down

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.480 
central bankers want to keep gold down
because<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.659> gold<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.619> silver<00:01:08.010> really<00:01:08.220> take

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
because if gold and silver really take

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060 
because if gold and silver really take
out<00:01:08.640> particularly<00:01:09.180> gold<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
out particularly gold that's that's a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.609 
out particularly gold that's that's a
monetary<00:01:11.610> commodity<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.799> it's<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.850> vote

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
monetary commodity and it's it's a vote

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.070 
monetary commodity and it's it's a vote
against<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.250> monetary<00:01:18.060> system<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.750> global

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
against the monetary system the global

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.899 
against the monetary system the global
monetary<00:01:19.500> system<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> vote<00:01:20.340> against<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
monetary system is a vote against the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.600 
monetary system is a vote against the
dollar<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.750> gold<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.470> skyrockets<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
dollar so gold really skyrockets that

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.499 
dollar so gold really skyrockets that
could<00:01:23.909> indicate<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.920> financial<00:01:26.850> crisis<00:01:27.390> so

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
could indicate a a financial crisis so

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.830 
could indicate a a financial crisis so
you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.750> see<00:01:27.990> why<00:01:28.290> government<00:01:28.950> would<00:01:29.100> want<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
you can see why government would want to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.600 
you can see why government would want to
manipulate<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:31.320> keep<00:01:31.560> gold<00:01:31.950> from<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.490> up

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
manipulate or keep gold from going up

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.910 
manipulate or keep gold from going up
too<00:01:32.820> high<00:01:33.030> people<00:01:33.630> say<00:01:33.780> well<00:01:33.990> geez<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.770> they're

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
too high people say well geez if they're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160 
too high people say well geez if they're
manipulating<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:36.000> markets<00:01:36.450> they're<00:01:36.810> doing<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
manipulating the markets they're doing a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
manipulating the markets they're doing a
lousy<00:01:37.350> job<00:01:37.619> because<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.610> price<00:01:38.820> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
lousy job because it's the price is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.359 
lousy job because it's the price is
going<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.240> ten<00:01:39.479> years<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.869> row<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:41.159> you

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
going up ten years in a row but if you

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.819 
going up ten years in a row but if you
look<00:01:41.520> at<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> different<00:01:42.119> way<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.020> garbage

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
look at a different way this is garbage

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.370 
look at a different way this is garbage
thinking<00:01:44.369> because<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.970> lot<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.630> people<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:46.140> Wall

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
thinking because a lot of people on Wall

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.840 
thinking because a lot of people on Wall
Street<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.740> say<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.159> jeez<00:01:47.490> gold

hasn't<00:01:48.210> been<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.509> great<00:01:48.540> an<00:01:48.899> investment

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
hasn't been that great an investment

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.929 
hasn't been that great an investment
because<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.399> had<00:01:50.520> kept<00:01:50.729> pace<00:01:50.909> with

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
because if it had kept pace with

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.690 
because if it had kept pace with
inflation<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:52.049> would<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.290> 23<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> 25<00:01:53.340> hundred

it's<00:01:56.520> thirteen<00:01:56.969> hundred<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.329> fifty<00:01:57.659> dollars

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
it's thirteen hundred and fifty dollars

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.200 
it's thirteen hundred and fifty dollars
an<00:01:58.140> ounce<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.740> that's<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.579> suppression

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
an ounce so that's what that suppression

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.120 
an ounce so that's what that suppression
is<00:02:00.479> done<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> rubber<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:02.070> a

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
is done think of it as a rubber of a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.130 
is done think of it as a rubber of a
little<00:02:02.340> ball<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.000> between<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> water<00:02:03.719> it's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
little ball but between the water it's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.230 
little ball but between the water it's
going<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.890> people<00:02:05.820> talk<00:02:05.969> about<00:02:06.000> a

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
going like this people talk about a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.719 
going like this people talk about a
bubble<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> reverse<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.280> what

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
bubble it's just the reverse so what

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.249 
bubble it's just the reverse so what
what<00:02:09.209> do<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.810> price<00:02:10.050> should

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
what do you think the price should

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.859 
what do you think the price should
really<00:02:10.619> be

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
really be

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.570 
really be
at<00:02:10.929> four<00:02:11.230> silver<00:02:11.620> if<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.099> markets<00:02:12.459> are

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
at four silver if the markets are

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.710 
at four silver if the markets are
manipulated<00:02:13.269> a<00:02:14.049> good<00:02:14.620> question<00:02:15.510> that's<00:02:16.510> been

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
manipulated a good question that's been

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.300 
manipulated a good question that's been
the<00:02:16.900> problem<00:02:17.049> I<00:02:17.470> mean<00:02:17.620> there<00:02:17.769> is<00:02:17.890> some<00:02:18.069> gold

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the problem I mean there is some gold

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.910 
the problem I mean there is some gold
around<00:02:18.549> with<00:02:18.700> basically<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.540> bad<00:02:20.379> guys<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
around with basically the bad guys the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.119 
around with basically the bad guys the
gold<00:02:21.129> cartel<00:02:21.580> had<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.150> manipulate<00:02:22.360> silver<00:02:23.290> to

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
gold cartel had to manipulate silver to

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.949 
gold cartel had to manipulate silver to
have<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.370> coincide<00:02:24.849> with<00:02:24.879> gold<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.599> it<00:02:25.870> was

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
have it coincide with gold and it was

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.240 
have it coincide with gold and it was
because<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.230> couldn't<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.650> silver<00:02:26.980> going

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
because you couldn't have silver going

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.069 
because you couldn't have silver going
this<00:02:27.370> way<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.640> gold<00:02:28.420> here<00:02:28.659> it<00:02:28.750> would<00:02:28.900> make<00:02:29.049> it

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
this way and gold here it would make it

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.050 
this way and gold here it would make it
too<00:02:29.290> obvious<00:02:29.319> so<00:02:29.680> they've<00:02:30.370> been<00:02:30.549> going<00:02:30.730> at<00:02:31.000> it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
too obvious so they've been going at it

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.130 
too obvious so they've been going at it
of<00:02:31.629> JP<00:02:32.140> Morgan<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.739> other<00:02:32.980> people<00:02:34.140> using

if<00:02:40.599> we're<00:02:40.840> correct<00:02:41.049> they're<00:02:41.890> caught<00:02:42.159> short<00:02:42.549> I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
if we're correct they're caught short I

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.160 
if we're correct they're caught short I
mean<00:02:42.879> Morgan<00:02:43.090> right<00:02:43.359> now<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.660> supposedly

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
mean Morgan right now is supposedly

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.069 
mean Morgan right now is supposedly
short<00:02:44.620> 30,000<00:02:45.400> contracts<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:46.480> big<00:02:46.720> money<00:02:46.959> is

short 30,000 contracts the big money is

short 30,000 contracts the big money is
moving<00:02:47.379> in<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.590> silver<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.099> would<00:02:48.519> be

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
moving in the silver I would be

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.400 
moving in the silver I would be
surprised<00:02:49.090> if<00:02:49.329> we're<00:02:49.540> not<00:02:49.660> between<00:02:50.109> thirty

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
surprised if we're not between thirty

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.140 
surprised if we're not between thirty

well<00:02:52.660> silver<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.349> very<00:02:53.650> very<00:02:53.859> small<00:02:54.040> market

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
well silver is a very very small market

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.869 
well silver is a very very small market
when<00:02:55.299> you<00:02:56.140> have<00:02:56.319> two<00:02:56.650> enormous<00:02:57.220> traders

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
when you have two enormous traders

when you have two enormous traders

in<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:01.120> tiny<00:03:01.359> market<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.049> those<00:03:02.200> traders<00:03:02.500> have

access to infinite capital those traders

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.250 
access to infinite capital those traders
can<00:03:06.069> push<00:03:06.340> any<00:03:06.730> tiny<00:03:07.299> market<00:03:07.780> around<00:03:07.870> it

any<00:03:13.540> market<00:03:13.840> well<00:03:14.620> III<00:03:15.099> think<00:03:15.340> that's<00:03:15.790> a

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
any market well III think that's a

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.110 
any market well III think that's a
potentially<00:03:17.769> explosive<00:03:17.859> issue<00:03:18.579> for<00:03:19.030> the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
potentially explosive issue for the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.449 
potentially explosive issue for the
markets<00:03:19.599> it's<00:03:19.989> not<00:03:20.349> and<00:03:20.799> it's<00:03:20.889> important<00:03:21.370> to

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
markets it's not and it's important to

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.190 
markets it's not and it's important to
note<00:03:21.639> this<00:03:21.849> that<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.329> issue<00:03:22.510> no<00:03:22.780> matter<00:03:22.959> what

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
note this that this issue no matter what

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.409 
note this that this issue no matter what
happens<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.859> is<00:03:23.950> not<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.700> potential

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
happens to it is not a potential

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.809 
happens to it is not a potential
negative<00:03:26.079> for<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.260> metals<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:27.310> if<00:03:27.579> it's<00:03:27.760> not

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
negative for the metals so if it's not

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.059 
negative for the metals so if it's not
