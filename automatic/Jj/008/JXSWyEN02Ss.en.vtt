with is interesting on paper but there
are<00:01:43.520> issues<00:01:43.820> with<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.900> biggest<00:01:45.080> problem

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
are issues with it the biggest problem

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.170 
are issues with it the biggest problem
is<00:01:45.650> that<00:01:45.830> your<00:01:46.010> ship<00:01:46.130> gets<00:01:46.490> too<00:01:46.670> close<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.100 
want to be looking at the map for too
long<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:52.970> have<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.450> glance<00:01:53.720> at<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:53.930> from

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
long but you have to glance at it from

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.780 
long but you have to glance at it from
time<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.440> time<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.799> see<00:01:55.010> where<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.340> pods<00:01:55.549> and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
time to time to see where the pods and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.640 
time to time to see where the pods and
disruptors<00:01:56.299> are<00:01:56.510> plus<00:01:57.110> there's<00:01:57.320> no<00:01:57.470> way<00:01:57.590> you

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
disruptors are plus there's no way you

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.080 
disruptors are plus there's no way you
could<00:01:57.860> possibly<00:01:58.010> navigate<00:01:58.729> your<00:01:58.850> way<00:01:58.970> around

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
could possibly navigate your way around

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.300 
could possibly navigate your way around
by<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.540> top<00:01:59.840> view<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.409> can't<00:02:00.890> even<00:02:01.010> see<00:02:01.190> the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
by the top view you can't even see the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.789 
by the top view you can't even see the
balls<00:02:01.810> it's<00:02:02.810> worse<00:02:02.990> than<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.260> get<00:02:03.470> caught<00:02:03.680> in

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
balls it's worse than you get caught in

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.230 
balls it's worse than you get caught in
this<00:02:03.920> rubble<00:02:04.340> juice<00:02:04.490> because<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:04.970> need<00:02:05.119> to

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
this rubble juice because you need to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.850 
this rubble juice because you need to
see<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.570> map<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.960> know<00:02:06.110> what<00:02:06.350> direction<00:02:06.650> you

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
see the map to know what direction you

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.020 
see the map to know what direction you
need<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.010> go<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.250> get<00:02:07.460> out<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.729> there

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
need to go to get out of there

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.669 
need to go to get out of there
but<00:02:08.420> at<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.599> same<00:02:08.750> time<00:02:09.019> you<00:02:09.200> have<00:02:09.349> to<00:02:09.379> see

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
but at the same time you have to see

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.400 
but at the same time you have to see
where<00:02:09.890> all<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.069> shoot<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.340> coming<00:02:10.700> from

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
where all the shoot is coming from

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.900 
where all the shoot is coming from
so<00:02:11.710> this<00:02:11.860> really<00:02:12.010> could<00:02:12.220> only<00:02:12.340> work<00:02:12.640> if<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:12.820> a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
so this really could only work if you a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.000 
so this really could only work if you a
vertically<00:02:13.330> cross-eyed<00:02:13.960> bouncing<00:02:14.770> your<00:02:14.890> eyes

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
vertically cross-eyed bouncing your eyes

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.500 
vertically cross-eyed bouncing your eyes
back<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.430> forth<00:02:15.640> gets<00:02:15.850> tiring<00:02:16.150> pretty

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
back and forth gets tiring pretty

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.180 
back and forth gets tiring pretty
quickly<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:17.470> doesn't<00:02:17.770> help<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:17.980> the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
quickly it doesn't help that the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.860 
quickly it doesn't help that the
shooting<00:02:18.490> portion<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.090> generally<00:02:19.510> fun<00:02:19.750> on

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
shooting portion is it generally fun on

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.760 
shooting portion is it generally fun on
its<00:02:20.020> own<00:02:20.140> anyway

I'll<00:02:29.920> give<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.160> game<00:02:30.310> credit<00:02:30.640> for<00:02:30.760> being

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
I'll give the game credit for being

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.970 
I'll give the game credit for being
ambitious<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.750> split-screen<00:02:32.140> idea<00:02:32.650> was<00:02:32.830> at

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
ambitious the split-screen idea was at

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.950 
ambitious the split-screen idea was at
least<00:02:33.160> original<00:02:33.700> but<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.390> wasn't<00:02:34.690> executed

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
least original but it wasn't executed

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.470 
least original but it wasn't executed
well
