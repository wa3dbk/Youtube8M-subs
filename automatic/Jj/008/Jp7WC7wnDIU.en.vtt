00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.200
 yubisoft this year is rich in releases like 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.970
 never 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.890
 and this time the next 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.850
 continuations of the series decided not 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.750
 confine 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.670
 and released two new titles and 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.890
 if looking dogs come out pretty 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.680
 long ago a new rating called for 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.140
 crew release but just recently and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.290
 we just could not prepare for 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.750
 you review the full version of the game with your own 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.149
 first impressions we have already shared 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.880
 in the review of troubles and so we'll talk today 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.520
 about what the test version show us 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.890
 I could not if by some miracle 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.920
 missed previous videos you can 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.230
 watch it by clicking here answers 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.230
 to questions like what kind of expectations is the game 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.150
 justified what did not justify and what 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.369
 interesting she boasts you 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.369
 learn in this video let's go 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.350
 describe in detail the plot and plot we do not 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.810
 we will because in the beta review and so 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.270
 said enough spoilers nobody 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.659
 love now let's just say that for 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.299
 Racing plot is very, very good a lot 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.360
 beautiful CJ kat-scene dialogue 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.539
 also sane script rare guest in 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.539
 games of this genre so for this game 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:45.149
 fat plus well well since we started with 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:49.080
 good let's oh good and let's talk 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.840
 closed a really big game and under 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.810
 the word big we mean sizes 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.479
 maps and of course the big open world 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.360
 Now you will not surprise anyone but see in 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.829
 ranking this level of detail 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.619
 environment, we do not ever ever 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.299
 and it is not about graphics which 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.450
 here in general, there are not enough stars from the sky 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.459
 and we are talking about how alive is here 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.290
 environment 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.660
 filling of populated and not very items 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.349
 gives the impression that you are playing 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.170
 good sandbox game and stretch hands 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.540
 in search of an exit button from the machine to be 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.319
 arrange another meat farce in 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.810
 gta style 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.819
 but not from sitting in the car and that 's it, but 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.489
 it is really compensated 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.660
 exciting rides to drive auto 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.420
 very nice 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.670
 especially if you change from the keyboard for 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.010
 convenient gamepad settings you can 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.470
 fully customize by turning 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.260
 a game of wooden arcades in more or 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.930
 less hardcore simulator in reasonable 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.480
 limits of course although even by default 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.760
 cardboard management olya infa with everything 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.100
 Equally no car somehow felt 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.940
 This is especially nice when you are tacking 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.859
 traffic rushing along the next highway 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.950
 doing such a huge location as well 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.910
 almost all of the United States 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.489
 developers are not limited 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.500
 copying the same location 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.419
 to location 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.669
 every city is different architecture 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.160
 road surface and even weather 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.560
 conditions nothing prevents from green 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.280
 fields to call in the snow-capped mountains and 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.920
 etc 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.140
 not without attractions 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.260
 here you and the opportunity to see big 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.270
 canyon and mountain yosemite and salt fields 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.080
 where the jet car overcame 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.300
 speed of sound with such places mass 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.610
 you can just score on all these races 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.980
 tests and multiplayer and just 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.190
 admire the views from the cab cars under 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.630
 the accompaniment of pleasant music and 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.510
 radio stations enough to satisfy 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.730
 all tastes of course with 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.739
 good old underground mi still 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.800
 no one has the strength to 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.200
 music and in a variety of tuning 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.180
 Speaking of tuning it since the kids 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.090
 no changes whatsoever 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.010
 has undergone that very sad variety 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.319
 however still not enough 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.150
 if we talk about something in the beta, we do not 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.970
 seen then first and foremost 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.250
 groupings are coming along 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.890
 the plot and getting a membership in this elite 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.609
 street club called 5 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.130
 out of 10 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.410
 we can choose one of five 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.440
 groupings each of which is responsible 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.610
 for a particular area 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.710
 initially we can only choose 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.260
 between swaths and eagles 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.320
 but as far as pumping everything is unlocked 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.330
 the rest at maximum level 50 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.900
 the coolest becomes available 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.200
 bear grouping but you understand bears 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.419
 so here being in one way or another we 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.010
 we earn there a reputation from which in 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.100
 our daily depends 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.590
 salary and other pleasures also in pvp 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.260
 races you can arrange a kind of inter 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.690
 clan competitions and since we're 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.300
 touched pvp then let's talk about 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.510
 online component as a whole and this 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.580
 quite a problem part of the game do not know 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.220
 maybe bids internet speed but 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.050
 the players around are noticeably lagging that is 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.669
 driving with a friend around the city you can 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.919
 watch how his car is like 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.320
 basketball ball rides along the road 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.260
 then jerks back and forth as suddenly bang and 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.050
 he abruptly bumps you to guess what 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.630
 it will be extremely difficult again 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.039
 that maybe it's all my fault 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.810
 Internet connections if all of a sudden you 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.030
 not observed then say so to 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.800
 int ariy by the way we still heard complaints 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.230
 on problems with servers in the first days 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.330
 output but in our memory this never 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.590
 there was at least now everything 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.570
 works like a clock 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.020
 so afraid of reset flights 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.520
 statistics and other things do not stand with 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.440
 groups, too, as it is not well 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.600
 why is it not possible to create your own 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.139
 own yet it would be pretty 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.270
 logical for imam project but no 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.669
 limited to the notorious party to 4 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.440
 person who can share tags 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.260
 on the map as well as reging on 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.960
 There are all sorts of graphics in the game in 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.330
 Generally complaints that does not cause David 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.010
 and better but with such scales as well 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.510
 online component had to 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.520
 donate something else 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.740
 it's better to be a little less by car 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.470
 details but the world will not be 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.690
 remind cardboard decorations all the more 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.300
 that the game is very gentle relate to 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.030
 gland that will allow it to run even on 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.889
 troughs not the first freshness 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:29.550
 but one thing is very forgive 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:32.190
 difficult where the reflection in the mirrors and you know 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.010
 where are they in january in january 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.610
 they will add a lot of all the problems solving 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.810
 patch 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.340
 but what's stopping to think about it before the release 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.650
 reflection in the mirrors is too important 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.390
 aspect to neglect them or 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.880
 the developers thought with a view of 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.729
 Salon nobody plays well and the rest 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.010
 for crew great racing certainly not without 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:55.110
 problems inherent in his project for example 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.570
 so far poorly represented than yourself 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.479
 hold on passing the whole plot and 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.669
 tests here it will all depend on 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:06.030
 project support by developers 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:08.460
 but one thing we know is definitely not a plot not 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.630
 the test is not the game process itself is not 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.180
 will make you bored 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:15.840
 very long time especially if 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.919
 spend it with friends on this 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.139
 perhaps all 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:21.510
 scriptwriter and montage Vladimir 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:24.090
