00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
slightly so that we can check it out in

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.179 
slightly so that we can check it out in
real<00:01:30.299> time<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.840> oops<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.710> didn't<00:01:31.950> mean<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
there are a lot of blocks in this

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.550 
there are a lot of blocks in this

builder that don't actually exist in
Lego<00:01:40.829> worlds<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.060> make<00:01:42.210> something<00:01:42.420> with

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
Lego worlds if you make something with

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.600 
Lego worlds if you make something with
those<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.049> not<00:01:43.140> going<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> work<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.310> we're

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
those it's not going to work so we're

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.969 
those it's not going to work so we're
going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.939> use<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.420> custom<00:01:45.960> palette<00:01:46.619> which<00:01:46.950> is

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
going to use a custom palette which is

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.969 
going to use a custom palette which is
actually<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.850> called<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.649> filter<00:01:49.649> brick

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
actually here it's called a filter brick

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.760 
actually here it's called a filter brick
bricks<00:01:50.610> buy<00:01:50.820> boxes<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.780> we're<00:01:52.439> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.590> use

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
bricks buy boxes and we're going to use

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.789 
bricks buy boxes and we're going to use
the<00:01:52.979> custom<00:01:53.460> Lego<00:01:53.790> worlds<00:01:54.240> palette<00:01:54.799> somebody

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the custom Lego worlds palette somebody

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.350 
the custom Lego worlds palette somebody
actually<00:01:56.280> already<00:01:56.549> made<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.030> didn't<00:01:57.240> put

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
super fancy and this is how easy

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.250 
super fancy and this is how easy
building<00:02:29.610> should<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:30.060> inside<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.600> Lego<00:02:30.930> worlds

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
building should be inside of Lego worlds

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.410 
building should be inside of Lego worlds
in<00:02:31.380> my<00:02:31.530> opinion<00:02:31.980> but<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.000> nice<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.300> easy

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
is save the project okay and then we

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.630 
is save the project okay and then we
need<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.530> do<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:42.110> first<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.230> all<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.250> nice

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
camera angle of it because you need to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.020 
camera angle of it because you need to
make<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.680> picture<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:47.910> can

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030

find<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.390> easier<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.780> Lego<00:02:48.990> worlds<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.280> right

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
find it easier in Lego worlds so right

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.010 
find it easier in Lego worlds so right
here<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.970> tool<00:02:51.150> box<00:02:51.360> there<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.780> take<00:02:51.990> a

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
here in the tool box there is take a

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.470 
here in the tool box there is take a
screenshot<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:53.550> I'm<00:02:53.610> going<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.060> and

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
screenshot so I'm going to do that and

screenshot so I'm going to do that and
we'll<00:02:54.750> call<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.260> simple<00:02:55.800> couch<00:02:55.980> -<00:02:56.870> because<00:02:57.870> I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
we'll call it a simple couch - because I

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.630 
we'll call it a simple couch - because I
don't<00:02:58.050> want<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.260> overwrite<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.370> actual

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
to export the model and this is

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.570 
to export the model and this is
important<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.470> need<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.680> export<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.130> as<00:03:05.280> an

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
important you need to export it as an

excel<00:03:06.920> XML<00:03:07.920> file<00:03:09.260> right<00:03:10.260> there<00:03:10.290> okay<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:10.980> make

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
excel XML file right there okay and make

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.010 
excel XML file right there okay and make
sure<00:03:11.430> it's<00:03:11.580> named<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.910> same<00:03:12.180> as<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.870> picture

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
you just made it so simple couch - now

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.340 
you just made it so simple couch - now
that's<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.390> user<00:03:18.540> palette<00:03:18.900> thing<00:03:19.080> which<00:03:19.230> I'll

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
that's the user palette thing which I'll

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.300 
that's the user palette thing which I'll
show<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.560> how<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.770> do<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.940> moment

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310
