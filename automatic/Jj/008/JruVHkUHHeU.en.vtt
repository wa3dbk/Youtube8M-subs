00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.109 
know don't drop the soap lads and it
seems<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.710> prediction<00:01:50.580> may<00:01:50.850> have

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
seems like that prediction may have

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.660 
seems like that prediction may have
indeed<00:01:51.390> come<00:01:51.810> true<00:01:52.380> hopefully<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.610> stay

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
indeed come true hopefully they stay

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.050 
indeed come true hopefully they stay
gone<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.510> they<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.840> indeed<00:01:55.260> gone<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.850> well

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
gone if they are indeed gone and as well

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
they didn't really do anything they were

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.320 
they didn't really do anything they were
just<00:01:58.590> kind<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.799> being<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.010> nuisance<00:01:59.189> and<00:02:00.000> even

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
just kind of being a nuisance and even

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.700 
just kind of being a nuisance and even
if<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.510> wasn't<00:02:00.689> them<00:02:00.990> they<00:02:01.229> were<00:02:01.320> still<00:02:01.439> taking

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
if it wasn't them they were still taking

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.649 
if it wasn't them they were still taking
notice<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:02.670> claim<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:03.240> all<00:02:03.330> this<00:02:03.479> stuff
