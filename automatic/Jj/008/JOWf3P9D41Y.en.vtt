short course truck combo right and it's
the<00:00:12.150> Sidewinder<00:00:12.719> SCT<00:00:13.259> combo<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> new

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
the Sidewinder SCT combo this is a new

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.790 
the Sidewinder SCT combo this is a new
Sidewinder<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> next<00:00:16.320> version<00:00:16.710> of

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
Sidewinder it's it's the next version of

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800 
Sidewinder it's it's the next version of
Sidewinder<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.520> its<00:00:17.910> first<00:00:18.119> showing<00:00:18.420> up<00:00:18.539> here

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
Sidewinder and its first showing up here

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.980 
Sidewinder and its first showing up here
as<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.230> SCT<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:20.609> new<00:00:20.820> Sidewinder<00:00:21.539> has<00:00:21.720> about

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
as the SCT the new Sidewinder has about

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.560 
as the SCT the new Sidewinder has about
40%<00:00:22.380> more<00:00:22.859> power<00:00:23.189> handling<00:00:23.670> than<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.359> old

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
40% more power handling than the old

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.620 
40% more power handling than the old
Sidewinder<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.310> actually<00:00:26.760> really<00:00:27.330> close

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
Sidewinder so it's actually really close

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.839 
Sidewinder so it's actually really close
to<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> old<00:00:28.109> Mamba<00:00:28.500> Macs<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.130> power<00:00:29.460> handling

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
to the old Mamba Macs in power handling

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.770 
to the old Mamba Macs in power handling

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
so as the motor pushes it around you're

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.969 
so as the motor pushes it around you're
only<00:01:40.920> got<00:01:41.250> two<00:01:41.729> sides<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.240> push<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:43.500> 4-pole

only got two sides to push the 4-pole

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.710 
only got two sides to push the 4-pole
rotor<00:01:44.399> which<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.299> one

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
rotor which is this one

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.240 
rotor which is this one
you<00:01:45.899> see<00:01:46.079> there's<00:01:46.259> four<00:01:46.560> magnets<00:01:47.009> wrapped

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you see there's four magnets wrapped

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.639 
you see there's four magnets wrapped
around<00:01:47.430> there<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.420> each<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.229> them<00:01:49.439> is

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
around there so each one of them is

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.190 
around there so each one of them is
being<00:01:50.340> pushed<00:01:50.670> around<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.149> circle<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.750> it's

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
being pushed around the circle so it's

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.700 
being pushed around the circle so it's
kind<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> same<00:01:52.710> idea<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:54.710> v6

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
kind of the same idea as going from a v6

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.899 
kind of the same idea as going from a v6
to<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> v8<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> v10<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.200> many<00:01:58.409> more

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
to a v8 to a v10 you have that many more

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
to a v8 to a v10 you have that many more
occasions<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.689> power<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.320> applied<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
occasions for power to be applied to the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.440 
occasions for power to be applied to the
rotor<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.850> course<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> single

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
rotor in the course of a single

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.980 
rotor in the course of a single
revolution<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.549> get<00:02:05.850> about<00:02:06.210> 30%<00:02:06.960> more

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
revolution so you get about 30% more

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.869 
revolution so you get about 30% more
torque<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.950> four<00:02:08.190> pole<00:02:08.399> motor<00:02:08.610> than<00:02:08.819> you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
torque out of a four pole motor than you

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.300 
torque out of a four pole motor than you
do<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.239> two<00:02:09.390> pole<00:02:09.569> hey<00:02:10.229> 30%<00:02:10.950> more<00:02:11.039> torque

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
do out of a two pole hey 30% more torque

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.559 
do out of a two pole hey 30% more torque
you<00:02:11.430> should<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.670> able<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.940> feel<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.120> pretty

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
you should be able to feel that pretty

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.949 
you should be able to feel that pretty
easily

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
easily

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.589 
easily
and<00:02:13.939> again<00:02:14.939> you'll<00:02:15.120> be<00:02:15.150> at<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.299> front<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
and again you'll be at the front of the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.599 
and again you'll be at the front of the
pack<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.319> that's<00:02:16.469> what<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.769> motors<00:02:17.129> look<00:02:17.370> like

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
pack so that's what the motors look like

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.869 
pack so that's what the motors look like
on<00:02:18.510> these<00:02:19.140> were<00:02:19.379> going<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.739> 14-10<00:02:20.549> and

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
on these were going with a 14-10 and

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.729 
on these were going with a 14-10 and
that's<00:02:22.189> the<00:02:23.189> new<00:02:23.579> motors<00:02:24.500> Newcastle<00:02:25.500> motor

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
that's the new motors Newcastle motor

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.860 
that's the new motors Newcastle motor
type<00:02:26.040> nomenclature<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.239> what<00:02:27.329> that<00:02:27.420> means<00:02:27.629> is

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
type nomenclature so what that means is

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.550 
type nomenclature so what that means is
it's<00:02:28.049> 1.4<00:02:28.709> inches<00:02:29.900> in<00:02:31.879> diameter<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.389> the<00:02:34.230> 10

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
it's 1.4 inches in diameter and the 10

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.309 
it's 1.4 inches in diameter and the 10
is<00:02:34.859> the<00:02:35.250> stack<00:02:35.609> length<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.689> the<00:02:36.870> 10<00:02:37.079> means

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
is the stack length and the 10 means

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.580 
is the stack length and the 10 means
it's<00:02:37.500> 1<00:02:37.680> inch<00:02:37.859> all<00:02:38.189> right<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.549> this<00:02:38.639> is<00:02:38.700> inches

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
it's 1 inch all right so this is inches

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.270 
it's 1 inch all right so this is inches
so<00:02:40.590> that's<00:02:41.280> that's<00:02:41.670> what<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:41.909> got<00:02:43.099> great<00:02:44.099> so

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
so that's that's what you got great so

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.250 
so that's that's what you got great so
