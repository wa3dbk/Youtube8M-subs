of your they are open it to go in get a
brush<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.250> what<00:00:26.699> you're<00:00:26.820> gonna<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.090> is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
brush and what what you're gonna do is

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.490 
brush and what what you're gonna do is

turn the hardness up on it done simply

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.280 
turn the hardness up on it done simply
go<00:00:32.279> back<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> color<00:00:32.899> just<00:00:33.899> gonna<00:00:34.140> do

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
go back to the color just gonna do

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.080 
go back to the color just gonna do
Redknapp<00:00:35.270> turn<00:00:36.270> an<00:00:36.360> oprah<00:00:36.800> make<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> bigger

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
Redknapp turn an oprah make a bigger

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:49.870 
Redknapp turn an oprah make a bigger
whatever<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:40.050> could<00:00:40.200> bigger<00:00:42.590> gentle<00:00:43.590> colder

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:01:07.730 

you<00:00:50.450> get<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.690> general<00:00:50.840> idea<00:00:52.570> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.280 

I<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.340> there's<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.579> bit<00:01:08.700> smaller

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.390 

no<00:01:15.860> part<00:01:16.310> cyclist<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:16.880> a<00:01:16.910> kind<00:01:17.510> of<00:01:17.630> a<00:01:17.720> bad<00:01:17.900> angle

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
no part cyclist is a kind of a bad angle

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.580 
no part cyclist is a kind of a bad angle
so<00:01:19.400> what<00:01:19.760> I'm<00:01:19.850> gonna<00:01:20.000> do<00:01:20.210> is<00:01:20.240> just<00:01:20.660> simply<00:01:21.320> call

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
so what I'm gonna do is just simply call

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.930 
so what I'm gonna do is just simply call
her<00:01:21.740> down<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:21.950> tiny<00:01:22.220> bit<00:01:24.400> now<00:01:25.400> you<00:01:25.460> can<00:01:25.700> choose

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
her down a tiny bit now you can choose

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.300 
her down a tiny bit now you can choose
say<00:01:28.330> another<00:01:29.330> core<00:01:29.630> right<00:01:29.660> and<00:01:30.260> sadly<00:01:31.040> Phil

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
say another core right and sadly Phil

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.620 
say another core right and sadly Phil
now<00:01:32.270> once<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.750> have<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:32.960> set<00:01:33.110> up<00:01:33.140> like<00:01:33.590> that

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
now once you have it set up like that

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.020 
now once you have it set up like that
anything<00:01:35.630> went<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.870> filter<00:01:36.670> blur<00:01:37.670> and

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
anything went to filter blur and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.240 
anything went to filter blur and
Gaussian<00:01:38.690> blur<00:01:41.290> okay<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:42.830> have<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.130> open

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
Gaussian blur okay so we have that open

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.800 
Gaussian blur okay so we have that open
as<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:44.420> can<00:01:44.510> see<00:01:44.690> it's<00:01:44.960> slightly<00:01:45.890> blurry<00:01:46.280> not

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
as you can see it's slightly blurry not

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.390 
as you can see it's slightly blurry not
blurry<00:01:47.810> enough<00:01:48.050> though<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:48.920> you're<00:01:49.160> going<00:01:49.280> to

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
blurry enough though so you're going to

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.400 
blurry enough though so you're going to
set<00:01:49.729> it<00:01:49.820> up<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.900> radius<00:01:51.410> higher<00:01:52.750> until<00:01:53.750> you

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
set it up the radius higher until you

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.770 
set it up the radius higher until you
get<00:01:54.590> whole<00:01:54.920> team<00:01:55.100> speed<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:55.780> extremely

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
get whole team speed and extremely

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.350 
get whole team speed and extremely
blurry<00:01:59.410> see<00:02:00.410> when<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:00.710> order<00:02:00.950> /<00:02:01.100> gets<00:02:01.360> bigger

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
blurry see when you order / gets bigger

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.469 
blurry see when you order / gets bigger

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.370 

and<00:02:29.620> now<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:29.890> can<00:02:30.280> see<00:02:30.520> where<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:31.230> sits<00:02:32.230> on

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
and now I can see where this sits on

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.730 
and now I can see where this sits on
pencil<00:02:32.710> for<00:02:32.830> some<00:02:32.980> reason<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.490> going<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.180> brush

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
pencil for some reason so going to brush

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
pencil for some reason so going to brush
and<00:02:35.740> make<00:02:35.890> sure<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.100> hydrants<00:02:36.460> is<00:02:36.580> off

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
and make sure the hydrants is off

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.750 
and make sure the hydrants is off
otherwise<00:02:37.120> it's<00:02:37.480> gonna<00:02:37.950> squirt<00:02:38.950> off<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:39.550> just

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
otherwise it's gonna squirt off so just

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.490 
otherwise it's gonna squirt off so just
simply<00:02:40.090> try<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.360> brush<00:02:41.580> around<00:02:44.970> besides<00:02:46.500> it's

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
simply try to brush around besides it's

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.080 
simply try to brush around besides it's
