00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.810 
nut now you might think that the nuts
gonna<00:01:45.530> interfere<00:01:46.039> with<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.310> plate<00:01:46.549> laying

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
gonna interfere with the plate laying

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.999 
gonna interfere with the plate laying
and<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.060> chassis<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:47.509> it<00:01:47.840> won't<00:01:48.049> believe<00:01:48.740> me

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
and the chassis but it won't believe me

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.149 
and the chassis but it won't believe me
this<00:01:49.430> plate<00:01:49.820> floats<00:01:50.299> just<00:01:50.780> above<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.680> chassis

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
this plate floats just above the chassis

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.740 
this plate floats just above the chassis
so<00:01:52.399> it's<00:01:52.609> not<00:01:52.789> gonna<00:01:52.939> interfere<00:01:53.149> with<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.630> at

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
so it's not gonna interfere with it at

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.779 
so it's not gonna interfere with it at
all<00:01:53.899> now<00:01:54.500> I'm<00:01:54.890> just<00:01:55.039> gonna<00:01:55.159> go<00:01:55.399> ahead<00:01:55.520> and

a nitro it's gonna need a lot of
cleaning<00:03:33.799> and<00:03:33.950> on<00:03:34.459> top<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.330> think<00:03:35.780> it

really doesn't cost that much and it

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.380 
really doesn't cost that much and it
doesn't<00:03:51.950> take<00:03:52.250> that<00:03:52.280> much<00:03:52.579> of<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.030> modification

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
doesn't take that much of a modification

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.870 
doesn't take that much of a modification
I<00:03:53.959> mean<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.799> hardest<00:03:55.190> thing<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.700> have

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
I mean the hardest thing that you have

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.120 
I mean the hardest thing that you have
to<00:03:56.060> figure<00:03:56.239> out<00:03:56.360> is<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.230> screw<00:03:57.530> size<00:03:57.769> and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
to figure out is the screw size and

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.009 
to figure out is the screw size and
believe<00:03:58.459> me<00:03:58.700> if<00:03:59.239> you<00:03:59.299> have<00:03:59.540> a<00:03:59.570> whole<00:03:59.750> bunch<00:03:59.930> of

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
believe me if you have a whole bunch of

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.810 
believe me if you have a whole bunch of
stock<00:04:00.350> screws<00:04:00.709> laying<00:04:00.950> around<00:04:01.100> you'll<00:04:01.640> be

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
stock screws laying around you'll be

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.580 
stock screws laying around you'll be
able<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.120> figure<00:04:02.299> it<00:04:02.420> out<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.470> was

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
able to figure it out and that was

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.570 
able to figure it out and that was
