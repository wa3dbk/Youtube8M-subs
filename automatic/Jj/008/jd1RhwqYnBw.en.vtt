it's quite easy to open its reveals the

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.620 
it's quite easy to open its reveals the
microUSB<00:01:12.100> port<00:01:14.520> got<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.550> screen<00:01:15.970> lock<00:01:16.180> button

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
microUSB port got a screen lock button

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.190 
microUSB port got a screen lock button
there<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:19.210> then<00:01:19.360> on<00:01:19.480> the<00:01:19.570> back<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.990> 5

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
there and then on the back of the 5

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.150 
there and then on the back of the 5
megapixel<00:01:20.440> camera<00:01:21.660> so<00:01:22.660> all<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.350> all<00:01:23.440> really

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
megapixel camera so all in all really

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.440 
megapixel camera so all in all really
nice<00:01:24.280> looking<00:01:24.670> thing<00:01:27.120> that's<00:01:28.120> only<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.390> half

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
nice looking thing that's only the half

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.950 
nice looking thing that's only the half
of<00:01:28.720> it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
of it

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.510 
of it
let's<00:01:29.110> have<00:01:29.260> a<00:01:29.290> look<00:01:29.470> see<00:01:29.980> what<00:01:30.010> else<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.400> can

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
let's have a look see what else it can

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.900 
let's have a look see what else it can
do<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:36.160> first<00:01:36.430> thing<00:01:36.610> you'll<00:01:36.730> notice

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
do the first thing you'll notice

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.890 
do the first thing you'll notice
straight<00:01:37.390> aways

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
straight aways

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
straight aways
it's<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.040> touch<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:40.810> your<00:01:40.990> touch<00:01:41.170> screen

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it's the touch with your touch screen

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.280 
it's the touch with your touch screen
dominates<00:01:42.700> pretty<00:01:43.630> much<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.900> whole<00:01:44.050> of<00:01:44.200> the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
dominates pretty much the whole of the

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.770 
dominates pretty much the whole of the
front<00:01:44.500> of<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.680> phone<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:45.450> mean<00:01:46.450> that's<00:01:46.600> why

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
front of the phone I mean that's why

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.460 
front of the phone I mean that's why
it's<00:01:46.930> so<00:01:47.110> long<00:01:48.150> we<00:01:49.150> also<00:01:49.330> got<00:01:49.600> s-class<00:01:50.080> running

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
it's so long we also got s-class running

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.390 
it's so long we also got s-class running
on<00:01:50.590> here<00:01:50.770> which<00:01:51.160> is<00:01:51.190> LG's<00:01:51.850> 3d<00:01:52.360> user<00:01:52.600> interface

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
on here which is LG's 3d user interface

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.420 
on here which is LG's 3d user interface
ok<00:01:54.660> you<00:01:55.660> can<00:01:56.310> manipulate<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.790> or<00:01:58.000> 3d<00:01:58.360> cube

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
ok you can manipulate this or 3d cube

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.500 
ok you can manipulate this or 3d cube
get<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.550> different<00:02:00.880> areas<00:02:01.150> of<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.330> phone

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
get to different areas of the phone

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.920 
get to different areas of the phone
quickly<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.050> easily

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.580 

and<00:02:07.410> got<00:02:07.560> these<00:02:07.710> interactive<00:02:08.340> widgets<00:02:08.760> here

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
and got these interactive widgets here

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.780 
and got these interactive widgets here
which<00:02:11.570> calendar<00:02:12.570> clock<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:14.340> hold<00:02:14.640> down

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
which calendar clock and you hold down

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.840 
which calendar clock and you hold down
on<00:02:15.000> one<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:15.960> add<00:02:16.170> more<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:18.120> that's<00:02:18.540> a

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
on one you can add more so that's a

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.160 
on one you can add more so that's a
calculator<00:02:21.380> just<00:02:22.380> drop<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.620> there<00:02:24.530> okay

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
calculator just drop that there okay

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:37.520 
calculator just drop that there okay
then<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.260> brings<00:02:28.380> out

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.420 

you<00:02:38.100> say<00:02:38.310> no<00:02:38.840> main<00:02:39.840> menu<00:02:40.200> hit<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.220> can

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
you say no main menu hit and you can

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.610 
you say no main menu hit and you can
scroll<00:02:41.880> through<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.510> different<00:02:42.900> features

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
scroll through the different features

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.990 
scroll through the different features
you<00:02:46.620> know<00:02:46.770> highlights<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.550> really

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
you know highlights it is a really

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.140 
you know highlights it is a really
responsive<00:02:48.540> touchscreen<00:02:52.100> very<00:02:53.100> fluid<00:02:53.760> and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
responsive touchscreen very fluid and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.780 
responsive touchscreen very fluid and
then<00:02:54.270> have<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.510> put<00:02:54.630> much<00:02:54.810> pressure<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:55.260> at<00:02:55.410> all

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
then have to put much pressure on at all

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.600 
then have to put much pressure on at all
that's<00:02:56.790> down<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.980> capacitive<00:02:58.980> technology

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
that's down to capacitive technology

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.520 
that's down to capacitive technology
rather<00:02:59.819> than<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.390> resistive<00:03:01.290> where<00:03:01.440> you

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
rather than the resistive where you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.570 
rather than the resistive where you
actually<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.040> apply<00:03:02.310> pressure<00:03:04.370> let's<00:03:05.370> go

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
actually have to apply pressure let's go

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:28.500 
actually have to apply pressure let's go
into<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.880> browser

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.479 

and<00:03:29.050> saint-just<00:03:29.500> EPA<00:03:29.890> so<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.220> should<00:03:30.400> be

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
and saint-just EPA so it should be

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.309 
and saint-just EPA so it should be
fairly<00:03:30.760> quick<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.420> always<00:03:31.599> we<00:03:31.690> got<00:03:31.780> Wi-Fi<00:03:31.989> on

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
fairly quick you always we got Wi-Fi on

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.410 
fairly quick you always we got Wi-Fi on
there<00:03:32.470> as<00:03:32.530> well<00:03:32.590> if<00:03:32.799> you<00:03:33.030> happen<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.180> be<00:03:34.330> in<00:03:34.390> a

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
there as well if you happen to be in a

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.350 
there as well if you happen to be in a
hot<00:03:34.569> spot<00:03:37.409> and<00:03:38.409> then<00:03:38.560> again<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:38.920> can<00:03:39.040> see
