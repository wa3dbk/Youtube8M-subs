00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 interesting as some people do not 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.450
 believe in prosperity 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.240
 I really like this talk, I really like it 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.759
 this conversation because Jesus already 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.099
 alert for abundance I remember 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.940
 a scene where Jesus has been walking on 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.859
 the beach and he finds Pedro and says so 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.420
 I can climb on your boat. 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.310
 Pedro then looks scared to Jesus and 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.800
 Says Master clear can get on my boat 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.900
 and Jesus always came up with something in some 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.329
 place a little higher to be able to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.760
 address the crowd and those people 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.629
 gathered together the return of Jesus and Jesus spoke 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.829
 among other things one of the most 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.350
 interesting that I really like and where 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.750
 he says so I came that they should have 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.750
 life and life in abundance 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.390
 Pedro had stairs all night but no 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.820
 got nothing and all night 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.920
 those fishermen suffered and those 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.140
 fishermen worried that they were 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.950
 indebted countries and should be 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.070
 networks 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.940
 he would need to return this morning 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.220
 jesus says to pedro go to a strong 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.580
 to the sea plays net again 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.150
 Dra insists with jesus and says but jesus 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.369
 We tried to fish the whole night. 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.630
 we caught nothing we are fishermen 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.899
 professionals 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.000
 You're at most a carpenter. 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.369
 Jesus insists once again not 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.820
 being the professional fisherman jesus 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.420
 God has an unshakable faith in the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.360
 Our wonderful god says to Pedro. 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.640
 play the net once again what are we 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.610
 we have in this scene the lesson of prosperity 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.280
 the lesson of persistence the lesson of 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.390
 optimism many times we come in 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.280
 night house 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.350
 we feel that our play also gave 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.810
 so sure we feel we are 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.610
 playing in our network so many 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.610
 Sometimes we're not fishing. 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.110
 the last sentence of the spirit andrÃ© luiz 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.270
 psychographed by chico xavier 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.060
 I really like what you say more or less. 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.270
 so there is no harm in owning the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.940
 money barely derives from indy lancia 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.630
 when you give us money in the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.650
 has meaning prosperity is a 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.190
 your right 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.140
 make good use of it 11 with intelligence 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.010
 every time you think of 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.100
 to give up 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.200
 remember jesus saying to you 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.110
 play the net one more time 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.410
 and in the same way that Jesus put the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.700
 hands on Pedro's shoulders and asked to 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.190
 get on your boat 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.220
