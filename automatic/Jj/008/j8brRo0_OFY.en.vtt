cars.com auto review

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.320
Hi I'm Dave Thomas for cars.com

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.340
with the 2012 Chrysler 300 SRT

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.679
8 srt8 is the most powerful version
understand offered

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.040
as 474 got something in me

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.189
fifty thousand dollars in federally
something you want you talk about

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.640
SRT from price learn to play something
like this you're really talking about

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.450
the engine

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.480
gotta 6.4 liter v8 with 470 horsepower

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.690
4 170 pound-feet of torque both those
numbers are up significantly worse is

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.590
the outgoing model

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.590
I guess that they're a 16-under five
seconds the 303 design last year but

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.350
srt8 get some designs we saw it on this
year

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.910
most notably are larger and lower front
and rear bumpers

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.110
a black grille up front and his huge
20-inch wheels

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.270
it just a few changes inside the srt8
but they're

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.079
big changes and the biggest I did
gigantic seats up front

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.259
a huge side bolsters actually pretty
support our

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.600
over the long haul after over an hour
drive in my back does get a little

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.369
uncomfortable

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.179
however check out this two-tone interior
it's really calling at the Red not only

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.859
in the states

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.859
but also the doors and is this carbon
fiber trim

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.840
everywhere all its features are nice but
you're probably wondering how to this

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.539
hard drive

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.450
well as performance might think its
performance car but it's really not this

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.329
is what I would call a true muscle car

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.479
because it really excels in a straight
line you don't acquire too much

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.149
because it's such a heavy vehicle it's
not gonna perform in that way

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.209
but if you don't wanna leave a stoplight
really fast mash a fellow writer down

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:42.509
that the gray car

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.509
and of course you don't get all this
power without the trade-off in mileage

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.869
srt8 only gets 40 miles per gallon City
23 Highway

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.479
I'm eating caterpillar taxes a thousand
dollars I've done this for over a week

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.209
and all kinds of different conditions I
never got about 50 miles per gallon in

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.399
the back seat will get your passengers a
feeling that they're in a sporty sedan

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.690
have the same red leather is a front
it's nice white 13

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.000
the fact it's actually he did an srt8
now the only problem I have is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.760
the room now I have player room right
now the seats were had when I was

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.360
driving

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.250
I'm 5'10 and sure there's a few inches
but for this big a car

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.689
expect the bathroom your backseat at
fifty point three cubic feet 300 strike

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:30.540
is plenty big

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.920
for golf clubs luggage groceries
whatever you have at that time for

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.810
practicality

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.439
makes a high-performance version have a
traditional sedan so attractive on

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.409
improvements under the hood are
impressive and were blown away by the

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.379
style and the srt8 for 2012

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.360
it's much more understand the last model
definitely more so than the charger

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.379
merging the srt8 so if you wanna sleep
read the spotlight

00:02:53.379 --> 00:03:00.379
this is it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.050
