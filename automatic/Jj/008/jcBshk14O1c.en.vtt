00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hi, its hard people and today I came to record until 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.960
 notebook tag that today is super fun 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.480
 when i first saw in canada 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.980
 English became personal and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.929
 we basically every song we 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.670
 will relate to a book I found very 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.859
 cool so we do not get going 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.050
 let the creator of the land down here 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.480
 and the person who modified the tag 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.269
 originally had ten days ten songs 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.150
 in case and there is a person who was axn 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.519
 technical so the two little questions the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.349
 two more songs and I'll do it here 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.050
 have two more songs added or 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.000
 be 1 12 songs is leave all the pec 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.440
 image with the bradesco who who 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.690
 I want to see a video of it also 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.820
 first song is will never die but 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 rather it is a book you loved 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.719
 a lot of stuff he turned and you had to 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.550
 cut relationships 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.050
 It was an easy think some of you 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.090
 more time can 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 Guess what I'm going to choose is the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.539
 rescue the tiger badly in chile ie the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.010
 Tiger Failure 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.530
 I really liked the first volume 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.930
 and I did not like the second 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.399
 I did not like it at all and then I knew 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.650
 what happened in the next days will 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.650
 getting more and more angry and told 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.610
 totally in relation to series 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.960
 unfortunately it is not because when he 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.909
 first I did not think it was 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.500
 happen younger that he does not know that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.310
 accompany him to the end for you too 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.080
 the first 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.990
 already the second one I did not like the next song 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.659
 head book with a red cover for 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.549
 focus on red I chose panels 451 from 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.380
 ray bradbury that he would be very 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.570
 Next song by Bach I gave a book that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.659
 If it makes you feel ours make you feel our 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.070
 I 'm going to pick a fado I have 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.110
 a sense of nostalgia is very great 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.909
 with the book I do not know why but not 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.490
 choosing this book I feel good in 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.530
 good fragmentation then I remember the time 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.960
 I read it and I remember it . 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.610
 I really like the boy from 2010 or 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.140
 stay in cell left the photo here of the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.960
 book because I do not have this book 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.729
 unfortunately it was thought at the time I 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.340
 I never bought but when I liked it 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.450
 quite a good kick in the neighbor and well 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.270
 nice to read 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.979
 is a very good feeling since the time that the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.969
 book is quite the same I think it should have 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.070
 been there in 2009 2010 something like this. 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:10.920
 story the next story the next 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.260
 music is crazy story in a book that 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.540
 have a baby for a book that has 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.640
 prohibited is not so serious but settled 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.989
 it is forbidden, it was not a law that is a 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.120
 perfect gentleman from julie coin 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.190
 third volume of the bug series 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.349
 because he makes a pass killed a layer 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.959
 lower social or néné and she has to 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.690
 live to work and I do not know what and today 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.390
 are familiar to play so they do not 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.340
 can get involved and has a statue in 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.810
 this impediment throughout the book today 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.640
 we know everyone is free in 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.470
 that were not happy endings so he 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.880
 Tell them they 're going to be together at school. 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.650
 end the love of god 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.819
 so as something forbidden I'm going to put 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.310
 a perfect gentleman who is a book 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.420
 very cute too advanced places 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.010
 which I did not like throughout history 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.170
 I explained what I said in the review 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.150
 It's a very cute book. I really like this book. 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.130
 series as you well know the next 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.139
 music is very good and I keep on 2008 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.690
 played is bad because you can not 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.609
 fall in love with the bad boy village and 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.590
 was chosen the seventh 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.100
 volume of the series the image of Minas Gerais 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.010
 because I see it's super boy he 's the owner 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.870
 of a nightclub that has the flippers it is the 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:24.000
 lord of drugs he sells drugs 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:26.190
 illicit is super boy even but with 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.480
 sure fits very well into the ring and 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.799
 today I speak for who he really is 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.630
 problem so much that the passage of this 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.380
 God's love book goes through several 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.980
 problems 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.650
 such is the next to be excluded that 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.299
 someone if at the end of it for you like 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.950
 gentle gentle Regent was like the people 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.650
 because I had a spoiler in everything that is 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.260
 I never cant stop spoiler I'm will be 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.480
 the only goal of the Spaniards I get myself 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.650
 keep is clean of the Spaniards but this 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.000
 what was possible 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.190
 I just got history on instagram. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.859
 photo of nothing to see I've read something 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.109
 of the mine counting the spoils of his book 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.090
 that the actress herself to the little law of 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.500
 a collection of convenient end in the same 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.990
 collective of the company all 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.640
 all reporters is very funny the 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.920
 video I will leave here down link to 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.930
 you watch the hilarious reaction of the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.690
 reporter with the best against spoiler 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.180
 anyway of course if you were the video 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.549
 you will also know from the history of 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.980
 obvious, I 'll never be able to 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.989
 know how it would have been that convergent 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.760
 if I did not know about this end then I 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.410
 I think even in 12 countries and Lula 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.970
 for me because I knew it would 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.430
 happen and I kind of really changed 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.900
 the next one is britten recht in a 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.790
 character of a book that passed through 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.530
 a great change and for that I chose 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.940
 white red vest with the blood of the 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.580
 sale auction that is one of my 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.680
 favorite authors 16 year old he 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.840
 goes through a very strong change over the 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.790
 of the book is a training novel he 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.860
 starts today and ends in another 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.590
 many things happen unexpectedly in the 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.540
 His life and I think a lot of people love to 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.490
 help come could also have chosen 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.380
 things that nobody knows as the same 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.030
 anything character information was 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.950
 a change program but I ended up 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.630
 paying for it here that I think I said 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.630
 about impact in his life is a 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.010
 specific event of the book as well 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.260
 have a blog 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.390
 the next and neither by IMF is the launch 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.800
 more expensive with you from the moment 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.930
 the book when they expect much of the moment 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.760
 It is the continuation of the white party 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.310
 the king's daughters in the second volume of that 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.990
 May colors series reads too much 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.030
 knowing continued'll let the picture of 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.840
 book here for you want is 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.490
 forever 21 favorite book couple 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.320
 could have chosen can as the couple 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.479
 Seriously, you 'll deal with the kisses I 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.710
 I love couples but look for a 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.229
 I mean, the series, since I already showed up. 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.570
 our tag I chose the side and accept the 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.760
 rappers series death very much 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.220
 made a noise as if the game was 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.900
 very sure yes they are different in 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.400
 several aspects but they combine a lot 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.690
 right and this is our moment of theirs 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.580
 is growing throughout the books of 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.200
 this series is the fourth is the next to the last 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.570
 finish fifth 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.310
 Anyway, I really like these characters. 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.440
 from this couple both favorite channels 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:04.870
 in this series here is my case preferring 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:08.650
 so read this week at 1 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.180
 to the tenth is kardec river a book that 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.070
 You do not like to borrow for not 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.600
 want to miss him 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.310
 I like to know so much the books 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.960
 It depends on the person but the books I 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.760
 really does not lend me independent 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.530
 of the person are the autographed books 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.360
 because anything that happens with 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.250
 they will not get another one like that 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.900
 so much as I lend some 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.310
 books that happened the accident the person 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.140
 still another one 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.150
 supposedly the person present at a 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.430
 another gift will no longer give me a 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.840
 another new one since she was in the book 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.490
 one more autographed book would be 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.530
 impossible then the use of books 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.320
 autographed I do not lend to anyone 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.360
 next is had drops online makes a 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.730
 book that made me cry a lot I'll be 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.040
 repeat for the thousandth time will tell 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.060
 girl who stole books because I think 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.500
 which was the book I loved most in 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.090
 my life along with him asleep 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.920
 of the legitimate so I always stay 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.260
 repeating these two and I cried more 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.090
 cynical bolivia I read 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.820
 At this stage they always think it's beautiful. 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.500
 Perfect USA in 2008 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.230
 in early 2008 and I remember 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.630
 perfectly his reading of this 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:11.380
 experience of crying and that one 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:14.020
 agony of the movie I also cried the next 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.760
 arrives off that at a pace newer ship 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.580
 that the most recent clip of 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.100
 made a book that you love very much and that 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.800
 you do not pay even for the other kings 26 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.270
 well I could not think of specific 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.310
 but I'm basically going to tell you 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.900
 Everyone I really like in the book I do not 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.450
 not even the people that people go to 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.640
 say if they do not like the business 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.110
 in this book I think it's horrible who does this 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.940
 What I stop liking is what 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.040
 and nobody has anything to do with goals 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.200
 of nobody all the books that bosh that 

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.780
 Eat for something I do not like then. 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.210
 It's all there and it does not matter, I want it 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.650
 know that I like and that's it 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.480
 I hope you have showed 

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.980
 in order to be able to even mark 

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.290
 Lets me think I had not thought about 

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.320
 advance will mark to them much 

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:59.560
 military the ex-santa parra area of ​​the books 

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.850
 and fuxicos tied literature and if case 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.620
 I do not know if people were not a 

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:07.390
 home or not but let's go 

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.740
 the mass of lava and rice to the wake of dl 

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.889
 the spring 

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.330
 It's a party for now, I do not know who 

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:15.880
 will win with the tag that does not record a 

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.150
 kiss your big with everyone and even the 

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.150
 next
