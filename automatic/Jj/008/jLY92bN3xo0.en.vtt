00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:09.669
 yes I think we all know that in 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.660
 Brunswick probably ours 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.089
 bad game 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.129
 last year was the whole 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:19.120
 normal that every team has around 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:21.300
 we talked about it in training 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.490
 or on sunday then have it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.500
 processed and therefore it works 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.010
 We held a new task for a long time 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.570
 in front of the breast 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.650
 yes, there are always things you can do 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.510
 I think with the combines have 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.329
 defensive I can improve myself 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.489
 because what the trainer with many many 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.629
 Things in the tactical area around us 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.640
 I can think better forward 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.859
 I have a certain quality knows 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.510
 me that can always bring but there 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.559
 Of course he has to me what the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.379
 first four games is still a 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.510
 a little more is coming , I do not think so 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.309
 not bad but not exactly 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.350
 well that you have to say honestly before 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.519
 everything in the game in duisburg would have 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.499
 probably have to be two more 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.539
 but is also not essential beinbruch 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.059
 after all, the dropout is there 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.699
 normal that there are ups and downs we are 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.409
 have to look that we are on ours 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.810
 focus and then I believe 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.689
 which still has many points in the league 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.100
 there is against greuther forth with one 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.689
 my best friends are the trekkers 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.549
 Of course, I am looking forward to killing it 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.259
 but otherwise I 'm glad 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.079
 theoretically you can play cool in advance 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.369
 games on the betzenberg or elsewhere 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.869
 Of course, she really horny states there 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.630
 you are happy because you know then it is 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.600
 the last one where we wanted to go 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.000
 more there and now it is right 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.479
 to gain a foothold and to get many points 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.520
 no it other for me so do the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.689
 as always, I'm behind 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.369
 for some, for example, they are special 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.350
 for me or I hope all of us 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.000
 Games is another very important game 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.700
 for us and accordingly 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.679
 smart forfour man already realizes that now 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.240
 wants to make everyone look good on Saturday 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.340
 or on friday as I said not so good 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.570
 were that we are fully there that we 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.780
 go into the battles as well as it 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.260
 have to be 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.610
 The coach has addressed the things 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.100
 we try to implement 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.900
 Now I am in good mood for Saturday yes 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.180
 as a loser, they probably have 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.229
 also certain certain claims internet 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.490
 Of course, they will follow suit 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.489
 but I will communicate outside 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.440
 think there's a lot of work to do 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.750
 jobs are not the moment we have to 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.190
 put our player on the field 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.410
 win battles and then we have 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.690
 We finally have a good chance 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.430
 play noticed how are the fans 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.959
 can say how important the twelfth 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.480
 man is for us im have us in 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.950
 We are registered in certain games 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.810
 Of course, sooner for everyone than one 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.730
 every one of them support it 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.980
 I know I go in every game 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.900
 to win or we all we 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.030
 in every game purely to get points 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.940
 Of course , there are some on the one side 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.950
 It would often be heavy at home to others 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.720
 maybe a bit simple but ask 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.310
 a game like any other 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.260
 there is and we have to look that we 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.819
 That's us the coach pretends good 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.750
 then implement the battles win 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.750
 we can win everywhere 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.420
 it is the possibility of movement 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.190
 just beyond its borders to 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.489
 maybe go a bit the feeling 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.489
 to fly 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.120
 It is important to me that you look at the 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.120
 leave health insurance
