come<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.789> handy<00:00:47.969> later<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.680> generally<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
come in handy later but generally the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.770 
come in handy later but generally the
games<00:00:49.980> workshop<00:00:50.399> wonder<00:00:51.199> wasn't<00:00:52.199> sufficient

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
games workshop wonder wasn't sufficient

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.020 
games workshop wonder wasn't sufficient
this<00:00:55.670> sort<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:57.680> truck<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.859> came<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.520> two

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
this sort of a truck here came with two

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.410 
this sort of a truck here came with two
different<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.539> backs<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:01.829> was<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.420> giant

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
different of backs one was the giant

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.340 
different of backs one was the giant
missile<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.840> other<00:01:03.989> one<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.199> this

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
missile and the other one was this

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.649 
missile and the other one was this
missile<00:01:04.680> pod<00:01:04.890> they<00:01:05.760> were<00:01:05.880> actually<00:01:06.060> swappable

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
missile pod they were actually swappable

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.649 
missile pod they were actually swappable
right<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.439> could<00:01:07.619> replace<00:01:08.490> them<00:01:08.820> this

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
right here you could replace them this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.320 
right here you could replace them this
one<00:01:09.900> actually<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.500> will<00:01:11.369> fire<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.090> press

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
one actually I'm will fire if you press

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.240 
one actually I'm will fire if you press
the<00:01:12.510> button<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:15.380> fires<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.470> little<00:01:16.710> missile<00:01:17.040> I

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the button and fires a little missile I

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.990 
the button and fires a little missile I
probably<00:01:18.090> won't<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.450> using<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:19.850> but<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.880> do

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
probably won't be using that but I do

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.789 
probably won't be using that but I do
like<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.420> base<00:01:21.950> as<00:01:22.950> sort<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.799> set

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
like this base as sort of the set

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.810 
like this base as sort of the set
setting<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.330> missile<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.640> was

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
setting for the the missile so I was

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.069 
setting for the the missile so I was
probably<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> combine<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.600> two<00:01:30.990> here

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
probably going to combine the two here

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.380 
probably going to combine the two here
so<00:01:34.759> grab<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.790> missile<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:38.280> its<00:01:38.700> back<00:01:38.939> portion

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
so grab the missile and its back portion

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.639 
so grab the missile and its back portion
as<00:01:39.479> well<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.140> rid<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> truck<00:01:45.590> see<00:01:46.590> if

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
as well you get rid of the truck see if

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:58.560 
as well you get rid of the truck see if
I<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.860> snap<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.280> off<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.670> my<00:01:47.850> hand

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.560 

so<00:01:59.570> what<00:01:59.719> we're<00:01:59.869> left<00:02:00.020> over<00:02:00.380> with<00:02:01.090> are<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.149> few

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
so what we're left over with are a few

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.469 
so what we're left over with are a few
different<00:02:02.630> pieces<00:02:03.020> here<00:02:04.929> mainly<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:07.479> rocket

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
different pieces here mainly the rocket

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.970 
different pieces here mainly the rocket
holster<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:14.540> frame<00:02:15.410> which<00:02:15.620> i'm<00:02:15.769> going<00:02:15.890> to

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
holster and the frame which i'm going to

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.390 
holster and the frame which i'm going to
use<00:02:16.750> now<00:02:17.750> i<00:02:17.780> have<00:02:17.959> some<00:02:18.200> bits<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.650> my<00:02:18.830> basilisk

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
use now i have some bits of my basilisk

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.710 
use now i have some bits of my basilisk
over<00:02:19.640> here<00:02:19.849> which<00:02:20.000> i<00:02:20.120> haven't<00:02:20.299> quite<00:02:20.510> put

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
over here which i haven't quite put

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.830 
over here which i haven't quite put
together<00:02:21.370> but<00:02:22.370> i<00:02:22.400> noticed<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:23.180> undercarriage

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
together but i noticed the undercarriage

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.490 
together but i noticed the undercarriage
here<00:02:25.030> actually<00:02:26.030> happens<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.780> be<00:02:26.930> almost<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
here actually happens to be almost the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.850 
here actually happens to be almost the
exact<00:02:27.950> width<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.930> piece<00:02:33.140> i<00:02:33.319> intend<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.709> use

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
exact width of the piece i intend to use

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.020 
exact width of the piece i intend to use
for<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.130> base<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:37.430> that's<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.730> myth<00:02:37.849> you're

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
for the base so that's the myth you're

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.890 
for the base so that's the myth you're
not<00:02:38.180> quite<00:02:39.670> quite<00:02:40.670> good<00:02:40.940> as<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.090> match<00:02:43.900> it's

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
not quite quite good as a match it's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.509 
not quite quite good as a match it's
quite<00:02:45.170> large<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.769> think<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.130> just<00:02:46.190> about

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
quite large but I think it's just about

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.410 
quite large but I think it's just about
the<00:02:46.819> perfect<00:02:47.030> scale<00:02:48.459> so<00:02:49.459> now<00:02:49.849> you've<00:02:50.030> seen<00:02:50.299> all

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
the perfect scale so now you've seen all

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.080 
the perfect scale so now you've seen all
the<00:02:50.510> bits<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.810> I'm<00:02:50.959> going<00:02:51.079> to<00:02:51.140> be<00:02:51.200> using<00:02:52.090> stay

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
the bits that I'm going to be using stay

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.630 
the bits that I'm going to be using stay
tuned<00:02:53.329> for<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.599> next<00:02:53.810> video<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:55.340> should

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
tuned for the next video it should

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.629 
tuned for the next video it should
hopefully<00:02:55.819> have<00:02:56.030> some<00:02:56.299> work<00:02:56.450> in<00:02:56.569> progress

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
hopefully have some work in progress

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.120 
hopefully have some work in progress
stay<00:02:58.639> tuned<00:02:58.880> for<00:02:59.090> that
