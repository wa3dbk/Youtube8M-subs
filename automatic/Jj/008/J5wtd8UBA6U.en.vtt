you extracted our legendary powers you
can<00:06:29.070> see<00:06:29.280> the<00:06:29.940> max<00:06:30.210> I<00:06:30.420> can<00:06:30.600> get<00:06:30.750> its<00:06:30.900> 30%<00:06:31.110> so<00:06:31.890> and

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
can see the max I can get its 30% so and

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.980 
can see the max I can get its 30% so and
a<00:06:32.280> really<00:06:32.550> cool<00:06:32.730> thing<00:06:32.970> is<00:06:33.180> it's<00:06:33.330> essentially

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
a really cool thing is it's essentially

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.290 
a really cool thing is it's essentially
equivalent<00:06:34.920> to<00:06:35.220> one<00:06:35.370> of<00:06:35.460> the<00:06:35.520> passives<00:06:36.030> at<00:06:36.210> the

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
equivalent to one of the passives at the

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.650 
equivalent to one of the passives at the
witchdoctor<00:06:36.480> has<00:06:36.990> so<00:06:38.240> you<00:06:39.240> can<00:06:39.420> save<00:06:39.630> a

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
witchdoctor has so you can save a

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.500 
witchdoctor has so you can save a
passive<00:06:40.140> slaughter<00:06:40.410> with<00:06:40.620> this<00:06:41.180> if<00:06:42.180> you<00:06:42.330> need

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
passive slaughter with this if you need

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.550 
passive slaughter with this if you need
that<00:06:42.720> extra<00:06:42.780> tank<00:06:44.900> so<00:06:45.900> that's<00:06:46.080> really<00:06:46.290> good

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
that extra tank so that's really good

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.070 
that extra tank so that's really good
and<00:06:46.830> actually<00:06:47.520> I'm<00:06:48.390> switching<00:06:48.810> to<00:06:48.840> this

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
and actually I'm switching to this

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.960 
and actually I'm switching to this
because<00:06:49.380> I<00:06:49.620> like<00:06:49.800> having<00:06:50.130> a<00:06:50.220> slot<00:06:50.490> that<00:06:50.790> means

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
because I like having a slot that means

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.150 
because I like having a slot that means
thanking<00:06:51.240> a<00:06:51.330> quick<00:06:51.510> legendary<00:06:52.080> gem<00:06:52.320> so<00:06:53.100> I'll

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.120 

how<00:06:59.880> we<00:06:59.940> extract<00:07:00.480> legendary<00:07:01.350> powers
