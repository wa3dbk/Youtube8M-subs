just like this okay so now let's insert
your<00:01:43.740> hook<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:46.049> begin<00:01:46.380> all<00:01:46.590> we're<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.220> do

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
your hook to begin all we're going to do

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.999 
your hook to begin all we're going to do
is<00:01:47.579> chain<00:01:48.119> 12<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.110> remember<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.770> never

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
is chain 12 so remember that this never

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.069 
is chain 12 so remember that this never
counts<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.460> one<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.740> two<00:01:52.939> and<00:01:53.939> three<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
counts as one so one two and three and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:04.780 
counts as one so one two and three and
four<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:56.250> five<00:01:57.649> six<00:01:58.649> seven<00:01:59.509> eight<00:02:01.939> nine<00:02:03.229> ten

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
four and five six seven eight nine ten

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.449 
four and five six seven eight nine ten
eleven<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.939> twelve<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.190> width

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
eleven and twelve so this is the width

kind of fun and fabulous
now<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.569> secret<00:04:15.870> answer<00:04:16.409> is<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:17.190> there<00:04:17.430> is

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
now the secret answer is that there is

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.940 
now the secret answer is that there is
ten<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.180> double<00:04:18.539> crochets<00:04:18.959> going<00:04:19.650> all<00:04:19.829> the

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
ten and double crochets going all the

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.890 
ten and double crochets going all the
way<00:04:19.979> across<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:20.579> we<00:04:20.700> make<00:04:20.880> sure<00:04:20.909> we<00:04:21.150> come<00:04:21.359> to

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
way across so we make sure we come to

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.880 
way across so we make sure we come to
that<00:04:22.019> very<00:04:22.289> end<00:04:22.500> one<00:04:22.740> here

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
that very end one here

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.670 
that very end one here
just<00:04:25.890> like<00:04:26.010> so<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:27.690> when<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:27.870> come<00:04:28.200> back

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
just like so so when I come back

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.320 
just like so so when I come back
remember<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:29.250> chaining<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.670> two<00:04:29.850> right<00:04:30.030> here

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
remember that chaining a two right here

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.540 
remember that chaining a two right here
we<00:04:30.570> don't<00:04:30.720> count<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.200> so<00:04:31.500> it's<00:04:31.710> just<00:04:31.890> one<00:04:32.160> two

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
we don't count that so it's just one two

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.530 
we don't count that so it's just one two
three<00:04:33.330> four<00:04:34.260> five<00:04:34.740> six<00:04:35.280> seven<00:04:35.670> eight<00:04:36.060> nine<00:04:36.300> and

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
three four five six seven eight nine and

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.390 
three four five six seven eight nine and
ten<00:04:36.870> so<00:04:37.560> we<00:04:37.590> just<00:04:37.770> when<00:04:37.920> you<00:04:37.980> get<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.310> other

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
ten so we just when you get to the other

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.250 
ten so we just when you get to the other
side<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:39.120> should<00:04:39.330> pay<00:04:39.540> attention<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.990> this

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
side you should pay attention that this

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.140 
side you should pay attention that this
chaining<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.770> two<00:04:41.010> before<00:04:41.550> you<00:04:41.580> start<00:04:41.970> it<00:04:42.060> in

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
chaining of two before you start it in

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.850 
chaining of two before you start it in
the<00:04:42.270> first<00:04:42.480> one<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:43.110> don't<00:04:43.230> worry<00:04:43.500> about<00:04:43.620> it

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
the first one you don't worry about it

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.530 
the first one you don't worry about it
because<00:04:44.250> you<00:04:44.520> should<00:04:44.760> be<00:04:44.850> able<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:45.030> count<00:04:45.210> and

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
because you should be able to count and

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.720 
because you should be able to count and

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.280 
each and every time so we just continue
to<00:04:59.220> chain<00:04:59.550> again<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.060> we<00:05:00.600> do<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.840> same<00:05:01.020> thing

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
to chain again and we do the same thing

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.350 
to chain again and we do the same thing
so<00:05:01.470> we<00:05:01.590> go<00:05:01.740> one<00:05:02.700> and<00:05:02.970> two<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:04.730> then<00:05:05.730> the<00:05:06.090> same

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
so we go one and two and then the same

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.380
