00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello to all your greetings to all and gabriel 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.839
 forfend android we find ourselves for 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.980
 a grip of the lgv watch urban 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.969
 ltee so with the 4g so if you know the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.190
 new bomb from LG 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.250
 she has the particularity so I 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.690
 to embark 4g connectivity 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.250
 directly in the bracelet so this 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.920
 bracelet is not interchangeable 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.530
 Sadly 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.280
 we especially 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.220
 very premium design as we can 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.269
 see here we are sure 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.460
 so on a gray version for 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.310
 the moment there is this one so it's 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.740
 really very very well finished 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.960
 we have three buttons here on the side 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.650
 right so it's the buttons that go 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.170
 serve for quick shortcuts right there at 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.090
 the home here and a back button in 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.760
 below we can know that if it's not 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.400
 of the sepa of android or r it's a 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.390
 interface home from lg so I'm going 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.910
 try to show you quickly 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.710
 so first I finish with a little 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.379
 watch tower 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.600
 see here we have the frequency sensor 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:09.400
 cardiac and alley connector dock 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.010
 to recharge the battery made here 700 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.780
 million eur pair against 400 million 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.080
 towards the gold for the first control watch 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.030
 so obviously this is because of the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.130
 4g connectivity that will consume 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.340
 so much more so we are sure we can 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.950
 always hold two days 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.270
 without the 4g after with kadji and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.700
 frankly here I can not tell you 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.049
 will have to see the used but in any case 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 they have increased the capacity of the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.649
 battery to deal with this 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.530
 community kg the ranks of the watch 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.469
 perfectly autonomous that's what 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.860
 is the design you will obviously have 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.840
 pictures to see that more closely so the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.700
 bracelet is not interchangeable 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.569
 here we have a dial that we can always 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.799
 not turned chela for to discover 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.860
 I will immediately show you 7 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.170
 this interface 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.939
 so here we are on the dial that we can 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.270
 of course personalized by staying supported 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.469
 above 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.969
 so there are frames in preload and 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.280
 so you just have to select 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.649
 whoever you like the info you 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.420
 want to display for example if I see 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.830
 the room here so it's a little bit more 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.540
 classical 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.120
 the thing is we can do it 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.210
 directly here but we can also 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.900
 use the dedicated application from home 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.300
 gaumont 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:30.710
 here I see here so here it is 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.710
 the app called 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.570
 jay white manager this is it so 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.630
 you can directly change the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.360
 dial here so for that you go 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.050
 in white space and so there are some 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.120
 dials that are ready to charge the 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.769
 theme gallery 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.659
 you see I just applied by 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.340
 example if I want this theme there hop I 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.900
 apply and that's my watch 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.069
 adapts but there is also the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.140
 ability to totally customize 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.060
 to create his own theme you see if 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.550
 I want 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.099
 a wallpaper like that brighter 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.580
 if I want to change the needles it's 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.069
 possible I can treble here is here and 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.930
 the dial right there and even to the bottom 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.700
 so you have the prince themes 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.200
 you were going but you also have them 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.500
 themes that you can make yourself 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.840
 even 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.500
 that's pretty good thinking from 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.820
 lg 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.500
 so that's what is there for 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.750
 customizing the dial after for this 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.660
 which is the interface in itself so 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.180
 you press the right key and 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.520
 you go directly to the shortcut of 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.510
 the watch so there you see I have 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.760
 Arabic 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.180
 here I have different shortcuts so the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.079
 wifi the brightness adjustment 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.760
 activation of 3g or 4g gp is 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.890
 so you have to know that mint and super 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.590
 connect there really is any gps 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.349
 katché gyroscope storage memory of 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.549
 4 gigabytes 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.959
 it allows you to store music 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.519
 for after listen to them when you 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.060
 go run on your bluetooth headset 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.010
 for example it is really made for 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.390
 be completely independent there will be a 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.950
 first synchronization for example of 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.190
 your music from your phone 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.590
 towards this weather vane schueren but after 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.229
 that will be completely autonomous so that 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.539
 that's how it really was 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.370
 share of lg 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.949
 so here it's all the shortcuts so 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.560
 I press the bottom button I do I 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.310
 come back and if I press the 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.990
 central key 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.699
 there are all the applications that 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.220
 is displayed as you can see 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:40.410
 the first of them was here the 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.240
 possibility to call so you can 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.770
 propose directly your 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.660
 your number and you can also 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:52.599
 access your contacts send 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.110
 messages obviously so here this is the 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.460
 music 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.699
 as I tell you you can the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.340
 store directly on the monte honda l 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.840
 g it stands allows you so once 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.900
 that you have set up your low profile 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.419
 to calculate your physical activity so 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.150
 thanks to the thanks to the pedometer obviously 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.710
 but also thanks to the GPS to track down your 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.900
 races for example and of course at 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.710
 heart rate sensor that gets 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.510
 found at the back 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.110
 I'll just call you back here 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.110
 watch 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.500
 we also have payment by nfc then 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.389
 it tells you so far it was just 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.819
 for korea but here is the 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.849
 opportunity to pay in nfc at 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:33.680
 calendar the emails the clock voice 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.310
 memo so this is the note taking paid 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.409
 to the voice your contacts is here 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.490
 so you just have to type for 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.490
 Add a contact 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.999
 what is acue voice that allows 

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:49.840
 to translate on the fly here if you 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:52.660
 want to know 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.400
 how do we say hello welcome in 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.290
 a precise language you just have to the 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.639
 tell the mint who takes care of the 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.360
 translate so it's kind of google 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.360
 translation actually 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.280
 we also have control of 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.230
 the remote photos application so there 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.380
 in fact see I just activated the 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.140
 light remote control 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.660
 I have a feedback from what ge is so 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.020
 my camera's photo sensor 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:22.890
 directly on the screen of a world that's 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.890
 it's not bad it's well thought out 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:31.449
 and so after the settings 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.030
 setting the blood of the screen to sarc 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.009
 the screen is 1.3 pushes so that's 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.280
 always a pollen screen so it's good 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.659
 for the brightness is good it's good 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.509
 for screen reflections that are not 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.409
 too present and the oled country allows 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.759
 still good management of 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:48.610
 the energy we had already seen with the 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.300
 first jci watch m that's what you 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.689
 to say otherwise it's a processor 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.169
 qualcomm snapdragon 441.2 giguère which 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:56.979
 is inside 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:59.349
 supported by a gig of ram so voila 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:01.539
 it was a little tour of this 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:02.860
 wing j watchbp r I hope it has you 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:05.530
 more if you have any questions 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.270
 not to ask them some to come back on 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.150
 the stand to take the watch in 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:13.030
 but here it was still enough 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.550
 complete at the tournament level the interface 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.449
 thank you for watching this video 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.979
 do not hesitate to subscribe to the channel 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:19.870
 youtube if you want to see the videos 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:23.580
 of the show and we find ourselves very quickly on

 paul android to thank you it succeeds
