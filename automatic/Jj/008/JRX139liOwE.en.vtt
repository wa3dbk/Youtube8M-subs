00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
than i did for ghosts because in my

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.120 
than i did for ghosts because in my
opinion<00:01:48.659> advanced<00:01:49.259> warfare<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> far

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
opinion advanced warfare is like a far

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.940 
opinion advanced warfare is like a far
superior<00:01:50.310> game<00:01:50.820> then<00:01:51.329> called<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.290> ghost<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
superior game then called it a ghost and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.830 
superior game then called it a ghost and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
for advanced warfare but the biggest

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.060 
for advanced warfare but the biggest

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.809 
I think I'm halfway through 11th or
actually<00:02:28.260> close<00:02:28.469> to<00:02:28.620> 12<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.219> I'm<00:02:29.370> really

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
actually close to 12 so I'm really

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.210 
actually close to 12 so I'm really
pretty<00:02:30.540> pretty<00:02:30.930> close<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.590> actually<00:02:31.980> getting

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
pretty pretty close to actually getting

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.280
