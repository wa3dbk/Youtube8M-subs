he's really used that as a very very
much<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.580> starting<00:02:25.330> point<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.050> what<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.770> wanted

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
much a starting point so what you wanted

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.130 
much a starting point so what you wanted
to<00:02:27.190> get<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.730> then<00:02:28.180> had<00:02:28.330> stripped<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.900> quite

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
to get to and then had stripped it quite

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.710 
to get to and then had stripped it quite
bare<00:02:29.410> down<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:30.100> something<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.060> had<00:02:31.390> done

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
bare down to something that is had done

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.780 
bare down to something that is had done
beyond<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.590> something<00:02:32.800> new<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:33.730> you

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
beyond that and is something new so you

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.540 
beyond that and is something new so you
can<00:02:34.030> almost<00:02:34.150> not<00:02:34.510> see<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.740> original<00:02:36.220> source

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
can almost not see the original source

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.490 
can almost not see the original source
which<00:02:36.910> i<00:02:37.090> think<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.720> art<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.320> good

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
which i think is the art of a good

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.860 
which i think is the art of a good
designer<00:02:38.860> if<00:02:39.340> it's<00:02:39.700> something<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.630> know<00:02:40.750> if

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
designer if it's something you know if

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.390 
designer if it's something you know if
the<00:02:40.959> designer<00:02:41.260> starts<00:02:41.650> up<00:02:41.770> wanting<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.160> do

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
the designer starts up wanting to do

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.450 
the designer starts up wanting to do
there<00:02:42.670> really<00:02:42.850> is<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> fluid
