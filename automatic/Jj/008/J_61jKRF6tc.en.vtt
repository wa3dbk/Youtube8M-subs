talk you through the reasons why this

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.140 
talk you through the reasons why this
product<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.309> slightly<00:00:14.580> different<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.969> what's

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
product is slightly different to what's

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.129 
product is slightly different to what's
available<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> market<00:00:15.990> at<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.109> moment

available on the market at the moment

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.010 
available on the market at the moment
and<00:00:16.859> why<00:00:17.039> we<00:00:17.220> developed<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.090> improved<00:00:18.779> it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
and why we developed it and improved it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.990 
and why we developed it and improved it
in<00:00:19.140> our<00:00:19.230> opinion<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.890> make<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.400> easier<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
in our opinion to make it easier and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.290 
in our opinion to make it easier and
simpler<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.869> produce<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.320> PVA<00:00:22.619> bag<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:24.000> loading

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
simpler to produce a PVA bag the loading

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.660 
simpler to produce a PVA bag the loading

tool itself as an indicator live this
aids<00:00:26.910> two<00:00:27.150> purposes<00:00:28.670> one<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.880> support<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
aids two purposes one is to support the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
locking color into the correct position

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.520 
locking color into the correct position
and<00:00:31.949> two<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.300> researching<00:00:33.989> into<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.350> bag

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
and two it's researching into the bag

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.549

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
where the loading crew needs to go

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.240 
where the loading crew needs to go
inside<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.180> bag<00:00:39.890> when<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.980> release<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
inside the bag when you release the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.569 
inside the bag when you release the
locking<00:00:41.489> collar<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.600> reservations

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
locking collar we have reservations

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.619 
locking collar we have reservations
around<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> bottom<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> loading<00:00:45.450> tool

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
around the bottom of the loading tool

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450 
around the bottom of the loading tool
itself<00:00:46.020> which<00:00:46.500> allow<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.950> grip<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> bag

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
itself which allow it to grip the bag

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.610 
itself which allow it to grip the bag
really<00:00:47.940> tightly<00:00:48.270> which<00:00:48.690> aids<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> process<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
really tightly which aids the process of

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
really tightly which aids the process of
twisting<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.850> order<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> create<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> bag

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
twisting in order to create in the bag

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.529 
twisting in order to create in the bag
there's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> round<00:00:52.920> chumford<00:00:53.399> edge<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:54.420> on

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
there's a round chumford edge just on

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.590 
there's a round chumford edge just on
here<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:56.070> allow<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.399> loader<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.120> push<00:00:57.329> over

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
here to allow the loader to push over

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.380 
here to allow the loader to push over
the<00:00:57.809> bag<00:00:58.079> once<00:00:58.350> you've<00:00:58.500> created<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.949> bag<00:00:59.390> so

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the bag once you've created the bag so

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.789 
the bag once you've created the bag so
just<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:02.489> show<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.730> briefly<00:01:02.969> how<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:07.320> system

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
just to show you briefly how the system

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.359 
just to show you briefly how the system
works<00:01:08.390> we've<00:01:09.390> got<00:01:09.540> our<00:01:09.659> pellet<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.110> there

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
works we've got our pellet in there

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.210 
works we've got our pellet in there
we'll<00:01:11.369> now<00:01:11.520> twist<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.530> in<00:01:13.530> order<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.830> lock<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
we'll now twist it in order to lock it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.660 
we'll now twist it in order to lock it
into<00:01:14.340> position<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:15.710> should<00:01:16.710> push<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.950> loading

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
into position I should push the loading

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.969 
into position I should push the loading
tool<00:01:17.880> back<00:01:18.180> over<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> bag<00:01:18.810> itself<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.740> round

tool back over the bag itself the round

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.550 
tool back over the bag itself the round
chamfer<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.880> allowing<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> PVA<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.140> come<00:01:22.409> back

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
chamfer is allowing the PVA to come back

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.420 
chamfer is allowing the PVA to come back
on<00:01:22.710> itself<00:01:23.150> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.270> look<00:01:24.390> round

on itself if you look round

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.700 
on itself if you look round
it's<00:01:26.430> easy<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.759> push<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.060> over<00:01:27.560> it's<00:01:28.560> now

the amount of residue in the race when

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120 
the amount of residue in the race when
the<00:01:44.310> bag<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.520> completed<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
the bag is completed you just want to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.380 
the bag is completed you just want to
let<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> corners<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> tighten<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
let the corners down just to tighten the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:58.700 
let the corners down just to tighten the
bag<00:01:48.509> off

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.670 

and<00:01:59.190> there's<00:01:59.370> the<00:01:59.490> completely<00:01:59.850> plug<00:02:00.680> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and there's the completely plug the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.080 
and there's the completely plug the
banks<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.100> systems<00:02:02.460> are<00:02:02.580> available<00:02:02.700> in

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
banks and the systems are available in

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.090 
banks and the systems are available in
five<00:02:03.330> different<00:02:03.360> sizes<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.680> two<00:02:04.920> different

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
five different sizes with two different

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.160 
five different sizes with two different
size<00:02:05.430> loaders<00:02:05.850> everything<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.870> color-coded

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
size loaders everything is color-coded

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.010 
size loaders everything is color-coded
so<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.070> of<00:02:08.160> ease<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.310> use<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.850> you<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.840> also
