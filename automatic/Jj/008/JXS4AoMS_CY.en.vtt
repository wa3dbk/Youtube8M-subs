00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.609
 an extended audio of 13 minutes where 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.850
 are shown of two missions that are 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.840
 entering in the future in 105 online or 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.580
 be 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.490
 it seems that rockstar is preparing 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.860
 new missions 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.259
 bank robberies will draw one or the other 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.549
 of ecce and they will add more missions 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.229
 for another thing we are going because the robberies 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.320
 Banks were a little bit dead 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.530
 well not so dead but good is a 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.619
 good idea to put in new missions of 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.490
 bank robberies one is called witch flip 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.710
 and the other one is called money back or that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.659
 you will have the link below in description of the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.820
 video that is on youtube maybe ros 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.340
 it is removed a few days but that's why 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.439
 yes that is what you tell me to see so you 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.780
 I will put a forum where is also the 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.789
 video and is the extended text of all 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.229
 of all the audio and what was spoken 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.549
 obviously it's in English you can 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.409
 translate because I obviously do not know English 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.179
 if I did not translate all the video everything 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.369
 the video but I can not the video not what 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.039
 I can use because obviously I do not have 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.520
 owner's rights this they achieve 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.990
 filter these audios from the missions of 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.789
 robberies to banks that the truth that they are 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.979
 very good they hear them whole I've 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.770
 understood more or less a little and this the 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.170
 it seems that a mission is going to be 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.170
 ok drugs to treat drug that is 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.850
 very good very very striking for 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.910
 bank robberies that I think is what 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.800
 what he deserves 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.680
 a little bit of drugs a little bit of 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.420
 movement and a little heat jetas 5 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.640
 Do not say the guys I hope you like them 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.690
 of bursting that button from the ex you'll have 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.730

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.140
 of bank robberies two new 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.470
 missions that they would be doing with that 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.460
 drop groove flip the other one is money back or 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.260
 you tell them guys I hope you have them 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.030
 I liked that you burst that button 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.010
 of likes subscribe beings not because 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.480

 description the audio is 13 minutes ok 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.260
 let's hope that rockstar holds us back 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.450
 audio and not even then we have to 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.790
 subtract it has because it happened with audi 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.740

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.630
 banks and nine in memory and what 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.310
 retired to threw hours or day 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.740
 let's hope they do not remove it and that 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.210
 stay there this incredible audio do not say 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.130
