00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.600 
is going to be like a really long lap
right<00:05:23.810> but<00:05:24.380> after<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:24.740> it<00:05:24.980> should<00:05:25.010> be<00:05:25.250> normal

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
right but after that it should be normal

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.930 
right but after that it should be normal
laps<00:05:25.850> and<00:05:26.180> then<00:05:27.080> that's<00:05:27.980> it<00:05:28.190> when<00:05:28.460> you're<00:05:28.610> when

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
laps and then that's it when you're when

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.110 
laps and then that's it when you're when
you're<00:05:29.060> ready<00:05:29.270> you<00:05:29.510> just<00:05:29.540> click<00:05:29.990> stop<00:05:31.120> split

so i'll show you so i'll go ahead i'm
going<00:06:09.200> to<00:06:09.260> go<00:06:09.350> ahead<00:06:09.380> and<00:06:09.590> stop<00:06:09.800> it<00:06:10.510> so<00:06:11.510> let<00:06:11.900> me

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
going to go ahead and stop it so let me

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:31.409 
going to go ahead and stop it so let me
go<00:06:12.050> ahead<00:06:12.790> well<00:06:13.790> I<00:06:14.030> stopped<00:06:14.780> it<00:06:14.960> right

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:37.209 

so<00:06:32.740> it's<00:06:33.740> best<00:06:34.069> to<00:06:35.409> it's<00:06:36.409> best<00:06:36.710> to<00:06:36.860> have<00:06:36.889> this

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219 
so it's best to it's best to have this

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:41.469 
so it's best to it's best to have this
thing<00:06:37.520> like<00:06:39.490> mounted<00:06:40.490> up<00:06:40.639> and<00:06:40.819> down<00:06:41.060> because

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
thing like mounted up and down because

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.399 
thing like mounted up and down because
it<00:06:42.020> uses<00:06:42.259> the<00:06:42.409> calibration<00:06:43.129> so<00:06:43.879> like<00:06:44.210> this<00:06:44.409> so

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:45.409 
it uses the calibration so like this so

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:47.379 
it uses the calibration so like this so
every<00:06:45.889> single<00:06:46.189> time<00:06:46.370> you<00:06:46.400> move<00:06:46.699> like<00:06:46.849> this<00:06:47.120> way

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
every single time you move like this way

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.679 
every single time you move like this way
or<00:06:47.719> lean<00:06:47.900> this<00:06:48.080> way<00:06:48.139> it<00:06:48.939> see<00:06:49.939> that<00:06:50.180> that<00:06:50.449> green

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:50.689 
or lean this way it see that that green

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:52.119 
or lean this way it see that that green
marker<00:06:50.990> you<00:06:51.169> say<00:06:51.319> straight<00:06:51.620> it'll<00:06:51.919> go<00:06:52.039> away

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:52.129 
marker you say straight it'll go away

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:54.219 
marker you say straight it'll go away
but<00:06:52.879> you<00:06:52.969> can<00:06:53.090> move<00:06:53.180> this<00:06:53.330> way<00:06:53.539> it'll<00:06:53.810> move<00:06:53.990> and

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
but you can move this way it'll move and

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:56.529 
but you can move this way it'll move and
you<00:06:54.349> go<00:06:54.409> this<00:06:54.590> way<00:06:54.770> it'll<00:06:55.099> move<00:06:55.279> see<00:06:56.150> but<00:06:56.419> if

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539 
you go this way it'll move see but if

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:58.480 
you go this way it'll move see but if
you<00:06:56.659> stay<00:06:56.840> straight<00:06:57.169> that<00:06:58.099> green<00:06:58.279> more

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
you stay straight that green more

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.240 
you stay straight that green more
eventually<00:06:58.879> will<00:06:59.180> go<00:06:59.300> away<00:07:00.069> means<00:07:01.069> like

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
eventually will go away means like

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.809 
eventually will go away means like
you're<00:07:01.400> still<00:07:01.669> right<00:07:02.050> so<00:07:03.520> anyways<00:07:04.520> what<00:07:04.729> I'll

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:04.819 
you're still right so anyways what I'll

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:08.019 
you're still right so anyways what I'll
do<00:07:05.000> is<00:07:05.180> I'll<00:07:05.680> put<00:07:06.680> this<00:07:06.830> in<00:07:07.069> the<00:07:07.189> case<00:07:07.400> right

00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:08.029 
do is I'll put this in the case right

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:10.420 
do is I'll put this in the case right
here<00:07:08.319> alright<00:07:09.319> so<00:07:09.439> imagine<00:07:09.860> it<00:07:09.979> being<00:07:10.129> in<00:07:10.339> the

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
here alright so imagine it being in the

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.490 
here alright so imagine it being in the
case<00:07:10.610> and<00:07:13.599> put<00:07:14.599> this<00:07:14.719> down<00:07:14.900> before<00:07:15.080> my<00:07:15.319> wife

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
case and put this down before my wife

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.800 
case and put this down before my wife
kills<00:07:15.800> me<00:07:15.949> and<00:07:16.129> then<00:07:16.819> I<00:07:17.089> stick<00:07:18.020> the<00:07:18.169> case<00:07:19.810> like

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810 
kills me and then I stick the case like

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.170 
kills me and then I stick the case like
on<00:07:20.990> my<00:07:21.110> bike<00:07:21.289> right<00:07:21.499> here<00:07:21.529> I<00:07:21.889> stick<00:07:22.879> the<00:07:23.000> case

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
on my bike right here I stick the case

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.159 
on my bike right here I stick the case
right<00:07:23.389> here<00:07:23.449> so<00:07:24.379> all<00:07:24.650> I<00:07:24.680> see<00:07:24.919> is<00:07:24.979> my<00:07:25.099> rpms<00:07:25.580> and<00:07:26.169> I

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:27.169 
right here so all I see is my rpms and I

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:29.980 
right here so all I see is my rpms and I
just<00:07:27.529> wrap<00:07:27.740> this<00:07:27.949> thing<00:07:28.599> like<00:07:29.599> around

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990 
just wrap this thing like around

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.540 
just wrap this thing like around
somewhere<00:07:30.439> here<00:07:30.650> that<00:07:30.860> way<00:07:31.039> it<00:07:31.129> stays<00:07:31.189> right

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
somewhere here that way it stays right

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.129 
somewhere here that way it stays right
here<00:07:31.610> so<00:07:31.849> I<00:07:31.879> have<00:07:32.089> the<00:07:32.270> lap<00:07:32.539> time<00:07:32.779> right<00:07:32.990> here

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:33.139 
here so I have the lap time right here

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:35.379 
here so I have the lap time right here
and<00:07:33.319> then<00:07:33.949> I<00:07:33.979> can<00:07:34.430> only<00:07:34.580> only<00:07:34.939> need<00:07:35.180> to<00:07:35.270> see

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:35.389 
and then I can only only need to see

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:36.879 
and then I can only only need to see
this<00:07:35.569> that<00:07:35.870> way<00:07:35.990> I<00:07:36.020> don't<00:07:36.379> read<00:07:36.560> line<00:07:36.740> out

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:36.889 
this that way I don't read line out

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:39.909 
this that way I don't read line out
every<00:07:37.039> time<00:07:37.189> so<00:07:37.430> that's<00:07:38.000> pretty<00:07:38.180> much<00:07:38.270> it<00:07:38.919> it
