serious<00:03:09.120> sam<00:03:09.300> games<00:03:09.570> but<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.800> doesn't<00:03:11.130> last

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
serious sam games but it doesn't last

serious sam games but it doesn't last
very<00:03:11.460> long<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.210> enemies<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.660> go<00:03:12.780> ahead<00:03:12.870> and

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
very long the enemies can go ahead and

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.660 
very long the enemies can go ahead and
blow<00:03:13.290> right<00:03:13.530> through<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.830> pretty<00:03:14.340> quickly

blow right through that pretty quickly
so<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.870> seems<00:03:16.110> even<00:03:16.380> more<00:03:16.410> hectic<00:03:17.010> because<00:03:17.190> if

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
so it seems even more hectic because if

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.430 
so it seems even more hectic because if
you<00:03:17.610> feel<00:03:17.790> safe<00:03:18.090> for<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.330> minute<00:03:18.630> that's<00:03:19.200> it

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
you feel safe for a minute that's it

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.020 
you feel safe for a minute that's it
it's<00:03:19.620> only<00:03:19.890> good<00:03:20.100> for<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.310> couple<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.640> seconds

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
it's only good for a couple of seconds

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.970 
it's only good for a couple of seconds
and<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.210> you<00:03:21.360> got<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.570> move<00:03:21.750> on<00:03:21.990> so<00:03:22.800> you're

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
and then you got to move on so you're

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.680 
and then you got to move on so you're
forced<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.370> go<00:03:23.520> ahead<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.030> run<00:03:24.300> in<00:03:24.480> there<00:03:24.660> and

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
forced to go ahead and run in there and

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.390 
forced to go ahead and run in there and
just<00:03:25.020> wipe<00:03:25.260> these<00:03:25.440> guys<00:03:25.650> out<00:03:25.830> as<00:03:26.010> fast<00:03:26.130> as<00:03:26.340> you

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
just wipe these guys out as fast as you

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.730 
just wipe these guys out as fast as you
can<00:03:26.640> since<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.660> gameplay<00:03:28.050> sounds<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.470> simple

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
can since the gameplay sounds so simple

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.290 
everybody would think that this is a
very<00:03:30.240> easy<00:03:30.510> game<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:31.470> not<00:03:31.940> they<00:03:32.940> go<00:03:33.090> ahead

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
very easy game it's not they go ahead

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.670 
very easy game it's not they go ahead
and<00:03:33.390> they<00:03:33.450> throw<00:03:33.720> many<00:03:34.050> different<00:03:34.440> types<00:03:34.530> of

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
going on it's not so much that you go

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.860 
going on it's not so much that you go
ahead<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.320> feel<00:03:49.620> overwhelmed<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:51.240> there's

enough<00:03:52.200> there<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.980> simplistic<00:03:53.430> gameplay

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
enough there in the simplistic gameplay

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.390 
enough there in the simplistic gameplay
that<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.080> makes<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.350> challenging<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:56.220> you
