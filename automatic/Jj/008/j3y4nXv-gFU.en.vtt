on I personally had to reinstall about a
dozen<00:00:21.449> apps<00:00:21.840> after<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.650> update<00:00:22.830> because<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
dozen apps after the update because the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
with drag-and-drop features they've also

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.870 
with drag-and-drop features they've also
changed<00:00:52.810> how<00:00:52.960> this<00:00:53.200> works<00:00:53.500> when<00:00:54.070> you<00:00:54.220> drag<00:00:54.610> the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
changed how this works when you drag the

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.180 
changed how this works when you drag the
middle<00:00:55.180> bar<00:00:55.390> all<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.690> way<00:00:55.840> up<00:00:56.110> it<00:00:56.320> readjusts

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
middle bar all the way up it readjusts

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.180 
middle bar all the way up it readjusts
itself<00:00:57.550> air<00:00:58.239> but<00:00:58.840> when<00:00:59.020> you<00:00:59.110> do<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.380> again<00:00:59.470> the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
itself air but when you do it again the

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.970 
itself air but when you do it again the
app<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:00.400> fully<00:01:00.880> maximized<00:01:01.570> I<00:01:01.960> really<00:01:02.770> like

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
app is fully maximized I really like

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.799 
app is fully maximized I really like
that<00:01:03.010> because<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:03.489> is<00:01:03.730> a<00:01:03.760> lot<00:01:04.059> more<00:01:04.239> intuitive

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
that because it is a lot more intuitive

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.020 
that because it is a lot more intuitive
than<00:01:04.839> hitting<00:01:05.260> this<00:01:05.470> daunt<00:01:05.800> making<00:01:06.640> sure<00:01:06.850> that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030

I'm not hundred percent sure if the

I'm not hundred percent sure if the
color<00:03:33.709> has<00:03:33.950> changed<00:03:34.030> but<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.090> always<00:03:35.510> thought

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
color has changed but I always thought

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.990 
color has changed but I always thought
the<00:03:36.050> neutral<00:03:36.500> looked<00:03:36.680> very<00:03:37.040> washed<00:03:37.400> out<00:03:37.730> and

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
the neutral looked very washed out and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.910 
the neutral looked very washed out and
that's<00:03:38.390> why<00:03:38.600> I<00:03:38.630> never<00:03:38.840> use<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.170> mode<00:03:39.530> even

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
that's why I never use that mode even

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.410 
that's why I never use that mode even
though<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.220> color<00:03:40.520> seemed<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:41.150> lot<00:03:41.390> more

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
though the color seemed a lot more

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.600 
though the color seemed a lot more
accurate<00:03:42.140> but<00:03:42.739> now<00:03:42.920> it's<00:03:43.190> even<00:03:43.370> more

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
accurate but now it's even more

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.670 
accurate but now it's even more
saturated<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.480> I'm<00:03:44.600> happy<00:03:44.989> leaving<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.530> at

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
saturated and I'm happy leaving it at

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.160 
saturated and I'm happy leaving it at
professional<00:03:46.340> photo<00:03:46.580> now<00:03:46.850> much<00:03:47.600> better<00:03:47.630> than

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
professional photo now much better than

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.280 
professional photo now much better than
dynamic<00:03:48.770> or<00:03:48.950> standard<00:03:49.400> in<00:03:49.520> my<00:03:49.670> opinion<00:03:50.000> as<00:03:50.360> for

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
dynamic or standard in my opinion as for

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.800 
dynamic or standard in my opinion as for
color<00:03:51.560> accuracy<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.459> wouldn't<00:03:53.180> say<00:03:53.330> can<00:03:53.600> use

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
color accuracy I wouldn't say can use

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.229 
color accuracy I wouldn't say can use
the<00:03:53.959> note<00:03:54.170> 2<00:03:54.380> as<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.590> color<00:03:55.190> calibration<00:03:55.820> tool

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
the note 2 as a color calibration tool

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.630 
the note 2 as a color calibration tool
but<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:56.900> do<00:03:57.049> think<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.650> coders<00:03:58.070> are<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.250> little

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
but I do think the coders are a little

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.670 
but I do think the coders are a little
bit<00:03:58.880> better<00:03:59.090> with<00:03:59.360> this<00:03:59.540> update<00:03:59.750> so<00:04:00.380> it<00:04:00.530> is<00:04:00.650> a

bit better with this update so it is a

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.340 
bit better with this update so it is a

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
you were there you have to touch the

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.880 
you were there you have to touch the
screen<00:04:44.120> within<00:04:44.660> five<00:04:45.020> seconds<00:04:45.440> before<00:04:45.620> it

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890

turns<00:04:46.070> off<00:04:46.340> at<00:04:46.550> first<00:04:47.300> I<00:04:47.479> don't<00:04:47.660> like<00:04:47.810> this<00:04:48.020> but

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
turns off at first I don't like this but

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.070 
turns off at first I don't like this but
it<00:04:48.650> makes<00:04:48.800> sense<00:04:49.120> when<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.240> see<00:04:50.450> it<00:04:50.540> go<00:04:50.570> dim

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
it makes sense when you see it go dim

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.020 
it makes sense when you see it go dim
you<00:04:51.290> normally<00:04:51.950> would<00:04:52.280> just<00:04:52.550> tap<00:04:52.790> on<00:04:52.970> the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
you normally would just tap on the

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.240 
you normally would just tap on the
screen<00:04:53.240> anyway<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:54.020> not<00:04:54.440> wait<00:04:54.770> around<00:04:54.919> in

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
screen anyway and not wait around in

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.190 
screen anyway and not wait around in
front<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.760> camera<00:04:56.180> for<00:04:56.450> a<00:04:56.479> few<00:04:56.720> seconds<00:04:57.080> to

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
front of the camera for a few seconds to

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.530 
front of the camera for a few seconds to
make<00:04:57.350> it<00:04:57.500> brighter<00:04:57.740> again

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
make it brighter again

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.510 
make it brighter again
I<00:04:58.600> think<00:04:59.290> this<00:04:59.380> will<00:04:59.530> save<00:04:59.740> some<00:04:59.980> battery<00:05:00.310> as

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
I think this will save some battery as

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.690 
I think this will save some battery as
well<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:02.770> that's<00:05:03.040> about<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.340> for<00:05:03.490> today

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
well so that's about it for today

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.370 
well so that's about it for today
hopefully<00:05:04.180> everyone<00:05:04.960> will<00:05:04.990> get<00:05:05.320> their
