 here too today it will be important to him yesterday against the Cape Verde 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.740
 To show critics who is master in the house 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.870
 Immediately to say and show how he says now was the prisoner it became 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 is going well 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.430
 with Chris Clemens nice pass on the train from Los Angeles 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.680

 Robert Garrett 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.410
 Since he lives from his athleticism, it does not matter if there is a place with me drauflegt 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.010
 I have 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.950
 Role of Jill Clayburgh been 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.140
 but overall the German embassy too big are big problems 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.140
 Victorino Fucile capture the light 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.960
 Baskets on 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.960
 what was that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.799
 Mercedes is so light that's far too easy the German defense 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.609
 Smid 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.609
 because of this area 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.790
 this was recognizable by the schuke organ 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.890
 that was the classic really going Germany has been 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.080
 Jesse's one-on-one situation splashes 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.810
 the duty 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 Mirel Radoi followed up 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.889
 there you go but what significance of this Soy national players serious 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.590
 first a so far durchschnaufen six-point leadership for the German 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.289
 Team but only a bit 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.289
 Favorite topic Answer letter the daughter Libro 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:34.069

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.989
 Halftime Germany leads 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.099
 / Gettorf Themen Space really well now 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:46.879
 17 points way to them also for Dirk Nowitzki so if there is one 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.159
 or any other there was any doubt whether the German 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.379
 Team is doing well 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.619
 but puts the thoughts of CeMAT far behind 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.209
 but like at the beginning of the game 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.549
 at the beginning of the third quarter again problems in the West German play also in 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.549
 the German defense 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:06.909
 Surpassed Mozilla 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.909

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.480
 nice pass on Linz 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.449
 played great 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.449
 and who does that despite the happy 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.159
 there it is from Dirk Nowitzki 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.709
 6 41 still 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.789
 in this lot Germany leads with 19 points must 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.279
 now here's the lid on it I'm somehow possible then 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:58.620
 run for ten seconds 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.819
 and then it is done 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.819
 with magnificent phases 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.939
