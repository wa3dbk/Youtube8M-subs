00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.980
 It is not easy to understand the European subsidy system 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.490
 agricultural products there are billions of euros in Brussels 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.719
 at the member countries one collects around them after a complicated system 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.139
 to redistribute 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.800
 The money is there when European products are exported 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.529
 who has first battled through the scheme Stolpe pulls on 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.140
 Horizon of big Europe Dräger which is there for farmers actually get the war 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.890
 that off 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.420
 but above all, there is plenty 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.489
 for large industrial groups previously 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.160
 have made you smart 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.220
 at least the cows are even happier on the farm of Martin 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.230
 Häusling 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.080
 the farmer is worried that he gets about 40 every year 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.860
 a thousand euros from the European Union agricultural subsidies yet because the prices 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.920
 for milk and meat in the basement, the money is barely enough to cover the costs 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 to cover his yard 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.430
 The eu-agricultural subsidies for many farmers are still an essential part of the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.550
 Income because the prices in recent years 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.790
 have come down drastically 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.380
 and just for many farmers, that is a lot of area today 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.670
 an important component of income 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.840
 That's why the EU has 55 billion euros for agricultural subsidies in the coffers 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.230
 tax money 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.100
 actually aids for farmers the house but more than 80 percent of 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.910
 Subsidies are being used by industrial groups 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.280
 like Tönnies 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 one of the largest meat producers in Germany with billions in sales 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.170
 yet 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.490
 almost two chambers 7 million euros, an as in 2008 still in addition 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.800
 Get Brussels 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 In front of the camera you do not want to be cashed here 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.790
 not an isolated case said Carter Martin Hofstetter of Greenpeace 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.220
 in Hamburg 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.390
 the subsidy policy of the EU is a self-service shop for the industry 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.740
 So knowing subsidies are distributed after that were especially good 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.539
 Lobbying in Brussels 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.749
 and now we see that there is a lot of money in there 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:06.159
 Agriculture should flow in the industrial areas of energy 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.599
 Tierney's sectoral corporations flowing into confectionery sector 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.370
 Südzucker in Mannheim for example 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.240
 one of the largest sugar producers in Europe already makes without subsidies 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.599
 millions in profits 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.200
 and still have 34 million euros in agricultural subsidies in 2008 from 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.980
 the hip pay and also here if you are not in front of our camera 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.629
 In writing, Südzucker justifies the million-euro payment with exports of 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.329
 quota sugar 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.089
 in other words, because the company produces more sugar than you 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:42.029
 actually needs the EGU Südzucker pays a million-dollar 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.710
 Consolation for export that out too much produced sugar 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.559
 tax money 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:51.289
 With this trick even Haribo comes to the pots that actually for the 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:55.760
 Farmers are determined because there is sugar in a gummy bear 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.349
 Bears outside Europe sold something like a small Xetra export 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.019
 Haribo has received over 330,000 euros in this way 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:08.469
 that successful industrial companies get out of the pot 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.870
 to serve for the farmers 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.870
 you can find everything in order here in Brussels 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.879
 So this is for graced that is clear 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.299
 and if you read that one 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.900
 and a big company gets money from the European Union is that 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.479
 of course a bit shocking but you have to 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.479
 read on and see what they get the money for 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:34.379
 This music is more accurate and discovered on the list of EU grant recipients 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.989
 a cow Netzer das Leistungs GmbH &amp; Co kg 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.900
 189 00 322 euros and 29 cents of agricultural subsidies to the company 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.679
 cashed 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:47.599
 we want to run according to the logbook 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.599
 the address Friedrichstrasse 68 in Berlin 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.819
 what is a fancy shopping and not a farm 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.559
 In house number 68, there is no company called Fun at 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.649
 Coke 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:04.169
 we ask questions about hurting connections here because of over suspect 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.199
 Merz has cleared coca-Cola's us operations 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.919
 we are confirmed in writing 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.450
 It is true that Coca-Cola in Germany in 2008 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.509
 Agricultural subsidies received subsidies are linked to the 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.530
 Sale of products to foreign military in Germany has been paid 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.580
 prompt 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.020
 in other words 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.819
 coca-cola collected subsidies for each through the Commerz GmbH IQ 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:39.180
 cola-bottle which one delivered in American barracks like here in Wiesbaden 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.560
 Has 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.570
 because there is a lot of sugar in every cabbage and the barracks are American 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.130
 Territory is any delivery goes behind these numbers as a sugar export 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.640
 I can not understand why food companies are there when they come 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.530
 without war 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.770
 they have day-to-day business in which they can make money, it is completely 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.610
 incomprehensible that there money flow into the actually in one 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.969
 organic farming would have to go 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:06.779
 Farmer Häusling remains sour a million-dollar industrial enterprise 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.569
 Compatible with all tricks and tricks Viagra coffers of the EU 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.759
 Reason for the farmers remain only 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:18.839
 European agricultural subsidies 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:21.169
 for large multinational companies 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.540
 that can not be the meaning of agricultural help
