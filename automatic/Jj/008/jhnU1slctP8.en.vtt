00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.870
 welcome once again to winston mexico 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.090
 this time we have the first one a 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.799
 box in the channel this expected about 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.750
 this edition of the joe mask that the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.580
 that he released television this month for 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.750
 exclusively for the chain Sanborns 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.029
 but now we can with that in 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.100
 any side and we have here the edition 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.340
 so they can see it and we're going to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.340
 proceed to open the one that contains 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.630
 as you can see here on the mask 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.630
 let's get this out 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.040
 and we leave the box to one side 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.780
 then we will go to see what is the 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.810
 content 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.990
 we have the pp 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:53.280
 and the most important thing is the mask 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.890
 here you have a tape let me if I have 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.430
 scissors I've thought for any 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430
 situation 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.960
 perfect 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.580
 and here you can see is the mask 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.670
 yoga 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.670
 Well, my first impression is very 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.260
 good the truth I feel that green is 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.710
 see something yellowish I do not know what I see 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.470
 and you can see that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.470
 god what else goes up original tag 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.060
 batman 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.970
 well this would be what has been 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.310
 the most expensive for the one who wanted to see her 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.880
 detail 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.250
 it looks 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.740
 It has a good finish but the truth 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.770
 disappointed a bit to see that it is not so 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.030
 well painted for example here you see 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.350
 White 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.620
 what else 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:59.100
 here you can see we have 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.750
 on the other hand the pp that sack televises 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.340
 It also exists in this month but I take it out 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.780
 with another cover and here we see nobody 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.360
 different cover that is being the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.729
 back cover of the other cover so 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.190
 They had doubts and is almost the same thing 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.350
 those of the first of the numbers that 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.080
 form this arch since 2000 on 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.870
 which I really liked but I feel that the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.670
 people did not like it so much for more than nothing 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.040
 by the last numbers that for which 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.380
 you have not read it, not a spoiler, so it's not 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.340
 can see the same thing and this is what 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.720
 would include what this mask edition 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.410
 the best of s 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.870
 of batman with all the main bow of 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.210
 this story already after a pleasant 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.860
 off cameras watching the editing of 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.200
 this mask can I say that really 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.000
 I feel somewhat disappointed is I really 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.800
 I expected more from this mask and I 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.370
 they were commenting apart that the edition 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.770
 in original the mask is different so 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.170
 that probably for a next video 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.610
 I can talk to you about a 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.420
 comparative in which this mask the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.010
 true 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.050
 it was going to be directly after 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.850
 this video but I really prefer 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.180
 make it an option so that it is not 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.830
 so long and good and also put 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.630
 I already had this story 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.060
 which is the main arch the 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.070
 which I liked at the time I feel 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.810
 that was a little underrated and 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.320
 really let's say for the last 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.230
 numbers but overall I liked it a lot 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.200
 of tim from where family 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.769
 and well my final opinion would be that 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.170
 really if you like batman you can 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.980
 buying it is not so expensive but 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.909
 honestly I was disappointed I feel 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.709
 that this edition 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.319
 I expected a little more a little 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:46.100
 more quality with respect to the mask 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.690
 original but but not easy 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.090
 and as I said let's make a 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.130
 comparative about the original and the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.510
 Mexican version so that they are not left either 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.739
 Doubts 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.450
 and well you know they cost 499 pesos the 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.189
 can find in assembly or in 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.560
 comic book stores as it can be here 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:05.599
 in infinity with infinity quest that already 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.250
 they know that any information of this 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.739
 store is in the comments and in the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.659
 exception and well this would be all for 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.849
 this video you already know that if you liked it 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.860
 Give him a like share what for more 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.720
 people can give this a chance 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.289
 television edition that surprised us 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.030
 last month of December and good follow 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.410

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.039
