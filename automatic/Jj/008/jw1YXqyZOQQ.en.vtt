 teachers of this educational institution

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.920

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.170
 National Reading and Writing 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.780
 We are delivering more than 5 million 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.660
 books from the sevilla collection all 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.330
 the country in Cartagena the collection 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.540
 seed arrived and the students converted 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.950
 the school in a whole library where 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.630
 it appears very interesting project me 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.459
 It seems that it is good that they go to 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.830
 install so much with reading is something 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.910
 that has been lost then I read with 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.480
 because it 's because I have not yet 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.640
 read 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.920
 but already related everything we're going 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.459
 reading after reading the entire text 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.160
 he relates it to the drawings and she goes 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.160
 he is creating his own his own bridge 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.370
 when the equal seed collection 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.920
 school we were asking 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.980
 how to get children to improve their 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.739
 school performance as we said so that 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.349
 the school had a relationship with the 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.840
 community and like the little children that are 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.540
 blind and those who are blind could 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.610
 get closer to the reading process and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.190
 writing with the other children then 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.879
 born the idea of this collector that is a 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.879
 idea born of the teachers themselves and 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:40.260
 teachers with children and with them 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:42.930
 dads read mystery stories that 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.879
 what excites me there are many 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.940
 Account classes in the seed collection 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:52.850
 of mystery of terror 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.860
 of comedy drama 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.480
 has become accustomed and they come in the 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.550
 recess time and all that many of 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.880
 they come to read at recess time 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.940
 that they got used to since they were little 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.220
 that came to the library then the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.660
 strategy is that I lend you a book 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.960
 of Augustine or that they take it to the 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.960
 face 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.919
 from Bogotá to 900 people have 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.019
 processed 5 million books so that 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.650
 arrive in the best conditions to the 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.410
 children 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.750
 these books make many children 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.750
 learn and have fun reading 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.360
 In Medellin, the seed collection has 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.840
 integrated two cultures of the chocó and of 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.840
 antioquia 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.210
 we investigate about them and 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.980
 then we send letters to 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.190
 they and they have sent us 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.240
 we have a book called 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.690
 communication with the diagonal a 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.270
 meeting of cultures like the book of 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.750
 Africa is called from Africa us 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.750
 we have 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.270
 I'm talking about the seed collection that came 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.950
 of the national reading and writing plan 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.880
 for me as always what was said was how 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.880
 a gift from heaven 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.500
 everything was transformed because the children 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.710
 they showed such great love to the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.450
 contagiaban reading for dads 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.210
 National reading and writing plan 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.880
 is changing his life to more than 7 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.270
 millions of students in Colombia has 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.800
 formed more than 45 thousand teachers has 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.500
 invested with the support of 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.250
 mayoral governments and the private sector 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.470
 more than 70 billion pesos we are 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.200
 reaching 91 percent of the 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.030
 students of the official sector 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.390
 benefiting more than 18 thousand schools 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:51.440
 now one of the different things 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.020
 I know you can make bigger of everything 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.340
 now we like mathematics a lot 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.200
 plus 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.630
 one of dreaming to plan something 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.550
 we are sowing the seed that is 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.550
 making many children interested 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.460
 for reading and writing and this is 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.410
 changing the way of learning 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.660
 we are taking the seed collection to 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.720
 the farthest places to give to 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:19.480
 student teachers parents and 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.610
 rulers the transforming power that 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.610
 have reading and writing 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.540
 do not 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.509
 yes no 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.930
 dt a 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.930
 and it's like that 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.850
 d 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.590
 and it's like that 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:04.499
 reading and writing give you powers 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.259
 and you
