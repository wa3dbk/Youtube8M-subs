00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.660 
and so that might take a couple of
seconds<00:02:15.360> here<00:02:15.629> we<00:02:16.379> can<00:02:16.769> see<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> process<00:02:17.220> down

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
seconds here we can see the process down

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.390 
seconds here we can see the process down
below<00:02:18.120> as<00:02:18.390> it's<00:02:18.569> going<00:02:19.260> by<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:19.980> actually

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
below as it's going by and it's actually

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.850 
below as it's going by and it's actually
not<00:02:20.549> doing<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.910> too<00:02:21.060> slowly<00:02:21.840> it's<00:02:22.110> pretty<00:02:22.319> fast

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
not doing it too slowly it's pretty fast

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.729 
not doing it too slowly it's pretty fast
