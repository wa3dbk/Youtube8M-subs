so there was some roast beef

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.370 
so there was some roast beef
so<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.829> was<00:00:34.950> gravy<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.610> my<00:00:35.760> dish<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.170> only

yeah<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:12.129> lot<00:03:12.549> of<00:03:12.700> damage<00:03:13.120> instead<00:03:13.389> was<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
yeah a lot of damage instead was the

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.710 
yeah a lot of damage instead was the
first<00:03:14.470> minute<00:03:14.859> of<00:03:14.949> my<00:03:15.129> life<00:03:15.160> when<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.030> ate<00:03:16.329> was

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
first minute of my life when I ate was

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.220 
first minute of my life when I ate was
like<00:03:17.139> I<00:03:17.319> told<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.799> some<00:03:18.010> roast<00:03:18.280> beef<00:03:18.430> I

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
like I told you some roast beef I

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.080 
like I told you some roast beef I
believe<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.440> had<00:03:20.739> Wheaton<00:03:21.669> who<00:03:21.940> knows

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
believe that had Wheaton who knows

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.530 
believe that had Wheaton who knows
probably<00:03:22.389> it<00:03:22.629> had<00:03:22.780> soy<00:03:23.250> oil<00:03:24.250> or<00:03:24.519> some<00:03:25.090> sort<00:03:25.480> of

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
probably it had soy oil or some sort of

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.460 
probably it had soy oil or some sort of
soy<00:03:25.810> product<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.739> then<00:03:27.810> at<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.930> end<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:29.260> had<00:03:29.410> a

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
soy product and then at the end I had a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.339 
soy product and then at the end I had a
cup<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.680> tea<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.730> tasted<00:03:31.269> sweet<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:32.109> I

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
cup of tea and it tasted sweet and I

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.860 
cup of tea and it tasted sweet and I
asked<00:03:33.220> if<00:03:33.310> there<00:03:33.489> was<00:03:33.579> sugar<00:03:34.000> in<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.359> and<00:03:34.569> I<00:03:34.660> say

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
asked if there was sugar in it and I say

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.750 
asked if there was sugar in it and I say
no<00:03:34.900> but<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:36.489> did<00:03:36.760> sit<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.299> eat<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.750> now<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.049> think
