00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
true think about that the finest steel

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.139 
true think about that the finest steel
has<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.170> go<00:00:37.320> through<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> hottest<00:00:37.980> fire<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149

temperature<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:43.200> highest<00:00:43.590> flames<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.760> most

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
temperature the highest flames the most

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
temperature the highest flames the most
pain<00:00:45.890> because<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.219> finest<00:00:47.670> steel<00:00:48.030> all

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
pain because it's the finest steel all

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.500 
pain because it's the finest steel all
right<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.700> you<00:00:50.700> think<00:00:50.910> about<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.360> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
right and you think about that like you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.610 
right and you think about that like you
can<00:00:51.660> use<00:00:51.809> more<00:00:52.020> now<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.320> think<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
can use more now if you think about a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.160 
can use more now if you think about a
diamond<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.190> how<00:00:53.280> much<00:00:53.399> pressure<00:00:53.870> goes<00:00:54.870> into

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
diamond and how much pressure goes into

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.160 
diamond and how much pressure goes into
making<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.489> beautiful<00:00:56.940> diamond<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.600> so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
making one of a beautiful diamond and so

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.840 
making one of a beautiful diamond and so
think<00:00:58.350> about<00:00:58.469> yourself<00:00:58.800> now<00:00:59.129> put<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
think about yourself now put that and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.869 
think about yourself now put that and
put<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.180> plan<00:01:00.359> your<00:01:00.480> life<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:01.879> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
put that in plan your life right the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.299 
put that in plan your life right the
finest<00:01:03.420> steel<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> finest<00:01:04.739> diamond<00:01:05.189> or

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
finest steel or the finest diamond or

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.969 
finest steel or the finest diamond or
whatever<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.729> might<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:06.080> right<00:01:07.080> steel<00:01:07.770> that's

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
whatever it might be right steel that's

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.810 
whatever it might be right steel that's
used<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:10.110> armored<00:01:10.530> cars<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.520> order<00:01:11.700> for

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
used on the armored cars in order for

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.770 
used on the armored cars in order for
that<00:01:11.850> stilted<00:01:12.270> mean<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that stilted mean it's going to the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.960 
that stilted mean it's going to the
hottest<00:01:12.990> fire<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.460> builds<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
hottest fire because that builds up a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.380 
hottest fire because that builds up a
resistance<00:01:15.439> that<00:01:16.439> makes<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.979> more<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:18.360> know

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
resistance that makes it more you know

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.980 
resistance that makes it more you know
makes<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:18.960> usable<00:01:19.290> more<00:01:19.650> pliable<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:21.509> so

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
makes it more usable more pliable and so

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.510 
makes it more usable more pliable and so
what<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> think

what not what I what I want you to think

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.469

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
steel because you went through the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.709
