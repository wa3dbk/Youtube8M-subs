00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.119
 what seen in my new version of my 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.769
 volkswagen vochito that I climbed yesterday or 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.019
 Antier has little to upload what comes 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.009
 being this little bug today 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.619
 I bring what I have seen in my new 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.819
 version that I just finished 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.560
 previously it was a version say 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:32.320
 like who says beta because not yet 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.540
 they convinced me 100% to upload them and so 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.760
 I modified it and I'm left with this 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.580
 result that you will see below 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.160
 here as I say new kid now 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.890
 they have what 18 but it is that I mess 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.990
 I'm going is now herbie version of the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.760
 movie all march here with take 5 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.230
 I think it was called where the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.540
 buenona d 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.860
 it's my gun style and how they look now 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.870
 I am very well what has been the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.579
 bag I put what I did in the chest 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.250
 from the little one I had to do from scratch 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.820
 because the previous painting was different 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.770
 to this one and it was different let's say in the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.050
 the parts only locations that brought what 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.640
 that is being the drawings drop and 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.250
 also adds what has been the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.750
 rear and front defense as you are 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.479
 watching are the classic or the stop 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.619
 by which comes say by default to 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.030
 same also put some wheels 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.940
 different that are from the let's say 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.070
 original of the hewitt and just like they see 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.500
 he put say a spoiler type there that 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.690
 it looks like I do not say it's let's say 100% 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.700
 but I tried to do it let's say the most 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.190
 seemed as similar as possible yes 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.660
 Of course, the closest thing is to try it 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.000
 do to let us say three terms 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.470
 enjoy as I tell you this car is going to 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.570
 be available for you to have 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.110
 also for you to use it if it is 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.060
 that they do not have to give you 5 to say 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.890
 also enjoy this voice of this 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.280
 version of mib 8 in the previous version 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.170
 from the like to the Mexican to many 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.090
 let's say they had that flag they liked 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.549
 one or two that were 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.990
 where I public the gt5 mods do not 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.070
 liked but honestly I do not care 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.619
 and while the nickname of friends always goes 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.719
 to be say ts depending on that 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.099
 way because obviously mine so 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.200
 I hope you like me sincerely 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.730
 I really liked how you look at what's coming 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.670
 being the rims the people look very 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.989
 well I do not know why if they look up they give me 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.150
 I want to eat them but I do not know 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.890
 honestly I really like how you look 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.330
 no longer bring the car what a saying 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.500
 the extra that previously brought the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.480
 version 1 that the Mexican naked among the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.250
 let's say the luggage rack or the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.140
 punnet bringing up no longer enters 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.420
 and that now what brings different 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.150
 let's say like an extra today here I do not have 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.769
 the eyes that happened my car see we go 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.300
 to put the other one so that 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.100
 you look at it 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.390
 I will bring what is coming 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.780
 headlights face that as they are 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.910
 seeing this I think it was 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.760
 I think in some like that the wines in what 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.190
 model seen this these headlights that is 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.080
 in front now brings four in total it 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.150
 I saw something weird but that's how we say 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.650
 classics but I think not against the 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.420
 front I think you should not have in the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.830
 doors to finally sincerely like 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.770
 it looks very good what one feels of 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.600
 This car I liked there I liked it a lot 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.819
 how I was left inside is 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.620
 practically the same or better said is 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.480
 the same I did not change anything because it is 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.520
 perfect so I wanted to put another 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.840
 but I think that it's going to be a 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.910
 next version that maybe you can 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.100
 let 's fall but will be tuned one 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.140
 say a pimped VW Beetle because I 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.480
 I have a mode of san andreas of a 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.489
 tuned vocho try to modify it to 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.440
 it is even better and as well 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.940
 As I say, I did not like it very much 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.819
 I 'm staying what this boat is coming 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.610
 the tires are the ones that highlight it and 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.350
 timing the spoiler the air the spoiler 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.910
 Sorry, it's very good 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.010
 which is still a lot so that 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.410
 you also enjoy it I try 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.550
 do let's say the mods so that you a5 and 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.709
 so that you thunder is also the most 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.450
 that obviously takes me longer and now 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.370
 If I love spirit but before I want 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.790
 Thank you very much to all the people who 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.500
 comment on my videos and what 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.719
 I like the video sincerely many 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.859
 thanks for that support previously in 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.349
 the next in the previous life 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.620
 previously 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.569
 in the previous video you had many 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.799
 looks and that he was a montage is 5 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.170
 and I know that maybe many do not have 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.030
 jeta 5 but what I liked what 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.370
 I appreciate that you support the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.230
 content of my channel more however if 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.449
 they do not have gta 5 and that's why I try to 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.729
 upload the mod for you to san andreas 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.620
 so that you enjoy it and so 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.440
 let's say do not make any kind of complaint or 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.900
 to do more GT5 tourism and so 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.090
 I try to climb and convert the two cars 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.039
 so that you give yourself 5 and for people andrÃ©s 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.550
 but obviously as we are now 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.620
 let's say in full and openings of 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.720
 the mote of gta 5 I have to say 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.240
 convert cars because a lot of people are 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.009
 raising their cars and I also think that 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.470
 I'm the only Mexican I do not know, be the only 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.539
 Mexican who is in this but I think that 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.630
 yes honestly I do not know but I've seen 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.370
 another Mexican who is making models 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.940
 I think I saw one but it was detest 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.970
 textures of 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.460
 of federal trial police and that but 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.070
 well anyway, now I say goodbye 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.800
 I was glad I said I was glad hahaha 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.840
 asshole is called lengthen a lot the video 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.340

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.440
