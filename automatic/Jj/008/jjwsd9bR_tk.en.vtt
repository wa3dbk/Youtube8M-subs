a look at the Space Center mm-hmm okay

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.870 
a look at the Space Center mm-hmm okay
so<00:01:00.690> there<00:01:00.960> was<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.170> error<00:01:01.440> loading<00:01:01.559> that

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.029 

okay<00:01:06.880> so<00:01:06.969> I<00:01:07.090> guess<00:01:07.240> now<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:08.439> application

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
okay so I guess now the application

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.380 
okay so I guess now the application
crashed<00:01:09.429> or<00:01:09.670> something<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:10.090> don't<00:01:10.149> know<00:01:10.270> i'm

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
crashed or something I don't know i'm

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.490 
crashed or something I don't know i'm
not<00:01:10.509> sure<00:01:10.570> about<00:01:10.840> I'll<00:01:11.590> reload<00:01:11.950> back<00:01:12.189> into<00:01:12.490> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
not sure about I'll reload back into it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.620 
not sure about I'll reload back into it
shouldn't<00:01:14.500> be<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.619> problem<00:01:14.860> I<00:01:15.219> guess<00:01:15.969> there's

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
shouldn't be a problem I guess there's

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.760 
shouldn't be a problem I guess there's
so<00:01:16.780> some<00:01:16.990> bugs<00:01:17.229> in<00:01:17.409> it<00:01:17.530> still<00:01:18.100> brand-new<00:01:18.399> so

I<00:02:04.050> hope<00:02:04.320> they<00:02:04.500> do<00:02:04.560> because<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.660> gets<00:02:06.660> kind<00:02:07.050> of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
I hope they do because it gets kind of

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.690 
I hope they do because it gets kind of
annoying<00:02:07.170> waiting<00:02:07.980> for<00:02:08.130> an<00:02:08.190> application<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.860 

and

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.540 

there<00:03:12.500> we<00:03:12.680> go

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.850 

okay<00:03:18.240> didn't<00:03:18.930> really<00:03:18.990> take<00:03:19.350> me<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.710> where<00:03:19.830> I

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
okay didn't really take me to where I

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
okay didn't really take me to where I
want<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.190> go

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.550 

let's<00:03:24.880> try<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.240> again<00:03:27.270> search<00:03:28.380> street<00:03:29.380> he

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
let's try that again search street he

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.460 
let's try that again search street he
was<00:03:29.650> not<00:03:29.800> available<00:03:29.920> for<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.400> location<00:03:31.470> okay

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
was not available for this location okay

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.880 
was not available for this location okay
