00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.140 

there's<00:00:35.770> a<00:00:35.830> lot<00:00:35.980> of<00:00:36.010> research<00:00:36.400> that<00:00:36.730> goes<00:00:36.760> into

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
there's a lot of research that goes into

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.120 
there's a lot of research that goes into
looking<00:00:37.990> at<00:00:38.110> what<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.260> drivers<00:00:38.680> do<00:00:38.860> on<00:00:39.100> a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
looking at what the drivers do on a

technologies and conveniences that can
best<00:00:43.750> support<00:00:43.870> them<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.850> vehicle<00:00:49.420> is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
best support them this vehicle is

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.569 
best support them this vehicle is
something<00:00:50.260> completely<00:00:50.680> new<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:51.310> it<00:00:51.430> will

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
something completely new so it will

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.390 
something completely new so it will
define<00:00:52.030> a<00:00:52.090> completely<00:00:52.600> new<00:00:52.780> segment<00:00:53.380> my<00:00:54.160> role

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
define a completely new segment my role

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.580 
define a completely new segment my role
in<00:00:54.550> innovation<00:00:55.270> truck<00:00:55.480> too<00:00:55.690> was<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.320> overall

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
in innovation truck too was the overall

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.920 
in innovation truck too was the overall
program<00:00:56.920> manager<00:00:57.460> we<00:00:57.880> noticed<00:00:58.090> that<00:00:58.510> there

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
program manager we noticed that there

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.479 
program manager we noticed that there
was<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.410> shift<00:00:59.710> towards<00:01:00.040> more<00:01:00.250> and<00:01:00.370> more

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
was a shift towards more and more

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.000 
was a shift towards more and more
dickheads<00:01:00.970> so<00:01:01.270> we<00:01:01.510> took<00:01:01.690> a<00:01:01.750> look<00:01:01.930> at<00:01:02.140> what<00:01:02.739> the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
dickheads so we took a look at what the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.770 
dickheads so we took a look at what the
market<00:01:03.340> had<00:01:03.489> available<00:01:03.820> today<00:01:04.150> both<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.629> day

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
market had available today both the day

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.320 
market had available today both the day
cabs<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:05.409> sleeper<00:01:05.770> cabs<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.310> then<00:01:07.000> we<00:01:07.180> had

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
cabs and sleeper cabs and then we had

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.390 
cabs and sleeper cabs and then we had
this<00:01:07.479> concept<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.200> creating<00:01:08.740> something<00:01:09.310> in

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
this concept of creating something in

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.690 
this concept of creating something in
between<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:10.000> really<00:01:10.420> gives<00:01:10.540> flexibility<00:01:11.320> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
between that really gives flexibility I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.030 
between that really gives flexibility I

the key parts of the revolution truck is

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.550 
the key parts of the revolution truck is
the<00:01:21.549> fact<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:21.880> it's<00:01:22.150> optimized<00:01:22.870> around<00:01:23.380> a

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
the fact that it's optimized around a

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.649 
the fact that it's optimized around a
single<00:01:23.770> driver<00:01:24.310> it's<00:01:25.060> one<00:01:25.299> of<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.450> first

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
single driver it's one of the first

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.210 
single driver it's one of the first
things<00:01:25.750> we<00:01:25.960> did<00:01:26.110> if<00:01:26.290> he<00:01:26.320> said<00:01:26.650> do<00:01:26.860> we<00:01:26.979> need<00:01:27.159> a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
things we did if he said do we need a

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.660 
things we did if he said do we need a
passenger<00:01:27.820> side<00:01:28.030> door<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:29.560> really<00:01:29.950> there's<00:01:30.610> a

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
passenger side door not really there's a

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.550 
passenger side door not really there's a
cargo<00:01:31.030> hatch<00:01:31.270> on<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.570> passenger<00:01:32.049> side<00:01:32.080> but

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
cargo hatch on the passenger side but

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.910 
cargo hatch on the passenger side but
there's<00:01:32.799> not<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.430> typical<00:01:34.390> door<00:01:35.290> once<00:01:35.830> you

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
there's not a typical door once you

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.830 
there's not a typical door once you
think<00:01:36.070> about<00:01:36.190> a<00:01:36.369> vehicle<00:01:36.880> only<00:01:37.210> having<00:01:37.630> one

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
think about a vehicle only having one

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.140 
think about a vehicle only having one
person<00:01:38.320> in<00:01:38.470> it<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:39.040> can<00:01:39.070> kind<00:01:39.430> of<00:01:39.490> open<00:01:39.790> up<00:01:39.880> to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
person in it you can kind of open up to

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.120 
person in it you can kind of open up to
your<00:01:40.570> thoughts<00:01:40.810> about<00:01:41.140> what<00:01:41.320> that<00:01:41.470> truck<00:01:41.950> is

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
your thoughts about what that truck is

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.520 
your thoughts about what that truck is
going<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.400> look<00:01:42.520> like

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.300 

I<00:01:48.170> did<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.260> concept<00:01:49.680> development<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
I did the concept development for the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.520 
I did the concept development for the
exterior<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.780> truck<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.170> wanted<00:01:52.409> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
exterior to do this truck we wanted a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.039 
exterior to do this truck we wanted a
dynamic<00:01:53.100> shape<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.549> wanted<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.119> obviously<00:01:54.960> an

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
dynamic shape we wanted a obviously an

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.510 
dynamic shape we wanted a obviously an
innovative<00:01:55.530> shape<00:01:55.770> something<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.190> showed

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
innovative shape something that showed

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.499 
innovative shape something that showed
the<00:01:56.549> future<00:01:57.030> something<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the future something that was a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.210 
the future something that was a
game-changer<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.320> looked<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:58.650> things<00:01:59.070> such

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
game-changer so I looked at things such

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.370 
game-changer so I looked at things such
as<00:01:59.340> aircraft<00:01:59.610> sports<00:02:00.299> cars<00:02:00.630> things<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.259> show

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
as aircraft sports cars things that show

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.200 
as aircraft sports cars things that show
speed<00:02:01.830> things<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.280> shall<00:02:02.400> movement<00:02:02.970> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
speed things that shall movement to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.540 
speed things that shall movement to
change<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> face<00:02:03.690> of<00:02:03.720> trucking<00:02:04.259> my<00:02:05.220> role<00:02:05.399> in

of<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.380> system<00:02:19.860> we<00:02:20.340> ended<00:02:20.489> up<00:02:20.580> having<00:02:20.760> to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
of the system we ended up having to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.850 
of the system we ended up having to
lower<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.450> engine<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:22.080> ended<00:02:22.320> up<00:02:22.380> having<00:02:22.560> to
