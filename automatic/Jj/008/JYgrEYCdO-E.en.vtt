00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
on in speculation on what these actually

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.690 
on in speculation on what these actually
mean<00:00:34.260> because<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.219> list<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.520> doesn't

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
mean because in the list it doesn't

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.770 
mean because in the list it doesn't
actually<00:00:35.790> describe<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.809> each<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.260> these

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
actually describe what each of these

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.090 
actually describe what each of these
specializations<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.620> I'm<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.890> kind<00:00:41.070> of

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
specializations are so I'm just kind of

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.010 
specializations are so I'm just kind of
giving<00:00:41.280> my<00:00:41.460> opinion<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.879> some<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.149> them<00:00:42.270> so

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
giving my opinion on some of them so

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.930 
giving my opinion on some of them so
yeah<00:00:43.140> let's<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.410> started<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.640> looks<00:00:44.670> like

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
yeah let's get started so it looks like

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.220 
yeah let's get started so it looks like
there's<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.570> lot<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.809> cool

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
there's going to be a lot of cool

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.680 
there's going to be a lot of cool
customization<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.820> your<00:00:48.270> actual

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
customization just for your actual

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.660 
customization just for your actual
ammunition<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.739> kind<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.010> change<00:00:50.370> how

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
ammunition so you can kind of change how

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.939 
ammunition so you can kind of change how
you<00:00:50.730> want<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.230> fight<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> battle<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.800> if

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you want to fight the battle so if

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.470 
you want to fight the battle so if
there's<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.219> lot<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.430> tanks<00:00:53.730> around<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.239> you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
there's a lot of tanks around and you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.760

just<00:00:54.660> died<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.199> realize<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.590> want<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
just died and you realize you want to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.110 
just died and you realize you want to
take<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> lot<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.129> those<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.460> you're<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
take a lot of those out you're going to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.369 
take a lot of those out you're going to
have<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.360> option<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.930> armor-piercing

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
have that option of armor-piercing

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.470 
have that option of armor-piercing
rounds<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.219> you're<00:00:59.640> also<00:00:59.789> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
rounds and you're also going to have the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.500 
rounds and you're also going to have the
option<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.859> more<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:03.090> getting

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
option I think to be more are getting

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
option I think to be more are getting
more<00:01:03.570> bang<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:03.960> your<00:01:04.049> buck<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.680> taking<00:01:04.920> out

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
more bang for your buck for taking out

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.200 
more bang for your buck for taking out
infantry<00:01:05.489> which<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.760> think<00:01:05.939> are<00:01:06.000> called

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
infantry which I think are called

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.780 
infantry which I think are called
canister<00:01:06.780> shells<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.470> could<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.280> wrong<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.610> this

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
canister shells I could be wrong on this

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.000 
canister shells I could be wrong on this
but<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.210> kind<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.600> gives<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.020> vibe<00:01:10.049> when<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
but it kind of gives that vibe when I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.340 
but it kind of gives that vibe when I
looked<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.430> there's<00:01:12.330> also<00:01:12.540> guided<00:01:13.049> shells

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
looked it up there's also guided shells

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.609 
looked it up there's also guided shells
heat<00:01:13.740> seeker<00:01:14.189> missiles<00:01:14.840> guided<00:01:15.840> missiles<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
heat seeker missiles guided missiles and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.890 
heat seeker missiles guided missiles and
guided<00:01:17.490> rockets<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.150> I'm<00:01:18.210> assuming<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
guided rockets and I'm assuming the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.870 
guided rockets and I'm assuming the
differences<00:01:19.320> between<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.860> guided<00:01:20.250> all<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
differences between the guided all the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.190 
differences between the guided all the
different<00:01:21.119> guided<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.960> different

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
different guided is just different

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.749 
different guided is just different
vehicles<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:22.920> you're<00:01:23.040> going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
vehicles so you're going to have you

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.660 
vehicles so you're going to have you
know<00:01:23.850> your<00:01:24.030> tank<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:25.170> jets<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:26.040> your

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
know your tank your jets and your your

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.219 
know your tank your jets and your your
helicopters<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.479> they're<00:01:27.630> they're<00:01:27.930> just

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
helicopters and they're they're just

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.480 
helicopters and they're they're just
different<00:01:28.350> names<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.250> this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
different names but they do this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.340 
different names but they do this
essentially<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> same<00:01:30.060> thing<00:01:30.140> I'm<00:01:31.140> not

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
essentially the same thing I'm not

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.929 
essentially the same thing I'm not
actually<00:01:31.560> sure<00:01:31.799> how<00:01:32.280> these<00:01:32.490> things<00:01:32.520> are<00:01:32.729> going

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
actually sure how these things are going

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.340 
actually sure how these things are going
to<00:01:33.030> be<00:01:33.060> guided<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.450> how<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.659> mechanics<00:01:33.869> are

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
to be guided and how the mechanics are

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.050 
to be guided and how the mechanics are
going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.950> work<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.579> guess<00:01:35.850> we'll<00:01:36.030> just

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
going to work but I guess we'll just

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.280 
going to work but I guess we'll just
have<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.270> wait<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.479> see<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.930> battlefield

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
have to wait and see you in battlefield

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.690 
have to wait and see you in battlefield
3<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.740> hopefully<00:01:38.220> they're<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.640> in

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
3 or hopefully they're going to be in

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.760 
3 or hopefully they're going to be in
the<00:01:38.790> beta<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.150> well<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.320> hopefully<00:01:40.409> we'll

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the beta as well so hopefully we'll

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.160 
the beta as well so hopefully we'll
figure<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.159> out<00:01:41.220> shortly<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.869> also<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
figure that out shortly there is also a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.830 
figure that out shortly there is also a
couple<00:01:43.470> optics<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:45.030> vehicles<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:45.689> are

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
couple optics on the vehicles which are

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.330 
couple optics on the vehicles which are
Zoomer<00:01:46.170> optics<00:01:46.500> which<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.250> bed

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
Zoomer optics which are just like in bed

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.160 
Zoomer optics which are just like in bed
company<00:01:47.759> where<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.570> option<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
company where you have that option to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.109 
company where you have that option to
zoom<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.710> zoom<00:01:49.740> out<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.030> just

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
zoom in and zoom out and this is just

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.270 
zoom in and zoom out and this is just
for<00:01:51.360> those<00:01:51.630> players<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.259> want<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.740> plan<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
for those players that want to plan a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.800 
for those players that want to plan a
tank<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.759> snipe<00:01:54.149> people<00:01:54.450> from<00:01:54.600> our<00:01:54.720> an

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
tank and snipe people from our an

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.209 
tank and snipe people from our an
extremely<00:01:55.380> far<00:01:55.560> distance<00:01:55.920> you're<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
extremely far distance you're going to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.740 
extremely far distance you're going to
have<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.430> option<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.909> there's<00:01:57.509> also

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
have that option and there's also

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.200 
have that option and there's also
thermal<00:01:58.380> optics<00:01:58.530> which<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.610> essentially

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
thermal optics which will essentially

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.080 
thermal optics which will essentially
anything<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.530> has<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.950> heat<00:02:02.430> signature<00:02:02.729> is

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
anything that has a heat signature is

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.709 
anything that has a heat signature is
going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.540> show<00:02:03.899> up<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.200> your<00:02:04.290> screen<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.719> show

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
going to show up on your screen and show

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.180 
going to show up on your screen and show
up<00:02:06.840> like<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> sore<00:02:07.229> thumb<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.740> these<00:02:07.979> are

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
up like a sore thumb so these are

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.910 
up like a sore thumb so these are
inventory<00:02:08.640> units<00:02:08.910> tanks<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.140> jets<00:02:10.739> I'm

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
inventory units tanks and jets I'm

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.530 
inventory units tanks and jets I'm
assuming

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
assuming

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.020 
assuming
and<00:02:11.659> we<00:02:12.469> actually<00:02:12.650> get<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.069> glimpse<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:13.579> this<00:02:13.790> in

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
and we actually get a glimpse of this in

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.970 
and we actually get a glimpse of this in
action<00:02:14.299> in<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.989> Caspian<00:02:15.469> Border<00:02:15.560> trailer

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
action in the Caspian Border trailer

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.830 
action in the Caspian Border trailer
where<00:02:16.159> it<00:02:16.280> looks<00:02:16.459> like<00:02:16.609> a<00:02:16.760> helicopter<00:02:17.659> is

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
where it looks like a helicopter is

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.349 
where it looks like a helicopter is
flying<00:02:18.019> over<00:02:18.409> a<00:02:18.829> Down<00:02:19.430> vehicle<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.060> I'm

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
flying over a Down vehicle and I'm

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.940 
flying over a Down vehicle and I'm
assuming<00:02:20.719> it's<00:02:20.810> using<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.200> thermal<00:02:21.650> optics

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
assuming it's using the thermal optics

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.399 
assuming it's using the thermal optics
because<00:02:22.640> infantry<00:02:23.599> units<00:02:23.870> are<00:02:23.959> showing<00:02:24.200> up<00:02:24.290> as

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
because infantry units are showing up as

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.229 
because infantry units are showing up as
white<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.859> they<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.819> know<00:02:25.849> they<00:02:25.939> really

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
white and they you know they really

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.300 
white and they you know they really
stick<00:02:26.510> out<00:02:26.659> so<00:02:26.719> I'm<00:02:27.650> assuming<00:02:27.769> that's<00:02:28.129> going

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
stick out so I'm assuming that's going

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.789 
stick out so I'm assuming that's going
to<00:02:28.370> be<00:02:28.430> thermal<00:02:28.730> optics<00:02:28.879> in<00:02:29.180> battlefield<00:02:29.569> 3

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
to be thermal optics in battlefield 3

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.020 
to be thermal optics in battlefield 3
there's<00:02:30.799> also<00:02:30.980> some<00:02:31.220> other<00:02:31.370> cool<00:02:31.519> stuff<00:02:31.579> like

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
there's also some other cool stuff like

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.229 
there's also some other cool stuff like
the<00:02:32.290> coaxial<00:02:33.290> mg<00:02:33.769> in<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.099> HMG<00:02:34.640> I'm<00:02:35.000> not<00:02:35.120> really

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
the coaxial mg in the HMG I'm not really

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.610 
the coaxial mg in the HMG I'm not really
sure<00:02:35.329> what<00:02:35.629> the<00:02:35.720> difference<00:02:35.840> between<00:02:36.230> those

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
sure what the difference between those

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.410 
sure what the difference between those
two<00:02:36.829> are<00:02:37.010> but<00:02:37.579> they're<00:02:37.700> essentially<00:02:38.060> like<00:02:38.239> in

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
two are but they're essentially like in

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.300 
two are but they're essentially like in
bed<00:02:38.510> company<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.439> where<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.769> could<00:02:39.889> have<00:02:40.099> a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
bed company to where you could have a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.809 
bed company to where you could have a
mounted<00:02:41.120> turret<00:02:41.840> on<00:02:42.049> your<00:02:42.319> tank<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:43.700> can

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
mounted turret on your tank and you can

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.399 
mounted turret on your tank and you can
basically<00:02:43.970> spray<00:02:44.599> bullets<00:02:44.780> at<00:02:45.049> your<00:02:45.139> enemy

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
basically spray bullets at your enemy

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.009 
basically spray bullets at your enemy
while<00:02:45.620> your<00:02:46.040> your<00:02:46.879> tank<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.269> reloading<00:02:47.780> it's

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
while your your tank is reloading it's

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.770 
while your your tank is reloading it's
it's<00:02:48.379> a<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:48.889> main<00:02:49.370> ammunition<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.180> it's<00:02:50.629> just

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
it's a it's main ammunition so it's just

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.449 
it's a it's main ammunition so it's just
another<00:02:50.900> way<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.139> do<00:02:51.680> some<00:02:51.980> damage<00:02:52.129> to<00:02:52.370> your

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
another way to do some damage to your

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.429 
another way to do some damage to your
enemy<00:02:52.669> there<00:02:53.239> is<00:02:53.419> also<00:02:53.599> something<00:02:54.019> called<00:02:54.139> the

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:54.439 
enemy there is also something called the

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.710 
enemy there is also something called the
IR<00:02:54.889> smoke<00:02:55.250> which<00:02:55.519> I'm<00:02:55.730> assuming<00:02:55.879> is<00:02:56.329> much<00:02:56.540> like

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
IR smoke which I'm assuming is much like

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.960 
IR smoke which I'm assuming is much like
that<00:02:56.930> battlefield<00:02:57.530> bad<00:02:57.799> company<00:02:57.950> 2<00:02:58.310> where<00:02:58.939> you

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
that battlefield bad company 2 where you

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.420 
that battlefield bad company 2 where you
have<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.629> option<00:02:59.840> to<00:03:00.079> kind<00:03:00.859> of<00:03:00.889> throw<00:03:01.340> out<00:03:01.400> a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
have the option to kind of throw out a

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
site from your enemies to kind of maybe

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.920 
site from your enemies to kind of maybe
to<00:03:06.769> repair<00:03:07.069> your<00:03:07.099> tank<00:03:07.629> maybe<00:03:08.629> if<00:03:08.780> there's

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
to repair your tank maybe if there's

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.479 
to repair your tank maybe if there's
some<00:03:09.139> sort<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.349> tracer<00:03:09.709> dart<00:03:09.919> like<00:03:10.220> in<00:03:10.370> bad

company 2 to get rid of that I'm not

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.500 
company 2 to get rid of that I'm not
really<00:03:13.459> sure<00:03:13.549> but<00:03:13.849> it's<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.180> going<00:03:14.299> to<00:03:14.329> be<00:03:14.419> a

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
really sure but it's just going to be a

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.849 
really sure but it's just going to be a
more<00:03:14.989> defensive<00:03:16.299> tactic<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.859> specialization

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
more defensive tactic and specialization

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.439 
more defensive tactic and specialization
there<00:03:19.699> is<00:03:19.849> also<00:03:20.030> something<00:03:20.329> called

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
there is also something called

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.390 
there is also something called
maintenance<00:03:20.930> which<00:03:21.440> I'm<00:03:21.590> assuming<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:22.099> going

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
maintenance which I'm assuming is going

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.530 
maintenance which I'm assuming is going
to<00:03:22.549> increase<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:24.519> health<00:03:25.519> regeneration<00:03:25.970> on

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
to increase the health regeneration on

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.449 
to increase the health regeneration on
your<00:03:27.049> tank<00:03:27.319> because<00:03:27.620> there<00:03:27.739> is<00:03:27.859> actual<00:03:28.250> health

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
your tank because there is actual health

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.879 
your tank because there is actual health
regeneration<00:03:28.790> in<00:03:29.329> battlefield<00:03:29.870> 3<00:03:29.900> it's<00:03:30.590> kind

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
regeneration in battlefield 3 it's kind

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.319 
regeneration in battlefield 3 it's kind
of<00:03:30.979> controversial<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.699> lot<00:03:31.849> of<00:03:31.879> people<00:03:31.970> don't

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
of controversial a lot of people don't

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.789 
of controversial a lot of people don't
really<00:03:32.540> like<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.870> but<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.379> looks<00:03:33.530> like<00:03:33.650> there's

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
really like it but it looks like there's

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.379 
really like it but it looks like there's
actually<00:03:34.099> going<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.400> be<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.609> specialization

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
actually going to be a specialization

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.319 
actually going to be a specialization
that<00:03:35.569> will<00:03:35.959> maybe<00:03:36.109> increase<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.739> rate<00:03:36.919> or

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
that will maybe increase the rate or

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.390 
that will maybe increase the rate or
maybe<00:03:38.329> increase<00:03:38.659> the<00:03:39.379> time<00:03:39.620> or<00:03:39.919> decrease<00:03:40.370> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
maybe increase the time or decrease the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.210 
maybe increase the time or decrease the
time<00:03:40.669> it<00:03:41.000> takes<00:03:41.359> for<00:03:41.659> that<00:03:41.979> regeneration<00:03:42.979> to

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
time it takes for that regeneration to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.580 
time it takes for that regeneration to
actually<00:03:43.549> start<00:03:44.049> there's<00:03:45.049> also<00:03:45.290> something

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
actually start there's also something

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.229 
actually start there's also something
called<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:46.129> speed<00:03:46.519> belt<00:03:46.790> which<00:03:46.970> I'm<00:03:47.120> assuming

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
called the speed belt which I'm assuming

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.360 
called the speed belt which I'm assuming
is<00:03:47.540> just<00:03:47.720> going<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.019> increase<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.799> speed<00:03:49.129> at

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
is just going to increase the speed at

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.280 
is just going to increase the speed at
which<00:03:49.400> your<00:03:49.729> your<00:03:50.269> tank<00:03:50.569> and<00:03:50.720> move<00:03:50.900> back<00:03:51.079> I

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
which your your tank and move back I

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.210 
which your your tank and move back I
don't<00:03:51.590> really<00:03:51.709> think<00:03:51.859> it's<00:03:52.040> anything

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
don't really think it's anything

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.129 
don't really think it's anything
different<00:03:52.699> than<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:53.019> there's<00:03:54.019> also

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
different than that there's also

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.960 
different than that there's also
something<00:03:54.409> called<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.739> autoloader<00:03:55.310> which<00:03:55.669> in

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
something called the autoloader which in

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.640 
something called the autoloader which in
my<00:03:56.239> opinion<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:56.689> kind<00:03:56.959> of<00:03:57.049> confusing<00:03:57.199> because

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
my opinion is kind of confusing because

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.800 
my opinion is kind of confusing because
I<00:03:58.189> know<00:03:58.519> in<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.790> trailer<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.329> looked<00:03:59.540> like<00:03:59.659> you

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
I know in the trailer it looked like you

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.210 
I know in the trailer it looked like you
could<00:03:59.840> actually<00:04:00.169> reload<00:04:00.799> your<00:04:00.829> ammunition

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
could actually reload your ammunition

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.520 
could actually reload your ammunition
but<00:04:02.120> this<00:04:02.389> kind<00:04:02.599> of<00:04:02.689> gives<00:04:02.840> me<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.139> idea<00:04:03.439> that

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
but this kind of gives me the idea that

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.460 
but this kind of gives me the idea that
you<00:04:04.250> may<00:04:04.400> have<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:04.760> manually<00:04:05.209> reload<00:04:05.540> your<00:04:05.989> or

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
you may have to manually reload your or

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.170 
you may have to manually reload your or
hit<00:04:06.650> like<00:04:06.829> your<00:04:07.010> reload<00:04:07.280> button<00:04:07.430> every<00:04:07.879> single

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
hit like your reload button every single

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.729 
hit like your reload button every single
time<00:04:08.359> you<00:04:08.389> actually<00:04:08.629> want<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.019> reload<00:04:09.530> your

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
time you actually want to reload your

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.599 
time you actually want to reload your
main<00:04:10.729> weapon<00:04:11.229> and<00:04:12.229> this<00:04:12.590> autoloader<00:04:13.250> would

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
main weapon and this autoloader would

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.460 
main weapon and this autoloader would
just<00:04:13.790> make<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:15.109> know<00:04:15.229> you<00:04:15.290> wouldn't

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
just make that you know you wouldn't

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.930 
just make that you know you wouldn't
have<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.769> do<00:04:15.919> that<00:04:16.039> anymore<00:04:16.099> so<00:04:16.699> I'm<00:04:16.820> not

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
have to do that anymore so I'm not

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.789 
have to do that anymore so I'm not
really<00:04:17.090> sure<00:04:17.209> what<00:04:18.139> this<00:04:18.289> autoloader

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
really sure what this autoloader

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.330 
really sure what this autoloader
specialization<00:04:19.549> is<00:04:19.760> if<00:04:20.299> you<00:04:20.419> have<00:04:20.450> any<00:04:20.779> idea

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
specialization is if you have any idea

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.550 
specialization is if you have any idea
our<00:04:21.459> speculations<00:04:22.270> on<00:04:22.690> what<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:22.900> could<00:04:22.930> be<00:04:23.080> let

something<00:04:28.060> called<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.419> proximity<00:04:28.900> skin

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
something called the proximity skin

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.930 
something called the proximity skin
which<00:04:29.830> may<00:04:30.130> be<00:04:30.160> something<00:04:30.550> like<00:04:30.669> in<00:04:30.820> bad

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
which may be something like in bad

I<00:04:58.330> could<00:04:58.510> be<00:04:58.630> wrong<00:04:58.810> but<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.440> think<00:04:59.560> that<00:04:59.830> might

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
I could be wrong but I think that might

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.640 
I could be wrong but I think that might
be<00:05:00.250> kinda<00:05:01.240> where<00:05:01.479> that<00:05:01.720> specialization<00:05:02.260> is

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
be kinda where that specialization is

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.580 
be kinda where that specialization is
heading<00:05:03.660> there<00:05:04.660> is<00:05:04.690> also<00:05:05.080> something<00:05:05.470> called

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
heading there is also something called

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.030 
heading there is also something called
the<00:05:05.830> atgm<00:05:06.700> launcher<00:05:06.870> which<00:05:07.870> I<00:05:08.229> could<00:05:08.740> be<00:05:08.860> wrong

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
the atgm launcher which I could be wrong

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.040 
the atgm launcher which I could be wrong
when<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.550> looked<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:09.940> up<00:05:10.030> it<00:05:10.240> really<00:05:10.810> wasn't<00:05:11.020> a

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
when I looked it up it really wasn't a

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.030 
when I looked it up it really wasn't a
whole<00:05:11.200> lot<00:05:11.229> of<00:05:11.320> information<00:05:11.410> that<00:05:11.800> I<00:05:11.889> could

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
whole lot of information that I could

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.120 
whole lot of information that I could
find<00:05:12.220> that<00:05:12.460> was<00:05:12.760> easily<00:05:13.320> readable<00:05:14.320> I<00:05:14.710> guess<00:05:14.919> if

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
find that was easily readable I guess if

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.070 
find that was easily readable I guess if
that<00:05:15.220> makes<00:05:15.400> any<00:05:15.460> sense<00:05:15.580> but<00:05:16.450> from<00:05:16.870> what<00:05:16.960> it

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
that makes any sense but from what it

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.710 
that makes any sense but from what it
looked<00:05:17.260> like<00:05:17.320> it<00:05:17.590> looked<00:05:17.710> like<00:05:17.889> it<00:05:18.070> was<00:05:18.250> a

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
looked like it looked like it was a

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.260 
looked like it looked like it was a
anti-air<00:05:19.720> launcher<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:20.979> if<00:05:21.280> you<00:05:21.520> are<00:05:21.789> in<00:05:22.120> a

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
anti-air launcher so if you are in a

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.020 
anti-air launcher so if you are in a
tank<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.960> isn't<00:05:23.470> equipped<00:05:23.800> with<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.490> you<00:05:24.940> know

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
tank that isn't equipped with a you know

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.330 
tank that isn't equipped with a you know
anti-air<00:05:25.479> missiles<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:26.560> will<00:05:26.740> give<00:05:26.979> you<00:05:27.160> that

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
anti-air missiles it will give you that

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.150 
anti-air missiles it will give you that
option<00:05:27.550> to<00:05:27.789> maybe<00:05:28.780> be<00:05:29.200> an<00:05:29.410> anti<00:05:29.680> ground<00:05:29.950> and

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
option to maybe be an anti ground and

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.219 
option to maybe be an anti ground and
also<00:05:30.430> anti-tank<00:05:31.030> vehicles<00:05:31.600> so<00:05:31.810> kind<00:05:32.050> of<00:05:32.110> like

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
also anti-tank vehicles so kind of like

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.760 
also anti-tank vehicles so kind of like

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
just going to kind of go over the

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.409 
just going to kind of go over the
specializations<00:05:45.880> I<00:05:45.970> thought<00:05:46.150> were<00:05:46.240> really

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
specializations I thought were really

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.230 
specializations I thought were really
cool<00:05:46.720> and<00:05:46.870> really<00:05:46.900> interesting<00:05:47.500> so<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.490> ECM

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
cool and really interesting so the ECM

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.060 
cool and really interesting so the ECM
jammer<00:05:49.270> is<00:05:49.810> really<00:05:50.380> cool<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:50.800> what<00:05:50.889> it<00:05:50.979> allows

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
jammer is really cool and what it allows

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.250 
jammer is really cool and what it allows
you<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:51.460> do<00:05:51.610> is<00:05:51.789> if<00:05:51.970> someone<00:05:52.180> has<00:05:52.419> a<00:05:52.630> lock<00:05:52.870> on<00:05:53.020> to

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
you to do is if someone has a lock on to

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.450 
you to do is if someone has a lock on to
your<00:05:53.349> vehicle<00:05:53.740> you're<00:05:53.979> going<00:05:54.099> to<00:05:54.160> be<00:05:54.250> able<00:05:54.280> to

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
your vehicle you're going to be able to

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.190 
your vehicle you're going to be able to
make<00:05:54.610> i'm<00:05:54.880> assuming<00:05:55.180> press<00:05:55.570> a<00:05:55.720> button<00:05:55.990> and

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
make i'm assuming press a button and

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.990 
make i'm assuming press a button and
it's<00:05:56.919> going<00:05:57.070> to<00:05:57.190> send<00:05:57.460> out<00:05:57.520> this<00:05:57.639> jamming

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
it's going to send out this jamming

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.270 
it's going to send out this jamming
device<00:05:58.270> or<00:05:58.510> something<00:05:59.020> and<00:05:59.200> it's<00:05:59.950> going<00:06:00.160> to

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
device or something and it's going to

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.070 
device or something and it's going to
make<00:06:00.460> it<00:06:00.610> so<00:06:00.789> that<00:06:00.820> you<00:06:01.360> will<00:06:01.450> they<00:06:01.750> no<00:06:01.900> longer

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
make it so that you will they no longer

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.320 
make it so that you will they no longer
have<00:06:02.380> a<00:06:02.410> lock<00:06:02.740> on<00:06:02.889> to<00:06:03.190> your<00:06:03.340> vehicle<00:06:03.789> so<00:06:04.000> if

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
have a lock on to your vehicle so if

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.640 
have a lock on to your vehicle so if
you're<00:06:04.570> in<00:06:04.660> a<00:06:04.720> jet<00:06:04.960> this<00:06:05.229> is<00:06:05.289> going<00:06:05.500> to<00:06:05.560> be

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
you're in a jet this is going to be

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.650 
you're in a jet this is going to be
really<00:06:05.860> important<00:06:06.400> because<00:06:06.550> i'm<00:06:07.120> assuming<00:06:07.389> a

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
really important because i'm assuming a

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.730 
really important because i'm assuming a
lot<00:06:07.780> of<00:06:07.900> people<00:06:08.080> are<00:06:08.169> going<00:06:08.289> to<00:06:08.410> be<00:06:08.470> gunning

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
lot of people are going to be gunning

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.620 
lot of people are going to be gunning
for<00:06:08.889> you<00:06:09.010> and<00:06:09.190> having<00:06:10.120> these<00:06:10.240> jammer<00:06:10.510> is

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
for you and having these jammer is

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.360 
for you and having these jammer is
probably<00:06:11.349> going<00:06:11.500> to<00:06:11.590> save<00:06:11.770> your<00:06:11.919> life<00:06:12.099> more

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
probably going to save your life more

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.460 
probably going to save your life more
than<00:06:12.430> once<00:06:12.750> there<00:06:13.750> is<00:06:13.840> also<00:06:14.020> something<00:06:14.349> called

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
than once there is also something called

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.860 
than once there is also something called
the<00:06:14.710> TV<00:06:15.190> missile<00:06:15.639> which<00:06:16.150> I'm<00:06:16.389> assuming<00:06:16.510> is

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
the TV missile which I'm assuming is

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.629 
the TV missile which I'm assuming is
something<00:06:17.200> much<00:06:17.440> like<00:06:17.680> in<00:06:17.919> battlefield<00:06:18.370> to

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
something much like in battlefield to

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.730 
something much like in battlefield to
where<00:06:19.060> you<00:06:19.240> were<00:06:19.539> in<00:06:19.630> the<00:06:19.720> chopper<00:06:20.020> gunner<00:06:20.200> you

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
where you were in the chopper gunner you

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.870 
where you were in the chopper gunner you
would<00:06:20.860> have<00:06:20.979> the<00:06:21.099> option<00:06:21.430> to<00:06:21.460> you<00:06:21.639> kind<00:06:21.849> of

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
would have the option to you kind of

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.790 
would have the option to you kind of
like<00:06:22.030> the<00:06:22.180> shoot<00:06:22.450> of<00:06:22.570> rocket<00:06:22.960> and<00:06:23.110> that<00:06:23.470> rocket

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
like the shoot of rocket and that rocket

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.260 
like the shoot of rocket and that rocket
you<00:06:23.919> would<00:06:24.010> have<00:06:24.160> a<00:06:24.190> little<00:06:24.820> camera<00:06:25.150> in<00:06:25.210> the

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
you would have a little camera in the

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.550 
you would have a little camera in the
front<00:06:25.300> of<00:06:25.510> it<00:06:25.630> and<00:06:25.750> actually<00:06:25.900> guide<00:06:26.380> it

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
front of it and actually guide it

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.990 
front of it and actually guide it
towards<00:06:26.800> your<00:06:27.220> target<00:06:27.400> so<00:06:27.760> you<00:06:27.820> would

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
towards your target so you would

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.589 
towards your target so you would
literally<00:06:28.270> run<00:06:29.200> in<00:06:29.500> to<00:06:30.039> an<00:06:30.490> enemy<00:06:30.820> chopper<00:06:31.360> or

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
literally run in to an enemy chopper or

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:32.370 
literally run in to an enemy chopper or
then<00:06:31.900> maybe<00:06:32.050> 10

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
then maybe 10

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.140 
then maybe 10
and<00:06:32.560> take<00:06:32.890> them<00:06:33.070> out<00:06:33.160> really<00:06:33.520> quickly<00:06:33.760> and<00:06:34.060> it

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
and take them out really quickly and it

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.960 
and take them out really quickly and it
was<00:06:34.240> a<00:06:34.270> really<00:06:34.540> fun<00:06:34.810> and<00:06:35.110> cool<00:06:35.170> way<00:06:35.530> of<00:06:35.970> using

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
was a really fun and cool way of using

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.910 
was a really fun and cool way of using
our<00:06:37.360> plane<00:06:37.780> the<00:06:38.080> chopper<00:06:38.320> gunner<00:06:38.620> so<00:06:38.800> I<00:06:38.830> think

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
our plane the chopper gunner so I think

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.530 
our plane the chopper gunner so I think
that's<00:06:39.130> also<00:06:39.460> very<00:06:39.490> cool<00:06:39.940> addition<00:06:40.330> to<00:06:40.420> the

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
that's also very cool addition to the

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.360 
that's also very cool addition to the
game<00:06:40.720> there<00:06:41.410> is<00:06:41.530> also<00:06:41.680> something<00:06:41.980> called<00:06:42.100> the

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
game there is also something called the

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.150 
game there is also something called the
below<00:06:42.670> radar<00:06:42.940> and<00:06:43.390> the<00:06:43.780> air<00:06:43.990> radar<00:06:44.530> for

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
below radar and the air radar for

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.220 
below radar and the air radar for
vehicles<00:06:45.670> and<00:06:45.910> to<00:06:46.330> be<00:06:46.450> honest<00:06:46.750> I'm<00:06:46.930> kind<00:06:47.170> of

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
vehicles and to be honest I'm kind of

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.930 
vehicles and to be honest I'm kind of
confused<00:06:47.650> as<00:06:48.100> to<00:06:48.130> how<00:06:48.310> this<00:06:48.460> is<00:06:48.580> going<00:06:48.730> to<00:06:48.850> be

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
confused as to how this is going to be

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.520 
confused as to how this is going to be
used<00:06:49.150> because<00:06:49.330> on<00:06:49.690> your<00:06:49.870> mini-map<00:06:50.110> it's<00:06:50.380> not

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530 
used because on your mini-map it's not

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.960 
used because on your mini-map it's not
really<00:06:50.980> big<00:06:51.190> at<00:06:51.370> least<00:06:51.490> in<00:06:51.640> the<00:06:51.700> previous

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
really big at least in the previous

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.950 
really big at least in the previous
titles<00:06:52.390> and<00:06:53.250> having<00:06:54.250> a<00:06:54.340> radar<00:06:54.760> or<00:06:55.720> having

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
titles and having a radar or having

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.120 
titles and having a radar or having
vehicle<00:06:56.230> show<00:06:56.380> up<00:06:56.440> on<00:06:56.530> your<00:06:56.560> radar<00:06:56.770> I<00:06:56.890> really

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130 
vehicle show up on your radar I really

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.590 
vehicle show up on your radar I really
don't<00:06:57.280> see<00:06:57.340> that<00:06:57.520> being<00:06:57.700> very<00:06:58.150> useful<00:06:58.570> because

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
don't see that being very useful because

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.480 
don't see that being very useful because
they're<00:06:59.530> going<00:06:59.650> to<00:06:59.710> zip<00:06:59.890> in<00:07:00.040> and<00:07:00.070> zip<00:07:00.370> out

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
they're going to zip in and zip out

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.220 
they're going to zip in and zip out
really<00:07:00.760> quickly<00:07:00.910> especially<00:07:01.240> if<00:07:01.600> they're<00:07:01.750> you

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.230 
really quickly especially if they're you

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.050 
really quickly especially if they're you
know<00:07:02.260> an<00:07:02.500> air<00:07:02.650> vehicle<00:07:03.100> so<00:07:03.370> not<00:07:03.790> really<00:07:03.940> sure

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
know an air vehicle so not really sure

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.090 
know an air vehicle so not really sure
how<00:07:04.210> that's<00:07:04.390> going<00:07:04.540> to<00:07:04.660> be<00:07:04.750> used<00:07:05.140> so<00:07:05.980> this

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.100 
how that's going to be used so this

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.470 
how that's going to be used so this
