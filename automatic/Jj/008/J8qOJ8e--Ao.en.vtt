that he's hurting because this is the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.020 
that he's hurting because this is the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
events and we think kids in in

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.080 
events and we think kids in in
elementary<00:00:58.710> school<00:00:59.039> are<00:00:59.520> ready<00:00:59.789> for<00:00:59.969> the

meaning<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.320> events<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.820> show<00:01:03.180> Jesus

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
meaning of the events so we show Jesus

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.750 
meaning of the events so we show Jesus
on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> cross<00:01:04.140> he's<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.890> bloody<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.519> he<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
on the cross he's not bloody but he is a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.210 
on the cross he's not bloody but he is a
little<00:01:06.000> bruised<00:01:06.420> more<00:01:06.810> importantly<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.830> see

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
little bruised more importantly we see

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.609 
little bruised more importantly we see
how<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.000> affects<00:01:09.390> how<00:01:09.600> seeing<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.200> affects

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
how it affects how seeing that affects

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.740 
how it affects how seeing that affects
the<00:01:10.830> other<00:01:10.860> characters<00:01:11.549> how<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> puppets

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the other characters how the puppets

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.609 
the other characters how the puppets
respond<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:14.400> seeing<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.939> happen<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.900> we

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
respond to seeing this happen and we

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.080 
respond to seeing this happen and we
visualize<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.640> think<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:17.970> is

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
visualize and I think this is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.670 
visualize and I think this is
potentially<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> most<00:01:18.720> powerful<00:01:19.290> part<00:01:19.530> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
potentially the most powerful part that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
potentially the most powerful part that
I<00:01:19.710> don't<00:01:19.830> know<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.100> I've<00:01:20.189> ever<00:01:20.250> seen<00:01:20.460> done

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
I don't know that I've ever seen done

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.440 
I don't know that I've ever seen done
before<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:21.630> visualized<00:01:22.409> what<00:01:22.680> God<00:01:23.009> saw<00:01:23.450> when

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
before we visualized what God saw when

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.499 
before we visualized what God saw when
Jesus<00:01:24.960> bore<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.770> sin<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.880> world<00:01:26.909> we've

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
Jesus bore the sin of the world we've

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.780 
Jesus bore the sin of the world we've
set<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.110> visual<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.770> sins<00:01:29.070> since<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> very

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
set up a visual for sins since the very

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.960 
set up a visual for sins since the very
beginning<00:01:30.030> since<00:01:30.540> DVD<00:01:31.110> 1<00:01:31.470> sin<00:01:32.460> entered<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
beginning since DVD 1 sin entered the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.080 
beginning since DVD 1 sin entered the
world<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:34.140> made<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.409> visual<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.759> kids

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
world and we made that visual so kids

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.609 
world and we made that visual so kids
could<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.930> wasn't<00:01:37.259> completely

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
could see it so it wasn't completely

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.149 
could see it so it wasn't completely
intangible<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.579> gave<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.270> form<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.799> sin

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
intangible we gave a form to sin

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.460 
intangible we gave a form to sin
entering<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> world<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.659> way<00:01:42.990> back<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.350> I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
entering the world and way back then I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.679 
entering the world and way back then I
was<00:01:43.590> three<00:01:43.799> years<00:01:43.829> ago<00:01:44.250> way<00:01:44.490> back<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.149> knew

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
was three years ago way back then I knew

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.469 
was three years ago way back then I knew
that<00:01:46.140> when<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.320> got<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.530> Jesus<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.729> cross<00:01:48.000> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that when I got to Jesus on the cross I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.889 
that when I got to Jesus on the cross I
was<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> bring<00:01:49.439> back<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.950> visual<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
was going to bring back that visual and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.350 
was going to bring back that visual and
Jesus<00:01:51.899> would<00:01:52.110> bear<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.649> sin<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.610> world<00:01:53.640> in

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
Jesus would bear the sin of the world in

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.139 
Jesus would bear the sin of the world in
a<00:01:54.600> visual<00:01:55.200> representation<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.850> couldn't

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
a visual representation and I couldn't

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.399 
a visual representation and I couldn't
wait<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.360> get<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.930> point<00:01:58.140> because<00:01:58.350> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
wait to get to that point because I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.560 
wait to get to that point because I
thought<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.740> would<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.250> powerful<00:01:59.790> for<00:02:00.149> kids

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
thought it would be so powerful for kids

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.730 
thought it would be so powerful for kids
to<00:02:00.810> actually<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.710> what<00:02:02.460> God<00:02:02.729> saw<00:02:03.469> so<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> can't

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
to actually see what God saw so I can't

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.719 
to actually see what God saw so I can't
wait<00:02:04.860> for<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.189> see<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.430> either<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.640> think

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
wait for you to see it either I think

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.600 
wait for you to see it either I think
it's<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.689> effective<00:02:07.229> in

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
it's really going to be effective in

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.059 
it's really going to be effective in
connecting<00:02:08.610> kids<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.330> emotion<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.259> what

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
connecting kids to the emotion of what

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.210 
connecting kids to the emotion of what
God<00:02:11.430> did<00:02:11.819> because<00:02:12.239> he<00:02:12.420> loved<00:02:12.690> us

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
God did because he loved us

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.340 
God did because he loved us
much<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.730> how<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.120> completely<00:02:14.720> changes<00:02:15.200> our

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
much and how it completely changes our

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.089 
much and how it completely changes our
lives<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.950> hope<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.940> enjoy<00:02:17.240> it
