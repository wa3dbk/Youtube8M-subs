the the Kydex sheath really doesn't and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
the the Kydex sheath really doesn't and
I'll<00:00:52.469> show<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.649> guys<00:00:52.800> here<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.370> doesn't<00:00:53.550> hang

on<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> handle<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> knife

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
on to the to the handle of the knife

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.119 
on to the to the handle of the knife
let's<00:00:56.730> say<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.379> I'm<00:00:58.500> thinking<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:58.949> more

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
let's say and I'm thinking it's more

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.670 
let's say and I'm thinking it's more
because<00:00:59.520> if<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.530> have

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
because if you do have it if you do have

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.070 
because if you do have it if you do have
the<00:01:01.800> Kydex<00:01:02.039> hanging<00:01:02.609> onto<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> knife<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.960> will

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the Kydex hanging onto the knife it will

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.140 
the Kydex hanging onto the knife it will
ruin<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.010> handle<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.850> an<00:01:05.939> over

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
ruin the the handle because it's an over

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.380 
ruin the the handle because it's an over
molded<00:01:06.479> rubber<00:01:07.200> handled<00:01:08.000> which<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.150> really
