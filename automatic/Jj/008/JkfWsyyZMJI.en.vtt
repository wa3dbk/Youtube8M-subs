of<00:00:10.469> war<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:12.019> basically<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.200> be<00:00:13.320> used<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.740> just

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
of war and basically to be used it just

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.279 
of war and basically to be used it just
roadblocks<00:00:14.519> something<00:00:15.089> two<00:00:15.210> units<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.170> to

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
roadblocks something two units have to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.620 
roadblocks something two units have to
be<00:00:16.410> moved<00:00:16.619> around<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.850> mean<00:00:18.029> as<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.359> see

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
be moved around but I mean as we see

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.210 
be moved around but I mean as we see
they<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.080> used<00:00:19.350> for<00:00:19.619> other<00:00:19.740> games<00:00:20.039> where

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
they can be used for other games where

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.679 
they can be used for other games where
you<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:20.400> get<00:00:20.550> figures<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.240> out<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.539> them

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
you can get figures in and out of them

you can get figures in and out of them
three<00:00:22.680> pieces<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.340> built<00:00:23.580> these<00:00:23.760> couple<00:00:24.269> of

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
three pieces I built these couple of

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.269 
three pieces I built these couple of
weeks<00:00:24.480> ago<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> only<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.890> recently<00:00:26.070> got

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
weeks ago but I only just recently got

weeks ago but I only just recently got
around<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.670> finishing<00:00:26.699> them<00:00:27.150> off<00:00:27.240> adding<00:00:27.570> some

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
around to finishing them off adding some

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.450 
around to finishing them off adding some
static<00:00:28.050> grass<00:00:28.260> clumps<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.010> some<00:00:29.220> quant

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
static grass clumps and some quant

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.429 
static grass clumps and some quant
foliage<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.000> trees<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.689> stuff<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.050> so

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
foliage and trees and stuff like that so

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.290 
foliage and trees and stuff like that so
let's<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.340> quick<00:00:32.520> look<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:32.759> these<00:00:32.880> ones<00:00:33.149> if

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
let's have a quick look at these ones if

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.459 
let's have a quick look at these ones if
you're<00:00:33.450> interested<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.870> something<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.260> this

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
you're interested in something like this

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.799 
you're interested in something like this
I'm<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:35.340> sure<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:35.790> I'll<00:00:35.940> do<00:00:36.090> hers<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.540> sort

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
I'm not sure if I'll do hers that sort

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.910 
I'm not sure if I'll do hers that sort
of<00:00:36.840> stuff<00:00:37.020> you'll<00:00:37.260> you'll<00:00:37.469> see<00:00:37.649> these<00:00:37.770> are

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
of stuff you'll you'll see these are

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.560 
of stuff you'll you'll see these are
made<00:00:38.040> from<00:00:38.190> my<00:00:38.370> hair<00:00:38.520> stops<00:00:38.790> blocks<00:00:39.059> there

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
made from my hair stops blocks there

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750 
made from my hair stops blocks there
talk<00:00:39.780> quite<00:00:40.050> time<00:00:40.320> consuming<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:41.010> build<00:00:41.280> I've

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
talk quite time consuming to build I've

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580 
talk quite time consuming to build I've
still<00:00:42.239> got<00:00:42.420> loads<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.960> loads<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.320> blocks

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
still got loads and loads of blocks

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.869 
still got loads and loads of blocks
hanging<00:00:43.890> around<00:00:44.129> from<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.430> different<00:00:44.670> sorts

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
hanging around from all different sorts

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.660 
hanging around from all different sorts
of<00:00:45.059> molds<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.960> will<00:00:46.710> use<00:00:47.010> those<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.460> build

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
of molds so I will use those to build

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.479 
of molds so I will use those to build
more<00:00:47.820> pieces<00:00:48.289> for<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.320> studio<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:50.280> let's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
more pieces for the studio but let's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.920 
more pieces for the studio but let's
have<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> look<00:00:50.760> at<00:00:50.789> these<00:00:50.879> ones<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.660> they're<00:00:51.809> all

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
have a look at these ones so they're all

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
have a look at these ones so they're all
very<00:00:52.110> similar<00:00:52.620> way<00:00:52.710> i'll<00:00:52.829> use<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> six<00:00:53.460> inch

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
very similar way i'll use the six inch

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.389 
very similar way i'll use the six inch
round<00:00:54.000> mold<00:00:54.350> there<00:00:55.350> are<00:00:55.530> some<00:00:55.800> sections<00:00:56.250> on

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
round mold there are some sections on

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.860 
round mold there are some sections on
these<00:00:56.579> models<00:00:57.000> where<00:00:57.149> some<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> glue<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
these models where some of the glue is a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.330 
these models where some of the glue is a
little<00:00:58.170> bit<00:00:58.289> shiny<00:00:58.590> because<00:00:58.920> i've<00:00:59.039> used<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
little bit shiny because i've used a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.819 
little bit shiny because i've used a
thicker<00:00:59.520> PVA<00:01:00.030> there's<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:00.989> section<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.649> this

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
thicker PVA there's one section on this

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.170 
thicker PVA there's one section on this
model<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.340> where<00:01:02.489> i<00:01:02.520> dropped<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.969> piece<00:01:03.120> of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
model here where i dropped a piece of

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.000 
model here where i dropped a piece of
glue<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.480> didn't<00:01:03.840> clean<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.830> that's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
glue and didn't clean it up but that's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.260 
glue and didn't clean it up but that's
fine<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.430> i<00:01:05.519> said<00:01:05.700> these<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:05.970> these<00:01:06.210> are

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
fine like i said these are these are

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.000 
fine like i said these are these are
studio<00:01:06.689> models<00:01:07.049> these<00:01:07.229> will<00:01:07.380> get<00:01:07.530> used<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.890> our

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
studio models these will get used in our

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.580 
studio models these will get used in our
games<00:01:08.340> i<00:01:08.640> will<00:01:09.479> clean<00:01:09.750> those<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.260> little<00:01:10.290> bit

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
games i will clean those up a little bit

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.510 
games i will clean those up a little bit
if<00:01:10.680> they're<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.010> come<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.250> battle

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
if they're going to come in battle

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
if they're going to come in battle
reports<00:01:11.880> further<00:01:12.180> down<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> track<00:01:12.450> once<00:01:12.840> we

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
reports further down the track once we

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.320 
reports further down the track once we
get<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> studio<00:01:13.560> cleaned<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.640> um<00:01:14.880> they're

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
get the studio cleaned up but um they're

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.070 
get the studio cleaned up but um they're
all<00:01:15.479> pretty<00:01:16.439> much<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> same<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.430> same<00:01:17.460> mold

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
all pretty much the same the same mold

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.170 
all pretty much the same the same mold
just<00:01:19.080> off<00:01:19.439> cuts<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.009> i<00:01:20.130> had<00:01:20.369> hanging<00:01:20.729> around

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
just off cuts that i had hanging around

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.390 
just off cuts that i had hanging around
five<00:01:21.720> cuts<00:01:22.080> spare<00:01:22.710> blocks<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.130> i<00:01:23.220> had

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
five cuts spare blocks that i had

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.039 
five cuts spare blocks that i had
hanging<00:01:23.640> around<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> while<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.020> thought

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
hanging around for a while so I thought

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.050 
hanging around for a while so I thought
I'd<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.439> something<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:25.979> them<00:01:26.159> each<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
I'd do something with them each of the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
with these pieces their spaces where you

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.090 
with these pieces their spaces where you
can<00:02:25.390> get<00:02:25.510> miniatures<00:02:25.990> inside<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.680> model<00:02:26.890> if

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100

models<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.120> there<00:02:31.300> but<00:02:31.840> as<00:02:31.960> unit<00:02:32.770> blockers<00:02:33.190> I

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
models in there but as unit blockers I

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.250 
models in there but as unit blockers I
think<00:02:33.760> these<00:02:33.850> pieces<00:02:34.120> work<00:02:34.450> quite<00:02:34.660> well<00:02:34.690> so

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260
