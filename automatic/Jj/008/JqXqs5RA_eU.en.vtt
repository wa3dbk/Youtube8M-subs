00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.639
 today Californian route I'm going to know 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.919
 one of the most important symbols of 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.790
 baja california el cerro prieto te 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.790
 I invite you to meet him 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.570
 The Cerro Prieto has a height of 260 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.129
 meters above sea level and can 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.890
 observed from any point of the 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.379
 Mexican valley this hill is actually 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.629
 a volcano hence its dark color where 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.920
 Take the name is considered as a volcano 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.519
 passive 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.830
 some sources from the usa report that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.100
 the boiler or magma body of the hill 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.009
 Prieto is about five or six 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.409
 kilometers below the surface 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.259
 the volcano's dome is estimated to be 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.010
 formed approximately according to evidence 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.110
 paleo magnetic 100,000 years ago 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.390
 this area is well known for 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.130
 first settlers the Cucapá who 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.570
 they have stories and legends that have 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.630
 transmitted from generation to generation 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.030
 to the present day 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.119
 the legends of the Cucapáh Indians 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.060
 describe the volcano as a monster that 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.640
 cover the earth with hot stones 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.820
 that grew through the ground and emitted 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.159
 tongues of fire a possible reference 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.140
 to its growth 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.880
 the valley of Mexicalli is in 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.310
 an area crossed by the fault of san 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.289
 André so it becomes one of 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.210
 the most seismically active areas in 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.340
 Mexico as well as outcrops 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.750
 thermals in it is one of the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.530
 thermoelectric plants more 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.810
 important of mexico 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:16.650
 this plant started its construction in 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.620
 1958 and was put into service in 1973 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.560
 the steam is extracted from the hot subsoil 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.170
 it is purified and sent through a 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.709
 pipe system until it throws 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.079
 through turbines this energy that is 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.840
 transformed into electricity is 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.569
 used in baja california and when 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.640
 there is surplus usually in autumn and 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.740
 Winter is exported to the USA 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.840
 As you can see, it has become a whole 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.030
 tradition climb the hill and write 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.900
 names or messages with rocks in the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.900
 crater of the volcano 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.610
 These towers are microwave antennas 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.569
 various services 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.150
 private and public telecommunication without 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.730
 no doubt the attractiveness is stolen 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.160
 natural to the place but have collaborated with 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.030
 the development of telecommunications 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.030
 from our region 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.160
 during the summer months it is 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.040
 important to take precautions when visiting 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.340
 this place wear clothes and shoes 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.720
 appropriate for this wild terrain 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.260
 wear a hat or cap to protect 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.099
 of the sun 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.739
 this route is very narrow and it should be 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.829
 be careful to avoid a 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.840
 fall or kinks our state has 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.519
 many natural wonders but the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.500
 Cerro Prieto has contributed enormously 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.690
 for the development of our region 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.110
 follow the Californian route until the 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.110
 next
