00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.020
 I would like you to be careful not to use the prefectural office, but I've said it many times, but I think so 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.720
 Masu Sae Painting 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.140
 This theme last time I for all of you I want to be Maggie even if it is good for me 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.480
 Is 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 What 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.220
 What was your story of that is the presence or and Tsu guitar for me for everyone 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.640
 I also talked about what kind of existence it is 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:53.519
 Well there is also a feeling that the extension is 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.050
 Story that I mean we should have How so the Tteyuu compatibility for Once done 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.470
 I would like to do 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.700
 Well this is just me 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.900
 Of course it because the concept of 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:06.190
 Though I do not think that it can be said that it is correct 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.720
 How I always do to the guitar 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.650
 Do you show aiff 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.290
 Speaking of 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:16.880
 After all, it is to kill ぇ 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.310
 I said this last time, but I also love you to play guitar if you love it 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.009
 It will come 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:28.090
 People are their own, for example, in the management of buying a guitar that you have acquired hard 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:33.970
 There is a pattern , and even if it is various thoughts , it will be attached 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.920
 I'm trying hard for myself, save money , save money , and say that I 'm thinking about the guitar I bought 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.300
 There is a strong thing to really of 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.330
 Put in the hands of Tteyuu guitar in various memories 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.180
 I'm going to take 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:50.460
 It is I I I thought for a guitar that got 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.650
 I can't do that kind of kind of thing. 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.460
 I don't know but that's not the case 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.520
 For example, though especially that often draw listened to this something I 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.000
 Is not closed is Yappa gently to and Acoustic Tsu guitar 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.850
 I'm not good I don't call it 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.110
 That's why it 's different from your own hand with a scratch on the guitar 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.310
 Anyway cats 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.440
 One Do I have to care 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.330
 One is how to touch the guitar and how to pour that crampon 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.720
 It though made not such I 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:27.560
 Also in the Well of course energy that acoustic guitar Well especially get to Posutekku 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:32.239
 Of course I think that it can be said that it is classic, but after all net return more return 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.300
 If there is something to come, some things will come back gently . 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.190
 That kind of sharp 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.760
 I'm listening to the guitar 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:44.440
 That's why I think it's because I feel that I'm feeling clean and empty 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.680
 After all it is is it to come back to the side version if Komere feelings so is the best part of the guitar 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:53.440
 If you think about it, I can not afford to know the book 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:56.180
 Also there is a reason here but its intensity-free back not pulled violently as Persson 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.700
 Nishi- There are also cases, though 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.510
 Well the movie I new grade always with the increase you are using the 5-year part but this of I 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.719
 Though 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.680
 I Well this I'd think a little Hey ugly 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:11.470
 Please look around the sound hole. 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.110
 Articles are out 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:21.370
 5 I 'll scratch it about already It doesn't matter if the paint on the guitar is cut off already 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.500
 I say I'm sorry for the guitar it is and this about not still do it in real 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.310
 I'm thinking about my feelings 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:31.490
 It seems that this is already too hurt, though 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:36.890
 We have already struggled by playing a musical instrument at the pick 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:40.190
 The Fu of whether is not not it important those things that beat play up to about tomorrow 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:44.540
 And it is doing this thing called not You're As a result I think 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:50.290
 Well it comes out in the middle of peeling of the paint, but there is a spring though there is a ruth 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.290
 Even though Kedomo I'm cool I think that enters into it those who say that this hate 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.830
 I will wear it so that the paint around the sundoll can be scraped off 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.810
 It is the word 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.220
 I am good 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.970
 I think that is not the reason it is 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.560
 With this feeling that I just like the guitar against this kind of ー ー ー ー 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.580
 Including what 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.920
 I still want to go about this but I think by the way how to show the table 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.530
 In my previous videos I though I'm open another 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.180
 With a guitar 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:30.320
 I wo n't change one expression, but it's alive 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.390
 Because we are told that'll'm alive springs through the sound I've talked to say 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.660
 I hope you see something intense 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:41.460
 But it is not to Newton's and burn 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.240
 I'm going to Yoshiyama Tani-gun I will return the guitar as a sound opposite to what I have fused 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:49.410
 I from 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:56.069
 That's why I thought Nyoro likely there is to say and do another I that one with anger 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:05:02.230
 I think Fu say, however it is the translation to Ati trying to, of course, for example, playing sounds that amount 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:07.600
 However, if you wipe it off with a 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:10.720
 After all, after a live show , the guitar is an extreme story 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.990
 I guess that the Well or dirty like crazy some of the tired 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:18.310
 I think I'm also out I loose the strings after I finished playing 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:22.220
 I will try to wipe it this way again I am always trying hard 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:26.090
 But I'm angry, this is it, this is it, this is it so intensely 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.810
 I 'm going to sit down after listening, so I'll do regular 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:34.010
 Well I guess it would also be How do you think Come on everyone that it is one of affection 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.650
 Of course, if you can say that I can do all that mountain path in my opinion, of course, there must be 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.890
 I'll pull of feelings gently that I think 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.240
 I think some people say that they are not the best love for the guitar 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:46.020
 Various insects and also to have any 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:50.789
 Maybe there is no body if it Some people say or not it love's for guitar 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:53.669
 Well , I was such a person even after 10 years, but I think there are various ways of thinking 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.849
 Do you good in the idea say so it is is I 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.220
 Check the second floor politely polite 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.950
 If luck will be given 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.040
 Is not this it is we do expect'm minimum of affection against 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:08.560
 I wonder how the chair has been doing 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.520
 Doing the talk centered we continued to Well the last time that the I think Fu that 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.990
 Even though it has 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.480
 This time it was a little difficult problem that we had many people on such a theme 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.440
 But I wonder if you were chased like you 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.000
 How to let the first moderated by say 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.000
 All at once
