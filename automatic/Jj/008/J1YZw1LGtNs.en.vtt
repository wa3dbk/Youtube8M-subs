your cities skylines playing experience
there<00:00:05.640> are<00:00:05.670> three<00:00:06.089> types<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.569> industries<00:00:07.080> owns

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
there are three types of industries owns

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.379 
there are three types of industries owns
two<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.069> them<00:00:08.220> being<00:00:08.400> yellow<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.120> third

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
two of them being yellow and the third

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.930 
two of them being yellow and the third
being<00:00:09.690> offices<00:00:10.320> I'll<00:00:10.530> focus<00:00:11.160> on<00:00:11.460> offices

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
being offices I'll focus on offices

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.629 
being offices I'll focus on offices
later<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:13.139> first<00:00:13.380> type<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.650> yellow<00:00:14.009> industry

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
later the first type of yellow industry

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.180 
later the first type of yellow industry
is<00:00:14.849> raw<00:00:15.240> material<00:00:15.870> harvesters<00:00:16.470> these

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
is raw material harvesters these

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.400 
is raw material harvesters these
industries<00:00:17.850> use<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.390> natural<00:00:18.630> resources

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
industries use the natural resources

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.710 
industries use the natural resources
that<00:00:20.039> are<00:00:20.130> provided<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> map<00:00:20.939> which<00:00:21.539> are

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
that are provided on the map which are

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.420 
that are provided on the map which are
oil<00:00:22.020> or<00:00:23.000> forestry<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.240> farming<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.920> second

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
oil or forestry and farming the second

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.759 
oil or forestry and farming the second
type<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.609> yellow<00:00:27.000> industry<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.779> manufacturing

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
type of yellow industry is manufacturing

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.040 
type of yellow industry is manufacturing
taking<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> raw<00:00:29.849> materials<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.630> turning

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
taking the raw materials and turning

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.900 
taking the raw materials and turning
them<00:00:31.170> into<00:00:31.289> products<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:32.009> delivery<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.610> sale

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
them into products for delivery to sale

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.229 
them into products for delivery to sale
more<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.750> later<00:00:33.930> too<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:35.090> simple<00:00:36.090> example

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
more on that later too a simple example

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.660 
more on that later too a simple example
is<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.899> think<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.200> building<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.710> chair<00:00:37.980> first

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
is to think of building a chair first

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
is to think of building a chair first
you<00:00:39.210> harvest<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> raw<00:00:39.840> logs<00:00:40.200> from<00:00:40.590> your

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you harvest the raw logs from your

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.490 
you harvest the raw logs from your
forest<00:00:41.100> industry<00:00:41.640> turning<00:00:42.390> those<00:00:42.510> logs<00:00:42.870> into

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
forest industry turning those logs into

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.709 
forest industry turning those logs into
wood<00:00:43.710> planks<00:00:44.160> then<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.030> take<00:00:45.270> those<00:00:45.480> wood

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
wood planks then you take those wood

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.049 
wood planks then you take those wood
flanks<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.320> your<00:00:46.710> manufacturing<00:00:47.489> industries

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
flanks to your manufacturing industries

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.510 
flanks to your manufacturing industries
and<00:00:48.300> turn<00:00:49.200> them<00:00:49.379> into<00:00:49.500> chairs<00:00:49.950> or<00:00:50.250> other

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
and turn them into chairs or other

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.720 
and turn them into chairs or other
furniture<00:00:51.140> if<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.289> don't<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.680> raw<00:00:53.100> material

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
furniture if you don't have raw material

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.119 
furniture if you don't have raw material
industries<00:00:54.239> that's<00:00:54.840> okay<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.770> regular

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
industries that's okay your regular

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
industries that's okay your regular
manufacturing<00:00:56.910> industries<00:00:57.420> will<00:00:57.930> import<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
manufacturing industries will import the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.619 
manufacturing industries will import the
raw<00:00:58.800> materials<00:00:59.340> instead<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.480> will

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
raw materials instead but this will

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.599 
raw materials instead but this will
cause<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> bit<00:01:01.140> more<00:01:01.289> traffic<00:01:01.559> more<00:01:02.399> on

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
cause a bit more traffic more on

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.939 
cause a bit more traffic more on
importing<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.300> exporting<00:01:03.359> later<00:01:04.049> keep<00:01:04.799> in

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
importing and exporting later keep in

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.969 
importing and exporting later keep in
mind<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.850> oil<00:01:06.180> and/or<00:01:06.540> resources<00:01:07.260> are<00:01:07.680> not

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
industry zones but keep in mind they

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.170 
industry zones but keep in mind they
need<00:01:18.659> an<00:01:18.780> easy<00:01:18.990> way<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> their<00:01:19.830> jobs
