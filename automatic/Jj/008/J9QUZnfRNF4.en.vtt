foamboard is widely used in the design
industry<00:00:08.099> as<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.030> source<00:00:09.630> really<00:00:09.870> for

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
industry as a source really for

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.299 
industry as a source really for
presentation<00:00:10.830> for<00:00:11.550> model<00:00:12.150> making<00:00:12.599> and

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
presentation for model making and

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.799 
presentation for model making and
various<00:00:14.309> different<00:00:14.580> uses<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.450> actually

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
various different uses it's actually

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.550 
various different uses it's actually
made<00:00:16.049> up<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.949> sandwich<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.730> paper<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.750> very

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
made up of a sandwich of paper and very

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.759 
made up of a sandwich of paper and very
thin<00:00:19.830> foam<00:00:20.220> inside<00:00:21.210> there<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.500> like<00:00:22.560> an

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
thin foam inside there so it's like an

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.529 
thin foam inside there so it's like an
extruded<00:00:23.220> foam<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.789> then<00:00:24.000> paper<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.420> each

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
extruded foam and then paper on each

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.679 
extruded foam and then paper on each
side<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.590> very<00:00:25.619> very<00:00:26.099> lightweight<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.849> very

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
side it's very very lightweight and very

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.050 
side it's very very lightweight and very
very<00:00:27.930> rigid<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:29.340> comes<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.820> three

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
very rigid and it comes in three

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.720 
very rigid and it comes in three
thicknesses<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.439> see<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:32.099> we've

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
thicknesses as you can see here we've

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.900 
thicknesses as you can see here we've
got<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.969> three<00:00:33.390> mil<00:00:33.899> thickness<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:35.309> five<00:00:35.610> mil

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
got the three mil thickness the five mil

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.959 
got the three mil thickness the five mil
thickness<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.570> then<00:00:37.469> finally<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.250> ten<00:00:38.730> mil

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
thickness and then finally the ten mil

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.540 
thickness and then finally the ten mil
thickness<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.980> does<00:00:41.160> come<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
thickness like so it does come in a

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.280 
thickness like so it does come in a
variety<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:42.000> different<00:00:42.360> colors<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.840> we've<00:00:43.170> got

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
variety of different colors so we've got

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.080 
variety of different colors so we've got
black<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.770> black<00:00:43.890> grey<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.399> I'll<00:00:44.520> tell<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
black and black grey but I'll tell you

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.490 
black and black grey but I'll tell you
about<00:00:45.180> those<00:00:45.480> later<00:00:46.940> now<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.239> far<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.750> foam

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
about those later now as far as the foam

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.979 
about those later now as far as the foam
was<00:00:49.649> concerned<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.940> quite<00:00:51.480> important<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
was concerned it is quite important that

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.350 
was concerned it is quite important that
when<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.379> cutting<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:54.030> cuts<00:00:54.239> it

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
when you are cutting this you cuts it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.020 
when you are cutting this you cuts it

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.020 
got a piece here and I'll show you what
happens<00:00:59.010> when<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.430> don't<00:00:59.579> cut<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.910> with<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
happens when you don't cut it with a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.930 
happens when you don't cut it with a
sharp<00:01:00.300> blade<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.469> rip<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.609> foam

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
sharp blade and it can rip to the foam

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.840 
sharp blade and it can rip to the foam

in<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.399> edge<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:56.259> can<00:01:56.409> cut<00:01:56.680> with<00:01:56.710> either

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
in the edge and you can cut with either

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.690 
in the edge and you can cut with either
say<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.490> stanley<00:01:57.909> type<00:01:58.119> blade<00:01:58.450> like<00:01:58.690> so<00:01:58.750> or<00:01:59.700> most

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
say a stanley type blade like so or most

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.719 
say a stanley type blade like so or most
people<00:02:01.030> use<00:02:01.420> these<00:02:01.630> for<00:02:01.690> morton<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:03.130> 3/8

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
people use these for morton and the 3/8

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.779 
people use these for morton and the 3/8
blades<00:02:04.149> at<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:05.140> ten<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.500> blade<00:02:05.770> sorry<00:02:06.039> 3/8<00:02:06.430> handle

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
blades at a ten a blade sorry 3/8 handle

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.440 
blades at a ten a blade sorry 3/8 handle
its<00:02:07.509> most<00:02:07.750> appropriate<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:08.500> just<00:02:09.489> got<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.850> 3/8

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
its most appropriate I just got a a 3/8

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.660 
its most appropriate I just got a a 3/8
blade<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:10.959> one<00:02:11.140> here<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.459> cut

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
blade and this one here and and the cut

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.400 
blade and this one here and and the cut
is<00:02:12.790> very<00:02:12.819> straightforward<00:02:13.239> obviously<00:02:13.870> keep

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
is very straightforward obviously keep

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.080 
is very straightforward obviously keep
your<00:02:14.560> fingers<00:02:14.890> nicely<00:02:15.370> out<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.640> way<00:02:15.790> and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
your fingers nicely out of the way and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.259 
your fingers nicely out of the way and
just<00:02:17.080> simply<00:02:18.010> like<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.090> follow<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.630> ruler

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
just simply like that follow a ruler

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.390 
just simply like that follow a ruler
like<00:02:22.269> so<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:23.440> this<00:02:23.620> actually<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> ten

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
like so and this actually is the ten

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.870 
like so and this actually is the ten
mill<00:02:24.640> phone<00:02:25.060> board<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:25.870> quite<00:02:26.080> thick<00:02:26.560> so

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
mill phone board so it's quite thick so

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.900 
mill phone board so it's quite thick so
you'll<00:02:27.880> need<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> couple<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.540> cuts<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:30.670> so

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
you'll need a couple of cuts like so

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.539 
you'll need a couple of cuts like so
maybe<00:02:31.239> even<00:02:31.269> three<00:02:31.660> just<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.930> make<00:02:32.110> sure<00:02:32.549> and

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
maybe even three just to make sure and

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.300 
maybe even three just to make sure and
there<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:34.510> go<00:02:34.690> there<00:02:35.380> we<00:02:35.410> have<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.620> nice<00:02:35.830> clean

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
there we go there we have a nice clean

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.729 
there we go there we have a nice clean
cut<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.670> phone<00:02:36.880> now<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.840> as<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.290> 10<00:02:38.560> mil

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
cut to the phone now this as a 10 mil

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.520 
cut to the phone now this as a 10 mil
can<00:02:38.890> be<00:02:39.010> used<00:02:39.250> for<00:02:39.489> modeling<00:02:39.910> also<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.750> you

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
can be used for modeling also and you

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.680 
can be used for modeling also and you
can<00:02:41.650> obviously<00:02:41.890> but<00:02:42.220> these<00:02:42.610> edges<00:02:42.970> up<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.390> so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
can obviously but these edges up like so

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.140 
can obviously but these edges up like so
and<00:02:43.959> produce<00:02:44.620> all<00:02:44.829> sorts<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:45.280> sculptures<00:02:45.940> for

obviously it is quite delicate and the
last<00:03:00.790> thing<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:00.940> will<00:03:01.090> do<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.269> use<00:03:01.570> something

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
last thing you will do is use something

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.860 
last thing you will do is use something
like<00:03:02.049> superglue<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.950> will<00:03:03.040> just<00:03:03.190> melt<00:03:03.430> through

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
like superglue it will just melt through

like superglue it will just melt through
what<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.900> good<00:03:05.109> tip<00:03:05.350> for<00:03:05.380> doing<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.400> glue<00:03:06.640> and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
what a good tip for doing is to glue and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.099 
what a good tip for doing is to glue and
just<00:03:07.150> put<00:03:07.329> a<00:03:07.359> pin<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:09.150> simple<00:03:10.150> then<00:03:10.690> just

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
just put a pin like a simple then just

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.360 
just put a pin like a simple then just
straight<00:03:11.200> through<00:03:11.290> that<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.950> will<00:03:12.070> hold<00:03:12.220> it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
straight through that that will hold it

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.160 
straight through that that will hold it
in<00:03:12.430> place<00:03:12.489> while<00:03:12.880> it's<00:03:13.090> gonna<00:03:13.209> be<00:03:13.390> here<00:03:13.570> and

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
in place while it's gonna be here and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.410 
in place while it's gonna be here and
once<00:03:14.410> it's<00:03:14.590> dry<00:03:14.709> it's<00:03:15.100> very<00:03:15.310> rigid<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:15.880> it

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
once it's dry it's very rigid and it

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.990 
once it's dry it's very rigid and it
does<00:03:16.570> dry<00:03:16.870> really<00:03:17.200> quickly<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:18.040> it's<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.400> great

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
does dry really quickly so it's a great

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.860 
does dry really quickly so it's a great
product<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.329> use<00:03:20.700> most<00:03:21.700> foam<00:03:21.940> board<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.570> called

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
product to use most foam board is called

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.479 
product to use most foam board is called
it<00:03:22.989> has<00:03:23.109> a<00:03:23.140> memory<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:23.799> if<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.010> do<00:03:24.160> actually

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
it has a memory so if you do actually

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.479 
it has a memory so if you do actually
make<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.150> dent<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.040> memory<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:27.430> it

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
make a dent in it it's a memory so it

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.039 
make a dent in it it's a memory so it
will<00:03:27.579> keep<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:28.090> dent<00:03:28.359> you<00:03:28.570> probably<00:03:28.870> see

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
will keep that dent you probably see

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.050 
will keep that dent you probably see
there<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.530> obviously<00:03:30.160> very<00:03:30.340> careful<00:03:30.819> when<00:03:30.940> you

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
there so obviously very careful when you

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.539 
there so obviously very careful when you
are<00:03:31.090> using<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.690> not<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.230> bash<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.950> the

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
are using it not to bash it and the

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.430 
are using it not to bash it and the
ground<00:03:33.790> if<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:33.940> want<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.150> nicely<00:03:34.359> and<00:03:34.810> and

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
ground if you want it nicely and and

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.660 
ground if you want it nicely and and
smooth<00:03:36.150> as<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.209> said<00:03:37.450> earlier<00:03:37.980> most<00:03:38.980> times<00:03:39.430> foam

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
smooth as I said earlier most times foam

boards<00:03:39.940> use<00:03:40.060> for<00:03:40.239> presentations<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.200> you're

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
boards use for presentations so you're

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.800 
boards use for presentations so you're
generally<00:03:42.340> following<00:03:42.699> something<00:03:43.380> onto

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
generally following something onto

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.320 
generally following something onto
a<00:03:44.870> piece<00:03:45.709> like<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.670> use<00:03:46.849> it<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:47.180> actually

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
a piece like that to use it to actually

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.320 
a piece like that to use it to actually
do<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.870> presentation<00:03:48.500> together<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:49.520> most<00:03:50.120> cases

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
do a presentation together so most cases
