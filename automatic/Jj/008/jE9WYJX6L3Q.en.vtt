00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
special just a camera and Hisense 9 ok

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.460 
special just a camera and Hisense 9 ok
so<00:02:59.800> let's<00:03:00.310> turn<00:03:00.580> this<00:03:00.760> thing<00:03:00.820> on<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:05.230> it's<00:03:05.380> a

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
so let's turn this thing on so it's a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.290 
so let's turn this thing on so it's a
smart<00:03:05.800> high<00:03:06.070> sense<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:08.790> know<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.970> can't<00:03:10.210> wait

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
smart high sense I know you can't wait

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.910
