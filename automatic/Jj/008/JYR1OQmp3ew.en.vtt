00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello friends with you Alexey my 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.540
 Assistant Vanya and you are watching the transfer 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.519
 check and 72 myths can be burned 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.410
 fire without the aid of matches the first myth 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.929
 is that when mixing 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.150
 potassium permanganate and glycerin fire is formed 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.130
 Well, the second myth on the axis you know it 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.520
 battery fire nastya battery and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 gum foil let's go or truth 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.570
 poison for first experience us 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.150
 will need potassium permanganate glycerin 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.120
 some teaspoon teaspoon and 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.710
 a few sheets of A4 paper manganese and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.230
 glycerin can be bought at a regular pharmacy 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.980
 it should first of all open cheaply 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.250
 potassium permanganate and pour it on a sheet that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.250
 small 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.120
 very little 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.239
 I think it will be enough how many 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.800
 It stayed there remains little time 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.610
 about half the same 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.940
 tube of potassium permanganate take a teaspoon and 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.690
 we will pour glycerin 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.600
 such a pipette will now be difficult with this 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:18.210
 problems are 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.210
 mainly myself up to try this 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.100
 I think the residual, yes, I quietly 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.100
 somehow a bit 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.570
 it just starts and every moment 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.070
 may flash reads 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:42.080
 rotten 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:46.850
 a little something you can wait no Pol'na 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.220
 agree and it will not catch fire 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.680
 offensively of course the first time the experience failed 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.140
 I will try to take less spirra glycerin 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:00.440
 for the experience we did not work as a sheet 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:06.080
 wet through this construction 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:10.420
 I'll try to make also take 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.420
 this time we pour out all the potassium permanganate 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.830
 well here's our potassium permanganate and let me 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.830
 here is just a bit of a cop 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.680
 Well, now we are waiting for the experience of us 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.680
 succeeded 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.430
 as you can see we managed to get the fire 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.650
 so that the myth is true Chervinsky times not 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.489
 It turned out because we soaked our 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:59.599
 leaf but now it burns well so the glands do not 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.939
 set fire glycerin but parts 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.430
 extinguished using snow this experience turned out to be 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:07.459
 true of course who knows chemistry knowing that 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.120
 potassium permanganate has very good windows 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.980
 properties 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.750
 if you go trekking and afraid of this dream 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.970
 match moss take in tubes 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.549
 glycerin and manganese you calm 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:23.780
 kindle a fire well what to do second 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:26.799
 our experience it's time to test 2 mikvah 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.709
 for this we need a battery and 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:34.819
 foil on the back of which paper 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:38.620
 This foil is found in chewing 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.620
 let's check these records 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.430
 well what will the fire in the kitchen be 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.540
 very small and you will not see clearly 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.500
 nominal setup 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:04.410
 Well, what is not Christ's cheating blood 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.480
 I will take the dima gum plate there side 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.270
 and on the finger I have this foil 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.790
 1 and a shack 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.760
 so here we take our foil 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:21.200
 scissors and such a wand visa sometimes 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.200
 making the main mistake 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.970
 so knit this strip fold it in 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.229
 this folded and 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.229
 and cut off the tip 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.500
 then the construction is left 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.440
 take the battery and connect 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.000
 vampire than that side what is the fact that 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.000
 the paper was outside of our country 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.180
 now all three days on one side 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.180
 to 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.449
 spiro that we did not work but it does not matter 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:14.889
 let's try it now I decided 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:14.889
 try to make this talk be 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.680
 our regret is what vocations 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.360
 good either or now that's not yet 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.910
 let's do the same process 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.690
 let's foil can give to give 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.690
 look a little music 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.979
 well, our experiences have come to the end 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.470
 comments to experience me the most 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.650
 I liked the first experience since it was 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.419
 easier for you to show it was more 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.520
 effective 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.690
 with the second experience we have been steaming for a very long time 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.479
 we could not 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.400
 well we could just hold both sides 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:27.849
 the foil of the battery is how strong it is 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.150
 heated all the same at the end you like 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:33.190
 it turned out well well come on 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.160
 Frames exactly everything turned out so well 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.380
 so all myths are true opportunity 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.479
 make fire of potassium permanganate and glycerin and 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.330
 it is possible to make fire from a battery and 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:45.880
 foil so it's the first pass anymore he 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.910
 was more beautiful so more chemically 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.830
 weave chemistry role duplicate problems with 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.560
 second myth because the foil was 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.690
 another foil had to be blue 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.320
 so silvery but in the elbow 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:01.780
 everything can be seen everything turned out it is clearly every 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.759
 angry first experience and who is very beautiful 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.919
 and very cool if you are going to 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:08.229
 hike take glycerin for potassium permanganate 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:10.300
 the spirit your matches get wet and with 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.080
 this experience you can always grow 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.460
 bones 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.380
 put your thumbs up 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.000
 subscribe to the channel with you was vanya 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.400
 also fall asleep our group vkontakte 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.680
 reference in the description there are new requests 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.780
 that we will shoot in the near future 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.169
 leave your comments with you was 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.169
 Alexey 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.979
 sign up and put huskies
