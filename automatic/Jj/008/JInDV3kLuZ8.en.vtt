high high effluence angle of attack and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.620 
high high effluence angle of attack and
just<00:02:28.980> drive<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.610> around<00:02:29.640> with<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.060> thrust<00:02:30.390> and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
just drive it around with the thrust and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.030 
just drive it around with the thrust and
it<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.230> looks<00:02:31.380> really<00:02:31.440> cool<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.010> really
