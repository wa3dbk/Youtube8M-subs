hi Kevin graph with Trainor tree going

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.130 
hi Kevin graph with Trainor tree going
to<00:00:03.780> show<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.740> set<00:00:04.799> up<00:00:05.190> my<00:00:05.779> citrus<00:00:06.779> trees

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
example this particular one is a kaffir

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.990 
example this particular one is a kaffir
lime<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.389> kaffir<00:00:16.230> I'm<00:00:17.190> going<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.490> keep<00:00:17.760> this

lime and kaffir I'm going to keep this

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.320 
lime and kaffir I'm going to keep this
tree<00:00:18.390> very<00:00:18.930> very<00:00:19.350> small<00:00:19.910> because<00:00:20.910> what<00:00:21.300> I

really<00:00:21.720> want<00:00:21.930> from<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.289> tree<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.490> leaves

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
really want from this tree is the leaves

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.029 
really want from this tree is the leaves
you<00:00:24.090> use<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.840> cooking<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.830> make

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.660 
you use it in cooking I like to make
different<00:00:27.050> typhoons<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.619> such<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.460> love

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
of food so I'm going to keep this tree

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.740 
of food so I'm going to keep this tree
very<00:00:35.820> very<00:00:36.059> small<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.469> want<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.100> be

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
very very small but I want it to be

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.020 
very very small but I want it to be
spread<00:00:39.750> out<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.170> maintained<00:00:40.770> very<00:00:41.040> well<00:00:41.370> so

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
spread out and maintained very well so

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.819 
spread out and maintained very well so
with<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.899> particular<00:00:43.110> tree<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.770> doesn't

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
with this particular tree it doesn't

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.910 
with this particular tree it doesn't
need<00:00:44.250> much<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.789> bought<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.420> tree<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> mark

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
need much I bought this tree on a mark

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.850 
need much I bought this tree on a mark
down<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.700> small<00:00:48.090> pot<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.870> five<00:00:49.110> dollars<00:00:49.379> I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
down in a small pot for five dollars I

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.250 
down in a small pot for five dollars I
brought<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> home<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.300> put<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.629> into<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.899> little

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
brought it home I put it into a little

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.610 
brought it home I put it into a little
larger<00:00:52.710> pot<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:55.020> made<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> couple

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
larger pot and and I made a couple

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.040 
larger pot and and I made a couple
little<00:00:55.920> cuts<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> could<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
little cuts on it so that I could get a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.470 
little cuts on it so that I could get a
little<00:00:58.289> bit<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.620> growth<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.579> now<00:01:00.300> it's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
little bit of growth out of it now it's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.479 
little bit of growth out of it now it's
not<00:01:00.570> really<00:01:01.050> fair<00:01:01.289> completely<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.100> some<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
not really fair completely with some of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.860 
not really fair completely with some of
the<00:01:02.579> stuff<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.969> show<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.690> I've

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the stuff that I show you because I've

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.450 
the stuff that I show you because I've
already<00:01:04.229> had<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.739> many<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.100> these<00:01:05.189> things

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
already had so many of these things

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
already had so many of these things
utilizing<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> system<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.350> you'll<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
utilizing the system but you'll get the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.429 
utilizing the system but you'll get the
gist<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.229> particular

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
gist of it here so like this particular

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.750 
gist of it here so like this particular
tree<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:12.140> really<00:01:13.140> don't<00:01:13.439> need<00:01:13.650> much<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.369> this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
tree I really don't need much in this

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.760 
tree I really don't need much in this
other<00:01:15.240> than<00:01:16.100> one<00:01:17.240> spreader<00:01:18.290> because<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.500> want

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
other than one spreader because I want

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.789 
other than one spreader because I want
this<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.360> middle<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.680> I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this one here to be the middle and I

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.300 
this one here to be the middle and I
want<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:25.110> come<00:01:25.409> down<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
want this one here to come down just a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.359 
want this one here to come down just a
little<00:01:26.340> bit<00:01:26.670> more<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.470> all<00:01:28.950> I'm<00:01:29.220> going

I've<00:01:32.400> already<00:01:32.939> had<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.990> blocks<00:01:34.380> hanging<00:01:35.009> in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
I've already had the blocks hanging in

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.060 
I've already had the blocks hanging in
here<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.670> pulling<00:01:36.390> these<00:01:36.540> things<00:01:36.600> down<00:01:37.259> so

like to be able to get into the center
this<00:01:46.079> particular<00:01:46.530> tree<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> dwarf

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
this particular tree this is a dwarf

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.920 
this particular tree this is a dwarf
golden<00:01:48.509> nugget<00:01:49.189> now<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.490> bought<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.329> tree<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
golden nugget now I bought this tree a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.139 
golden nugget now I bought this tree a
couple<00:01:52.350> years<00:01:52.560> ago<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.310> struggled

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
couple years ago and it really struggled

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.870 
couple years ago and it really struggled
it<00:01:54.240> did<00:01:54.390> not<00:01:54.570> do<00:01:54.840> well<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.470> ground<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
it did not do well in the ground so I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.300 
it did not do well in the ground so I
pulled<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.329> out<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.780> ground<00:01:58.079> bought<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> new

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
pulled it out of the ground bought a new

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
I would do here is hollow out the inside

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.490 
I would do here is hollow out the inside
a<00:02:38.630> little<00:02:38.840> bit<00:02:39.020> because<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.610> have<00:02:41.110> more<00:02:42.110> food

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
a little bit because you have more food

a little bit because you have more food
growing<00:02:42.980> inside<00:02:43.700> like<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:44.300> one<00:02:44.540> in<00:02:44.690> here<00:02:44.959> I

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
growing inside like this one in here I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.090 
growing inside like this one in here I
don't<00:02:45.800> want<00:02:46.100> more<00:02:47.050> inside<00:02:48.080> I<00:02:48.320> want<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.650> force

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
don't want more inside I want to force

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.949 
don't want more inside I want to force
it<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:50.570> outside<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.940> anything<00:02:53.840> that's

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.009 
it to the outside so anything that's
growing<00:02:54.319> sideways<00:02:55.600> pushing<00:02:56.600> different

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
growing sideways pushing different

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.210 
growing sideways pushing different
directions<00:02:57.680> I'm<00:02:58.550> going<00:02:58.819> to<00:02:58.880> take<00:02:59.120> out<00:02:59.950> I<00:03:00.950> don't

directions I'm going to take out I don't
need<00:03:01.610> another<00:03:01.959> one<00:03:02.959> growing<00:03:03.290> up<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.830> center

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
need another one growing up the center

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.949 
need another one growing up the center
so<00:03:04.370> I'm<00:03:04.519> going<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.700> take<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.269> guy<00:03:05.540> there<00:03:05.780> out

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
can see this one here is trying to grow

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.470 
can see this one here is trying to grow
opposite<00:03:16.130> direction<00:03:16.489> there<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.180> I'm<00:03:17.269> going<00:03:17.390> to

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
opposite direction there so I'm going to

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.910 
opposite direction there so I'm going to
take<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.870> out<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:20.890> that's<00:03:21.890> about<00:03:22.549> it<00:03:23.920> here

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
take that out and that's about it here

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.090 
take that out and that's about it here
everything<00:03:25.549> else<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:26.440> growing<00:03:27.440> in<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.860> right

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
everything else is growing in the right

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.440 
everything else is growing in the right
direction<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:30.280> all's<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.640> would<00:03:31.820> do<00:03:32.000> with<00:03:32.239> this

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
direction so all's I would do with this

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.020 
direction so all's I would do with this
in<00:03:32.780> here<00:03:33.200> is<00:03:33.380> spread<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.340> out<00:03:34.489> just<00:03:34.820> a<00:03:35.000> little

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
in here is spread it out just a little

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.880 
in here is spread it out just a little
bit<00:03:35.660> more<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.760> like<00:03:37.970> this<00:03:38.299> one<00:03:38.540> here<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.109> would

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
bit more so like this one here I would

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.830 
bit more so like this one here I would
put<00:03:40.130> this<00:03:40.280> in<00:03:41.140> here

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.930 

and<00:03:46.360> push<00:03:47.360> this<00:03:47.930> out<00:03:48.170> opening<00:03:49.160> up<00:03:49.310> this<00:03:49.489> Center

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
and push this out opening up this Center

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.750 
and push this out opening up this Center
just<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.360> little<00:03:50.870> bit<00:03:51.050> more<00:03:51.349> I<00:03:52.450> would<00:03:53.450> take<00:03:53.690> I

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
just a little bit more I would take I

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.180 
just a little bit more I would take I
would<00:03:55.760> take<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.120> couple<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.720> these<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:58.040> would

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
would take a couple of these and I would

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.660 
would take a couple of these and I would
pull<00:03:58.459> them<00:03:58.670> out<00:03:58.849> just<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.720> little<00:03:59.750> bit<00:04:00.080> more

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
done in here you can set this tree up to

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.070 
done in here you can set this tree up to
be<00:04:10.970> very<00:04:11.269> successful

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
be very successful

be very successful
here's<00:04:12.290> another<00:04:12.410> that's<00:04:12.830> growing<00:04:13.069> on<00:04:13.250> just<00:04:13.489> a

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
here's another that's growing on just a

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.150 
here's another that's growing on just a
little<00:04:13.880> bit<00:04:13.970> too<00:04:14.180> straight<00:04:14.569> I<00:04:14.900> want<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.040> to

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
little bit too straight I want it to

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.050 
little bit too straight I want it to
come<00:04:16.370> down<00:04:16.430> just<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.180> little<00:04:17.209> bit<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:22.060> these

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
come down just a little bit and these

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.969 
come down just a little bit and these
don't<00:04:23.389> take<00:04:23.600> long<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.870> harden<00:04:24.380> off<00:04:24.530> when<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:24.830> say

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
don't take long to harden off when I say

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.280 
don't take long to harden off when I say
hard<00:04:25.160> not<00:04:25.370> from<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.700> wood<00:04:25.910> to<00:04:26.090> go<00:04:26.240> from<00:04:26.570> from

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
hard not from the wood to go from from

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.640 
hard not from the wood to go from from
like<00:04:28.250> green<00:04:28.639> like<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:29.479> to<00:04:29.750> Brown<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.500> where

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
like green like this to Brown to where

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.210 
like green like this to Brown to where
it's<00:04:30.800> now<00:04:31.510> its<00:04:32.510> structure<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.410> that's<00:04:33.860> really

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
it's now its structure and that's really

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.500 
it's now its structure and that's really
what<00:04:34.490> we're<00:04:34.610> trying<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.940> accomplish<00:04:35.240> is

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
what we're trying to accomplish is

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.469 
what we're trying to accomplish is
getting<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.169> very<00:04:36.350> strong<00:04:36.820> structure<00:04:37.820> so<00:04:38.419> I

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
getting a very strong structure so I

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.090 
getting a very strong structure so I
want<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.660> open<00:04:38.990> up<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.200> center<00:04:39.440> have<00:04:39.860> it

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
want to open up the center have it

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.540 
want to open up the center have it
coming<00:04:40.430> out<00:04:40.639> more<00:04:41.479> like<00:04:41.660> that<00:04:42.130> so<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.250> Sun<00:04:43.520> can

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
coming out more like that so the Sun can

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.379 
coming out more like that so the Sun can
penetrate<00:04:44.090> all<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.840> our<00:04:45.139> fruit<00:04:45.410> will<00:04:45.620> ripen

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
penetrate all of our fruit will ripen

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.290 
penetrate all of our fruit will ripen
evenly<00:04:47.389> and<00:04:48.460> that's<00:04:49.460> all<00:04:49.610> I<00:04:49.640> would<00:04:49.789> do<00:04:50.060> with

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
evenly and that's all I would do with

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.790 
evenly and that's all I would do with
this<00:04:50.479> particular<00:04:50.720> tree<00:04:51.380> this<00:04:52.370> here<00:04:53.590> is<00:04:54.590> going

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
this particular tree this here is going

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.680 
this particular tree this here is going
to<00:04:54.860> live<00:04:55.070> most<00:04:55.280> of<00:04:55.430> its<00:04:55.610> life<00:04:55.789> in<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.210> pot<00:04:56.419> this

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
to live most of its life in a pot this

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.150 
to live most of its life in a pot this
happens<00:04:57.080> to<00:04:57.200> be<00:04:57.229> a<00:04:58.300> Mineola<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.800> this<00:05:00.800> also

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
happens to be a Mineola and this also

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.490 
happens to be a Mineola and this also
was<00:05:01.550> a<00:05:01.580> rescue<00:05:02.620> this<00:05:03.620> one<00:05:03.890> had<00:05:04.190> a<00:05:04.520> bunch<00:05:05.390> of<00:05:05.660> it

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
was a rescue this one had a bunch of it

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.960 
was a rescue this one had a bunch of it
didn't<00:05:06.770> have<00:05:06.860> very<00:05:06.979> many<00:05:07.160> leaves<00:05:07.460> on<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:07.850> at

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
didn't have very many leaves on it at

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:08.320 
didn't have very many leaves on it at
all

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
all

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.620 
all
and<00:05:08.419> it<00:05:08.900> already<00:05:09.229> had<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:10.070> benefit<00:05:10.550> of<00:05:10.580> of<00:05:11.479> the

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
and it already had the benefit of of the

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.080 
and it already had the benefit of of the
spreaders<00:05:14.630> in<00:05:15.320> pushing<00:05:15.889> out<00:05:16.330> its<00:05:17.330> main

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
spreaders in pushing out its main

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.440 
spreaders in pushing out its main
branches<00:05:20.090> so<00:05:20.389> that<00:05:20.600> that<00:05:21.229> there<00:05:21.880> is<00:05:22.880> really

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
branches so that that there is really

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.510 
branches so that that there is really
all<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:23.720> did<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:25.570> this<00:05:26.570> this<00:05:27.200> tree<00:05:27.470> and<00:05:27.860> then

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
all I did to this this tree and then

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.290 
all I did to this this tree and then
other<00:05:28.880> than<00:05:29.090> hanging<00:05:30.220> some<00:05:31.220> of<00:05:31.370> these<00:05:31.550> on<00:05:31.820> to

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
other than hanging some of these on to

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.290 
other than hanging some of these on to
pull<00:05:32.600> them<00:05:32.930> down<00:05:33.289> because<00:05:34.130> I<00:05:34.520> want<00:05:34.729> my<00:05:34.940> trees

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
pull them down because I want my trees

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.800 
pull them down because I want my trees
to<00:05:35.600> weep<00:05:36.280> more<00:05:37.280> than<00:05:37.910> I<00:05:37.940> want<00:05:38.270> them<00:05:38.419> reaching

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
to weep more than I want them reaching

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.560 
to weep more than I want them reaching
up<00:05:39.050> to<00:05:39.289> the<00:05:39.320> sky

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.570 

so<00:05:44.570> again<00:05:45.320> just<00:05:45.710> trying<00:05:45.889> to<00:05:46.009> open<00:05:46.340> up<00:05:46.430> that

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
so again just trying to open up that

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.180 
so again just trying to open up that
Center<00:05:46.940> a<00:05:46.970> little<00:05:47.270> bit<00:05:47.419> because<00:05:47.990> with<00:05:48.680> citrus

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
Center a little bit because with citrus

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.820 
Center a little bit because with citrus
it<00:05:49.639> can<00:05:49.970> get<00:05:50.150> so<00:05:50.479> tight<00:05:50.840> inside<00:05:51.410> here<00:05:51.710> you

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
it can get so tight inside here you

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.590 
it can get so tight inside here you
can't<00:05:52.160> reach<00:05:52.370> in<00:05:52.669> makes<00:05:53.120> it<00:05:53.240> very<00:05:53.330> difficult

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
can't reach in makes it very difficult

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.080 
can't reach in makes it very difficult
to<00:05:53.900> prune<00:05:54.259> and<00:05:54.560> that's<00:05:55.100> my<00:05:55.310> goal<00:05:55.550> is<00:05:55.729> to<00:05:55.880> keep

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
to prune and that's my goal is to keep

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.909 
to prune and that's my goal is to keep
all<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.449> fruit<00:05:56.720> on<00:05:56.840> the<00:05:56.960> outside<00:05:57.320> easy<00:05:57.680> to

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
all the fruit on the outside easy to

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.170 
all the fruit on the outside easy to
harvest<00:05:59.169> so<00:06:00.169> here<00:06:01.009> I<00:06:01.039> see<00:06:01.370> this<00:06:01.639> particular

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
harvest so here I see this particular

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.480 
harvest so here I see this particular
one<00:06:02.690> you<00:06:03.259> can't<00:06:03.560> see<00:06:03.740> it<00:06:03.830> from<00:06:03.919> over<00:06:04.039> there<00:06:04.310> but

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
one you can't see it from over there but

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.969 
one you can't see it from over there but
this<00:06:04.820> one<00:06:05.210> branch<00:06:05.570> is<00:06:05.810> wanting<00:06:06.320> to<00:06:06.350> grow<00:06:06.710> up

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
this one branch is wanting to grow up

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.879 
this one branch is wanting to grow up
this<00:06:07.610> way<00:06:07.880> so<00:06:08.539> I'm<00:06:08.690> going<00:06:08.870> to<00:06:08.900> assist<00:06:09.199> him<00:06:09.590> just

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
this way so I'm going to assist him just

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.409 
this way so I'm going to assist him just
a<00:06:10.009> little<00:06:10.039> bit<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:12.220> now<00:06:13.220> remember<00:06:13.789> these

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
a little bit and now remember these

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:21.490 
a little bit and now remember these
plants<00:06:17.259> will<00:06:19.750> they're<00:06:20.750> trying<00:06:21.050> to<00:06:21.080> grow<00:06:21.289> up

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
plants will they're trying to grow up

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.350 
plants will they're trying to grow up
and<00:06:21.949> so<00:06:22.130> you<00:06:22.190> put<00:06:22.550> a<00:06:22.580> little<00:06:22.729> weight<00:06:23.030> on<00:06:23.060> them

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
and so you put a little weight on them

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.730 
and so you put a little weight on them
you<00:06:23.449> don't<00:06:23.720> want<00:06:23.870> to<00:06:23.930> put<00:06:24.110> it<00:06:24.199> all<00:06:24.349> the<00:06:24.470> way<00:06:24.500> out

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
you don't want to put it all the way out

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.070 
you don't want to put it all the way out
on<00:06:24.949> the<00:06:24.979> end<00:06:25.330> because<00:06:26.330> if<00:06:26.449> you<00:06:26.539> put<00:06:26.780> it<00:06:26.870> out<00:06:27.020> on

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
on the end because if you put it out on

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.779 
on the end because if you put it out on
the<00:06:27.199> end<00:06:27.470> it's<00:06:27.710> just<00:06:27.949> going<00:06:28.099> to<00:06:28.160> pull<00:06:28.400> it<00:06:28.460> all

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
the end it's just going to pull it all

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.370 
the end it's just going to pull it all
the<00:06:28.820> way<00:06:29.120> over<00:06:29.419> and<00:06:29.720> have<00:06:29.810> it<00:06:29.930> hanging<00:06:30.229> to<00:06:30.320> the

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
the way over and have it hanging to the

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.779 
the way over and have it hanging to the
ground<00:06:30.440> and<00:06:30.830> that<00:06:30.949> is<00:06:31.099> not<00:06:31.250> what<00:06:31.430> we're<00:06:31.550> trying

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
ground and that is not what we're trying

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.110 
ground and that is not what we're trying
to<00:06:31.880> do<00:06:32.030> either<00:06:32.240> we<00:06:33.169> just<00:06:33.199> want<00:06:33.620> to<00:06:33.860> get<00:06:34.699> it<00:06:34.910> to

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
to do either we just want to get it to

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.629 
to do either we just want to get it to
come<00:06:35.930> down<00:06:35.960> just<00:06:36.530> a<00:06:36.680> little<00:06:36.710> bit<00:06:36.979> I<00:06:37.340> actually

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
come down just a little bit I actually

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.990 
come down just a little bit I actually
could<00:06:37.970> put<00:06:38.000> one<00:06:38.330> on<00:06:38.449> there<00:06:38.660> also<00:06:40.000> would

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
could put one on there also would

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.939 
could put one on there also would
benefit<00:06:41.539> this<00:06:42.039> and<00:06:43.720> it<00:06:44.720> needs<00:06:45.500> a<00:06:45.620> little<00:06:45.800> bit

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
benefit this and it needs a little bit

the way out on the end move it in just a
little<00:06:57.710> bit<00:06:58.070> let<00:06:58.820> the<00:06:58.970> tree<00:06:59.240> start<00:06:59.659> to<00:06:59.810> bend<00:07:00.050> if

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
little bit let the tree start to bend if

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.620 
little bit let the tree start to bend if
it<00:07:00.620> needs<00:07:00.919> a<00:07:01.280> little<00:07:01.310> bit<00:07:01.610> more<00:07:02.060> you<00:07:02.300> see<00:07:02.539> in

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
it needs a little bit more you see in

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.689 
it needs a little bit more you see in
that<00:07:02.750> it's<00:07:02.900> just<00:07:02.960> not<00:07:03.199> quite<00:07:03.560> move<00:07:04.190> it<00:07:04.340> out<00:07:04.430> one

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
that it's just not quite move it out one

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:08.020 
that it's just not quite move it out one
more<00:07:04.970> leaf<00:07:05.210> and<00:07:06.430> eventually<00:07:07.430> it<00:07:07.520> will<00:07:07.550> start

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
more leaf and eventually it will start

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.420 
more leaf and eventually it will start
to<00:07:08.150> pull<00:07:08.330> itself<00:07:08.750> down<00:07:08.960> and<00:07:09.949> that<00:07:10.130> is<00:07:10.280> the

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
to pull itself down and that is the

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.050 
to pull itself down and that is the
basis<00:07:10.880> of<00:07:10.909> the<00:07:11.900> trinitarian<00:07:12.889> is<00:07:13.039> is<00:07:13.190> to<00:07:13.729> get

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
basis of the trinitarian is is to get

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.170 
basis of the trinitarian is is to get
your<00:07:14.300> tree<00:07:14.659> formed<00:07:15.650> properly<00:07:16.090> from<00:07:17.090> the

your tree formed properly from the

your tree formed properly from the
