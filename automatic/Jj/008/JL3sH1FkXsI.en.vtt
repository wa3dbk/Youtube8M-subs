00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.870 

take<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.240> air<00:00:24.390> bubbles<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:26.250> when<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.699> make

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
take out the air bubbles and when I make

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.109 
take out the air bubbles and when I make
planter<00:00:27.269> pots<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.869> like<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.349> keep<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.070> pot<00:00:29.670> that

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
planter pots I like to keep the pot that

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.479 
planter pots I like to keep the pot that
collects<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> water<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.929> bottom

collects the water on the bottom
attached<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.600> don't<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.960> move

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
attached to it so I don't have to move

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.959
