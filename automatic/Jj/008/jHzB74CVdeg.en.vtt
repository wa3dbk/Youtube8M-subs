00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
same out lower and over hybrid theory

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.350 
same out lower and over hybrid theory
and<00:05:20.170> meteora<00:05:20.770> were<00:05:21.100> different<00:05:21.640> they<00:05:22.000> were<00:05:22.060> not

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
and meteora were different they were not

are<00:05:24.970> talking<00:05:25.360> about<00:05:25.560> but<00:05:26.560> hybrid<00:05:27.160> theory<00:05:27.340> was

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
are talking about but hybrid theory was

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.830 
are talking about but hybrid theory was
completely<00:05:28.060> different<00:05:28.360> for<00:05:28.480> me<00:05:28.570> you<00:05:28.690> are<00:05:28.720> a

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
completely different for me you are a

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.500 
completely different for me you are a
hybrid<00:05:29.050> theory<00:05:29.410> was<00:05:29.680> more<00:05:30.010> more<00:05:30.490> rocks<00:05:30.820> more

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
hybrid theory was more more rocks more

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.710 
hybrid theory was more more rocks more
metal<00:05:32.020> than<00:05:32.050> me<00:05:32.980> or<00:05:33.280> was<00:05:33.670> meteora<00:05:34.270> was<00:05:34.570> like

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720
