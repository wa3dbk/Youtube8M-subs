00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.410 
a huge issue that we have right now
local<00:03:51.080> popularity<00:03:51.830> only<00:03:52.100> 51%<00:03:52.910> obviously<00:03:53.300> we

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
local popularity only 51% obviously we

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.630 
local popularity only 51% obviously we
have<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.630> Bears<00:03:53.900> in<00:03:54.340> Chicago<00:03:55.340> as<00:03:55.430> well

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
have the Bears in Chicago as well

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.800 
have the Bears in Chicago as well
obviously<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.209> don't<00:03:56.300> think<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.600> game

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
obviously I don't think the game

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.000 
obviously I don't think the game
necessarily<00:03:57.440> takes<00:03:57.709> that<00:03:57.860> into

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
necessarily takes that into

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.400 
necessarily takes that into
consideration<00:03:58.190> but<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.269> still<00:03:59.870> like<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.170> think

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
consideration but I still like to think

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.860 
consideration but I still like to think
of<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.620> but<00:04:00.769> player<00:04:01.010> marketing<00:04:01.519> again<00:04:01.870> we

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
of it but player marketing again we

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.600 
of it but player marketing again we
really<00:04:03.080> don't<00:04:03.260> have<00:04:03.440> too<00:04:03.650> many<00:04:03.739> marketable

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
really don't have too many marketable

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.640 
really don't have too many marketable
players<00:04:04.940> Tim<00:04:05.600> Tebow<00:04:05.930> still<00:04:06.200> leading<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.470> way

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
don't know we need to work on this we

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.599 
don't know we need to work on this we
need<00:04:17.330> to<00:04:17.419> work<00:04:17.540> on<00:04:17.660> this<00:04:17.780> a<00:04:17.840> lot<00:04:18.310> we<00:04:19.310> need<00:04:19.489> to

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
need to work on this a lot we need to

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.659

improve find some players to market

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.950 
improve find some players to market
maybe<00:04:22.820> that's<00:04:23.210> what<00:04:23.390> we<00:04:23.419> should<00:04:23.479> look<00:04:23.720> for<00:04:23.870> in

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
maybe that's what we should look for in

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.500 
maybe that's what we should look for in
the<00:04:24.080> draft<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.560> marketable<00:04:25.010> player<00:04:25.400> I<00:04:25.729> think

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
the draft a marketable player I think

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.160 
the draft a marketable player I think
that<00:04:26.630> might<00:04:26.810> be<00:04:26.840> a

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
that might be a

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.220 
that might be a
good<00:04:27.230> idea<00:04:27.380> Patrick<00:04:27.800> Willis<00:04:28.400> there<00:04:29.060> we<00:04:29.150> go<00:04:29.330> all
