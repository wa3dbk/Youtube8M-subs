internet for a while I pretty much I
trusted<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> source<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> knew<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.670> one

combination of Donkey Kong the keg and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.460 
combination of Donkey Kong the keg and
RAM<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.009> jump

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
RAM be and if you jump

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.710 
RAM be and if you jump
attack<00:02:07.400> or<00:02:07.700> jump<00:02:07.880> off<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.060> them<00:02:08.360> it'll<00:02:08.540> turn

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
attack or jump off of them it'll turn

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
back to normal ran be so you can't

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.250 
back to normal ran be so you can't
really<00:02:10.759> do<00:02:11.180> anything<00:02:11.510> with<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.900> grey<00:02:12.080> donkey

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
bets anybody want to guess so we line up

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.560 
bets anybody want to guess so we line up
with<00:02:39.560> Ram<00:02:39.770> be<00:02:39.950> right<00:02:40.130> there<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.580> I<00:02:41.209> decide<00:02:41.540> to

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
with Ram be right there and I decide to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.150 
with Ram be right there and I decide to
turn<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.230> around<00:02:42.320> and<00:02:42.590> line<00:02:42.740> it<00:02:42.770> up<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:43.040> little

turn it around and line it up a little

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.040 
turn it around and line it up a little
better<00:02:43.370> because<00:02:43.580> I'm<00:02:43.940> anal<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.810> and

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
better because I'm anal and this and

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.900 
better because I'm anal and this and
this<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.380> really<00:02:45.890> kind<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.340> hard<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:46.550> pull<00:02:46.760> off

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
this is really kind of hard to pull off

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.370 
this is really kind of hard to pull off
I<00:02:47.120> spent<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.390> lot<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.540> time<00:02:47.630> trying<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.080> get<00:02:48.200> this

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
I spent a lot of time trying to get this

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.570 
I spent a lot of time trying to get this
grab<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.190> keg<00:02:49.520> through<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.320> jumped<00:02:51.320> on<00:02:51.470> it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
grab the keg through it jumped on it

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.130 
grab the keg through it jumped on it
then<00:02:52.580> nothing<00:02:53.150> seemed<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.360> happen<00:02:53.570> so<00:02:54.080> I'm

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
then nothing seemed to happen so I'm

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.440 
then nothing seemed to happen so I'm
like<00:02:54.260> okay<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:55.090> guess<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.209> didn't<00:02:56.390> work

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
like okay I guess it didn't work

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.860 
like okay I guess it didn't work
whatever<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.110> then<00:02:57.890> here<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.700> did<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.540> throw

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
whatever and then here I did the throw

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.890 
whatever and then here I did the throw
motion<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.560> boom<00:03:00.860> Diddy<00:03:01.760> on<00:03:01.970> Diddy<00:03:02.240> action

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
motion and boom Diddy on Diddy action

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.220 
motion and boom Diddy on Diddy action
yep<00:03:03.260> did<00:03:03.770> he<00:03:03.890> did<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:05.120> he's<00:03:05.360> not<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.720> guess<00:03:06.140> he

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
yep did he did it so he's not I guess he

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.110 
yep did he did it so he's not I guess he
kind<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.500> looks<00:03:06.680> greater<00:03:07.010> in<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.190> face<00:03:07.400> it's

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
kind of looks greater in the face it's

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.000

weird that is so weird how's the same
walking<00:03:10.370> motion<00:03:10.489> did<00:03:10.820> he<00:03:10.880> doesn't<00:03:11.090> really

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
walking motion did he doesn't really

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.150 
walking motion did he doesn't really
have<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.390> fall<00:03:11.660> motion<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.320> he<00:03:12.590> has<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.890> same

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.520 
in all the videos I saw they started a
new<00:03:37.070> game<00:03:37.100> went<00:03:37.760> into<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.239> then<00:03:38.870> did<00:03:39.110> it<00:03:39.230> so

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
new game went into it and then did it so

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.720

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
can actually do it after completing the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.170 
can actually do it after completing the
level<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.400> can<00:03:43.549> do<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.730> from<00:03:43.850> a<00:03:43.970> saved

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
level and you can do it from a saved

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.870 
level and you can do it from a saved
game<00:03:44.269> as<00:03:44.540> well<00:03:45.010> so<00:03:46.010> here<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.310> just<00:03:46.400> go<00:03:46.700> back

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
game as well so here I just go back

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.340 
game as well so here I just go back
through<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.269> course<00:03:47.510> it's<00:03:47.810> pretty<00:03:47.989> easy<00:03:48.170> I

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
through the course it's pretty easy I

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.810 
through the course it's pretty easy I
mean<00:03:48.530> it's<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.739> first<00:03:49.010> level<00:03:49.340> it's<00:03:49.640> not<00:03:49.760> that

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
mean it's the first level it's not that

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.420 
mean it's the first level it's not that
hard<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.180> get<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.720> but<00:03:51.590> it's<00:03:51.799> a<00:03:51.920> it's<00:03:52.100> a<00:03:52.220> pain

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
hard to get to it but it's a it's a pain

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.690 
hard to get to it but it's a it's a pain
to<00:03:52.549> pull<00:03:52.730> off<00:03:53.140> because<00:03:54.140> sometimes<00:03:54.700> rampy

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
to pull off because sometimes rampy

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.000 
to pull off because sometimes rampy
would<00:03:55.820> run<00:03:55.940> away<00:03:56.060> sometimes<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:57.530> keg<00:03:57.769> never

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
would run away sometimes the keg never

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.009 
would run away sometimes the keg never
came<00:03:58.310> back<00:03:58.549> so<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:59.000> mean<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.330> really<00:03:59.360> isn't<00:03:59.900> that

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
came back so I mean it really isn't that

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.860 
came back so I mean it really isn't that
easy<00:04:00.760> but<00:04:01.760> when<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.150> do<00:04:02.269> it<00:04:02.390> it's<00:04:02.540> pretty<00:04:02.750> cool

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
easy but when you do it it's pretty cool

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.570 
easy but when you do it it's pretty cool
to<00:04:02.930> show<00:04:03.140> off<00:04:03.350> so<00:04:03.620> definitely<00:04:04.130> try<00:04:04.310> this<00:04:04.370> one

avoiding<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.239> Cong<00:04:14.420> letters<00:04:14.780> because<00:04:14.959> who

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
avoiding the Cong letters because who

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.129 
avoiding the Cong letters because who
really<00:04:15.500> cares<00:04:15.709> so<00:04:16.220> we're<00:04:16.280> gonna<00:04:16.400> line<00:04:16.549> them<00:04:16.639> up

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
really cares so we're gonna line them up

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.479 
really cares so we're gonna line them up
run<00:04:18.139> up<00:04:18.259> here<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.530> you're<00:04:19.039> actually<00:04:19.190> going<00:04:19.430> to

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
run up here and you're actually going to

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.920 
run up here and you're actually going to
see<00:04:19.669> that<00:04:19.789> when<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:19.940> do<00:04:20.030> this<00:04:20.269> again<00:04:20.690> it

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
see that when I do this again it

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.749 
see that when I do this again it
actually<00:04:21.289> triggers<00:04:21.739> differently<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:22.460> every

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
actually triggers differently so every

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.360 
actually triggers differently so every
time<00:04:22.789> it<00:04:23.150> kind<00:04:23.330> of<00:04:23.479> does<00:04:23.690> something<00:04:24.020> different

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
time it kind of does something different

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.100 
time it kind of does something different
like<00:04:25.370> one<00:04:25.580> time<00:04:25.789> I<00:04:25.820> press<00:04:26.120> down<00:04:26.449> and<00:04:26.840> then<00:04:26.930> like

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
like one time I press down and then like

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.260 
like one time I press down and then like
this<00:04:27.320> time<00:04:27.500> like<00:04:27.710> nothing<00:04:28.009> happened<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.729> I

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
this time like nothing happened and I

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.700 
this time like nothing happened and I
just<00:04:29.479> keep<00:04:29.630> running<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:30.020> then<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.229> did<00:04:30.410> throw

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710
