 become a hunter of big pike can 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.520
 every angler 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.570
 some fishermen think they are catching 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.109

 specimens of this fish on the shoulder each 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.100
 maybe in your opinion it sounds 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.010
 too much 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.440
 optimistic isn't fishermen 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.870
 who have been fishing for pike all their life 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.510
 but never caught a single meter 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.970
 fishes but few ponds which 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.940
 Predator size limit is 80 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.070
 or 90 centimeters and so rarely 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.839
 happens that the dedicated large pike 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.330
 coming off at the end 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.299
 understand correctly, I am catching a trophy 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.519
 fish and is an easy walk if on 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.320
 some waters of north america you 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.930
 be able to catch meter pike 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.330
 day then on the lake near your house for 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.869
 This will take a whole season or even 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.869
 more 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.359
 but if you find a reservoir nearby 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.700
 I already caught a similar fish if 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.869
 follow the tips from this video and 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.530
 be patient 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.380
 you catch your dreams pike important 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.020
 condition you have to change your principles 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.020
 and not catch pike like most fishermen 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.149
 and how do you think how was able to meter 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.130
 pike under great pressure by the fisherman 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.409
 grow to huge sizes 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.499
 if the usual hunt for her would be 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.899
 efficient this pike skips past 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:44.479
 yourself countless baits too 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:48.140
 unsuitable bait are used either 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.270
 feeding methods or anglers catch on 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.789
 wrong place either in the wrong 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.950
 time usually when hunting for pike 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.300
 the more poklevok at the angler so 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.760
 happy he happens 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.880
 When hunting for big pike, the motto is different 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.230
 no need to be sprayed on a trifle 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.020
 focus on catching trophy fish 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.210
 your desire should be enough 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.700
 big so you can calmly 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:19.140
 survive the days without a bite advice 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.200
 number 1 big bait many anglers 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.230
 are concerned not too 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.450
 their pike bait is great but ask 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.210
 My question is not too much or too little . 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.550
 bait for trophy pike bait 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.890
 10 centimeters long correlated with 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.340
 big pike like a mouse in relation to 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.100
 the lion 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.620
 what do you think the lion will be chasing 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.170
 with mice if near walks larger 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.170
 Lure victims usually do not have enough 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.750
 size to excite a predator 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.130
 stomach stalking is all set 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.090
 they are most eager to feed fish 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.780
 components from ten to fifteen 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.560
 percent of their own mass for pike 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.180
 weighing 10 kilograms it would be a fish from 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.420
 half a kilo 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.610
 which corresponds to a length of 35 to 45 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.590
 centimeters 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.950
 usually papain professionals like large 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.980
 pike 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.590
 do not use lures longer than 25 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.620
 centimeters to avoid problems 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.350
 casting and prefers wobblers length 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.190
 a little over 20 centimeters or dead 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.070
 fish weighing about 250 grams such 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.860
 bait greatly increases the chance 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.860
 catching a large instance not excluding 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.350
 at the same time and catching average pikes and so your 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.080
 lures must be large 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.570
 tip number three catch in depth 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.550
 Recently, many write about fishing 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.490
 on surface bait which 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.220
 glide along the water and pike emerges over 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.380
 if their depth is of crocodile 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.870
 quite catchy way of catching large 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.960
 pike but only when she 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.650
 shallow water is active and the method is used 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.990
 still not as wide as deep ponds 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.120
 everything is not so easy on the deep and soul 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.810
 baits for example appropriate 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.690
 wobblers 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.940
 or soft plastic bait and jack with severe head 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.900
 can not catch the trophy pike on 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.580
 great depth when fishing with a float 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.510
 it is advisable to first measure the depth and 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.670
 serve bait in meter from 1 and 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.400
 english pike fishing professionals 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.800

 adheres to bottom fishing tactics 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.910
 they let the dead fish to the bottom and 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.310
 catches big pikes on them 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.360
 tip number 4 choose unusual 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.940
 bait 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.039
 do not use the same wobblers and 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.710
 catches your tails 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.770
 colleagues on the nearby reservoirs may 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.180
 your unusual bait will shoot and you 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.130
 catch from the most experienced pike rey 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.530
 top pike fishing advice 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.930
 bet on the dead fish on 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:09.090
 tackles no pike hungry 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.229
 can remain indifferent to her advice 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.550
 number 5 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.979
 have patience as already said 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.449
 be a trophy pike long can be in 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.060
 for many months 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.360
 good luck will not accompany you this 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.130
 who at that time in despair will give up 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.590
 probably capitulates to the very goal 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.470
 and who will continue to catch with 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.000
 unwavering persistence will be possible 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.110
 rewarded and two 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.580
 record pike for 1 month 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.389
 endurance and patience is always 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.940
 rewarded 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.430
 why it takes so much time that 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.470
 catch the trophy pike while 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.470
 instance of medium size comes across 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.020
 quite often firstly quantity 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.990
 meter pikes in the pond is not so big 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.810
 what smaller relatives and secondly 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.599
 they feed less frequently while 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.720
 small pikes grab prey during the day 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:06.659
 many times larger more economically 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.570
 spend their strength often they for one 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:11.210
 attack gets fodder weight 1 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.090
 kilogram 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.160
 then calmly digest and that in 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.600
 depending on the time of year 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.240
 last a few days 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.729
 only after that they become again 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.960
 active but for a short time 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:29.599
 and so the more often you will be taking 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.030
