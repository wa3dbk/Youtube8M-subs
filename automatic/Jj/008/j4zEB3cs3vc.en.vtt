00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
way I'm going to do half way because

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.070

this<00:01:32.200> is<00:01:32.260> a<00:01:32.409> skin<00:01:32.830> in<00:01:32.979> row<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.420> then<00:01:34.780> I'm<00:01:34.900> going

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
this is a skin in row and then I'm going

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.000 
this is a skin in row and then I'm going
to<00:01:35.110> use<00:01:35.409> that<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:37.600> going<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:37.930> kind<00:01:38.920> of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.780 
to use that and I'm going to kind of
pick<00:01:39.340> it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.810 

so<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.510> skin<00:01:42.870> comes<00:01:43.200> along<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.800> it<00:01:43.980> I'm<00:01:44.520> just

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so the skin comes along with it I'm just

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.310 
so the skin comes along with it I'm just
pushing<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.390> ever<00:01:45.900> so<00:01:46.320> lightly<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:48.320> will

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320

and<00:01:56.390> it's<00:01:56.689> not<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.350> most<00:01:57.499> comfortable<00:01:57.890> thing

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
and it's not the most comfortable thing

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.459 
and it's not the most comfortable thing
as<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.259> can<00:02:00.409> see<00:02:00.679> her<00:02:00.890> other<00:02:01.039> foot<00:02:01.460> is<00:02:02.469> going

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.400 

I'm<00:02:26.050> just<00:02:26.380> back<00:02:27.480> then<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.630> want<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.960> get<00:02:29.110> any

better
so<00:02:43.300> there<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.630> go<00:02:44.350> this<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.190> all<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.610> skin

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
so there you go this is all the skin

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.960 
so there you go this is all the skin
that's<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.480> there

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.050 

so<00:03:00.810> if<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.410> toenails<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.190> wide<00:03:02.460> you<00:03:02.790> want<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:13.900 
so if the toenails this wide you want to
go<00:03:03.180> halfway<00:03:05.960> and<00:03:06.960> this<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.500> half<00:03:07.680> point

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.460 

push<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.750> out

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.800 

but<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.070> want<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.310> hold<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:19.000> other

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
but you want to hold the other

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.430 
but you want to hold the other
right<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:21.860> it's<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:22.760> pressure

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.010 

this<00:03:27.040> piece<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.580> out<00:03:27.850> already<00:03:28.090> but<00:03:28.660> they're

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
this piece is out already but they're

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.460 
this piece is out already but they're
still<00:03:29.410> skin<00:03:29.920> out<00:03:30.160> here<00:03:30.490> and<00:03:31.450> we<00:03:31.660> zoom<00:03:31.960> in<00:03:32.140> close

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
still skin out here and we zoom in close

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.130 
still skin out here and we zoom in close
there's<00:03:33.120> white

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:54.240 

go<00:03:38.770> ahead<00:03:39.069> and<00:03:40.060> push<00:03:40.330> that<00:03:40.360> out<00:03:40.870> too

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.550 

white<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.730> what<00:03:55.939> you<00:03:56.060> can't<00:03:56.360> get<00:03:56.569> up<00:03:56.810> those<00:03:57.079> I

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
white so what you can't get up those I
