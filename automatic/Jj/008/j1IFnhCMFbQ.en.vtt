00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.190
 motorcycle fans of all 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.870
 coats from now you are warned 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:20.890
 that a star was born in the 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:23.740
 firmament biker a nice motorbike 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.940
 modern logic and polyvalent and if you 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.060
 you are asking if it is 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:33.940
 damn funny you look at her like 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:36.010
 half is the gmt 07 flame that has 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.110
 loaned lounge is not a two-cylinder 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.840
 use of the cross plane engine of this 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.430
 Small big bike makes it different 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.989
 has even lower than expected 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.610
 but that engine configuration 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:51.040
 allows a power curve always 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.230
 full yes it seems electric by city it 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.000
 shows spectacularly manageable already 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.460
 it's not a street fighter of airs 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.400
 urban although that does have a handlebar 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.520
 a little narrow 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.520
 yes 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.990
 touch dimensions the reduced 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.310
 weight and general maneuverability make 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.740
 make it fun to wear in any 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.740
 circumstance is very comfortable even for 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.110
 buy the participation 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.850
 but of course our tramontana always 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.130
 Irresistible calls us to taste the in 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.990
 a more ideal environment the curves are 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.159
 one of its natural lands does not 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.259
 it also needs to run a lot to 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.030
 have fun and for benefits we believe 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.310
 that has a fluid and without driving 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.929
 brusqueness thus carried though not the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:47.850
 we force a lot can go pretty 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:50.310
 pretty fast you tell me you need to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.289
 more arguments then look at the test with 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.970
 and without limitation and it is the model that 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.530
 less suffers in the character to be limited 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.530
 that we have tried and long 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.829
 and more advantages declared a consumption of 4 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.170
 liters to have them to us 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.520
 came out 5,6 you have to recognize that so 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.520
 we gave him a little salt 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.960
 and the overall behavior of the finishes 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.910
 they are enough for 90% of us 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.910
 90% of the time 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.930
 so much in fact that it outraged 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.440
 think that Yamaha is betting strongly on the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.330
 small mt 07 like some best-selling ones like that 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.540
 You already know how to see her on a motorcycle 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.780
 Sado hi colleagues asks for a test that you 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.780
 will like 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.430
 ah
