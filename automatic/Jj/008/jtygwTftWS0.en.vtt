00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 I already ask racita how are they if that animal 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.599
 capon and welcome gentlemen to a game 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.450
 play black black black black black 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.309
 ops sir is good welcome to someone 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.139
 because recite is an example of domination 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.320
 that out there we are giving hard to the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.970
 to eggs but good recent before 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.410
 moving on to the main issues them 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.289
 I want to tell you before this example 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.060
 and gentlemen trust me theater and is 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.769
 playing a team deathmatch and do not suck me 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.740
 I think the best voices that excel 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.500
 black ops the ipyc is theater I do not record it 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.600
 because the host's ass came out and so that 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.210
 mother is not recorded calculation of ccoo wait 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.180
 vision is two stories that everything comes out 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.820
 that everything you do comes out and is done 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.129
 all click you do a good crap 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.660
 if it was a game but it's worth it but 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.780
 well I know that I trauma with my fingers 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.170
 Well then he recites is the fashion of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.000
 q2 that logically then because they have 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.300
 put gameplays right now is the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.100
 gamescom go in germany and good condition 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.660
 circulating a little bit a day with day 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.530
 all the things that the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.810
 multiplayer del black ops 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.090
 and well then that is the theme 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.409
 relevant to this gameplay like that you 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.150
 they go in , they 're going to clean that 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.759
 rope with its crossing mine then for 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.619
 see how he put on he was chingón 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.960
 this really the black ops is a 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.690
 I think the only thing that I would complain about 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.540
 is that it's not mexican friendly connection 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.490
 since it is very unfair truth with the 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.040
 others if there is a fucking good host 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.979
 It was worth moms hebe de cinema table this 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.200
 but outside of that the game is very good 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.060
 then let's talk the click the cop 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.619
 logically we are going to give them the two 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.030
 gentlemen of what has come out I would like 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:46.000
 know their opinions that they think because 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.770
 well there is always the doubt that if it goes 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.259
 to sell more the flag halo plus the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.259
 xylophone is going to compete or is going to sell 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.640
 plus the call of duty the shit x yo 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.950
 I think with what they have shown up 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.810
 horita gentlemen the call of duty goes to 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.759
 keep your sales record 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.110
 I think it's going to be a fucking 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.570
 super sales record because it's 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.740
 multiplayer is good ok 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.149
 compared to the new software 3 that does not 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.009
 we must compare because they are also two 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.310
 different games and moss to be used in 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.350
 different companies this east if you see 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.240
 that they got it, they listened to the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.670
 community brings more theater moms more 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.300
 mothers even for youtubers for 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.610
 bonuses and so on 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.750
 the game everything is done 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.690
 game modes and the same weapons all 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.990
 everything customizable within the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.690
 classes no mamen is chingón or the 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.260
 Starting amount and attachment for 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.960
 the weapons you have everything 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.470
 the rest and see how it makes a rule 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.260
 on its east side and well I think you're 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.300
 is giving a plus because it's over 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.690
 same as always not looking 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:00.100
 the pex in favor of having your classes and your 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.890
 three verses but adapt a little more or 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.650
 rather the game adapts towards you not 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.050
 to a class that you really are 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.570
 I 'm going to buy it a little bit with the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.010
 bar 'the in that style because we're worth it if 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.660
 you can customize a lot your 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.870
 classes without the need to put perez that 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.580
 you can put a parquero this but 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.710
 without getting too much into the bar the fill 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.890
 You can customize them, you bastard 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.050
 classes what is it that these guys 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.510
 they treated me I think we try to be a 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.000
 they tried to match by what they saw from 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.569
 the examples and gentlemen if they are to give very 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.999
 fan boy 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.400
 and I think that the game will 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:39.330
 highlight the predecessors enough to 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.510
 the heats of before 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.430
 a war of ideas from all sides is not 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.800
 I say it's not a totally new game 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.620
 it's something totally cool 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.480
 but if they are different things, it's not like that 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.870
 if there is a difference apart I think that 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.760
 it's a more level game first it seems 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.620
 that the connections do not know if I already 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.450
 confirmed that I think the servers 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.760
 dedicated now are confirmed for 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.080
 pc I had listened because also 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.180
 for console but I do not know no but good 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.430
 this matchmaking is going to be more 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.140
 level is going to put you with people of your 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.970
 level if you want you will be able to play with 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.830
 everyone also but if you want 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.870
 playing with people of your level is what the 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.489
 it will be you learn not 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.580
 that you are playing more machine 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.190
 and good is what starts to make the 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.530
 game becomes even as there is no 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.720
 something super powerful I say good to see 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.759
 the weapons at the time they leave because 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.220
 always there is an imbalance not in 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.590
 He comforts her here 74 or at the beginning that 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.740
 normally two bullets killed and 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.980
 in the new fer 3 good the 95 times already 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.000
 they lowered this the pinches the laptops 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.280
 a blowjob 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.390
 you say that but it's not so bad it 's like 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.130
 you want to keep killing good asshole 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:00.950
 but it's not that we remember that the 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.440
 white is a game that I have many 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.090
 many patches that if they put a voice 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.970
 been updating it to be improving and 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.680
 I hope and I imagine that this is going to be with 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.750
 Lacandon not going to start correcting 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.100
 all those little things that are coming out 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.390
 that are even coming from 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.090
 a week at gamescom while you're 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.920
 playing people are getting 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.420
 feedback for that do the brothers is 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.580
 precisely to receive feedback from 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.340
 all players 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.960
 and players of all kinds to see what 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.550
 can improve the game not really what 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.030
 what we are seeing there is a game that 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.340
 is in beta is not the game over 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.980
 and he still needs to stop 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.240
 that it reaches its final version but 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.180
 good sir this is what has 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.880
 seemed things things more dynamic the 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.680
 to say that those who are from 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.780
 eskorzo ix instead of kyushi that are 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.520
 Chinese and maximum why why not 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.260
 return 3 they gave us the support and 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.800
 uan whore many said no mames is that 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:57.910
 It's unfair that I'm a bomber 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:00.160
 this one for not killing 2 weixing by 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.330
 assists or that captures this and that 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.430
 does this and that the other and they leave 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.410
 accumulating lest he die and if they continue 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.120
 accumulating is the ox at the end the 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.270
 Starting program what is done water 2 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.460
 here where bomber could not kill 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.850
 be all the city team is going well but 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.290
 here gentlemen that you do you have done 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.270
 I believe that an equivalence with the 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.220
 scorpions because now those that 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.350
 capture goals it's usually going to 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.500
 import more for you to take out your 15 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.249
 instead of walking matti mate like crazy or 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.549
 Changing 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:33.079
 be with assistance I do not know et cetera no 

00:06:30.549 --> 00:06:35.849
 so now if you are if you really go 

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:38.429
 to do this let's say 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:41.610
 but here it's not going to matter so much of 

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:43.289
 how many mates of people but 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.110
 really how much did this help the team in 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.509
 the game and that's fine I do not know is like 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.069
 the bar the fill 3 not that really for 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.839
 winning many points is because I really 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:54.270
 you are helping to win the game not 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:55.830
 because they are killing güeyes and away not 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.559
 who are you giving a plus and 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.009
 downloading a help to your team that 

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:04.939
 is what I intend in q2 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:08.629
 so we perfect apart from the 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:10.699
 15 well we will go on talking more I will take 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:12.979
 a series before the cop that is of 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.599
 done this should I be a subscriber and 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:16.430
 that's why we're going to talk about what 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:18.139
 of what is coming from what of what 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.369
 you saw the 15 and what you 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:21.110
 say 

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:23.930
 I would like good I would like to see the 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.490
 comments in this video that put 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.369
 comment is exactly what they think 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:31.849
 you for me to be able to express your 

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:34.580
 comments on another video elsewhere 

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:35.960
 if we are not taking it to get a 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.999
 conclusion and analyze what but 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.770
 logically the gel fans and others 

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:41.539
 I'll say again to prick capón fan very 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.159
 good years that my channel early 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:45.529
 based on useful heat that alluded and I 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:47.509
 like it more than any other game but 

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:49.219
 that does not mean that he is denigrating 

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:51.710
 to the other games thanks simply 

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:54.229
 right now it 's time for black ops 2 and 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:56.240
 when it is let which increased 4 and so 

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:58.339
 ok between twins reviews recipes that 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.979
 they think they thought these first 

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:02.449
 gameplays of black ops 2 waiting for 

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:07.069
