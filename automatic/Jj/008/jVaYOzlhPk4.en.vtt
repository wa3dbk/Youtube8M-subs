00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.030 
probably it just works better with gap
in<00:01:42.540> Rio<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> ones<00:01:43.290> fighting<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.950> he

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
in Rio be the ones fighting so that he

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.429 
in Rio be the ones fighting so that he
instead<00:01:44.430> barrel<00:01:44.850> however<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.689> kind<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.110> wish<00:01:46.290> i

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
instead barrel however I kind of wish i

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.410 
instead barrel however I kind of wish i
was<00:01:46.799> able<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.159> make<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.369> episode<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:48.030> some

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
was able to make that episode at some

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.149 
was able to make that episode at some
point<00:01:48.659> because<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.140> kind<00:01:49.320> does<00:01:49.590> establish<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
point because the kind does establish a

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.819 
point because the kind does establish a
son<00:01:50.430> concept<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.060> never<00:01:51.299> got<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.780> address<00:01:52.140> with

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
son concept I never got to address with

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.450 
son concept I never got to address with
this<00:01:53.490> guy<00:01:53.729> see<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.750> guy<00:01:54.960> see<00:01:55.470> who's<00:01:55.649> hot<00:01:55.860> yeah

this guy see this guy see who's hot yeah
that<00:01:57.119> don't<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:58.229> actually<00:01:58.469> gives<00:01:59.100> them

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
that don't think is actually gives them

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.490 
that don't think is actually gives them
the<00:01:59.399> ability<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.939> transform<00:02:00.450> into<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:01.110> super

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
seems like a decent idea because it's

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.030 
seems like a decent idea because it's
simple<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.660> no<00:02:55.470> it's<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.800> role<00:02:56.010> reversal

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040

because of time constraints I really

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.130 
because of time constraints I really
wanted<00:04:41.000> to<00:04:41.090> make<00:04:41.270> that<00:04:41.450> episode<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:42.050> be

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
wanted to make that episode to be

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.900 
wanted to make that episode to be

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
completely honest but again time

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.820 
completely honest but again time
constraints<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.510> life<00:04:44.900> kind<00:04:45.380> of<00:04:45.470> gives<00:04:45.650> him

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
constraints and life kind of gives him

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.950 
constraints and life kind of gives him
away<00:04:46.100> also<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.760> set<00:04:47.030> like<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.419> said<00:04:47.660> wasn't

though barely anything to work with the
set<00:04:54.830> is<00:04:55.040> a<00:04:55.100> miracle<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.550> I<00:04:55.610> was<00:04:55.790> able<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:56.150> make

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
set is a miracle that I was able to make

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.640 
set is a miracle that I was able to make
this<00:04:56.419> stuff<00:04:56.600> resemble<00:04:57.169> what<00:04:57.440> they<00:04:57.560> were

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
this stuff resemble what they were

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.680 
this stuff resemble what they were
supposed<00:04:58.010> to<00:04:58.130> be<00:04:58.280> so<00:04:58.669> knowing<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.150> was<00:04:59.330> working

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
supposed to be so knowing I was working

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.110 
supposed to be so knowing I was working
with<00:04:59.780> the<00:05:00.020> Alpha<00:05:00.410> materials<00:05:00.919> making<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.820> sets

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
with the Alpha materials making the sets

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.640 
with the Alpha materials making the sets
for<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.450> multiple<00:05:02.780> locations<00:05:03.110> in<00:05:03.530> this

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
for the multiple locations in this

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.330 
for the multiple locations in this
episode<00:05:03.919> would<00:05:04.820> have<00:05:04.970> taken<00:05:05.270> forever<00:05:05.570> and
