00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
blitzing but I'm also in a better

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.249 
blitzing but I'm also in a better
position<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.150> cover<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> halfback<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.020> as

position to cover the halfback and as

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.200 
position to cover the halfback and as
the<00:01:40.409> halfback<00:01:40.829> goes<00:01:41.009> over<00:01:41.430> even<00:01:42.030> with<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the halfback goes over even with the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.850 
the halfback goes over even with the
pre-snap<00:01:42.479> read<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.079> linebacker<00:01:43.560> should

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
pre-snap read this linebacker should

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.530 
pre-snap read this linebacker should
know<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.460> come<00:01:44.640> over<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.299> try<00:01:45.420> to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
know to come over here and try to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.319 
know to come over here and try to
provide<00:01:45.840> better<00:01:46.079> coverage<00:01:46.380> instead<00:01:47.329> that

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
provide better coverage instead that

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.630 
provide better coverage instead that
only<00:01:48.540> happens<00:01:49.140> when<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> offense<00:01:50.100> puts<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
only happens when the offense puts the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.889 
only happens when the offense puts the
tight<00:01:50.850> end<00:01:51.060> into<00:01:51.299> motion<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
tight end into motion and the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.749 
tight end into motion and the
interesting<00:01:52.320> thing<00:01:52.350> would<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.369> offense

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
interesting thing would be the offense

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.730 
interesting thing would be the offense
actually<00:01:54.180> hurts<00:01:54.450> itself<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.290> happens

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
actually hurts itself when that happens

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.819 
actually hurts itself when that happens
so<00:01:56.399> when<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> tight<00:01:57.329> end<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.930> adjusting

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
so when the tight end is not adjusting

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.999 
so when the tight end is not adjusting
and<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.280> over<00:01:59.460> this<00:02:00.030> linebacker<00:02:01.009> continues

this for its speed this is the example

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.780 
this for its speed this is the example
where<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.530> tight<00:02:40.769> end<00:02:40.950> has<00:02:41.100> shifted<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.670> to

where the tight end has shifted and to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.240 
where the tight end has shifted and to
me<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.450> actually<00:02:42.989> impedes<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.680> offense<00:02:44.099> I

me this actually impedes the offense I
don't<00:02:44.310> know<00:02:44.610> why<00:02:44.849> they<00:02:45.390> would<00:02:45.569> do<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:45.900> more

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
don't know why they would do this more

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.410 
don't know why they would do this more

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
would be daryl washington in my opinion
even<00:03:06.120> though<00:03:06.330> he's<00:03:06.450> going<00:03:06.720> through<00:03:06.840> a

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
even though he's going through a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.210 
even though he's going through a
suspension<00:03:07.290> one<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.680> best<00:03:07.890> middle

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
suspension one of the best middle

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.490 
suspension one of the best middle
linebackers<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.910> game<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:10.140> really

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
linebackers in the game so this really

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.280 
linebackers in the game so this really
puts<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.730> advantage<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.870> Cardinals

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
puts the advantage to the Cardinals

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.840 
puts the advantage to the Cardinals
because<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:14.010> see<00:03:14.190> there<00:03:14.340> even<00:03:14.580> though<00:03:14.670> it's

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
because you see there even though it's

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.300 
because you see there even though it's
not<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.150> best<00:03:15.390> coverage<00:03:15.950> Washington<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.040> able

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
not the best coverage Washington is able

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.880 
not the best coverage Washington is able
to<00:03:17.370> come<00:03:17.580> out<00:03:17.610> make<00:03:18.359> a<00:03:18.390> very<00:03:18.720> easy<00:03:19.109> quick<00:03:19.590> read

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
to come out make a very easy quick read

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.349 
to come out make a very easy quick read
he's<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.190> better<00:03:20.400> position<00:03:20.970> just<00:03:21.209> from<00:03:21.329> a

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
he's in better position just from a

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.110 
he's in better position just from a
starting<00:03:21.810> point<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.440> pursue<00:03:23.130> Richardson<00:03:23.970> and

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
starting point to pursue Richardson and

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.819 
starting point to pursue Richardson and
this<00:03:24.450> really<00:03:24.840> allows<00:03:24.959> this<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.590> be<00:03:25.739> an

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
this really allows this to be an

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.620 
this really allows this to be an
ineffective<00:03:26.250> play<00:03:26.730> now<00:03:27.239> we're<00:03:27.420> going<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.570> go

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
ineffective play now we're going to go

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.090 
ineffective play now we're going to go
ahead<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.049> load<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.290> up<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.500> other<00:03:28.530> way<00:03:28.890> and

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
ahead and load it up the other way and

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.199 
ahead and load it up the other way and
then<00:03:29.310> we're<00:03:29.430> going<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.579> play<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.970> few<00:03:30.150> times

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
then we're going to play it a few times

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.699 
then we're going to play it a few times
its<00:03:30.660> speed<00:03:30.900> all<00:03:31.290> right<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.500> here<00:03:31.620> we<00:03:31.680> have

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
its speed all right so here we have

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.960 
its speed all right so here we have
Allen<00:03:32.070> on<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.220> right<00:03:32.400> side<00:03:32.609> of<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.730> formation

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
speed and to me this is what we're

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.630 
speed and to me this is what we're
seeing<00:03:37.019> really<00:03:37.380> continue<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.100> hinder<00:03:38.459> this

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
seeing really continue to hinder this

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.819 
seeing really continue to hinder this
game<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.180> really<00:03:39.630> just<00:03:39.959> not<00:03:40.200> understanding

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
game and really just not understanding

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.039 
game and really just not understanding
of<00:03:41.340> fundamental<00:03:41.489> football<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.450> concepts

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
of fundamental football and concepts

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.199 
of fundamental football and concepts
playing<00:03:43.829> out<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.310> field<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.850> create<00:03:45.180> a

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
playing out on the field to create a

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.449 
playing out on the field to create a
simulation<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:46.140> mean<00:03:46.530> we<00:03:46.739> take<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> look<00:03:47.250> here

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
simulation I mean we take a look here

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.520 
simulation I mean we take a look here
what<00:03:47.609> Abraham<00:03:48.030> does<00:03:48.299> he's<00:03:48.750> on<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.019> wrong<00:03:49.200> side

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
what Abraham does he's on the wrong side

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.750 
what Abraham does he's on the wrong side
of<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.709> field<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:50.040> cover<00:03:50.190> Richardson<00:03:50.670> to

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
of the field to cover Richardson to

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.699 
of the field to cover Richardson to
begin<00:03:51.060> with<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.510> then<00:03:51.540> all<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.290> sudden<00:03:52.620> he

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
begin with and then all of a sudden he

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.259 
begin with and then all of a sudden he
starts<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.190> run<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.820> me<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
starts to run in and to me this is the

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.880 
starts to run in and to me this is the
most<00:03:54.390> interesting<00:03:54.840> part<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.350> this<00:03:55.410> play<00:03:55.680> I

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
most interesting part of this play I

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.789 
most interesting part of this play I
mean<00:03:56.310> florin<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.090> Abraham<00:03:58.049> or<00:03:58.260> basically

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
mean florin and Abraham or basically

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.710 
mean florin and Abraham or basically
face<00:03:59.220> mask<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.670> face<00:03:59.880> mask<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.390> it's<00:04:00.510> almost

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
face mask to face mask and it's almost

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.210 
face mask to face mask and it's almost
as<00:04:01.049> if<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.380> offensive<00:04:01.739> line<00:04:01.890> does<00:04:02.190> not

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
as if the offensive line does not

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.789 
as if the offensive line does not
understand<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.420> Abraham<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.380> threat<00:04:04.769> to

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
understand that Abraham is a threat to

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.979 
understand that Abraham is a threat to
Andrew<00:04:05.190> Luck<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.579> like<00:04:05.760> they<00:04:05.940> know<00:04:06.239> that<00:04:06.810> he

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
situation and you can see there again he

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.550 
situation and you can see there again he
gets<00:04:15.480> into<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.690> position<00:04:15.870> where<00:04:16.139> now<00:04:16.350> he's

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
gets into a position where now he's

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.159 
gets into a position where now he's
behind<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.609> two<00:04:17.820> offensive<00:04:18.359> linemen<00:04:18.810> he's

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
behind the two offensive linemen he's

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.960 
behind the two offensive linemen he's
continuing<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.950> look<00:04:20.070> over<00:04:20.400> at<00:04:20.519> richardson

continuing to look over at richardson

continuing to look over at richardson
but<00:04:21.090> he<00:04:21.180> needs<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.539> make<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.840> assessment

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
but he needs to make that assessment

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.860 
but he needs to make that assessment
that<00:04:22.500> right<00:04:22.740> now<00:04:22.950> he<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.490> continuing<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.720> get

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
that right now he is continuing to get
