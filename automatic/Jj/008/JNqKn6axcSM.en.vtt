Candida training HQ and today we're
going<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.740> go<00:00:04.920> over<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> quick<00:00:05.339> tip<00:00:05.670> covering

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
going to go over a quick tip covering

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.690 
going to go over a quick tip covering
two<00:00:06.480> exercises<00:00:07.170> which<00:00:07.859> can<00:00:08.099> increase<00:00:08.550> your

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
two exercises which can increase your

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.180 
two exercises which can increase your
mobility<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.870> help<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.260> get<00:00:10.530> into<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> deep

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
mobility to help you get into a deep

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.610 
mobility to help you get into a deep
squat<00:00:11.400> position<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.750> first<00:00:12.960> movement<00:00:13.290> is

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
squat position the first movement is

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.799 
squat position the first movement is
simply<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> front<00:00:14.519> squat<00:00:14.639> but<00:00:15.299> what<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.509> want<00:00:15.750> you

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
simply a front squat but what I want you

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.779 
simply a front squat but what I want you
to<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:16.650> your<00:00:16.830> stance<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.310> narrow<00:00:17.670> as

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
to do is have your stance as narrow as

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.300 
to do is have your stance as narrow as
possible<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:19.050> most<00:00:19.289> likely<00:00:19.680> you'll<00:00:19.859> start<00:00:20.160> out

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
possible so most likely you'll start out

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.640 
possible so most likely you'll start out
with<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.550> fairly<00:00:20.880> wide<00:00:21.210> stance<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.960> just<00:00:22.350> go<00:00:22.500> as

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
with a fairly wide stance and just go as

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.380 
with a fairly wide stance and just go as
low<00:00:22.859> as<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.130> can<00:00:23.400> while<00:00:23.699> keeping<00:00:23.730> your<00:00:24.240> lower

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
low as you can while keeping your lower

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.720 
low as you can while keeping your lower
back<00:00:24.779> straight<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.500> then<00:00:25.980> as<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.460> increase

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
back straight and then as you increase

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.970 
back straight and then as you increase
your<00:00:26.970> mobility<00:00:27.150> move<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.960> stance<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.439> as<00:00:28.769> much

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
your mobility move the stance in as much

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.070 
your mobility move the stance in as much
as<00:00:29.039> possible<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:30.029> will<00:00:30.240> take<00:00:30.510> some<00:00:30.660> time<00:00:30.720> but

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
as possible this will take some time but

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.659 
as possible this will take some time but
with<00:00:31.230> each<00:00:31.470> successive<00:00:31.949> workout<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.640> should

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
with each successive workout you should

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.490 
with each successive workout you should
be<00:00:32.910> able<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> narrow<00:00:33.420> your<00:00:33.570> stance<00:00:34.020> more<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
be able to narrow your stance more and

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.200 
be able to narrow your stance more and
more<00:00:34.680> what's<00:00:35.219> great<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.030> that

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
more what's great about this is that

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.569 
more what's great about this is that
improves<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:36.809> ankle<00:00:37.290> flexibility<00:00:38.070> while

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
improves your ankle flexibility while

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.700 
improves your ankle flexibility while
also<00:00:39.090> forcing<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.719> improve<00:00:40.200> your<00:00:40.410> core

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
also forcing you to improve your core

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010 
also forcing you to improve your core
stability<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.879> focus<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.270> keeping<00:00:42.480> your<00:00:42.750> chest

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
stability so focus on keeping your chest

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.860 
stability so focus on keeping your chest
up<00:00:43.290> lower<00:00:43.829> back<00:00:44.100> straight<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.910> your<00:00:44.969> heels<00:00:45.660> on

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
up lower back straight and your heels on

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.900 
up lower back straight and your heels on
the<00:00:45.899> ground<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.649> recommend<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.730> this

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the ground I recommend that you do this

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.209 
the ground I recommend that you do this
exercise<00:00:48.149> without<00:00:48.930> shoes<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.710> order<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
exercise without shoes on in order to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.369 
exercise without shoes on in order to
best<00:00:50.550> develop<00:00:50.789> your<00:00:51.180> ankle<00:00:51.480> flexibility<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
best develop your ankle flexibility I

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.869 
best develop your ankle flexibility I
know<00:00:52.680> some<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.250> are<00:00:53.280> probably<00:00:53.610> watching

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
know some of you are probably watching

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.520 
know some of you are probably watching
this<00:00:54.300> thinking<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.989> seems<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.289> an

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
this thinking that this seems like an

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.130 
this thinking that this seems like an
unrealistic<00:00:56.039> exercise<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.539> remember<00:00:57.989> it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
unrealistic exercise but remember it's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.049 
unrealistic exercise but remember it's
all<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:58.350> gradually<00:00:59.219> building<00:00:59.609> into<00:00:59.940> this

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
all about gradually building into this

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.389 
all about gradually building into this
movement<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> start<00:01:02.160> with

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
movement so if you have to start with

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.670 
movement so if you have to start with
the<00:01:02.550> wider<00:01:02.789> stance<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.600> even<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the wider stance and even if you have to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920 
the wider stance and even if you have to
squat<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> little<00:01:05.129> bit<00:01:05.519> higher<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:06.420> okay

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
squat a little bit higher that's okay

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.289 
squat a little bit higher that's okay
then<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.619> gradually<00:01:08.130> decrease<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.000> stance

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
then just gradually decrease the stance

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.780 
then just gradually decrease the stance
width<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.900> increase<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.860> depth<00:01:11.100> over<00:01:11.520> time

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
width and increase the depth over time

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.359 
width and increase the depth over time
also<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> suggest<00:01:13.229> doing<00:01:13.290> paused<00:01:13.799> wraps<00:01:14.130> with

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
also I suggest doing paused wraps with

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.429 
also I suggest doing paused wraps with
this<00:01:14.549> exercise<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.930> important

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
this exercise and this is important

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.130 
this exercise and this is important
because<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.400> forces<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> use<00:01:18.420> good<00:01:18.780> form

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
because this forces you to use good form

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.109 
because this forces you to use good form
the<00:01:19.619> weight<00:01:19.830> will<00:01:20.040> actually<00:01:20.400> push<00:01:20.700> your<00:01:20.909> body

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the weight will actually push your body

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.840 
the weight will actually push your body
into<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> proper<00:01:22.080> position<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:23.430> easier

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
into the proper position and it's easier

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.999 
into the proper position and it's easier
to<00:01:24.000> focus<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.540> tensing<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> corne<00:01:25.439> keeping

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
to focus on tensing the corne keeping

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.789 
to focus on tensing the corne keeping
the<00:01:26.100> proper<00:01:26.520> posture<00:01:27.119> when<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.960> hole<00:01:28.140> okay

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the proper posture when in the hole okay

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.469 
the proper posture when in the hole okay
so<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.159> first<00:01:29.430> drill<00:01:29.670> focus<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.150> ankle

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
so that first drill focus on ankle

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.870 
so that first drill focus on ankle
flexibility<00:01:31.140> core<00:01:31.680> stability<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
flexibility core stability and the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.429 
flexibility core stability and the
ability<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.210> maintain<00:01:33.479> thoracic<00:01:34.320> extension

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
ability to maintain thoracic extension

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.069 
ability to maintain thoracic extension
in<00:01:34.979> your<00:01:35.100> upper<00:01:35.310> back<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:36.390> what<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.840> want<00:01:37.020> to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
in your upper back now what we want to

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.690 
in your upper back now what we want to
work<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> second<00:01:37.950> drill<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.369> hip

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
work with the second drill is hip

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.630 
work with the second drill is hip
mobility<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.799> suggest<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.460> take

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
mobility so for this I suggest you take

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.580 
mobility so for this I suggest you take
a<00:01:41.700> stance<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.540> wide<00:01:42.780> as<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.350> go

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
a stance that's as wide as you can go

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.280 
a stance that's as wide as you can go
with<00:01:44.130> still<00:01:44.460> reaching<00:01:44.909> parallel<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.659> common

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
with still reaching parallel a common

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.050 
with still reaching parallel a common
mistake<00:01:46.619> when<00:01:46.770> working<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.250> mobility<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
mistake when working on mobility in the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
mistake when working on mobility in the
squat<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:49.079> people<00:01:49.350> focus<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.860> stretching

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
squat is that people focus on stretching

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.490 
squat is that people focus on stretching
the<00:01:50.640> hamstrings<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.930> hamstrings<00:01:52.290> are

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the hamstrings and your hamstrings are

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
the hamstrings and your hamstrings are
not<00:01:52.740> maximally<00:01:53.399> stretched<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> bottom

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
not maximally stretched in the bottom

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.929 
not maximally stretched in the bottom
position<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.110> deep<00:01:55.350> squat<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.430> real<00:01:56.670> issue

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
position of a deep squat the real issue

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.450 
position of a deep squat the real issue
with<00:01:57.240> hip<00:01:57.420> mobility<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.140> deep<00:01:58.350> squat<00:01:58.619> isn't

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
with hip mobility and a deep squat isn't

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.520 
with hip mobility and a deep squat isn't
hip<00:01:59.610> extension<00:02:00.270> rather<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.079> keeping<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
hip extension rather it's keeping the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.950 
hip extension rather it's keeping the
hips<00:02:01.680> externally<00:02:02.549> rotated<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.780> hip

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
hips externally rotated and it's hip

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.990 
hips externally rotated and it's hip
abduction<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.979> that's<00:02:05.159> why<00:02:05.369> wide<00:02:05.610> stance

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
abduction so that's why wide stance

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.359 
abduction so that's why wide stance
squats<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:06.990> effective<00:02:07.649> because<00:02:08.069> they

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
squats can be so effective because they

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.619 
squats can be so effective because they
strengthen<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> smaller<00:02:09.420> muscles

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
strengthen the smaller muscles

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.780 
strengthen the smaller muscles
surrounding<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.500> hips<00:02:10.739> responsible<00:02:11.580> for

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
surrounding the hips responsible for

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.840 
surrounding the hips responsible for
those<00:02:11.910> two<00:02:12.209> functions<00:02:12.480> that's<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.470> guys

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
those two functions that's it guys

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.580 
those two functions that's it guys
when<00:02:13.940> working<00:02:14.180> on<00:02:14.420> mobility<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.200> key<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.560> not

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
when working on mobility the key to not

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.740 
when working on mobility the key to not
wasting<00:02:16.280> your<00:02:16.400> time<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.270> focus<00:02:17.630> on

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
wasting your time is to focus on

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.900 
wasting your time is to focus on
movements<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.500> will<00:02:18.620> directly<00:02:19.130> translate

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
movements that will directly translate

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.090 
movements that will directly translate
into<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.450> lift<00:02:20.660> itself<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.620> that's<00:02:21.710> why<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:21.890> use

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
into the lift itself so that's why I use

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.830 
into the lift itself so that's why I use
variations<00:02:22.460> of<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.090> squat<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.510> actually

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
variations of the squat to actually

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.690 
variations of the squat to actually
strengthen<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.560> muscles<00:02:24.980> not<00:02:25.160> just<00:02:25.430> stretch

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
strengthen the muscles not just stretch

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.510 
strengthen the muscles not just stretch
them<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.020> directly<00:02:27.560> translates<00:02:28.250> into

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
them and so it directly translates into

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.490 
them and so it directly translates into
your<00:02:28.820> back<00:02:29.000> squat<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:30.020> both<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.260> these

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
your back squat so both of these

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.800 
your back squat so both of these
movements<00:02:31.070> are<00:02:31.220> accessory<00:02:31.850> exercises

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
movements are accessory exercises

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.990 
movements are accessory exercises
meaning<00:02:33.440> they're<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.800> be<00:02:33.920> done<00:02:34.160> after<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
meaning they're to be done after the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.060 
meaning they're to be done after the
heavy<00:02:35.180> lifting<00:02:35.750> make<00:02:36.230> sure<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.560> use<00:02:36.740> very

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
heavy lifting make sure you use very

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.400 
heavy lifting make sure you use very
light<00:02:37.310> weights<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:38.330> use<00:02:38.630> enough<00:02:39.020> resistance

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
light weights just use enough resistance

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.680 
light weights just use enough resistance
to<00:02:39.920> strengthen<00:02:40.490> stabilization<00:02:41.360> in<00:02:41.540> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
to strengthen stabilization in the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.760 
to strengthen stabilization in the
proper<00:02:42.080> positions

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
proper positions

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.290 
proper positions
so<00:02:43.040> I'd<00:02:43.100> say<00:02:43.280> guys<00:02:43.460> like<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.910> video<00:02:44.120> support

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
so I'd say guys like the video support

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.940 
so I'd say guys like the video support
the<00:02:44.600> channel<00:02:44.840> subscribe<00:02:45.200> if<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.680> haven't
