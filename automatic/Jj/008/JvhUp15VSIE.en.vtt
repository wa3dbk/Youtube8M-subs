00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.000
 not 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.799
 hello my name is magali I am 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.420
 professional makeup artist and 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.150
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.070
 do an avatar makeup the material 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.150
 that you will need already started that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 will be small sponges brushes 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 of course always tracers these are 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.650
 high liner liquid that you 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.410
 allow to work very 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.410
 precisely and you will have materials 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.960
 watercolor it's called finally it's 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.120
 makeup face painting in celebration and 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.039
 a pair of false eyelashes and if you want 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.210
 push the character a little further 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.489
 in detail you can also 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.039
 to provide you with opticians 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.350
 lenses are either phosphorescent 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.359
 lenses that mimic the eyes of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.760
 cat so the first step this will be 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:59.299
 to apply with my sponge my 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.120
 paintings fez painting and I'm going 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.680
 tap gently work on 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.280
 all the face 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.280
 it's the backdrop 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 do not hesitate to work with two 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.500
 three different shades of blue for 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.960
 can create relief 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.860
 so there he if I just put a little bit of 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.720
 white in small movements all 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.490
 gently and work with little 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.180
 matter always using your 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.760
 sponge 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.090
 you will work your different 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.230
 hues to create the patterns if these are 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.080
 grooves you will be able 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.950
 work slowly if you want 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:52.080
 carve your nose a little bit 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.370
 use your navy blue knowing 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.670
 that the avatar is really inspired 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:03.300
 of the cat so we can find the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.740
 characteristics of the cat's face 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.080
 second step is now at 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.160
 brush we will work the stripes the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.160
 stripes with blue hand 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.090
 third step now i'm leaving to 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.160
 ornament so I'm going to put the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.540
 small white dots with a brush 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.630
 very very hungry you will start to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:38.020
 work your liquid eye liner and 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.020
 you will do your little point word 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.549
 with a new brush I'm going 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.260
 start drawing the nose version 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.260
 cats and lips in pink 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.110
 and to finish my makeup I'm going 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.960
 but two of a pair of false eyelashes 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.410
 to strengthen the look I'm going to put 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.730
 also rhinestones and I'm going to add to 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.730

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.320
