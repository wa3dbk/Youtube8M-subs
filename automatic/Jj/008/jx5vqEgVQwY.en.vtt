00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.280 

and<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.930> just<00:04:15.050> keeps<00:04:15.290> going<00:04:16.600> porous<00:04:17.600> another

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
and it just keeps going porous another

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.949 
and it just keeps going porous another
course<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:19.010> then<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.310> think<00:04:19.489> that's<00:04:19.669> in<00:04:20.030> so

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
course and then I think that's in so

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.650 
course and then I think that's in so
even<00:04:21.950> though<00:04:22.130> some<00:04:22.160> parts<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.120> course<00:04:23.360> was

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
even though some parts of the course was

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.090 
even though some parts of the course was
a<00:04:23.690> little<00:04:24.020> high<00:04:24.169> for<00:04:24.200> me<00:04:24.530> that's<00:04:24.680> basically

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
a little high for me that's basically

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.409 
a little high for me that's basically
how<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.340> song<00:04:25.550> goes

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
how the song goes

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.270 
how the song goes
it's<00:04:26.960> just<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.380> singing<00:04:27.590> more<00:04:27.889> progression

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
it's just a singing more progression

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.990 
it's just a singing more progression
over<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:29.210> over

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
over and over

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.940 
over and over
and<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.840> know<00:04:31.930> that's<00:04:32.140> how<00:04:32.620> some<00:04:32.830> people

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
and you know that's how some people

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.610 
and you know that's how some people
learn<00:04:33.940> how<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.120> write<00:04:34.360> songs<00:04:34.660> is<00:04:34.960> they<00:04:35.470> just

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
learn how to write songs is they just

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.790 
learn how to write songs is they just
pick<00:04:36.220> a<00:04:36.430> chord<00:04:36.880> progression<00:04:36.970> that<00:04:37.630> sounds<00:04:38.140> and

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
pick a chord progression that sounds and

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.690 
pick a chord progression that sounds and
apparently<00:04:39.670> destiny<00:04:40.180> was<00:04:40.540> playing<00:04:40.810> with<00:04:40.960> this

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
apparently destiny was playing with this

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:52.500 
apparently destiny was playing with this
progression<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:44.730> just<00:04:45.730> started<00:04:51.300> I'm<00:04:52.300> sure

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
progression and just started I'm sure

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.390 
progression and just started I'm sure
they<00:04:52.660> just<00:04:52.720> did<00:04:53.230> that<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:56.320> then<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:57.070> chorus

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
they just did that and then the chorus

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.010 
they just did that and then the chorus
part<00:04:57.640> even<00:04:58.270> though<00:04:58.360> it's<00:04:58.480> played<00:04:58.690> with<00:04:58.720> the

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
part even though it's played with the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.620 
part even though it's played with the
same<00:04:59.260> chord<00:04:59.980> progression<00:05:00.240> they<00:05:01.240> just<00:05:01.450> sing<00:05:01.600> it

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
same chord progression they just sing it

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.090 
same chord progression they just sing it
differently<00:05:02.140> you<00:05:02.380> know<00:05:02.560> you<00:05:02.620> can<00:05:02.920> find

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
differently you know you can find

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.960 
differently you know you can find
different<00:05:03.420> verses<00:05:04.420> or<00:05:04.660> different<00:05:05.020> courses<00:05:05.970> to

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
different verses or different courses to

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.530 
different verses or different courses to
sing<00:05:07.240> differently<00:05:08.310> so<00:05:09.310> it's<00:05:09.550> it's<00:05:09.970> just<00:05:10.210> you

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
sing differently so it's it's just you

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.570 
sing differently so it's it's just you
know<00:05:10.630> being<00:05:10.870> creative<00:05:11.290> with<00:05:11.320> your<00:05:11.580> vocal

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
know being creative with your vocal

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.380 
know being creative with your vocal
melody<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:14.020> still<00:05:14.950> keeping<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.700> same<00:05:15.970> chord

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
melody and still keeping the same chord

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.160 
melody and still keeping the same chord
progression<00:05:16.480> over<00:05:17.140> and<00:05:17.500> over<00:05:17.800> works<00:05:18.420> so<00:05:19.420> maybe

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
progression over and over works so maybe

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.750 
progression over and over works so maybe
some<00:05:20.440> of<00:05:20.470> you<00:05:20.650> who<00:05:20.830> are<00:05:20.920> trying<00:05:21.310> to<00:05:21.430> you<00:05:21.700> know

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
some of you who are trying to you know

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.300 
some of you who are trying to you know
write<00:05:21.970> your<00:05:22.090> own<00:05:22.240> songs<00:05:22.570> maybe<00:05:22.870> that's<00:05:23.110> the

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
write your own songs maybe that's the

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.470 
write your own songs maybe that's the
simplest<00:05:24.310> way<00:05:24.370> to<00:05:24.490> get<00:05:24.760> started<00:05:24.970> it's<00:05:25.240> just<00:05:25.390> to

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
simplest way to get started it's just to

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.080 
simplest way to get started it's just to
play<00:05:25.660> a<00:05:25.690> simple<00:05:26.680> chord<00:05:27.130> progression<00:05:27.190> like

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
play a simple chord progression like

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.970 
play a simple chord progression like
