from<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> second<00:00:39.480> generation<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.710> we

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
from the second generation is when we

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.560 
from the second generation is when we
got<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.190> after<00:00:41.460> yet<00:00:41.640> another<00:00:41.879> time<00:00:42.210> skip

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
we got to see assam honoring his fallen

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.270

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.260 
but i thought that one of the great
scenes<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> end<00:01:11.430> was<00:01:11.610> when<00:01:11.790> flit<00:01:12.060> was

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.880 
scenes at the end was when flit was
pulling<00:01:12.570> off<00:01:12.689> his<00:01:12.900> coup<00:01:13.080> d'etat<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.530> ended<00:01:13.830> up

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
pulling off his coup d'etat and ended up

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.320 
pulling off his coup d'etat and ended up
purging<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.549> sorts<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> traitorous

like<00:03:05.310> from<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.730> anime<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.180> there<00:03:06.300> were<00:03:06.390> any

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
like from the anime that there were any

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.450 
like from the anime that there were any
modifications<00:03:07.350> whatsoever<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.100> normal

modifications whatsoever to the normal
but<00:03:08.910> anyway<00:03:09.210> I'm<00:03:09.360> sure<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.840> could<00:03:09.990> go

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
but anyway I'm sure that you could go

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.900 
but anyway I'm sure that you could go
ahead<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.380> add<00:03:10.530> your<00:03:10.740> own<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.520> wonder<00:03:11.790> if

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
ahead and add your own and I wonder if

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.460 
ahead and add your own and I wonder if
Bandar<00:03:12.210> is<00:03:12.240> going<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.720> release<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.260> and

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
Bandar is going to release it and

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.690 
Bandar is going to release it and
whether<00:03:13.710> they<00:03:13.860> would<00:03:14.010> have<00:03:14.160> throw<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.580> any

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
whether they would have throw on any

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.880 
whether they would have throw on any
extras<00:03:15.210> or<00:03:15.330> things<00:03:15.510> like<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.620> suppose

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
extras or things like that and I suppose

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.650 
extras or things like that and I suppose
that<00:03:16.920> begs<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.400> question<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:17.880> if<00:03:18.300> he<00:03:18.480> had<00:03:18.630> a

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
that begs the question that if he had a

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.480 
that begs the question that if he had a
year<00:03:18.960> off<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.200> he<00:03:19.530> painted<00:03:19.890> this<00:03:20.010> one<00:03:20.190> up<00:03:20.340> in

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
year off and he painted this one up in

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.640 
year off and he painted this one up in
white<00:03:20.700> with<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.330> double<00:03:21.690> bullet<00:03:21.990> also<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.620> a

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
white with a double bullet also have a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.650 
white with a double bullet also have a
white<00:03:22.980> variation<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.970> could<00:03:24.150> we<00:03:24.270> be<00:03:24.420> seeing

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
white variation and could we be seeing

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.770 
white variation and could we be seeing
that<00:03:24.870> somewhere<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.620> spin-off<00:03:25.920> some<00:03:26.370> time

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
that somewhere and a spin-off some time

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.880 
that somewhere and a spin-off some time

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.630 
Gundam is a very cool thing that Bend I
did<00:04:10.050> even<00:04:10.560> though<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:10.920> was<00:04:11.040> only<00:04:11.160> one<00:04:11.459> episode

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
did even though it was only one episode

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.940 
did even though it was only one episode
I<00:04:11.970> think<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.420> had<00:04:12.570> a<00:04:12.600> lot<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:12.959> impact<00:04:13.290> visually

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
I think it had a lot of impact visually

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.280 
I think it had a lot of impact visually
so<00:04:14.880> there<00:04:15.000> still<00:04:15.120> are<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.360> few<00:04:15.690> other<00:04:15.840> questions

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
so there still are a few other questions

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.599 
so there still are a few other questions
I<00:04:16.380> suppose<00:04:16.709> in<00:04:16.890> terms<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.250> painting

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
I suppose in terms of the painting

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.130 
I suppose in terms of the painting
details<00:04:18.000> like<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.359> mentioned<00:04:18.660> with<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.780> double

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
details like I mentioned with the double

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.360 
details like I mentioned with the double
bullet<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.590> how<00:04:19.739> are<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:19.920> supposed<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.220> do

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
bullet and how are you supposed to do

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.130 
bullet and how are you supposed to do
the<00:04:20.459> hyper<00:04:20.640> dogs<00:04:20.910> up<00:04:21.150> again<00:04:21.570> with<00:04:21.750> just<00:04:21.959> doing

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
the hyper dogs up again with just doing

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.750 
the hyper dogs up again with just doing
the<00:04:22.229> colour<00:04:22.380> swaps<00:04:22.680> putting<00:04:23.460> white<00:04:23.640> on

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
the colour swaps putting white on

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.159 
the colour swaps putting white on
instead<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.120> blue<00:04:24.330> just<00:04:24.690> seem<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.960> be<00:04:25.050> the

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
instead of blue just seem to be the

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.810 
instead of blue just seem to be the
easiest<00:04:25.500> but<00:04:25.800> then<00:04:25.919> again<00:04:26.010> it's<00:04:26.310> those<00:04:26.520> pink

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
easiest but then again it's those pink

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.250 
easiest but then again it's those pink
beams

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
beams

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.750 
beams
that<00:04:27.620> are<00:04:27.710> going<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:27.890> catch<00:04:28.040> your<00:04:28.190> eye<00:04:28.250> even

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
that are going to catch your eye even

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.140 
that are going to catch your eye even
more<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:29.180> against<00:04:30.050> that<00:04:30.110> white<00:04:30.380> backdrop<00:04:31.150> so

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
more so against that white backdrop so

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.400 
more so against that white backdrop so
to<00:04:32.210> do<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:32.510> whole<00:04:32.690> thing<00:04:32.870> up<00:04:32.990> here's<00:04:33.260> the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
to do this whole thing up here's the

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.200 
to do this whole thing up here's the
plates<00:04:33.650> basically<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.340> red<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:35.030> whole

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
plate of blue and then you basically

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.350 
plate of blue and then you basically
just<00:04:36.740> have<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.040> paint<00:04:37.310> up<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.550> third<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.330> a

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360
