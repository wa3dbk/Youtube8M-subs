as<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.900> protector<00:00:47.980> okay<00:00:52.780> now<00:00:53.780> let's<00:00:54.310> take<00:00:55.310> a

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
as a protector okay now let's take a

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.650 
as a protector okay now let's take a
look<00:00:55.670> at<00:00:56.470> this<00:00:57.470> phone

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:17.590 

so<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.380> screen<00:01:03.680> is<00:01:03.940> 4.7<00:01:04.940> inch

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.490 

and<00:01:17.720> it<00:01:18.530> is<00:01:18.710> um<00:01:19.150> HD<00:01:20.150> capacitive<00:01:20.470> with<00:01:21.470> a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
and it is um HD capacitive with a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
and it is um HD capacitive with a
definition<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.490> 1280<00:01:23.150> x<00:01:23.509> 720<00:01:24.140> pixel<00:01:24.950> display

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.940 

so<00:01:32.119> it<00:01:32.450> takes<00:01:32.719> pretty<00:01:33.109> short<00:01:33.350> time<00:01:33.530> for<00:01:33.799> turn

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
so it takes pretty short time for turn

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.630 
so it takes pretty short time for turn
on<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:36.380> cpu<00:01:36.859> is<00:01:38.049> mtk6589<00:01:39.049> quad-core<00:01:39.469> and<00:01:39.950> it

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
on the cpu is mtk6589 quad-core and it

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:49.539 
on the cpu is mtk6589 quad-core and it
runs<00:01:40.939> up<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.649> 1.2<00:01:42.649> gig<00:01:42.920> hurts<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.219> can<00:01:49.369> see

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
runs up to 1.2 gig hurts so you can see

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.149 
runs up to 1.2 gig hurts so you can see
is<00:01:49.700> pretty<00:01:49.969> fast<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:50.569> responsive<00:01:54.009> there<00:01:55.009> is

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
is pretty fast and responsive there is

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.090 
is pretty fast and responsive there is
this<00:01:55.280> little<00:01:55.520> panel<00:01:56.450> on<00:01:56.630> top<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:57.439> can<00:01:57.679> change

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
this little panel on top you can change

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.660 
this little panel on top you can change
your<00:01:58.280> setting<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:59.950> find<00:02:00.950> all<00:02:01.069> the<00:02:01.159> shortcut

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.380 

now<00:02:04.670> let's<00:02:05.149> try<00:02:06.220> antutu<00:02:07.220> benchmark<00:02:09.849> so<00:02:10.849> I<00:02:10.880> from

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
now let's try antutu benchmark so I from

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:28.430 
now let's try antutu benchmark so I from
score<00:02:11.750> as<00:02:12.459> you<00:02:13.459> can<00:02:13.610> see

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.190 

so<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.160> phone<00:02:29.370> has<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> memory<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.360> one<00:02:30.750> gig<00:02:30.990> ram

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
so the phone has a memory of one gig ram

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.690 
so the phone has a memory of one gig ram
and<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:32.100> eight<00:02:32.700> gig<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:33.420> ram<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:35.010> system<00:02:35.490> is

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
and a eight gig of ram the system is

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.140 
and a eight gig of ram the system is
Android<00:02:36.830> 4.1<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.160> mean<00:02:38.640> for<00:02:38.880> point-to-point

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
Android 4.1 I mean for point-to-point

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:52.530

one<00:02:39.690> jellybean

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.930 

oh<00:02:53.670> let's<00:02:54.670> see<00:02:54.849> thank<00:02:55.569> goodness

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.300 

since<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:00.840> sell<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.230> phone<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.710> all<00:03:01.950> over<00:03:02.190> the

since we sell the phone to all over the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.920 
since we sell the phone to all over the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:55.490 

something

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.830 

so<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.709> has<00:03:56.940> flash<00:03:57.940> as<00:03:58.480> well<00:03:59.049> as<00:03:59.290> autofocus

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
so it has flash as well as autofocus

so it has flash as well as autofocus
yeah<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:02.230> lighting<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.590> not<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.159> great<00:04:03.370> here

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
yeah the lighting is not that great here

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.820 
yeah the lighting is not that great here
but<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:07.750> can<00:04:07.900> see<00:04:08.110> it<00:04:08.230> takes<00:04:08.349> pretty<00:04:08.650> good

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
but you can see it takes pretty good

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.150 
but you can see it takes pretty good
though

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.150 

the<00:04:14.760> there's<00:04:15.510> another<00:04:15.780> camera<00:04:16.650> at<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.860> front

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
the there's another camera at the front

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.240 
the there's another camera at the front
so<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.670> front<00:04:18.150> camera<00:04:18.480> is<00:04:18.570> 5<00:04:19.110> megapixel<00:04:20.100> and

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
the one at the back which I took just

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:50.030

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.220 

so<00:05:11.710> let<00:05:11.860> me<00:05:11.890> turn<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.310> volume<00:05:12.640> all<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.850> way<00:05:13.150> up

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
so let me turn the volume all the way up

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.100 
so let me turn the volume all the way up
so<00:05:14.230> you<00:05:14.290> can<00:05:14.470> hear<00:05:14.710> how<00:05:14.770> loud<00:05:15.420> the<00:05:16.420> volume<00:05:16.870> can

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
so you can hear how loud the volume can

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:48.040 
so you can hear how loud the volume can
go<00:05:17.230> up<00:05:17.440> to
