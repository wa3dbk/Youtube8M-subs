 free attack 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.939
 it's dirty it's really dirty are 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.140
 being remy cabella remy cabella i 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.880
 loved on the interview me i love 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.930
 I love I got a little bit 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.909
 asleep but hey I still listen 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.930
 the essential is pretty much what I have 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.100
 understood is that his dream this guy 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.390
 had they been marseille 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.090
 he dreamed of playing marseille as 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.320
 full of players who dream late on the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.619
 late to play marseille in fact the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.640
 guys 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.170
 as soon as he was able to leave 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.570
 montpellier what did he do there 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 went to Marseilles but passing 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.140
 by newcastle because it's life it's the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.030
 new wade app that is 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.000
 yet very quickly and traffic jams 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.000
 give you a bis route that goes through 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.310
 ducasse high schools smart but the habit 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.979
 it's newcastle sequana but newcastle 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.450
 stopped here in my opinion it must roll 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.860
 super good because everyone passes 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.780
 by newcastle to go anywhere 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.119
 to go to paris saint germain for 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.079
 go to lyon to go to rome that passes 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.490
 by newcastle 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.259
 in my opinion it must be a mahut road 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.990
 do not see him a great thing 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.070
 so congratulations monaco then monaco it's not 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.530
 of business 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.120
 a proof me i watched vasilyev 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.520

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.020
 make up there for the team the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.540
 coppola in the bus david 11 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.729
 million levin defense 25 million 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.289
 middle bernard feel millions and in 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.400
 attack I believe there is david 35 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.780
 millions here are fingers and everything all to 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.150
 do the yoyo and tony scott 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.160
 yes it is obviously still the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.330
 season not speak and so what in 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.530
 same time the club's recipes 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.480
 gerenton said yeah why are they selling 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.740
 the players the guys why excuse 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.300
 me the recipes of the club with the fair 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.860
 play I remember that last year 11 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.480
 jerseys sold including 7 to guys from the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.040
 reserve for their personal use 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.330
 five louis ii subscriptions including one for 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.070
 the prince who pays his place now 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.300
 still know that not only do they 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.680
 sell the players but you also know 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.590
 that you can rent black players 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.290
 on behalf of a bar mitzvah wedding you can 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.790
 to have my guitar in the back he goes for 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.709
 the for toulalan day for example 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.850
 800 euros they play at the canasta 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.940
 with your grandmother at the house of 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.940
 retirement 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.780
 I rented carvalho and mourinho for 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.280
 I make the lmr hyper nice it benefits 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.350
 the long street for the granular scorn 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.019
 so all that and all that helps 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.610
 to put the club I think we give 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.769
 too much we ask for 3 monaco 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.000
 we want them to win tonight said 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.130
 yes because it would allow France 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.750
 to pass in front of Portugal at the dcf a 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.430
 given that would be completely like 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.989
 monaco the one that Portuguese go when 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.220
 not even tried to kiss the Portuguese 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.799
 to get past the Portuguese 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.610
 and then somehow I mean 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.000
 normally points 1 6 and 1 of 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.410
 Monaco 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.360
 they should go to Portugal or so 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.100
 better because because the club gets 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.170
 watched the club of Monaco is owned 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.829
 so he's in monaco he's owned by 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.390
 a Russian 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.980
 it is managed by Portuguese and 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.470
 it's France that picks up the points 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.209
 the uefa excuse me I shot yesterday must 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.630
 send it to negotiate with angela 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.880
 merkel 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.560
 the guy he strangely is nothing 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.480
 by sealing this club and picking up 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.520
 points then I say bravo thiriet 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.510
 bravo and then anyway valence 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.150
 frankly we have our chances 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.870
 because I valence me I think that 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.790
 It's not terrible 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.990
 1 I spent my holidays in the Drôme 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.200
 yeah to football, we must not forget that 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.730
 some announce rightly it's true 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.620
 but even kind by the listened but as 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.300
 I say yes or no it was not the 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.190
 Armenians of Valencia surely do not have 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:11.090
 Armenians have fucked it's since the 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:11.090
 know all thank you eric j
