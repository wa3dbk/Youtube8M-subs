particularly at a younger age and take
them<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> all<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> big<00:00:31.890> fan<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> Oz<00:00:32.279> take<00:00:32.520> I

them to all on the big fan of Oz take I

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.250 
them to all on the big fan of Oz take I

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
think it's a great game I think it's the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.810 
think it's a great game I think it's the
future<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.680> rugby<00:00:35.040> league<00:00:35.190> me<00:00:35.370> personally<00:00:35.790> I

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
future of rugby league me personally I

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.660 
future of rugby league me personally I
think<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> replace<00:00:37.250> from<00:00:38.250> sevens

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
think it's going to replace from sevens

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.590 
think it's going to replace from sevens
through<00:00:38.850> two<00:00:38.969> twelves<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.329> think<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.510> would

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
through two twelves I think it would

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
through two twelves I think it would
make<00:00:39.719> sense<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.050> replace<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.160> restructure

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
make sense to replace and restructure

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.090 
make sense to replace and restructure
