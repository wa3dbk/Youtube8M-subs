00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
getting when you get this but this is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.510 
getting when you get this but this is
299<00:01:48.780> i<00:01:48.930> believe<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.500> mac<00:01:49.770> app<00:01:50.009> store<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
299 i believe on the mac app store and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.270 
299 i believe on the mac app store and
it<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.720> great<00:01:51.840> value<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.710> i<00:01:52.740> would

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
it is a really great value so i would

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.770 
it is a really great value so i would
definitely<00:01:53.310> recommend<00:01:53.820> checking<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.600> out

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
definitely recommend checking this out

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.560 
definitely recommend checking this out
it's<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.320> really<00:01:55.860> great<00:01:56.040> app<00:01:56.250> um<00:01:56.670> as<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.360> right

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
it's a really great app um as of right

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.120 
it's a really great app um as of right
now<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.469> gameplay<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.270> kind<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.329> limited

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
now the gameplay is kind of limited

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.560 
now the gameplay is kind of limited
there<00:02:02.130> isn't<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> lot<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.149> really<00:02:03.420> do

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
there isn't a lot you can really do

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.120 
there isn't a lot you can really do
there's<00:02:03.780> no<00:02:03.899> highscores<00:02:04.140> anything<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.979> there

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
there's no highscores anything and there

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.930 
there's no highscores anything and there

is on the iOS I assume we'll see that in
updates<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.179> future<00:02:09.860> I'm<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.430> showing

this<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.730> now<00:02:16.659> we<00:02:17.290> start<00:02:17.469> my<00:02:17.650> hand<00:02:17.859> here<00:02:18.989> so

bit more of a 3d look and I already lost

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.789 
bit more of a 3d look and I already lost
of<00:02:29.799> all<00:02:29.950> that's<00:02:30.310> nice<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:35.079> know<00:02:35.200> if<00:02:35.560> they

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
are pretty much all the same diff

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.640 
are pretty much all the same diff
different<00:02:37.299> board<00:02:37.510> that's<00:02:37.930> pretty<00:02:38.170> much<00:02:38.379> any

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
different board that's pretty much any

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.729 
different board that's pretty much any
difference<00:02:39.069> kinda<00:02:39.849> what<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.090> prefer<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.780> like

difference kinda what you prefer I like
the<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.709> Wild<00:02:44.980> West<00:02:45.099> versions<00:02:45.579> and

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
the I like the Wild West versions and

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.839 
the I like the Wild West versions and
ask<00:02:46.090> myself<00:02:46.680> hey<00:02:47.680> that's<00:02:47.859> because<00:02:48.099> what<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.310> is

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
ask myself hey that's because what I is

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.149 
ask myself hey that's because what I is
what<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.060> played<00:02:49.299> beginning<00:02:49.930> but<00:02:50.889> that's

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
what I played beginning but that's

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.490 
what I played beginning but that's
probably<00:02:51.459> just<00:02:51.609> me<00:02:51.989> we're<00:02:52.989> going<00:02:53.139> to<00:02:53.200> try<00:02:53.439> the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
probably just me we're going to try the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.690 
probably just me we're going to try the
other<00:02:54.510> level<00:02:55.510> here<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.590> level<00:02:56.919> but<00:02:56.950> game

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
other level here on that level but game

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.140 
other level here on that level but game
board<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.569> is<00:02:58.750> jungle<00:02:59.019> style<00:02:59.939> yeah<00:03:00.939> this

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
board and that is jungle style yeah this

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.550 
board and that is jungle style yeah this
is<00:03:01.269> probably<00:03:01.450> my<00:03:01.629> least<00:03:01.780> favorite<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.349> all<00:03:02.500> of

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
is probably my least favorite of all of

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.809 
is probably my least favorite of all of
them<00:03:02.760> because<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:03.819> don't<00:03:03.969> want<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.209> animals

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
them because I don't want the animals

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.610 
them because I don't want the animals
the<00:03:06.819> graphics<00:03:07.060> are<00:03:07.329> just<00:03:07.870> quite<00:03:08.169> as<00:03:08.260> good<00:03:08.409> that

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
the graphics are just quite as good that

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.770 
the graphics are just quite as good that
that's<00:03:08.829> mainly<00:03:09.189> why<00:03:09.519> I<00:03:09.819> was<00:03:10.359> just<00:03:10.480> shorten

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
that's mainly why I was just shorten

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.170 
that's mainly why I was just shorten
what<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.989> animals<00:03:11.349> then<00:03:11.819> you<00:03:12.819> know<00:03:12.909> you<00:03:13.030> can

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
what the animals then you know you can

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.170 
what the animals then you know you can
see<00:03:13.329> little<00:03:13.419> bit<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.659> pixilation<00:03:14.139> in<00:03:14.409> the<00:03:14.530> I

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
see little bit of pixilation in the I

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
see little bit of pixilation in the I
don't<00:03:16.180> know<00:03:16.359> what<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.540> call<00:03:16.629> it<00:03:16.840> there<00:03:17.079> to

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
don't know what you call it there to

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.319 
don't know what you call it there to
push<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.680> ball<00:03:17.829> can't<00:03:18.819> think<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.030> any<00:03:19.180> right

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
push the ball can't think of any right

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.119 
push the ball can't think of any right
now<00:03:19.449> but<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:20.229> guess<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:20.620> made<00:03:20.769> up<00:03:20.919> for<00:03:21.099> that

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
now but I guess it's made up for that

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.920 
now but I guess it's made up for that
you<00:03:21.400> have<00:03:21.489> all<00:03:21.669> these<00:03:21.819> 3d<00:03:22.120> ladders<00:03:22.599> and<00:03:22.810> that

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
you have all these 3d ladders and that

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.680 
you have all these 3d ladders and that
little<00:03:23.079> 3d<00:03:23.530> character<00:03:24.069> right<00:03:24.220> there<00:03:24.459> both<00:03:25.299> so

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
little 3d character right there both so

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.649 
little 3d character right there both so
I<00:03:25.720> think<00:03:26.049> that<00:03:26.319> really<00:03:26.349> makes<00:03:26.680> up<00:03:26.889> for<00:03:27.159> the

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
I think that really makes up for the

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.689 
I think that really makes up for the
somewhat<00:03:28.659> poor<00:03:28.900> graphics<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.590> couple<00:03:30.519> of<00:03:30.579> the

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
somewhat poor graphics a couple of the

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.030 
somewhat poor graphics a couple of the
elements<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.329> little<00:03:32.260> bit<00:03:32.349> pixelated<00:03:32.739> but

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
elements a little bit pixelated but

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.030 
elements a little bit pixelated but
again<00:03:33.819> i'm<00:03:33.970> pretty<00:03:34.299> sure<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:34.659> is<00:03:34.720> full<00:03:35.349> 1920

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
again i'm pretty sure this is full 1920

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.059 
again i'm pretty sure this is full 1920

store<00:04:18.759> apps<00:04:19.120> they<00:04:19.419> really<00:04:19.720> tend<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.229> run<00:04:20.549> low

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549
