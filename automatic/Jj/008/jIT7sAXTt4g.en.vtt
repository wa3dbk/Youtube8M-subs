a<00:01:53.340> chance<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.790> work<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.299> them<00:01:54.540> as

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
a chance to work with them as

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.139 
a chance to work with them as
technologies<00:01:55.710> evolve<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.520> evolve<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:57.119> it

when the iphone first appeared it was

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.069 
when the iphone first appeared it was
like<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> spaceship<00:02:05.460> from<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.850> future<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.479> so

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
like a spaceship from the future and so

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.380 
like a spaceship from the future and so
it's<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> same<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:07.890> robots<00:02:08.399> or<00:02:08.729> artificial

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
