all about intuitive f2l look ahead so
this<00:00:19.890> video<00:00:20.279> will<00:00:20.520> basically<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:21.210> be<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this video will basically just be a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.009 
this video will basically just be a
bunch<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.810> example<00:00:22.470> solves<00:00:22.859> me<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.369> through

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
bunch of example solves me going through

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.560 
bunch of example solves me going through
how<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.050> look<00:00:25.529> ahead<00:00:25.710> effectively<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.240> I'll

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
how to look ahead effectively so I'll

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.259 
how to look ahead effectively so I'll
just<00:00:27.599> go<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> first<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.880> okay<00:00:29.880> so

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
just go right to the first one okay so

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.690 
just go right to the first one okay so
now<00:00:30.539> we're<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> first

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
now we're just going to do the first

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.639 
now we're just going to do the first
example<00:00:32.850> solve<00:00:33.390> now<00:00:34.050> great<00:00:34.559> practice<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.309> to

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
example solve now great practice is to

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.350 
example solve now great practice is to
try<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.100> without<00:00:38.340> hesitating<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.180> at

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
try to do this without hesitating go at

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.060 
try to do this without hesitating go at
a<00:00:39.390> slow<00:00:39.870> enough<00:00:40.110> pace<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.770> can't

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
a slow enough pace so that you can't

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.569 
a slow enough pace so that you can't
hesitate<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:43.500> I'll<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.370> right<00:00:44.520> now

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
hesitate so I'll just do that right now

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.650 
hesitate so I'll just do that right now
so<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.510> see<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.960> corner<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.590> edge<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> i

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
so I see this corner on this edge so i

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.100 
so I see this corner on this edge so i
pair<00:00:49.200> them<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.860> also<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.110> corner

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
pair them up I also see this corner

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.779 
pair them up I also see this corner
right<00:00:52.260> here<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.710> I'm<00:00:52.920> doing<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.550> its

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
right here as I'm doing this and its

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.270 
right here as I'm doing this and its
edge<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.829> I'm<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> go

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
edge is right here so I'm going to go

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.090 
edge is right here so I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.730> set<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:58.289> do<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.890> also

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
ahead and set them up and do this I also

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.860 
ahead and set them up and do this I also
see<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.579> corner<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.149> edge<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.690> i'm

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
see this corner of this edge as i'm

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
see this corner of this edge as i'm
doing<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.260> i'm<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> go<00:01:02.520> ahead<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
doing this i'm going to go ahead and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.539 
doing this i'm going to go ahead and
solve<00:01:03.180> those<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.339> then<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> also

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
solve those right now and then I also

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.050 
solve those right now and then I also
see<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.970> corner<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:06.630> here<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.700> I<00:01:08.700> noticed

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
see this corner right here and I noticed

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.679 
see this corner right here and I noticed
i<00:01:09.330> paired<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.170> edge<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:11.689> but

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
i paired up with this edge as well but

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.620 
i paired up with this edge as well but
when<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.860> unfair<00:01:14.630> so

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
when I do this it's going to unfair so

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.740 
when I do this it's going to unfair so
where's<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> pair<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.390> bring<00:01:18.540> in

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
where's the pair of them up and bring in

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.160 
where's the pair of them up and bring in
it<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> that's<00:01:20.220> good<00:01:20.610> practice<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.720> look

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it so that's good practice for a look

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.850 
it so that's good practice for a look
ahead<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:23.100> we'll<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.790> solver<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.860> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
ahead then we'll just do solver to of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.499 
ahead then we'll just do solver to of
into<00:01:26.670> f2l<00:01:27.479> solver<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:29.400> normal<00:01:30.030> pace<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.450> you

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
into f2l solver to a normal pace so you

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.710 
into f2l solver to a normal pace so you
guys<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.229> what<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:32.030> ok<00:01:33.030> so

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
guys can see what you have to do ok so

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.940 
guys can see what you have to do ok so
when<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.250> full<00:01:35.430> speed<00:01:35.750> what<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.049> it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
when going at full speed what it's it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.219 
when going at full speed what it's it
can<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.430> difficult<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:39.180> first<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.840> what

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
can be difficult at first because what

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.530 
can be difficult at first because what
you<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:41.150> assuming<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.180> you're<00:01:42.390> not

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
you have to do assuming that you're not

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.200 
you have to do assuming that you're not
color<00:01:42.810> neutral<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:44.399> should<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.939> just

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
color neutral you should have to just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.710 
color neutral you should have to just
look<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.689> blurs<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.439> white<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.149> as<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.509> see

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
look for blurs of white and as you see

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.359 
look for blurs of white and as you see
the<00:01:48.899> blurs<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.380> what<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> notice<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the blurs of what you have to notice the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.280 
the blurs of what you have to notice the
other<00:01:50.549> colors<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.570> you're<00:01:51.780> solving<00:01:51.990> them

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
other colors and as you're solving them

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.819 
other colors and as you're solving them
you<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.790> your<00:01:53.790> f2l<00:01:54.270> slot<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.439> be

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you have to your f2l slot you have to be

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.679 
you have to your f2l slot you have to be
looking<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> next<00:01:56.610> edge<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.060> well<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.479> it

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
looking for the next edge as well so it

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.520 
looking for the next edge as well so it
can<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> little<00:01:58.200> tricky<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:59.670> um<00:02:00.350> we'll<00:02:01.350> go

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
can be a little tricky but um we'll go

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.100 
can be a little tricky but um we'll go
for<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.890> or<00:02:02.009> go<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> little<00:02:02.430> slowly<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.719> i<00:02:03.750> have

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
for it or go a little slowly so i have

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.649 
for it or go a little slowly so i have
this<00:02:04.140> edge<00:02:04.670> corner<00:02:05.670> right<00:02:05.790> here<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.119> this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
this edge corner right here and this

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.369 
this edge corner right here and this
edge<00:02:06.899> back<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.989> see<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:10.349> i

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
edge back here so as you can see here i

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.570 
edge back here so as you can see here i
go<00:02:10.739> ahead

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
go ahead

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.060 
go ahead
I<00:02:11.670> solve<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.420> i<00:02:12.630> notice<00:02:12.960> to<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.350> corner<00:02:13.680> in

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
I solve this i notice to this corner in

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.390 
I solve this i notice to this corner in
this<00:02:14.250> edge<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.700> not<00:02:18.000> normal<00:02:18.210> speakers

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
this edge so this is not normal speakers

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.380 
this edge so this is not normal speakers
this<00:02:20.400> corner<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.000> edge<00:02:21.740> this<00:02:22.740> corner<00:02:23.730> and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
this corner of this edge this corner and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.870 
this corner of this edge this corner and
