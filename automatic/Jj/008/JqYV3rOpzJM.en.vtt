about it is that there's three types of
fat<00:01:15.500> there's<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.770> fat<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.189> sort<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.520> like

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
fat there's the fat that sort of like

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.880 
fat there's the fat that sort of like
padding<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.329> our<00:01:18.450> body<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.649> got

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
padding for our body right so you got

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.679 
padding for our body right so you got
padding<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.610> between<00:01:20.759> your<00:01:21.030> organs<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
padding like in between your organs and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.389 
padding like in between your organs and
your<00:01:21.810> joints<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.350> type<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> thing<00:01:22.829> and

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
your joints on this type of thing and

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.010 
your joints on this type of thing and
there's<00:01:23.640> your<00:01:23.820> immediate<00:01:24.270> reserve<00:01:24.630> fats

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
there's your immediate reserve fats

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
there's your immediate reserve fats
which<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:26.070> body<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.460> use<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.969> miss<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
which your body can use if you miss a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.410 
which your body can use if you miss a
meal<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:27.540> two<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.310> burns<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
meal or two and it burns that up to you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.880 
meal or two and it burns that up to you
know<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.689> keep<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.380> then

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
know just keep you going and then

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.020 
know just keep you going and then
there's<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.159> third<00:01:32.340> type<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.549> fat<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:33.000> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
there's a third type of fat which is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.350 
there's a third type of fat which is
abnormal<00:01:33.960> fat<00:01:34.380> deposits<00:01:35.070> that's<00:01:35.640> fat<00:01:35.969> that<00:01:36.210> we

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
abnormal fat deposits that's fat that we

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.020 
abnormal fat deposits that's fat that we
do<00:01:36.539> not<00:01:36.750> need<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.409> abnormal<00:01:38.219> and<00:01:38.399> that's

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
do not need it's abnormal and that's

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.670 
do not need it's abnormal and that's
what<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> simians<00:01:39.780> protocol<00:01:40.229> gets<00:01:40.469> rid<00:01:40.649> of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
what the simians protocol gets rid of
