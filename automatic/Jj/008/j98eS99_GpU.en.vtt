much work to it to make it work and it

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.690 
much work to it to make it work and it
may<00:03:47.120> only<00:03:47.270> last<00:03:47.540> one<00:03:47.900> or<00:03:48.050> two<00:03:48.080> years<00:03:48.500> just<00:03:48.710> not

may only last one or two years just not

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.180 
may only last one or two years just not
worth<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.750> time<00:03:53.440> swept<00:03:54.440> my<00:03:54.650> little<00:03:54.920> tour<00:03:55.160> of

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
worth the time swept my little tour of

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.560 
worth the time swept my little tour of
the<00:03:56.140> greenhouse<00:03:57.140> or<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.530> remnants<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.130> I

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
the greenhouse or the remnants of it I

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.060 
the greenhouse or the remnants of it I
decided<00:03:59.570> that<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.990> Harbor<00:04:00.500> Freight<00:04:00.650> wasn't

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
decided that the Harbor Freight wasn't

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.180 
decided that the Harbor Freight wasn't
for<00:04:01.220> me<00:04:01.310> it<00:04:01.990> wasn't<00:04:02.990> big<00:04:03.230> enough<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.770> I<00:04:03.980> didn't

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
for me it wasn't big enough and I didn't

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.910 
for me it wasn't big enough and I didn't
think<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.460> would<00:04:04.550> be<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.970> last<00:04:05.560> even<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.650> year

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
think it would be the last even a year

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.280 
think it would be the last even a year
so<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:08.000> chief<00:04:08.210> price<00:04:08.420> really<00:04:08.810> wasn't<00:04:09.080> worth

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
so the chief price really wasn't worth

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.750 
so the chief price really wasn't worth
it

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
it

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.490 
it
I've<00:04:10.760> since<00:04:11.000> found<00:04:11.060> on<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.510> Internet<00:04:11.990> people

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
I've since found on the Internet people

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.940 
I've since found on the Internet people
that<00:04:12.590> have<00:04:12.710> modified<00:04:13.190> them<00:04:13.370> building<00:04:14.950> wood

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
that have modified them building wood

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.550 
that have modified them building wood
covers<00:04:16.850> for<00:04:17.090> Omen<00:04:17.420> and<00:04:18.080> everything<00:04:18.380> like<00:04:18.530> that

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
covers for Omen and everything like that

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.349 
covers for Omen and everything like that
and<00:04:18.770> it<00:04:19.040> would<00:04:19.130> have<00:04:19.280> just<00:04:19.400> cost<00:04:19.670> too<00:04:19.880> much<00:04:19.940> I

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
and it would have just cost too much I

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.890 
and it would have just cost too much I
mean<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.140> would<00:04:21.230> have<00:04:21.320> cost<00:04:21.500> as<00:04:22.100> much<00:04:22.160> as<00:04:22.900> the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
mean it would have cost as much as the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.240 
mean it would have cost as much as the
next

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250

enough<00:06:11.200> right<00:06:12.200> here<00:06:12.440> I<00:06:12.730> can<00:06:13.730> make<00:06:13.880> a<00:06:13.910> human<00:06:15.160> and

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
enough right here I can make a human and

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.900 
enough right here I can make a human and
actually<00:06:17.090> I<00:06:17.390> can<00:06:17.960> cool<00:06:18.140> it<00:06:18.200> off<00:06:18.440> two<00:06:18.740> two<00:06:19.730> ways

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
actually I can cool it off two two ways

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.090 
actually I can cool it off two two ways
to<00:06:20.030> do<00:06:20.090> that<00:06:20.240> okay<00:06:20.810> miss<00:06:21.620> Deane<00:06:21.800> system<00:06:22.250> and<00:06:22.940> a

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
to do that okay miss Deane system and a

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.760 
to do that okay miss Deane system and a
swamp<00:06:25.100> cooler<00:06:25.280> or<00:06:25.730> an<00:06:25.820> evaporative<00:06:26.270> cooler

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
swamp cooler or an evaporative cooler

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.050 
swamp cooler or an evaporative cooler
the<00:06:27.770> way<00:06:27.860> those<00:06:28.100> work<00:06:28.280> is<00:06:28.430> they<00:06:28.550> have<00:06:28.670> pads

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
the way those work is they have pads

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.880 
the way those work is they have pads
that<00:06:29.390> trickle<00:06:29.960> water<00:06:30.140> down<00:06:30.380> and<00:06:30.650> then<00:06:30.770> they

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
that trickle water down and then they

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.560 
that trickle water down and then they
have<00:06:31.250> a<00:06:31.280> phantom<00:06:31.610> that<00:06:31.730> pulls<00:06:31.970> their<00:06:32.210> through

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
have a phantom that pulls their through

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.600 
have a phantom that pulls their through
and<00:06:33.080> they<00:06:33.140> throw<00:06:33.350> it<00:06:33.410> out<00:06:33.560> guess<00:06:34.220> what<00:06:34.340> that

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
and they throw it out guess what that

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.330 
and they throw it out guess what that
puts<00:06:34.850> out<00:06:35.000> a<00:06:35.030> lot<00:06:35.120> humidity<00:06:35.990> so<00:06:36.950> I<00:06:36.980> can<00:06:37.160> have<00:06:37.310> a

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
puts out a lot humidity so I can have a

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.880 
puts out a lot humidity so I can have a
fan<00:06:37.640> in<00:06:37.790> here<00:06:37.940> like<00:06:38.120> that<00:06:38.560> put<00:06:39.560> out<00:06:39.650> a<00:06:39.710> lot<00:06:39.830> of

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
fan in here like that put out a lot of

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.860 
fan in here like that put out a lot of
comity<00:06:40.220> and<00:06:40.370> cool<00:06:40.880> it<00:06:41.000> down<00:06:41.090> at<00:06:41.270> least<00:06:41.510> 10

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
comity and cool it down at least 10

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.950 
comity and cool it down at least 10
degrees<00:06:42.200> in<00:06:42.230> here<00:06:43.390> plants<00:06:44.390> usually<00:06:44.510> like<00:06:44.810> it

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
degrees in here plants usually like it

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.040 
degrees in here plants usually like it
around<00:06:45.340> 90<00:06:46.340> degrees<00:06:46.660> look<00:06:47.660> at<00:06:47.750> something

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
around 90 degrees look at something

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.010 
around 90 degrees look at something
about<00:06:48.230> a<00:06:48.260> hundred<00:06:48.650> here<00:06:48.830> in<00:06:48.950> Texas<00:06:49.310> I<00:06:50.020> could

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
about a hundred here in Texas I could

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.720 
about a hundred here in Texas I could
have<00:06:51.110> the<00:06:51.230> shade<00:06:51.440> up

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
listing systems

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.840 
listing systems
I'll<00:06:56.330> have<00:06:56.450> it<00:06:56.570> at<00:06:56.660> 90<00:06:56.990> degrees<00:06:57.290> with<00:06:58.040> 7080

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850 
I'll have it at 90 degrees with 7080

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:10.920 
I'll have it at 90 degrees with 7080
