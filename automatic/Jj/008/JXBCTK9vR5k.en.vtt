to<00:03:47.700> deteriorate<00:03:48.390> into<00:03:48.570> this

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.470 

the<00:03:53.600> driving<00:03:54.170> is<00:03:54.320> very<00:03:54.790> arcade-style<00:03:55.790> and

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
the driving is very arcade-style and

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.390 
the driving is very arcade-style and
while<00:03:56.660> it<00:03:56.840> plays<00:03:57.200> really<00:03:57.620> well<00:03:57.800> with<00:03:58.190> a

driving wheel in something like a place
seat<00:04:00.320> I<00:04:00.590> think<00:04:00.920> it's<00:04:01.340> probably<00:04:01.790> best<00:04:02.240> with<00:04:02.600> the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
seat I think it's probably best with the

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.040 
seat I think it's probably best with the
standard<00:04:03.650> controller<00:04:04.100> we're<00:04:04.370> watching<00:04:04.820> the

sadly<00:04:14.650> it's<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.830> more<00:04:16.040> challenging<00:04:16.340> racing

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
sadly it's a more challenging racing

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.699 
sadly it's a more challenging racing
game<00:04:17.390> than<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.630> lot<00:04:17.840> of<00:04:17.959> these<00:04:18.049> open-world

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.160 
game than a lot of these open-world
games<00:04:19.549> primarily<00:04:20.120> because<00:04:20.570> you're<00:04:20.959> going

the car sounds are really good and I

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.690 
the car sounds are really good and I
also<00:04:37.960> have<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.530> compliment<00:04:39.040> the<00:04:39.250> surround

of the speakers my only gripe is that

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.410 
of the speakers my only gripe is that
the<00:04:53.530> environment<00:04:54.130> all<00:04:54.280> kind<00:04:54.880> of<00:04:55.000> looks<00:04:55.240> the

the environment all kind of looks the
same<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:55.750> think<00:04:55.810> a<00:04:55.960> lot<00:04:56.110> of<00:04:56.140> these<00:04:56.290> open-world
