00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:03.478
 We're asked about the time on the screen. 

00:00:04.225 --> 00:00:07.343
 First we look at the scorpion, the short bar. 

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:09.668
 Scorpio tells us the time. 

00:00:11.113 --> 00:00:12.794
 The notch on the top is 12. 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.615
 Then 1, 

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:19.382
 2, 3, 4 

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:25.937
 it looks like Scorpio 4 is a bit past. Then we're on the 4th. 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.243
 It's 4 o'clock. 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.160
 Now we'il think of the minute. 

00:00:31.257 --> 00:00:34.972
 The minute hand bar will tell us in minutes. 

00:00:36.117 --> 00:00:37.372
 Every notch on the watch, 

00:00:37.846 --> 00:00:38.987
 Equal to 5 minutes. 

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:41.486
 We start with the notch on the hill, 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.692
 this is the 0 point. 

00:00:44.262 --> 00:00:47.229
 Next notch, 5 minutes. 

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:52.762
 The next notch is 10 minutes. Then clock 

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:54.387
 4 out of 10. 

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:58.085
 In other words 4.10. 

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:00.356
 Let's make some more examples. 

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:02.334
 What time is it? 

00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:04.667
 First we look at the scorpion. 

00:01:05.082 --> 00:01:06.512
 Short bar here, 

00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:08.509
 12, 1, 2, 3, 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.772
 4, 5, 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.015
 6, 7, 8, 9. 

00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:19.018
 Scorpion between 9 and 10. 

00:01:19.898 --> 00:01:22.136
 So we're still in 9th, 

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:23.987
 We have not yet arrived at the 10th hour. 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.711
 It starts at 9 o'clock and continues until the scorpion shows 10. 

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:33.138
 Now we have to find the minute. 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.196
 We will count from five to five. 

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:45.408
 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. 

00:01:45.768 --> 00:01:47.913
 It's 9.30. 

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:50.995
 You understand the humor of the job. 

00:01:51.902 --> 00:01:54.065
 We know it's 60 minutes in an hour. 

00:01:54.996 --> 00:01:57.617
 And the minute hand here is right in the middle of the clock. 

00:01:58.422 --> 00:01:59.523
 Half of 60 is 30. 

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:01.918
 Let's do one more. 

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:03.345
 What time is it? 

00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:04.751
 Let's count. 

00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:08.316
 Even this time, let's count backwards. 

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:10.566
 12, 11, 10. 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.624
 We're 10 hours now. 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.704
 Scorpion has passed 10, but it hasn't reached 11 yet. 

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:20.518
 Then we're on the 10th hour. 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.958
 Well, 

00:02:22.472 --> 00:02:24.147
 How many minutes has passed? 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.963
 0, 5, 10, 15, 20. 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.820
 The minute hand shows 20. 

00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:33.377
 So it's been 20 minutes. 

00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:35.905
 It's 10.20. 

00:02:37.158 --> 00:02:38.233
 So 

00:02:38.988 --> 00:02:39.999
 hour 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:41.815
 10 is 20.
