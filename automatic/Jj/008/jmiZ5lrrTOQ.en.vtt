not<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> notion<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.690> ornament<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:23.640> way<00:00:23.730> I'm

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
not a notion of ornament in the way I'm

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.359 
not a notion of ornament in the way I'm
discussing<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.780> is<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.200> really<00:00:25.650> different<00:00:26.190> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
discussing it is is really different and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.880 
discussing it is is really different and
that's<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.320> language<00:00:28.340> theory<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:29.699> postmodern

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
that's a language theory or postmodern

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
20th century is that of the linguistic

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.229 
20th century is that of the linguistic
terminus<00:00:45.840> that's<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.649> sure<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.460> if<00:00:47.790> we<00:00:48.030> just

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
terminus that's for sure so if we just

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.569 
terminus that's for sure so if we just
take<00:00:48.600> our<00:00:48.809> language<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:50.040> a<00:00:50.070> moment<00:00:50.430> and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
take our language for for a moment and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.080 
take our language for for a moment and
then<00:00:50.940> try<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:51.840> what<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.890> ornament<00:00:53.309> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
then try to think what what ornament is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.869 
then try to think what what ornament is
it<00:00:54.690> suddenly<00:00:55.649> becomes<00:00:56.070> much<00:00:56.489> more<00:00:56.820> difficult

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
it suddenly becomes much more difficult

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.590 
it suddenly becomes much more difficult
to<00:00:57.600> understand<00:00:59.059> first<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
to understand first we have to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.039 
to understand first we have to
understand<00:01:01.110> that<00:01:01.760> in<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.000> 19th<00:01:03.570> century

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
understand that in the 19th century

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.760 
understand that in the 19th century
there<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.469> like<00:01:04.680> two<00:01:05.309> people<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.360> two<00:01:06.840> trends

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
there was like two people to two trends

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.670 
there was like two people to two trends
solely<00:01:08.310> splitting<00:01:09.030> apart<00:01:09.290> they<00:01:10.290> were<00:01:10.350> both

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
solely splitting apart they were both

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.950 
solely splitting apart they were both
dealing<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.280> ornament<00:01:11.790> both<00:01:12.450> dealing<00:01:12.840> with

dealing with ornament both dealing with

dealing with ornament both dealing with
organ<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.740> was<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> group<00:01:14.540> around<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.890> famous

organ one was a group around the famous

organ one was a group around the famous
the<00:01:17.729> imitation<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.270> ornament<00:01:18.750> who<00:01:18.810> wrote<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the imitation of ornament who wrote the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.050 
the imitation of ornament who wrote the
grammar<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.650> ornament<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.369> Owen<00:01:20.790> Jones

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
grammar of ornament which is Owen Jones

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.410 
grammar of ornament which is Owen Jones
and<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.409> other<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.860> much<00:01:23.070> closer<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:24.180> John

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
and the other is much closer to to John

and the other is much closer to to John
Ruskin<00:01:24.689> which<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.200> William<00:01:25.530> Morris<00:01:26.240> now

Ruskin which is William Morris now

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.210 
Ruskin which is William Morris now
normally<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.260> think<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.710> they're

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
normally you would think like they're

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.219 
normally you would think like they're
very<00:01:29.400> close<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> Victorian<00:01:30.630> age<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
very close in the Victorian age and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
very close in the Victorian age and
that's<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.130> battle<00:01:32.760> between<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
that's just like a battle between the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.510 
that's just like a battle between the
state<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.750> Oxford<00:01:34.140> school<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.530> Ruskin<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.250> and

the South Kensington school of Jones but
it's<00:01:39.689> much<00:01:39.930> deeper<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.530> lot<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.280> people<00:01:41.580> have

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it's much deeper a lot of people have

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.270 
it's much deeper a lot of people have
actually<00:01:42.180> suggested<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.080> Owen<00:01:43.470> Jones<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
actually suggested that Owen Jones and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.580 
actually suggested that Owen Jones and
this<00:01:44.759> whole<00:01:45.030> notion<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.350> called

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
this whole notion of what is called

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.100 
this whole notion of what is called
tessellation<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.520> means<00:01:47.960> there's<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
tessellation that means there's a

tessellation that means there's a
there's<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:50.390> subdividing<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:52.200> surface<00:01:52.500> into

there's a subdividing of a surface into
a<00:01:53.460> pattern<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.689> there<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.560> pattern<00:01:55.860> of

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.630 

discussing<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.470> whole<00:02:22.680> notion<00:02:22.920> that

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
discussing this whole notion that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.620 
discussing this whole notion that
actually<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.269> basis<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.810> modernism<00:02:25.530> of

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
actually the basis of modernism of

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.630 
actually the basis of modernism of
modern<00:02:27.630> people<00:02:27.959> like<00:02:28.230> Mondrian<00:02:28.830> Malevich<00:02:29.400> is

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
modern people like Mondrian Malevich is

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.710 
modern people like Mondrian Malevich is
not<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.300> Cezanne<00:02:31.080> or<00:02:31.440> ammonia<00:02:32.160> or<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.849> actually

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
not in Cezanne or ammonia or in actually

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.630 
not in Cezanne or ammonia or in actually
the<00:02:33.870> fine<00:02:34.140> arts<00:02:34.620> but<00:02:35.130> actually<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.519> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
the fine arts but actually in the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.150 
the fine arts but actually in the
applied<00:02:35.970> arts<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:37.260> there's<00:02:37.560> met<00:02:37.920> they're

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
applied arts and if there's met they're

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.130 
applied arts and if there's met they're
very<00:02:38.459> good<00:02:38.670> arguments<00:02:39.299> for<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:39.840> from

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
very good arguments for that so from

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.670 
very good arguments for that so from
Owen<00:02:40.590> Jones<00:02:40.860> we<00:02:41.760> get<00:02:42.000> modernism<00:02:42.720> why<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.440> that

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
Owen Jones we get modernism why is that

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.070 
Owen Jones we get modernism why is that
because<00:02:43.980> we've<00:02:44.370> got<00:02:44.549> this<00:02:44.700> purified<00:02:45.569> notion

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
because we've got this purified notion

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.630 
because we've got this purified notion
of<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.350> object<00:02:46.769> it<00:02:46.950> becomes<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.519> pure<00:02:48.019> ordered

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
of the object it becomes a pure ordered

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.340 
of the object it becomes a pure ordered
informational<00:02:50.640> thing<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.660> perception

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
informational thing and the perception

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.650 
informational thing and the perception
of<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.920> what<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:53.610> preach<00:02:53.819> cause<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.299> sense

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
of it is what go preach cause the sense

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.479 
of it is what go preach cause the sense
of<00:02:54.930> order<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.830> imagine<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.340> you're

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
of order can you imagine so you're

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.699 
of order can you imagine so you're
looking<00:02:56.640> at<00:02:56.940> something<00:02:57.390> you're<00:02:57.540> not<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:58.019> you

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
looking at something you're not like you

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.620 
looking at something you're not like you
don't<00:02:58.950> feel<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.340> sense<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.970> beauty<00:03:00.269> you

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
don't feel you a sense of beauty you

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.809 
don't feel you a sense of beauty you
don't<00:03:00.840> feel<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.680> don't<00:03:01.890> feel<00:03:02.130> anything<00:03:02.430> it's

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
don't feel you don't feel anything it's

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.630 
don't feel you don't feel anything it's
just<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.380> recalculating<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.620> order<00:03:05.130> system

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
just like recalculating the order system

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.729 
just like recalculating the order system
it's<00:03:05.819> an<00:03:05.940> informational<00:03:06.720> notion<00:03:07.200> we<00:03:07.560> say

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
it's an informational notion we say

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.550 
it's an informational notion we say
conquer<00:03:08.160> stop<00:03:08.459> right<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.810> nightmare

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
conquer stop right this is a nightmare

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.220 
conquer stop right this is a nightmare
it<00:03:10.799> is<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.010> complete<00:03:11.370> nightmare<00:03:11.549> because<00:03:12.239> we<00:03:12.900> as

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
it is a complete nightmare because we as

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.979 
it is a complete nightmare because we as
feeling<00:03:13.829> bodies<00:03:14.280> as<00:03:14.489> esthetic<00:03:15.299> bodies<00:03:15.720> we're

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
feeling bodies as esthetic bodies we're

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.400 
feeling bodies as esthetic bodies we're
suddenly<00:03:16.320> forced<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.220> some<00:03:17.540> decode<00:03:18.540> this

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
suddenly forced to some decode this

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.560 
suddenly forced to some decode this
whole<00:03:19.650> thing<00:03:19.829> not<00:03:19.980> bothered<00:03:20.609> it<00:03:20.760> basically<00:03:21.299> as

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
whole thing not bothered it basically as

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.819 
whole thing not bothered it basically as
a<00:03:21.630> whole<00:03:22.079> is<00:03:22.380> based<00:03:22.739> on<00:03:23.070> that<00:03:23.310> right<00:03:24.350> so<00:03:25.350> my

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
a whole is based on that right so my

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.160 
a whole is based on that right so my
matter<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.400> ornament<00:03:26.910> actually<00:03:27.239> comes<00:03:27.660> from

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
matter of ornament actually comes from

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.860 
matter of ornament actually comes from
this<00:03:28.350> notion<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.859> mores<00:03:29.220> which<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.239> much<00:03:30.540> more

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
this notion of mores which is much more

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.050 
this notion of mores which is much more
complex<00:03:31.350> much<00:03:31.470> more<00:03:31.650> abundant<00:03:32.010> whining<00:03:32.940> about

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
complex much more abundant whining about

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.949 
complex much more abundant whining about
entangling<00:03:33.840> they<00:03:34.079> get<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.470> word<00:03:34.709> again<00:03:35.040> about

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
entangling they get the word again about

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.420 
entangling they get the word again about
interlacing<00:03:36.959> that's<00:03:37.319> this<00:03:37.470> whole<00:03:37.680> notion<00:03:38.040> of

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
interlacing that's this whole notion of

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.840 
interlacing that's this whole notion of
something<00:03:38.819> that<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.420> not<00:03:39.780> in<00:03:40.079> order

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
something that is not in order

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.370 
something that is not in order
that<00:03:41.850> doesn't<00:03:42.150> mean<00:03:42.269> it's<00:03:42.450> if<00:03:42.569> you<00:03:42.690> construct

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
that doesn't mean it's if you construct

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.280 
that doesn't mean it's if you construct
it<00:03:43.620> or<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.130> it's<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.910> it's<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.390> failed<00:03:45.750> notion

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
it or that it's and it's a failed notion

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.750 
it or that it's and it's a failed notion
of<00:03:46.410> order<00:03:46.709> but<00:03:46.890> there's<00:03:47.069> that<00:03:47.220> there's<00:03:47.519> a

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
of order but there's that there's a

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.199 
of order but there's that there's a
beauty<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.139> right<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.340> wand<00:03:50.579> is<00:03:50.970> go

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
beauty to it right so the wand is go

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.559 
beauty to it right so the wand is go
straight<00:03:51.780> into<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:53.299> confinements<00:03:54.299> of<00:03:54.420> the

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
straight into the confinements of the

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.840 
straight into the confinements of the
sublime<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.410> other<00:03:55.560> go<00:03:55.859> into<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.280> sense<00:03:56.639> of

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
sublime and the other go into a sense of

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.650 
sublime and the other go into a sense of
beauty<00:03:57.389> so<00:03:57.900> there's<00:03:58.139> there's<00:03:58.440> there's<00:03:59.069> this

beauty so there's there's there's this
thing<00:04:00.660> about<00:04:00.829> ornament<00:04:01.829> that<00:04:01.889> makes<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:03.590> up

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
thing about ornament that makes it a up

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
ours but it's all made by machines it's

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.370 
ours but it's all made by machines it's
designed<00:06:56.460> on<00:06:56.730> a<00:06:56.760> computer<00:06:56.850> and<00:06:57.600> it's<00:06:57.810> and<00:06:58.110> it's

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
made by a computer so we suddenly we get

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.350 
made by a computer so we suddenly we get
this<00:07:00.990> notion<00:07:01.290> of<00:07:01.590> craft<00:07:02.070> and<00:07:02.460> of<00:07:02.610> detailing<00:07:03.150> of

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
this notion of craft and of detailing of

this notion of craft and of detailing of
feeling<00:07:03.900> and<00:07:04.260> of<00:07:04.680> attachment<00:07:05.280> to<00:07:05.370> object

which<00:07:06.330> is<00:07:06.510> really<00:07:06.840> made<00:07:07.050> by<00:07:07.290> machines<00:07:07.740> and<00:07:08.070> I

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:08.790 
which is really made by machines and I

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.700 
which is really made by machines and I
think<00:07:09.000> that's<00:07:09.150> in<00:07:09.360> the<00:07:09.390> work<00:07:09.690> of<00:07:09.870> both<00:07:10.440> of

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710 
think that's in the work of both of

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.400 
think that's in the work of both of
dafwa<00:07:11.160> and<00:07:11.640> then<00:07:11.820> probably<00:07:12.150> you<00:07:12.540> you<00:07:12.900> see<00:07:13.200> that

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410 
dafwa and then probably you you see that

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.510 
dafwa and then probably you you see that
sort<00:07:13.650> of<00:07:14.540> strange<00:07:15.540> merchants<00:07:16.530> of<00:07:16.740> Technology

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 
sort of strange merchants of Technology

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.900
