00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.410
 This is an electronic indicator bite 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.110
 indicator that is used when 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:31.099
 bottom fishing 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:33.320
 attached very simply attached to the blood to 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.320
 fishing rod using tape 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.829
 small stands special to which he 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.750
 affixed allow very clearly 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.520
 transfer the form oscillations to the indicator 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.170
 corresponding to different levels 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.829
 indicator sensitivity allow 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.969
 dark bite fix which 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.850
 can be any conditions that may 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.920
 produce in principle if put 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.810
 this indicator on the table and when 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.000
 maximum sensitivity even ice 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.750
 light tapping on the money table 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.670
 perfectly 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.130
 the table is simulated by dow plastic sensors 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.579
 when biting fish indicator is fine 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.340
 conducts in addition to several levels 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:26.659
 sensitivity needed for 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:32.659
 possibility of setting under the wind under 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:34.960
 a wave of admiration beep 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.549
 and duplicated light signal 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:43.549
 respectively, when the reaction of our reaction 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.890
 on bite flu estrus indicator 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.310
 goes into a passive state that is, he 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.259
 stops twisting and blinking annoying 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.539
 our angler has already responded calmly 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.000
 can be pulled out wore put it 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.429
 press the button again and give 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.340
 continues to work already in mode 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.959
 waiting bite 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.450
 I think that for lovers of bottom fishing 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:13.730
 for lovers of fishing for several rods 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:17.599
 quite an interesting device maybe 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.760
 claimed because it allows more 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.360
 relaxed on the pond behind 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.660
 account sound alarm 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.180
 you can always turn on the sound 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.370
 reacting shiva device like this 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.680
 the device suggests the possibility 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.840
 select one of several frame melodies 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.200
 is inside then we can by sound and 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.510
 respond and in this case on one 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.500
 of the three given unmistakably if we 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.209
 in advance 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.139
 put on different rods is not it 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.139
 perhaps all 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.930
 on
