okay welcome back guys today I'm showing
mind<00:00:03.240> of<00:00:03.449> scrapping<00:00:03.840> belcraft<00:00:04.259> um<00:00:05.629> automatic

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
mind of scrapping belcraft um automatic

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.810 
mind of scrapping belcraft um automatic
cold<00:00:07.290> chunk<00:00:08.240> machine<00:00:09.240> thing<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.929> he<00:00:10.050> wants<00:00:10.170> it

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
cold chunk machine thing is he wants it

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.369 
cold chunk machine thing is he wants it
but<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.480> how<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.719> works<00:00:14.179> so<00:00:15.179> first<00:00:15.750> my

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
but this is how it works so first my

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.210 
but this is how it works so first my
quarry<00:00:17.510> pumps<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.840> everything<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.740> gets

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
quarry pumps the everything that it gets

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.660 
quarry pumps the everything that it gets
in<00:00:20.609> through<00:00:21.300> these<00:00:21.480> pipes<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:23.100> gets<00:00:23.279> sort

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
in through these pipes and it gets sort

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.570 
in through these pipes and it gets sort
out<00:00:23.820> gets<00:00:24.480> sorted<00:00:24.869> out<00:00:25.039> through<00:00:27.109> copper<00:00:28.550> but<00:00:29.550> I

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
out gets sorted out through copper but I

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.099 
out gets sorted out through copper but I
get<00:00:29.730> sorted<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.090> as<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.539> see<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.900> gets

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
get sorted out as you can see it gets

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.740 
get sorted out as you can see it gets
turns<00:00:31.830> down<00:00:32.130> there<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.610> ic2<00:00:33.239> stuff

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
turns down there for the ic2 stuff

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.479 
turns down there for the ic2 stuff
destra<00:00:34.380> graph<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.969> but<00:00:35.969> um<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:40.219> better<00:00:41.219> turn

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
destra graph to but um I better turn

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.920 
destra graph to but um I better turn
this<00:00:41.760> off<00:00:41.969> because<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.239> doesn't<00:00:42.570> need<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> be

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this off because that doesn't need to be

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.869 
this off because that doesn't need to be
pumping<00:00:43.550> but<00:00:44.550> um<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:48.030> goes<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.410> gravel<00:00:49.950> which

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
pumping but um it goes that gravel which

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.209 
pumping but um it goes that gravel which
is<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> extras<00:00:51.510> goes<00:00:51.809> down<00:00:52.910> into<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.030> chest

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
is the extras goes down into this chest

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.950 
is the extras goes down into this chest
it<00:00:56.219> goes<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.610> an<00:00:56.699> infinite<00:00:56.940> loop<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.660> just

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it goes to an infinite loop was I just

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.150 
it goes to an infinite loop was I just
turned<00:00:58.140> off<00:00:58.350> because<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.559> don't<00:00:58.739> want<00:00:58.770> let's

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
turned off because I don't want let's

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.660 
turned off because I don't want let's
get<00:00:59.309> overheated<00:00:59.789> um<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> white

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
get overheated um so this is the white

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.329 
get overheated um so this is the white
one<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.840> white<00:01:04.140> goes<00:01:04.470> through<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
one so it the white goes through the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.880 
one so it the white goes through the
Flint<00:01:06.860> yellow<00:01:07.860> goes<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:09.270> gravel<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.260> Togo<00:01:10.770> an

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
Flint yellow goes for gravel so Togo an

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.460 
Flint yellow goes for gravel so Togo an
infinite<00:01:11.250> loop<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.970> turned<00:01:12.180> off

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
infinite loop which I just turned off

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.450 
infinite loop which I just turned off
and<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.560> said<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> million<00:01:14.430> times

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
and I said that like a million times

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.149 
and I said that like a million times
already<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:15.570> bud<00:01:15.810> home<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.650> Flint<00:01:16.920> gets

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
already I'm bud home the Flint gets

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.600 
already I'm bud home the Flint gets
pumped<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.590> takes<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.680> right<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
pumped up here and takes a right at the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.480 
pumped up here and takes a right at the
green<00:01:20.939> since<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.360> made<00:01:21.659> green<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.590> flint<00:01:23.400> in

the coal dust which is getting pumped
out<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:27.210> gets<00:01:27.450> uh<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.670> into

a new one um but um it gets pumped in
this<00:02:27.700> compressor<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.450> make<00:02:28.630> sure<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.900> pipes

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
this compressor and make sure the pipes

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.450 
this compressor and make sure the pipes
for<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:31.410> coal<00:02:32.410> balls<00:02:34.140> cold<00:02:35.140> chunks<00:02:35.560> are<00:02:36.070> going

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
for the coal balls cold chunks are going

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.880 
for the coal balls cold chunks are going
to<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.730> top<00:02:37.020> well<00:02:38.020> not<00:02:38.140> anyone<00:02:38.410> else<00:02:38.620> or<00:02:38.800> as

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
to the top well not anyone else or as

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.920 
to the top well not anyone else or as
they<00:02:39.070> get<00:02:39.400> into<00:02:39.580> their<00:02:39.700> or<00:02:40.060> their<00:02:40.420> depending

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
they get into their or their depending

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.970 
they get into their or their depending
where<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.600> made<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.990> mistake<00:02:44.050> what

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
where it is and I made that mistake what

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.680 
where it is and I made that mistake what
a<00:02:45.160> few<00:02:45.610> times<00:02:45.760> wondering<00:02:46.300> why<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.420> was

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
a few times wondering why that was

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.650 
a few times wondering why that was
happening<00:02:46.840> um<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.610> then<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.120> gets<00:02:49.210> pumped<00:02:49.570> out

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
happening um and then it gets pumped out

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.290 
happening um and then it gets pumped out
by<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.560> redstone<00:02:50.950> engine<00:02:51.340> going<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.120> this

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
by this redstone engine going to this

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.680 
by this redstone engine going to this
chest<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:53.500> gets<00:02:53.710> pumped<00:02:53.980> out<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.280> chest

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
chest it gets pumped out of that chest

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.870 
chest it gets pumped out of that chest
and<00:02:56.490> goes<00:02:57.490> through<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.030> CLO<00:02:58.510> slot

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
and goes through the CLO slot

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.100 
and goes through the CLO slot
uncompressed<00:03:00.880> cool<00:03:01.180> junk<00:03:01.510> that's<00:03:01.900> what's

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
uncompressed cool junk that's what's

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.190 
uncompressed cool junk that's what's
called<00:03:02.320> into<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.400> which<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.390> compressed

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
called into this which is a compressed

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.750 
called into this which is a compressed
cobol<00:03:05.710> it<00:03:06.040> makes<00:03:06.700> this<00:03:06.850> cool<00:03:07.300> chunk<00:03:07.660> on<00:03:08.550> out<00:03:09.550> of

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
cobol it makes this cool chunk on out of

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.450 
cobol it makes this cool chunk on out of
obsidian<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:10.510> gets<00:03:11.050> pumped<00:03:11.500> into<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.950> chest

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
obsidian and gets pumped into this chest

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.220 
obsidian and gets pumped into this chest
I<00:03:13.020> think<00:03:14.020> they're<00:03:14.200> used<00:03:14.410> for<00:03:15.000> smelting<00:03:16.230> not

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
I think they're used for smelting not

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.920 
I think they're used for smelting not
sure<00:03:17.650> but<00:03:18.690> um<00:03:21.239> well<00:03:22.239> thanks<00:03:22.570> for<00:03:22.660> watching

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
sure but um well thanks for watching

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.459 
sure but um well thanks for watching
