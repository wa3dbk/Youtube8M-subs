00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello welcome are like in the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.559
 next video that I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.559
 make a crossbow with pencils like this 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.759
 good what we are going to need are 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.080
 four pencils that are not round that 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.739
 have a little bit of relief so that 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.460
 They can take either two elastics one 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:29.259
 little thick four with more elastic not 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.190
 as cool as the previous tape 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.350
 adhesive 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.080
 a tube is worth in this case I have taken the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.230
 piece of a pen is worth nothing removed 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.290
 I love the tip of the pen and now 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.140
 I have the tube a pair of scissors and finally 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.940
 a toothpick like these are worth these 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.040
 matches are to be able to make skewers or 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.320
 something like that for cooking and this we will use 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.390
 as dart very well let's start 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.930
 The first thing we are going to do is tie two 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.970
 pencils for couples ok let's catch 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.480
 the gums plus smaller things and we're going 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.480
 to go around 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.330
 here we have one 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.340
 we're fine let's do the other side 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.070
 well once we have the two pencils 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.070
 exposed what we are going to do 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.220
 once we have two groups of rapids 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.830
 What we are going to do is put 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.180
 a gum in the first one had earlier said 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.450
 that it took only two commas 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.430
 how do you do not need three vouchers to 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.900
 put it we put it in one more place or 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.630
 less central and doing it this 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.090
 way voucher here would be in the center of 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.340
 the two gums doing it this way 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.770
 we put here 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.710
 OK 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.970
 we come here 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.970
 we go around 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.950
 let's go here behind 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.129
 do we turn a bend happen 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.780
 in such a way that we go all the time 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:39.430
 pulling well so that it is well fixed 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.280
 we come here we go around here it's worth and 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.090
 we had it again here and we go back 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.090
 backward 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.520
 we throw 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.290
 and as we see the slope, we are going 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.290
 to do the last 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.400
 here and here we will finish 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.480
 we see how it looks good 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.400
 and between crossing over here 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.270
 once we have made the cross we are going to 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.280
 put the pen the pen tube 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.740
 what we are going to do is put it here I go 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.860
 to take a little bit of a pair of gums 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.860
 here 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.530
 in this way I will not have to put as much 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.530
 Scotch tape 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.140
 and we will put here a little tape 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.140
 adhesive 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.790
 as I said it is not necessary much 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.030
 because this is only 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.670
 for 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.230
 let the projectile circulate in here 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.750
 once we have a post 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.490
 he had up here let's loosen a 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.430
 little bit here to put 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.230
 the gum then we will place some 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.690
 here also to put it though from here 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.450
 It will not be so necessary because we loose 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.970
 from here to put the rubber on this 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.430
 way we can separate the pencils what 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.950
 we take to the point where we want 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.710
 and the only thing that will be missing 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.910
 is stretching very well this rubber is worth you 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.340
 let's do exactly the same as 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.449
 the beginning what happens now 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.309
 overcoming the rubber that will make 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.939
 of elastic rope to be able to throw 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.939
 OK 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.300
 and we see how it has been and now we put 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.830
 the rubber up here here will not be so 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.710
 necessary because as we see with the two 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.900
 pencils we can separate a bit and the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.130
 rubber already ends up entering 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.740
 we have almost everything ready to shoot 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.680
 The only thing we will do now is put a 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.400
 little sticky tape here 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.110
 let's cut 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.700
 a piece like yes 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.950
 to make the basis for our 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.950
 project to put it 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.170
 we as a more or less secret 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.170
 this role 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.330
 In this way we can support the 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.630
 projectile here and now already for the part 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.800
 later 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:49.639
 we see how they enter vale 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.639
 we carry 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.350
 our rubber to the end 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.100
 the only missing charge 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.460
 and shoot let's do it we have it 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.460
 loaded 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.470
 and we see how it shoots 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.419
 ok here we have how it has been of 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.740
 agreement if you would like to do it a 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.220
 little more comfortable for charging time 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.340
 we could put a clamp how is it here 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.570
 to use it as a trigger now 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.690
 we have another video in a like that 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:36.419
 we teach how to put it in this case as 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.190
 has less travel I will not put it but 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.710
 you can put it worth the only thing that 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.600
 has to do is put the projectile 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:47.389
 that fits in the sack of agreement 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.389
 we stretch the sack so much with the projectile 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:53.430
 as we see here 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.620
 we look back and we can shoot 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.090
 we see that it comes out very strongly so 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.830
 do not use it against anyone 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.540
 alain we can do this in 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.430
 any site very easily and 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.410
 without having to hook anything and then if 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.880
 we want we can dismantle everything and 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.860
 we can continue using the pencils without 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.350
 no good problem I hope that I have 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.210
 liked and canada that you keep seeing others 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.960
 days of a like thank you very much and up 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.960
 see you soon
