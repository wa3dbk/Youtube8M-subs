00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello, I decided to shoot a small video 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.390
 and share a little experience experience 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.069
 associated with the problem of the nonworking 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.120
 the seventh channel at quadrocopter dji 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.910
 phantom 2 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.710
 with a suspension for us as many as three 3d can even 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.560
 experience is useful to those who are just uncomfortable 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.590
 or tired to drive the seventh channel on 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.710
 back of the console and move the van and 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.240
 in advance to the front panel more precisely so 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.789
 when I bought a bitch friend a copter from me 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.130
 Initially there was a non-working console more precisely 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.170
 worker but defective with defective 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.930
 With a resistor, this one that answers 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.020
 for under channel seven for lowering and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.770
 raising the camera is natural that all 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.719
 I tried to rewrite the rollback so what 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.940
 just did not try everything and the remote 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.640
 and phantom itself no results it is 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.410
 gave in the end I decided to solder though 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.539
 buy new resistors solder old 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.730
 I went to the radio store and bought 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.050
 here is such a resistor here it is 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.280
 here she is his hat who has this 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.949
 quadcopter with those will understand what i did 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.450
 just simply licked out old here 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.920
 this one here is also soldered let's show how 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.189
 let 's start in order we have contact 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.520
 triangle red wire we have on top 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.540
 and black yellow black below us left 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.200
 yellow on the right 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.119
 I pulled the wire neatly laid 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.340
 between here grooves 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.689
 for silicone and also for silicone love 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.850
 here and brought him to the resistor itself on 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.130
 the resistor we will have contacts 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.430
 who will rewire remember or 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.009
 stop the video and watch black 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.270
 contact but on the right side are red 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.430
 middle and yellow at our left side 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.880
 if you look at the variable resistor itself 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:55.320
 This is how the back side turns yellow 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.810
 red black and here we have yellow 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.310
 black red 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.740
 such are the things 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.229
 what else but i think i was afraid that when i 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.330
 I learned that there is a resistor in my opinion at 5 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.619
 or 6 com and when I asked in 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.380
 radio store give me 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.360
 About such a resistor I was answered 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.090
 that there is a mini minimum there is on 100 com and 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.950
 there do not understand the concept of these sensibly there 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.440
 or something else I asked let's 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.300
 let's on this cost me 80 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.730
 cents somewhere if you transfer dollars and 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.239
 I also took at once such a cap 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.380
 originally cost 30 cents but in the end 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.769
 I was not useful I found at home in the old 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.510
 the electronics are so chrome plated it 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.540
 quite simply 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.140
 fits well with chromed color 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.970
 switch to 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.040
 and the stick well sits down another one that I 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.459
 not yet completed the necessary few simple 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.709
 shorten the lever itself to the end 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.720
 dressed this one but nobody quite until 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.799
 the end so that no termitary rolls by 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.200
 to the body like this so let's probably I 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.380
 I will show immediately demonstrate naturally 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.019
 how does it all work to avoid 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.250
 doubt 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.920
 what did not like what you can 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.280
 adjust smoothness long stroke 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.940
 short move with such a resistor and already 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.410
 more than a month fly no problems fly 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.440
 almost every day if bad weather 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.900
 Naturally, I fly until any problems 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.730
 just one pleasure and much 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.010
 itâ€™s more convenient for me personally 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.500
 even though i did n't use back channels 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.220
 This is here a lever but it seems to me that 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.380
 he is not comfortable uncomfortable i decided to just 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.329
 just rewire right away because i 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.030
 planned as it were initially immediately 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:51.079
 re-solder then for no problems 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:56.989
 okay okay let me put 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.989
 batteries and show work 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:05.620
 7 channels of course we turn on the remote 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:18.280
 always first then we 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:19.870
 We include phantom so so See 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.780
 let's antenna probably on this side 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.250
 so as not to interfere 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.680
 I set it up of course you can customize 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.680
 slightly lift the camera also a little 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.550
 further and lower can be adjusted 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.390
 quality 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.400
 in the adjustment program from the remote 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.570
 adjust the camera travel 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.000
 short long 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:46.630
 I set it up as it is more convenient for me to look 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:51.520
 Behind the stick, everything can be smoothly neat 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:54.640
 here is the last movement also the initial 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:59.980
 the move begins immediately you can adjust 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:02.490
 it was not just the movement rather well 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.490
 conveniently 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:12.300
 so here 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:16.800
 I am basically happy with what I have 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.140
 it turned out to fix your problem so 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.700
 what do you need if this video at all 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.750
 will of course help put necessarily 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.860
 likes subscribe to my channel 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:31.890
 we will correct all our errors 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:36.900
 Phantom's favorite technique is quite harmful 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:41.750
 a toy you can say so well that's all 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.750
 probably nothing more to show here 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.980
 like this so if this video is for you 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.470
 liked to write 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.300
 comments ask what i can 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:59.580
 I will help 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:02.310
 surely here is such a small 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.860
 video so if you liked it 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.650
 put likes subscribe to my 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.280
 channel write comments ask what 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:14.480
 I can help those though just an amateur 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.480
 see you all soon
