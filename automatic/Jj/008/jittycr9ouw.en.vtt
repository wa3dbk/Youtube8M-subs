00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
string here on the tenth fret and I'm

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.149 
string here on the tenth fret and I'm
bending<00:01:01.879> up<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.239> whole<00:01:02.450> step<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.050> then<00:01:03.159> I'm

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
bending up a whole step and then I'm

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.789 
bending up a whole step and then I'm
switching<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.630> B<00:01:05.840> string<00:01:06.259> and<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.770> E

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.959 
switching to the the B string and the E
string<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:07.539> then<00:01:08.539> back<00:01:09.079> to<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.649> B<00:01:09.770> string<00:01:09.969> so

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
string and then back to the B string so

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:18.879 
string and then back to the B string so
that<00:01:10.999> sounds<00:01:11.420> together<00:01:11.569> like<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:15.310> okay<00:01:17.889> we

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:18.889 
that sounds together like this okay we

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:23.139 
that sounds together like this okay we
have<00:01:19.039> to<00:01:19.219> sort<00:01:19.369> of<00:01:19.929> fret<00:01:20.929> this<00:01:21.939> these<00:01:22.939> two

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
have to sort of fret this these two

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.959 
have to sort of fret this these two
strings<00:01:23.889> with<00:01:24.889> the<00:01:24.920> index<00:01:25.310> finger<00:01:25.549> on<00:01:25.639> the

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
strings with the index finger on the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.910 
strings with the index finger on the
eighth<00:01:26.119> fret<00:01:27.639> and<00:01:28.639> then<00:01:28.819> we<00:01:28.939> do<00:01:29.029> a<00:01:29.060> bend<00:01:29.420> from

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
eighth fret and then we do a bend from

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.679 
eighth fret and then we do a bend from
11th<00:01:30.920> fret<00:01:31.189> on<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.459> B<00:01:31.549> string<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:32.270> whole<00:01:32.420> step

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
11th fret on the B string the whole step

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.669 
11th fret on the B string the whole step
Bend<00:01:34.569> then<00:01:35.569> you<00:01:35.689> shake<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.200> string<00:01:36.439> for<00:01:36.649> a

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
Bend then you shake the string for a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:45.279 
Bend then you shake the string for a
while<00:01:36.969> buddy<00:01:37.969> guy<00:01:38.270> style<00:01:43.569> and<00:01:44.569> that<00:01:44.749> last<00:01:44.990> part

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
while buddy guy style and that last part

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.659 
while buddy guy style and that last part
is<00:01:45.499> on<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:47.509> eighth<00:01:47.719> fret<00:01:48.020> on<00:01:48.349> the<00:01:48.979> E<00:01:49.579> string

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:51.669 
is on the eighth fret on the E string

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:57.429 
is on the eighth fret on the E string
switching<00:01:52.669> to<00:01:52.999> the<00:01:53.090> B<00:01:53.209> string<00:01:53.270> 11th<00:01:54.259> fret<00:01:56.439> down

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
switching to the B string 11th fret down

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.849 
switching to the B string 11th fret down
to<00:01:57.619> eighth<00:01:57.740> fret<00:01:58.359> and<00:01:59.359> then<00:02:00.229> we<00:02:00.469> do<00:02:00.590> with<00:02:00.709> this

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
to eighth fret and then we do with this

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.080 
to eighth fret and then we do with this
band<00:02:01.249> again<00:02:01.549> with<00:02:01.669> it<00:02:01.759> in<00:02:01.849> the<00:02:01.909> beginning<00:02:04.090> let

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
band again with it in the beginning let

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.020 
band again with it in the beginning let
go<00:02:05.389> and<00:02:06.219> then<00:02:07.219> we<00:02:07.369> go<00:02:07.520> down<00:02:07.669> to<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:07.909> eighth

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
go and then we go down to the eighth

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.279 
go and then we go down to the eighth
fret

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:21.649 

so<00:02:11.159> it<00:02:11.250> sounds<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.420> last

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
so it sounds like this and the last

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.350 
so it sounds like this and the last
thing<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.930> did<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.230> was<00:02:25.910> now<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:26.940> went<00:02:27.209> all<00:02:27.330> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
way down to the D string on the tenth

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.150 
way down to the D string on the tenth
fret<00:02:30.140> switching<00:02:31.140> up<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.500> g<00:02:31.680> string<00:02:31.980> again

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
fret switching up to the g string again

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.770 
fret switching up to the g string again
on<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> eighth<00:02:32.640> fret<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.120> did<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> bit<00:02:33.599> of<00:02:33.629> a

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
on the eighth fret and did a bit of a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.170 
on the eighth fret and did a bit of a
band<00:02:33.989> here<00:02:34.340> with<00:02:35.340> my<00:02:35.430> index<00:02:35.700> finger<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.120> this

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
band here with my index finger and this

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.440 
band here with my index finger and this
something<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.599> Buddy<00:02:36.750> Guy<00:02:36.930> often<00:02:37.230> does<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:38.549> lot

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
something the Buddy Guy often does a lot

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.259 
something the Buddy Guy often does a lot
of<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:40.260> think<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.650> lot<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.799> blue<00:02:41.519> skies<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:42.090> to

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
of I think a lot of blue skies like to

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.460 
of I think a lot of blue skies like to
do<00:02:43.849> index<00:02:44.849> finger<00:02:45.360> bends<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:48.079> how<00:02:49.079> much<00:02:49.290> you

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
do index finger bends and how much you

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.759 
do index finger bends and how much you
Bend<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.920> really<00:02:50.840> it's<00:02:51.840> up<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.290> think

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
Bend is really it's up to you I think

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.500 
Bend is really it's up to you I think
that<00:02:53.010> Buddy<00:02:53.400> Guy<00:02:53.549> sometimes<00:02:54.030> been<00:02:54.239> just<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
that Buddy Guy sometimes been just a

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.180 
that Buddy Guy sometimes been just a
little<00:02:54.540> bit<00:02:54.920> sometimes<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.190> bends<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.459> lot<00:02:58.190> it's

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
little bit sometimes it bends a lot it's

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.869 
little bit sometimes it bends a lot it's
pretty<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.390> suspect<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:00.989> pretty<00:03:01.200> much<00:03:01.379> up<00:03:01.709> to

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
pretty I suspect this pretty much up to

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.849 
pretty I suspect this pretty much up to
whatever<00:03:02.879> mood<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.329> in<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.720> moment<00:03:04.049> so<00:03:04.680> again

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
whatever mood is in the moment so again

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.600 
whatever mood is in the moment so again

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
it's kind of floating if you have the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:40.220 
it's kind of floating if you have the
rhythm<00:03:30.239> going<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.940> then<00:03:39.690> by<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.840> end<00:03:40.020> of<00:03:40.140> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
rhythm going and then by the end of the

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.440 
lick it might go to the F and it would
sound<00:03:43.170> really<00:03:43.290> cool<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:43.950> doesn't<00:03:44.420> but<00:03:45.420> I

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450
