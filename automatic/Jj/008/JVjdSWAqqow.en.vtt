00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.949 
I like the shield out so it's flashing
red<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:24.700> fell<00:03:25.030> down<00:03:25.060> because<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.630> wasn't

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
red and I fell down because I wasn't

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.800 
red and I fell down because I wasn't
high<00:03:26.110> enough<00:03:26.140> up<00:03:26.500> in<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.680> air<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.810> something

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
high enough up in the air and something

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.580 
high enough up in the air and something
we<00:03:29.110> need<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.410> know<00:03:29.560> about<00:03:30.390> hovers<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:32.079> sooner

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
we need to know about hovers the sooner

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.430 
we need to know about hovers the sooner
you<00:03:32.739> shield<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.400> more<00:03:34.180> height<00:03:34.690> you'll<00:03:34.989> get<00:03:35.200> in

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
you shield the more height you'll get in

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.810 
you shield the more height you'll get in
the<00:03:37.500> otherwise<00:03:38.500> it's<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.980> short<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.430> sooner

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
the otherwise it's the short the sooner

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.360 
the otherwise it's the short the sooner
you<00:03:39.940> do<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.239> but<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.600> like<00:03:41.530> further<00:03:41.829> way<00:03:42.040> I

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
you do it but the like further way I

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.370 
you do it but the like further way I
don't<00:03:42.970> know<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.540> get<00:03:43.720> what<00:03:43.840> I'm<00:03:43.930> saying<00:03:43.959> the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
don't know you get what I'm saying the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.039 
don't know you get what I'm saying the
further<00:03:44.560> way<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.799> do<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.160> like<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:46.600> further

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
further way you do it like the further

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.210 
further way you do it like the further
you'll<00:03:47.350> go<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:48.280> see<00:03:48.519> I<00:03:48.870> backflip<00:03:49.870> ah

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.990 

relatively<00:03:53.220> like<00:03:53.430> far<00:03:54.590> from<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.740> detonation

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
relatively like far from the detonation

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.290 
relatively like far from the detonation
so<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.030> went<00:03:57.560> more<00:03:58.560> distance<00:03:59.070> but<00:03:59.820> if<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.060> wait

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
so I went more distance but if I wait

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.350 
so I went more distance but if I wait
longer<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.920> it's<00:04:02.070> really<00:04:02.430> flashing<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.180> go

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
longer so it's really flashing I go

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.060 
longer so it's really flashing I go
higher<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:04.110> it's<00:04:04.230> easier<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.560> do<00:04:04.770> with<00:04:04.890> mom

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
higher and it's easier to do with mom

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.390 
higher and it's easier to do with mom
she's<00:04:05.280> like<00:04:05.630> see<00:04:06.630> I'm<00:04:06.840> going<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.230> tire<00:04:07.590> but<00:04:08.250> if

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
she's like see I'm going to tire but if

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.820 
she's like see I'm going to tire but if
I<00:04:08.490> just<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:09.870> know<00:04:11.240> do<00:04:12.240> this<00:04:12.500> that<00:04:13.500> was<00:04:13.620> higher

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
I just you know do this that was higher

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.130 
I just you know do this that was higher
too<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:14.580> here<00:04:14.850> if<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.150> just<00:04:15.390> do<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.750> while<00:04:15.990> it's

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
too but here if I just do it while it's

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.630 
too but here if I just do it while it's
flashing<00:04:16.440> like<00:04:16.739> this<00:04:16.980> I'll<00:04:17.220> get<00:04:17.430> more

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
flashing like this I'll get more

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.480 
flashing like this I'll get more
distance<00:04:21.050> and<00:04:22.050> this<00:04:22.500> can<00:04:22.680> be<00:04:22.830> used<00:04:22.980> in<00:04:23.220> dozens

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
distance and this can be used in dozens

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.730 
distance and this can be used in dozens
of<00:04:23.850> places<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.600> can<00:04:24.720> be<00:04:24.810> used<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.110> climb<00:04:25.350> stone

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
of places it can be used to climb stone

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.690 
of places it can be used to climb stone
tower<00:04:26.330> can<00:04:27.330> be<00:04:27.450> used<00:04:27.740> there's<00:04:28.740> too<00:04:29.130> many<00:04:29.280> to

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
tower can be used there's too many to

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.280 
tower can be used there's too many to
list<00:04:30.000> in<00:04:30.420> this<00:04:30.600> one<00:04:30.930> video<00:04:31.430> why<00:04:32.450> there's<00:04:33.450> many

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
list in this one video why there's many

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:47.950 
list in this one video why there's many
many<00:04:34.560> uses<00:04:34.890> for<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.460> hover<00:04:35.670> and<00:04:36.410> so<00:04:38.690> yeah<00:04:46.580> so

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
many uses for the hover and so yeah so

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.220 
many uses for the hover and so yeah so
you<00:04:48.960> know<00:04:48.990> just<00:04:49.380> practice<00:04:49.920> it<00:04:50.720> there<00:04:51.720> I<00:04:51.750> failed

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
you know just practice it there I failed

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.330 
you know just practice it there I failed
right<00:04:52.500> there

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
right there

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.000 
right there
you<00:04:54.270> know<00:04:54.390> just<00:04:54.660> practice<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:55.530> work<00:04:55.770> at<00:04:55.950> it

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
you know just practice it and work at it

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.800 
you know just practice it and work at it
and<00:04:56.310> it's<00:04:56.550> really<00:04:56.880> one<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.420> most<00:04:57.600> useful

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
and it's really one of the most useful

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.500 
and it's really one of the most useful
glitches<00:04:58.470> in<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.710> game<00:04:58.920> so<00:04:59.300> maybe<00:05:00.300> a

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
glitches in the game so maybe a

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.450 
glitches in the game so maybe a
speedrunner<00:05:01.140> sync<00:05:01.590> them<00:05:01.770> we<00:05:02.040> gotta<00:05:02.220> get

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
speedrunner sync them we gotta get

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.550 
speedrunner sync them we gotta get
better<00:05:03.440> so<00:05:04.440> see<00:05:04.860> next<00:05:05.190> video
