the back we'd go to in different
languages<00:02:01.340> some<00:02:01.729> safety<00:02:01.970> guidelines<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.689> I'm

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
languages some safety guidelines and I'm

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.920 
languages some safety guidelines and I'm
saying<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.020> search<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:03.670> apart<00:02:04.670> from<00:02:04.729> that

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
saying a search and apart from that

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.809 
saying a search and apart from that
there's<00:02:05.930> this<00:02:07.420> adjustment<00:02:09.280> for<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.340> best<00:02:10.550> bus

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
there's this adjustment for the best bus

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.800 
there's this adjustment for the best bus
which<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:11.989> can<00:02:12.260> actually<00:02:12.830> use<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.790> write<00:02:14.569> out

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
which you can actually use and write out

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.990 
which you can actually use and write out
so<00:02:15.560> let<00:02:15.709> me<00:02:15.830> just<00:02:15.950> open<00:02:16.100> this<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.700> show<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:16.940> to

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
so let me just open this and show it to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.970 
so let me just open this and show it to
you<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:17.660> here<00:02:17.870> we<00:02:17.989> go<00:02:18.110> there<00:02:18.319> are<00:02:18.350> these<00:02:18.650> four
