00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.110
 tenth week of the return of the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.150
 blackberry and the game that will make you 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.190
 relive the world cup as they are I am 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.139
 vanessa hand orellana and gabriel sham and 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.870
 welcome to another segment of the week 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.060
 in cinema in spanish gabriel let's start 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.780
 with the video that goes round and round 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.850
 all sides and is that in the first 24 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.400
 hours already had millions of visits and it 's 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.369
 this video that shows how someone with 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.790
 his own hands manages to bend the iphone 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.910
 6 plus the new apple phone tablet and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.710
 go that impressive not only the video 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.899
 but the number of visits that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.510
 had therefore been a subject of which 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.890
 We have already spoken and that the audience 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.120
 you friends have been very 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.130
 interested 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.899
 I'm not sure how easy it is 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.910
 can fold an iphone 6 because every time 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.620
 that vanessa lends me the one we have 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.940
 here in the office the truth is that there 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.129
 to make a very big effort and I do not 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.079
 I have been able to bend it and also 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.000
 We have seen tests with other phones 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.549
 in particular some android phones 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.320
 that bend when you force 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.700
 special then let's say that the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.399
 conclusion is that if you 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.560
 you can fold these phones we read that 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.420
 some of the accusations was of 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.399
 people who had brought the phone in 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.380
 your back pocket for up to 18 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.539
 hours of course that sounds like 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.799
 potentially an opportunity to 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.450
 fold your phone but as much 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.240
 important to vanessa is that lean 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.000
 he said about it and said that until the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.219
 moment only nine people have called 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.880
 to Paul to complain about this problem with 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.319
 your new iphone 6 or iphone 6 plus and 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.049
 clarified that their phones have passed 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.240
 quality tests that the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.459
 better materials and so on and so on and 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.840
 for the same reason, I doubt that 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.640
 effectively this is a problem to 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.130
 long term I understand the concern 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.649
 gabriel because it 's an expensive phone is the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.939
 cheaper it costs you 300 dollars in 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.289
 contract so I understand the 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.720
 worry but to me what I 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.759
 worries is how tight they have the 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.789
 pants these people who achieve 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.420
 fold the phone in your pockets 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.549
 and I guess it will be good men and me 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.310
 I say good, do not wear a pair of pants 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.079
 Yes so tight and good but 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.239
 among your worries will also be 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.900
 that these phones probably the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.700
 current 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.610
 sharon this week with this 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.420
 ios 8 update that is ios 8 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.489
 points 0.1 that had to get Paul out 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.590
 of circulation almost immediately 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.689
 because it was causing problems in the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.689
 new phones in terms of their 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.909
 connectivity to the cellular network and use 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.129
 of tokai di then apple had a 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.079
 very bad week already said that it will repair 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.750
 this update and will release it to 8 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.700
 0.2 points very soon and we hope to see 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.790
 corrections but go weekly that you 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.489
 handsome and good and if you do not convince 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.069
 it's back to black berry and gabriel 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.750
 I do not know if you remember blackberry or is 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.819
 that the company has not done for a long time 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.680
 launches a device but now enters 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.260
 back to the market with the blackberry 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.329
 pass by a pretty curious phone 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.060
 that you have similar dimensions to a 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.250
 American passport and has that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.060
 physical keyboard that many people have 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.599
 missed from blackberry devices 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.819
 now on the screen measures 4.5 inches 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.080
 but it's a pretty wide phone 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.350
 sorry 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.370
 and it costs 599 dollars so in what 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.470
 I do not know if they manage to return to 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.670
 market with this phone gabriel the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.920
 client already said that he will have it 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.110
 available has not told us the price 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.940
 Not when, but stay tuned because 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.770
 as you say many people love those 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.990
 physical keyboards of blackberry and tea 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.360
 I also tell that electronic arts launched 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.480
 this week finally the highly anticipated 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.610
 fifa 15 remember that fifa 14 and the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.260
 special edition of the world the 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.940
 electronic arts sold very well 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.100
 thanks of course to the championship in 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.690
 Brazil and then we have a lot 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.340
 expectation to see how this game is doing 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.230
 which is one of the highest sales in 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.630
 regarding sports titles throughout 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.730
 world even though electronic arts is 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.790
 owner of the madden franchise of 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.530
 american football has my house super fan 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.560
 it's true my children are very fans 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.900
 I already downloaded it from before 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.940
 was available in beta the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.040
 graphics I liked vanessa the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.170
 goalkeepers have better reaction and even 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.239
 physically and his movements are much 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.099
 more real 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.460
 and of course that is better than the previous 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.990
 but let's see how it goes in the market 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.000
 good remember we have them all 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.460
 this news and you can watch this video 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.099
 of the iphone bending at the dotcom cinema 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.169
 diagonal is that there are several andreiana and 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.099

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.099
