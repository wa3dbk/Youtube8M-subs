00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.289
 ap but it's an estimate macias from big pictures of 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:10.289
 the mississippi 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:15.339
 in 1912 who will realize with a year a photographer called the barcamp 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.539
 two best 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.720
 it was actually only two traces that we had become what there is I 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.990
 working up to that time it will rule by considering all the 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.619
 photos we can realize that he will leave a trace a release but 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.880
 especially the weapons 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.359
 a synthesis of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.350
 the person to get excited 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.390
 and a good one when I'm passionate about animation cinema then 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.910
 underwriters that I want to work according to one of the fans I did a lot 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.380
 of fans 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.730
 I was interested in buying access to these photos 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.020
 and aaa 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.800
 I managed to put them in order 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.510
 with suspended sentences merge with each other in a credible way the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.680
 move that I will go from undermining minister sapa and it was really a 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.940
 choice you went away alone in this job did not know exactly what 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.890
 we were going to do we started to merge a picture of photos too much photo 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.840
 learn paris by three minutes of movie 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.410
 it's a bad turn to their presented did this work this 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.970
 but he lives political ideas that is to say have yet finished our 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.450
 purpose is to define another all the ballet that makes little 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.530
 close to 8 minutes 30 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.510
 we also merge intensity of the photos of other balls and offenses 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.870
 tax 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.390
 when we analyze the photos of the foreshore of photos that has all this ballet 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.960
 realizes that he does not have one who exactly in the same position as 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.760
 train d making them this gesture to ask 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.910
 on Monday 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.910
 we realized that he had sued at aaa 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.399
 that's really an accurate record of his work 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.759
 there are some big companies that have already gone up on paris 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.760
 those who claim to authenticity 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.290
 but what is particular what is weird is that there is not a cellar karam 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500
 we need results we all know young people 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.400
 no longer the plane human rights situation had left it to 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.050
 the charles jude of paris opera 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.300
 there is 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.959
 one of our best possible 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.069
 but for 110 years earlier to know exactly where the moments and quirky 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.719
 compared to music what 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.719
 we did in his affiliate at first the movie much needed 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.719
 it's called the cave and then we did an hour 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.769
 an animated paper cut out from the derelict karel table 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.269
 gucht person of course 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.109
 this is my third film 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.989
 we are already waiting to see the result 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.989
 the effect on the audience actually since it's somewhere it's a bit 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.439
 biggest record companies 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.099
 we managed to stall on m6 wanted to base hotel storyboard the sum of 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.979
 pictures compared to both debussy 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:49.079
 and then we worked on the intermediaries of one of these 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:49.939
 pics 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.049
 Alas 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.629
 that's what makes the film perfect 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:55.600
 ap 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.410
 as for her
