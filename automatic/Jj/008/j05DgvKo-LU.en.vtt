soft<00:00:59.050> touch<00:01:00.809> feels<00:01:01.809> good<00:01:02.050> it's<00:01:02.230> kind<00:01:02.320> of<00:01:02.410> a

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
soft touch feels good it's kind of a

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.760 
soft touch feels good it's kind of a
jersey<00:01:02.980> knit<00:01:03.250> fabric<00:01:04.210> but<00:01:05.050> it's<00:01:05.199> not<00:01:05.410> it's<00:01:05.590> not

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
jersey knit fabric but it's not it's not

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.000 
jersey knit fabric but it's not it's not
bad<00:01:05.979> it's<00:01:06.729> better<00:01:07.720> than<00:01:08.049> having<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.409> big<00:01:08.590> flank

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
bad it's better than having a big flank

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.130 
bad it's better than having a big flank
of<00:01:09.189> hard<00:01:09.490> plastic<00:01:09.640> there<00:01:10.180> in<00:01:10.360> my<00:01:10.510> opinion<00:01:10.630> and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
of hard plastic there in my opinion and

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.289 
of hard plastic there in my opinion and
this<00:01:11.740> can<00:01:11.920> is<00:01:12.220> available<00:01:12.790> in<00:01:12.880> other<00:01:13.000> colors

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
this can is available in other colors

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.280 
this can is available in other colors
red<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.170> blue<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.790> I<00:01:15.909> think<00:01:16.420> maybe<00:01:16.810> in<00:01:17.080> a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
red and blue and I think maybe in a

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.640 
red and blue and I think maybe in a
neutral<00:01:17.860> tan<00:01:18.280> color<00:01:18.670> as<00:01:18.909> well<00:01:19.150> I<00:01:19.439> prefer<00:01:20.439> the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
neutral tan color as well I prefer the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.999 
neutral tan color as well I prefer the
black<00:01:20.890> myself<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:23.140> plastic<00:01:23.590> up<00:01:23.710> here

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
black myself the plastic up here

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
car that I've really noticed is the fact

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.420 
car that I've really noticed is the fact
that<00:01:59.409> the<00:02:00.009> buttons<00:02:01.500> when<00:02:02.500> you<00:02:02.619> roll<00:02:03.219> your

that the buttons when you roll your
hands<00:02:03.759> over<00:02:03.880> them<00:02:04.119> they<00:02:04.659> don't<00:02:04.840> wiggle<00:02:05.079> around

hands over them they don't wiggle around

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.969 
hands over them they don't wiggle around
like<00:02:05.950> most<00:02:06.670> GM<00:02:07.030> products<00:02:07.509> seem<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:08.019> do<00:02:08.170> it's

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
like most GM products seem to do it's

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.619 
like most GM products seem to do it's
just<00:02:09.070> one<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.369> those<00:02:09.459> nitpicky<00:02:09.940> things<00:02:10.299> that

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
just one of those nitpicky things that

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.890 
just one of those nitpicky things that
to<00:02:11.620> me<00:02:11.770> evokes<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.640> higher<00:02:13.180> quality<00:02:13.660> image<00:02:14.050> than

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
to me evokes a higher quality image than

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.940 
to me evokes a higher quality image than
products<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.799> past<00:02:17.560> given<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> shift

me I guess if you look at the screen
when<00:04:36.800> I<00:04:36.889> change<00:04:37.129> the<00:04:37.310> temperature<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.909> see

Focus<00:06:22.099> was<00:06:22.279> a<00:06:22.310> sunroof<00:06:22.759> in<00:06:22.909> it<00:06:23.060> it's<00:06:23.659> kind<00:06:23.870> of

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
Focus was a sunroof in it it's kind of

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.019 
Focus was a sunroof in it it's kind of
annoying<00:06:24.229> and<00:06:24.500> how<00:06:24.710> it<00:06:24.860> operates<00:06:25.310> so<00:06:25.669> this<00:06:25.849> is

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:26.029 
annoying and how it operates so this is

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:30.730 
annoying and how it operates so this is
definitely<00:06:26.629> a<00:06:26.779> far<00:06:27.020> cry<00:06:27.169> from<00:06:27.259> that<00:06:27.440> car<00:06:29.740> so

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
definitely a far cry from that car so

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.189 
definitely a far cry from that car so
overall<00:06:31.250> the<00:06:31.669> new<00:06:32.300> cruise<00:06:32.599> definitely<00:06:33.080> has

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 
overall the new cruise definitely has

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:35.579 
overall the new cruise definitely has
one<00:06:33.440> of<00:06:33.529> the<00:06:33.589> best<00:06:33.770> GM<00:06:34.130> interiors<00:06:34.610> I've<00:06:34.849> ever

experienced and probably definitely

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.910 
experienced and probably definitely
surpasses<00:06:39.400> that<00:06:39.430> of<00:06:39.930> even<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:41.050> Cadillac<00:06:41.440> CTS

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.490 
surpasses that of even the Cadillac CTS
I'd<00:06:42.220> say<00:06:42.520> if<00:06:42.730> there<00:06:42.940> is<00:06:43.090> one<00:06:43.420> car<00:06:43.690> that<00:06:43.720> rivals

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.160 
was done by Opel but I hope this is a
glimpse<00:06:57.700> of<00:06:57.790> what's<00:06:58.030> to<00:06:58.180> come<00:06:58.210> from<00:06:58.570> the<00:06:58.960> rest

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170 
glimpse of what's to come from the rest

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.960 
glimpse of what's to come from the rest
of<00:06:59.350> jeans<00:06:59.560> mainstream<00:07:00.160> products<00:07:00.550> because<00:07:00.820> if

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
of jeans mainstream products because if

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.790 
of jeans mainstream products because if
it<00:07:01.060> is<00:07:01.210> to<00:07:01.450> the<00:07:01.930> future<00:07:02.290> should<00:07:02.440> be<00:07:02.620> pretty

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
it is to the future should be pretty

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.220 
it is to the future should be pretty
bright<00:07:03.100> for<00:07:03.130> that<00:07:03.460> company<00:07:03.850> because<00:07:04.150> this<00:07:05.020> is

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
bright for that company because this is

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.190 
bright for that company because this is
a<00:07:05.260> far<00:07:05.650> cry<00:07:05.680> from<00:07:05.950> the<00:07:06.700> Cobalt

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.200 
a far cry from the Cobalt

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.320 
a far cry from the Cobalt
so<00:07:08.950> that's<00:07:09.280> the<00:07:09.630> 2011<00:07:10.630> Chevrolet<00:07:11.110> Cruze
