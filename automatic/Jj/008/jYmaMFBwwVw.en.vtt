00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
now the sides got more of a setup I

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.800 
now the sides got more of a setup I
suppose<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.579> then<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.149> just<00:02:01.299> set<00:02:01.689> the

suppose but and then I just set the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:14.100 
suppose but and then I just set the
rollers<00:02:05.070> long<00:02:07.259> wrong

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.840 

medium-sized<00:02:18.040> obviously<00:02:19.040> they<00:02:19.430> have<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.730> be

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
medium-sized obviously they have to be

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.320 
medium-sized obviously they have to be
rolled<00:02:20.090> in<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.360> opposite<00:02:20.690> direction<00:02:22.150> if<00:02:23.150> you

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
rolled in the opposite direction if you

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.820 
rolled in the opposite direction if you
imagine<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.840> than<00:02:24.260> what<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.530> would<00:02:24.650> normally

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
imagine it than what you would normally

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.760 
imagine it than what you would normally
imagine<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:25.930> what<00:02:26.930> direction<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.470> cars<00:02:27.650> that

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
imagine in what direction of cars that

00:02:27.770 --> 00:03:00.370 
imagine in what direction of cars that
are<00:02:27.980> going<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.950> then<00:02:58.280> do<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.970> same<00:02:59.330> with<00:03:00.020> this

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
are going and then do the same with this

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:12.340 
are going and then do the same with this
side<00:03:09.490> mostly<00:03:10.490> rolling<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.120> towards<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.050> part

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
side mostly rolling it towards the part

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:54.970 
side mostly rolling it towards the part
in<00:03:12.530> AE<00:03:12.800> I<00:03:50.410> fixed<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.530> horrible<00:03:52.010> pin<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:53.980> step

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
in AE I fixed the horrible pin and step

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.820 
in AE I fixed the horrible pin and step
to<00:03:55.160> a<00:03:55.190> liberty<00:03:55.700> now<00:03:55.959> but<00:03:56.959> these<00:03:57.380> rollers

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
to a liberty now but these rollers

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.090 
to a liberty now but these rollers
walling<00:03:58.280> in<00:03:58.459> this<00:03:58.670> way<00:03:59.470> and<00:04:00.470> these<00:04:00.709> rollers

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
walling in this way and these rollers

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.320 
walling in this way and these rollers
are<00:04:01.250> rolling<00:04:01.550> in<00:04:01.670> this<00:04:01.910> way<00:04:03.970> going<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.060> do<00:04:05.180> my

my<00:04:30.460> role<00:04:30.670> is<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:30.910> basically<00:04:31.330> cold<00:04:31.690> now<00:04:31.920> so<00:04:32.920> I'm

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
my role is a basically cold now so I'm

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:53.580 
my role is a basically cold now so I'm

going to take them out okay let's see

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:06.150 
going to take them out okay let's see
what<00:04:53.770> we<00:04:53.890> can<00:04:53.920> do<00:05:04.380> if<00:05:05.380> you<00:05:05.530> want<00:05:05.560> your<00:05:05.920> fingers

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
what we can do if you want your fingers

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.450 
what we can do if you want your fingers
over<00:05:06.640> them<00:05:07.300> they<00:05:07.570> will<00:05:08.470> all<00:05:08.620> turn<00:05:08.860> into<00:05:09.070> one

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
over them they will all turn into one

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.530 
over them they will all turn into one
large<00:05:10.120> curl<00:05:10.950> which<00:05:11.950> will<00:05:12.130> be<00:05:12.190> easier<00:05:12.700> and<00:05:13.030> it

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
large curl which will be easier and it

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.530 
large curl which will be easier and it
will<00:05:13.630> Kyle<00:05:13.810> just<00:05:13.990> roll<00:05:14.440> itself<00:05:14.920> into<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:18.540> small

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
will Kyle just roll itself into a small

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:27.659 
will Kyle just roll itself into a small
hammer<00:05:21.960> back<00:05:24.990> okay<00:05:25.990> I'm<00:05:26.590> gonna<00:05:26.800> hold<00:05:26.980> up<00:05:27.250> to

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669

this<00:05:27.760> angle<00:05:28.200> from<00:05:29.200> my<00:05:29.410> head<00:05:30.000> if<00:05:31.000> you<00:05:31.060> imagine

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
this angle from my head if you imagine

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.780 
this angle from my head if you imagine
that<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:31.900> cow<00:05:32.110> is<00:05:32.290> gonna<00:05:32.500> die<00:05:33.150> up<00:05:34.150> here<00:05:34.350> alone

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
that the cow is gonna die up here alone

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:50.190 
that the cow is gonna die up here alone
that<00:05:36.790> way<00:05:38.130> so<00:05:39.130> good<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.110> end<00:05:46.230> I<00:05:48.990> found<00:05:49.990> one

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
that way so good to the end I found one

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:58.950 
that way so good to the end I found one
in<00:05:50.350> half<00:05:50.590> like<00:05:50.890> that<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:54.550> curl<00:05:55.000> down<00:05:57.930> see<00:05:58.930> what

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
in half like that and curl down see what

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.520 
in half like that and curl down see what
we've<00:05:59.260> got<00:05:59.290> a<00:05:59.500> debacle

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530
