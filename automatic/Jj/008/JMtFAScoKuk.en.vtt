gluing a battery on a battery but that's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.100 
gluing a battery on a battery but that's
because<00:02:46.760> this<00:02:47.030> has<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.510> fit<00:02:47.720> inside<00:02:47.900> the

battery compartment and have
matching<00:02:50.540> contacts<00:02:51.340> kind<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.430> what<00:02:52.549> you're

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
matching contacts kind of what you're

dealing<00:02:52.909> with<00:02:53.090> there<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.200> we<00:02:54.260> plop<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.709> guy

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
dealing with there so we plop that guy

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.240 
dealing with there so we plop that guy
right<00:02:55.129> in<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:56.450> looks<00:02:56.690> like<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.079> then<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.099> put

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
right in it looks like and then to put

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.030 
right in it looks like and then to put
the<00:02:58.280> case<00:02:58.549> on<00:02:59.260> cuz<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.349> really<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.680> something

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
the case on cuz it really is something

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.420 
the case on cuz it really is something
more<00:03:01.250> like<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.459> case<00:03:01.790> not<00:03:02.060> just<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.390> back<00:03:03.430> okay

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
more like a case not just a back okay

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.190 
more like a case not just a back okay
that<00:03:04.579> goes<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:04.940> pretty<00:03:05.209> easily<00:03:05.599> and<00:03:05.900> it's<00:03:06.019> kind

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
that goes on pretty easily and it's kind

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.030 
that goes on pretty easily and it's kind
of<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:06.349> like<00:03:06.500> putting<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.829> rubber

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
of just like putting a rubber

wraps around the edges in the front

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.259 
wraps around the edges in the front
completely<00:03:12.340> now<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.519> could<00:03:13.730> be<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.879> little

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
completely now it could be a little

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.030 
completely now it could be a little
tighter<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.629> be<00:03:14.840> honest<00:03:15.140> even<00:03:15.470> here<00:03:15.709> we've<00:03:15.859> got

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
tighter to be honest even here we've got

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.650 
tighter to be honest even here we've got
this<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:16.700> pretty<00:03:16.819> easy<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.239> pull<00:03:17.420> away<00:03:17.540> and

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
this is pretty easy to pull away and

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.240 
this is pretty easy to pull away and
since<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.079> is<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.349> only<00:03:18.379> protection<00:03:19.099> for

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
since this is the only protection for

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.440 
since this is the only protection for
the<00:03:19.340> phone<00:03:19.489> I'd<00:03:19.700> like<00:03:19.849> to<00:03:19.970> see<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.239> be<00:03:20.420> a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
the phone I'd like to see this be a

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.009 
the phone I'd like to see this be a
little<00:03:20.750> bit<00:03:20.900> tighter<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:22.519> on<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.599> back<00:03:23.810> you

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
little bit tighter and on the back you

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.360 
little bit tighter and on the back you
can<00:03:24.109> see<00:03:24.170> we<00:03:24.379> have<00:03:24.530> cut<00:03:24.769> out<00:03:24.920> for<00:03:25.129> the<00:03:25.190> camera

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
can see we have cut out for the camera

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.159 
can see we have cut out for the camera
does<00:03:25.760> not<00:03:25.790> cause<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.389> in<00:03:26.480> getting<00:03:26.810> its<00:03:26.989> work

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
does not cause it in getting its work

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.960 
does not cause it in getting its work
just<00:03:27.380> fine<00:03:27.560> for<00:03:27.620> us<00:03:27.889> access<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.609> headphone

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
just fine for us access to the headphone

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.520 
just fine for us access to the headphone
jack<00:03:29.000> there's<00:03:29.569> a<00:03:29.690> pass-through<00:03:29.930> for<00:03:30.290> the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
jack there's a pass-through for the

microphone jack it's correctly placed
that's<00:03:32.480> an<00:03:32.599> important<00:03:32.989> thing<00:03:33.019> with<00:03:33.260> cases

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
that's an important thing with cases

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.490 
that's an important thing with cases
sometimes<00:03:33.859> I<00:03:34.099> don't<00:03:34.250> get<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.519> quite<00:03:34.760> right

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
sometimes I don't get that quite right

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.750 
sometimes I don't get that quite right
here<00:03:36.500> we<00:03:36.650> have<00:03:36.769> our<00:03:36.919> volume<00:03:37.099> controls<00:03:37.639> they

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
here we have our volume controls they

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.809 
here we have our volume controls they
also<00:03:37.970> work<00:03:38.269> just<00:03:38.299> fine<00:03:39.280> power<00:03:40.280> buttons<00:03:40.639> right

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
also work just fine power buttons right

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.110 
also work just fine power buttons right
here<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:42.010> there's<00:03:43.010> our<00:03:43.160> opening<00:03:43.549> for<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.730> micro

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
here and there's our opening for a micro

USB our capacitive digital pen easy to
get<00:03:47.630> out<00:03:47.750> there's<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.019> deep<00:03:48.380> cut<00:03:48.620> out<00:03:48.799> over<00:03:49.099> here

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
get out there's a deep cut out over here

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.890 
get out there's a deep cut out over here
so<00:03:49.340> your<00:03:49.639> finger<00:03:49.910> can<00:03:50.060> get<00:03:50.209> in<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:50.510> still<00:03:50.690> lift

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
so your finger can get in and still lift

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.229 
so your finger can get in and still lift
it<00:03:50.989> under<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.290> lip<00:03:51.500> for<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:51.919> and<00:03:52.239> their

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
it under the lip for this and their

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.440 
it under the lip for this and their
microphone<00:03:53.660> hole<00:03:53.870> right<00:03:54.019> there<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:55.370> then<00:03:56.299> we

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
microphone hole right there and then we

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.150 
microphone hole right there and then we
have<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.599> little<00:03:56.870> hole<00:03:57.139> for<00:03:57.169> the<00:03:57.590> speaker<00:03:58.010> on

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
have a little hole for the speaker on

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
have a little hole for the speaker on
the<00:03:58.400> back<00:03:58.579> too<00:03:59.470> now<00:04:00.549> it's<00:04:01.549> actually<00:04:01.819> pretty

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
the back too now it's actually pretty

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.819 
the back too now it's actually pretty
rigid<00:04:02.569> when<00:04:02.660> it's<00:04:02.810> on<00:04:02.930> in<00:04:03.139> terms<00:04:03.380> of<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.590> back

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
rigid when it's on in terms of the back

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.860 
rigid when it's on in terms of the back
flex<00:04:04.220> you<00:04:04.669> can<00:04:04.700> see<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.060> little<00:04:05.419> bit<00:04:05.660> the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
flex you can see a little bit the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.710 
flex you can see a little bit the
masking<00:04:06.440> of<00:04:06.859> the<00:04:07.310> battery<00:04:07.669> here<00:04:07.879> through<00:04:08.180> the

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
masking of the battery here through the

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.780 
masking of the battery here through the
case<00:04:08.930> out<00:04:09.169> there<00:04:09.379> most<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:09.980> not<00:04:10.160> as<00:04:10.370> opaque

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
case out there most it's not as opaque

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.190 
case out there most it's not as opaque
as<00:04:10.849> it<00:04:11.120> could<00:04:11.299> be<00:04:11.419> which<00:04:11.540> is<00:04:11.660> interesting<00:04:11.900> but

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
as it could be which is interesting but

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.680 
as it could be which is interesting but
actually<00:04:12.950> in<00:04:13.099> terms<00:04:13.340> of<00:04:13.489> rigidity<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:14.359> doesn't

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
actually in terms of rigidity it doesn't

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.270 
actually in terms of rigidity it doesn't
feel<00:04:14.810> weird<00:04:15.139> like<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.440> thought<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.739> would<00:04:18.280> so

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
feel weird like I thought it would so

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.830 
feel weird like I thought it would so
now<00:04:19.519> we'll<00:04:19.699> boot<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.030> up<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:20.329> now<00:04:20.389> I<00:04:20.419> put<00:04:20.690> this

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
now we'll boot it up and now I put this

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.629 
now we'll boot it up and now I put this
through<00:04:21.109> two<00:04:21.289> charging<00:04:21.739> cycles<00:04:22.160> so<00:04:22.310> far<00:04:22.550> the

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
through two charging cycles so far the

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:23.860 
through two charging cycles so far the
first<00:04:22.760> time<00:04:22.940> they<00:04:23.060> suggest<00:04:23.449> that<00:04:23.510> you<00:04:23.630> charge

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
first time they suggest that you charge

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.480 
first time they suggest that you charge
it<00:04:24.050> for<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.229> full<00:04:24.440> 12<00:04:24.740> hours<00:04:24.889> that's<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.310> lot<00:04:25.460> of

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
it for a full 12 hours that's a lot of

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.770 
it for a full 12 hours that's a lot of
milliamps<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.090> charge<00:04:26.360> so<00:04:26.510> that's<00:04:26.599> a

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
milliamps to charge so that's a

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.689 
milliamps to charge so that's a
reasonable<00:04:27.080> thing<00:04:27.349> to<00:04:27.500> suggest<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:28.370> actually

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
reasonable thing to suggest it actually

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.339 
reasonable thing to suggest it actually
didn't<00:04:28.940> seem<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.150> take<00:04:29.210> nearly<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.990> long<00:04:30.169> it

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
didn't seem to take nearly that long it

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:31.899 
didn't seem to take nearly that long it
did<00:04:30.500> come<00:04:30.680> at<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.830> forty<00:04:31.130> percent<00:04:31.280> charge<00:04:31.610> which

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:31.909 
did come at a forty percent charge which

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.839 
did come at a forty percent charge which
it<00:04:32.090> should<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.860> extended<00:04:34.340> batteries<00:04:34.700> well

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
it should the extended batteries well

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:35.469 
it should the extended batteries well
they<00:04:35.000> are<00:04:35.120> big

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
they are big

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:43.829 
they are big
millions<00:04:36.169> they<00:04:36.349> do<00:04:36.409> take<00:04:36.650> longer<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:37.039> charge

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:43.839 

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:47.049 

works<00:04:44.839> just<00:04:45.080> fine<00:04:45.229> there<00:04:45.589> it<00:04:45.710> is<00:04:45.830> 99%<00:04:46.669> power

00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:47.059 
works just fine there it is 99% power

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:48.519 
works just fine there it is 99% power
I've<00:04:47.330> been<00:04:47.509> stuck<00:04:47.809> at<00:04:47.839> there<00:04:48.169> since<00:04:48.409> this

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:48.529 
I've been stuck at there since this

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:50.200 
I've been stuck at there since this
morning<00:04:48.740> even<00:04:49.039> I've<00:04:49.279> used<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.729> phone<00:04:49.939> pretty

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
morning even I've used the phone pretty

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.730 
morning even I've used the phone pretty
heavily<00:04:52.059> so<00:04:53.059> that's<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.449> zero<00:04:53.689> lemon<00:04:54.319> battery

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
heavily so that's the zero lemon battery

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.129 
heavily so that's the zero lemon battery

here<00:05:17.569> where<00:05:17.689> you<00:05:17.749> have<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.020> little<00:05:18.259> rubbery

here where you have the little rubbery
edges<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.490> could<00:05:19.610> be<00:05:19.729> a<00:05:19.759> little<00:05:20.029> bit<00:05:20.150> tighter
