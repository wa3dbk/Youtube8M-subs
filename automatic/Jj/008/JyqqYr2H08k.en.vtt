00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.370 

now<00:00:00.960> let's<00:00:01.290> look<00:00:01.620> at<00:00:01.890> how<00:00:02.520> do<00:00:02.580> we<00:00:02.820> represent

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
now let's look at how do we represent

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.860 
now let's look at how do we represent
sign<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.770> numbers<00:00:05.160> okay<00:00:05.609> what<00:00:06.299> do<00:00:06.509> we<00:00:06.569> mean<00:00:06.839> by

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
sign the numbers okay what do we mean by

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.900 
sign the numbers okay what do we mean by
sign<00:00:07.379> numbers<00:00:07.970> sign<00:00:08.970> numbers<00:00:09.450> means<00:00:09.809> positive

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
sign numbers sign numbers means positive

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.900 
sign numbers sign numbers means positive
numbers<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.330> negative<00:00:13.790> numbers<00:00:14.790> okay

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
numbers and negative numbers okay

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.630 
numbers and negative numbers okay
we<00:00:17.910> are<00:00:18.029> going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.449> look<00:00:18.600> at<00:00:18.840> how<00:00:19.369> positive<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
we are going to look at how positive and

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.590 
we are going to look at how positive and
negative<00:00:21.510> numbers<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.760> represented<00:00:23.760> in

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
negative numbers are represented in

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.990 
negative numbers are represented in
binary<00:00:25.500> number<00:00:26.340> system

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
binary number system

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.780 
binary number system
okay<00:00:28.910> so<00:00:29.910> first<00:00:30.900> way<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:32.360> representation<00:00:33.360> is

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
okay so first way of representation is

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.209 
okay so first way of representation is
sign-magnitude<00:00:36.410> method<00:00:37.489> okay

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
sign-magnitude method okay

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:48.350 
sign-magnitude method okay
sign-magnitude<00:00:42.530> method<00:00:44.960> right<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.730> this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
sign-magnitude method right so in this

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.529 
sign-magnitude method right so in this
method<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:52.820> we<00:00:53.820> add<00:00:54.120> an<00:00:54.989> extra<00:00:55.440> bit

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
method what we do is we add an extra bit

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:09.520 
method what we do is we add an extra bit
add<00:00:57.539> an<00:00:58.160> extra<00:00:59.160> bit<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.820> left<00:01:06.950> to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
add an extra bit to the left to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:17.330 
add an extra bit to the left to
represent<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.890> sign<00:01:11.580> okay<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> now<00:01:17.040> let's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
represent the sign okay so now let's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.999 
represent the sign okay so now let's
understand<00:01:18.210> how<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:21.500> represent<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.619> number

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
understand how do we represent a number

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.990 
understand how do we represent a number
in<00:01:23.130> sign-magnitude<00:01:24.259> method<00:01:25.369> suppose<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.520> have

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
in sign-magnitude method suppose I have

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.630 
in sign-magnitude method suppose I have
to<00:01:27.630> represent<00:01:28.700> plus<00:01:29.700> 25<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:32.090> minus<00:01:33.740> 25<00:01:34.740> okay

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
to represent plus 25 and minus 25 okay

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.330 
to represent plus 25 and minus 25 okay
so<00:01:36.390> let's<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.990> how<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
so let's see how do we do it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:51.139 
so let's see how do we do it
first<00:01:41.570> step<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:45.890> represent<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:50.280> number<00:01:50.850> in

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
first step is represent the number in

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.000 
first step is represent the number in
binary<00:01:56.119> okay

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
binary okay

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.260 
binary okay
so<00:01:58.850> when<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.210> say<00:01:59.570> number<00:01:59.930> I<00:02:00.590> mean<00:02:01.460> number

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
so when I say number I mean number

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:11.860 
so when I say number I mean number
without<00:02:03.230> any<00:02:03.850> sign<00:02:04.900> okay<00:02:06.310> number<00:02:10.630> without<00:02:11.630> any

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
without any sign okay number without any

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:20.680 
without any sign okay number without any
sign<00:02:12.620> in<00:02:12.920> binary<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:19.150> if<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.420> are<00:02:20.480> talking

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
sign in binary so if you are talking

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.670 
sign in binary so if you are talking
about<00:02:20.930> plus<00:02:21.440> 25<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.520> am<00:02:22.730> saying<00:02:23.270> represent<00:02:24.020> just

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
about plus 25 I am saying represent just

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.370 
about plus 25 I am saying represent just
25<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.880> binary<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.600> my<00:02:27.470> second<00:02:28.570> step<00:02:29.570> is<00:02:30.700> add

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
25 in binary and my second step is add

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:48.540 
25 in binary and my second step is add
an<00:02:33.460> extra<00:02:34.460> bit<00:02:40.630> 0f<00:02:42.070> positive<00:02:44.350> one<00:02:45.370> if<00:02:46.370> negative

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
an extra bit 0f positive one if negative

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.720 
an extra bit 0f positive one if negative
okay

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
okay

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.210 
okay
so<00:02:50.480> let's<00:02:51.230> see<00:02:51.530> how<00:02:51.770> do<00:02:51.830> we<00:02:52.040> represent<00:02:53.410> plus<00:02:54.410> 25

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
so let's see how do we represent plus 25

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.470 
so let's see how do we represent plus 25
over<00:02:55.520> here

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
over here

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.590 
over here
so<00:02:56.980> plus<00:02:57.980> 25<00:02:58.970> first<00:02:59.530> step<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:01.450> represent<00:03:02.450> the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
so plus 25 first step is represent the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.730 
so plus 25 first step is represent the
number<00:03:02.959> without<00:03:03.140> sign<00:03:03.910> binary<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.270> what<00:03:05.480> is<00:03:05.740> 25

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
number without sign binary so what is 25

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:17.020 
number without sign binary so what is 25
in<00:03:06.890> binary<00:03:07.570> 25<00:03:08.570> in<00:03:08.870> binary<00:03:09.350> is<00:03:10.240> 1<00:03:11.240> 1<00:03:12.130> 0<00:03:13.130> 0<00:03:13.459> 1<00:03:14.260> ok<00:03:16.030> 0

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
in binary 25 in binary is 1 1 0 0 1 ok 0

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.080 
in binary 25 in binary is 1 1 0 0 1 ok 0
1<00:03:17.450> 2<00:03:17.810> 3<00:03:18.110> 4<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.760> what<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:20.420> 2<00:03:20.989> raise<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.290> 4<00:03:22.090> 2

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
1 2 3 4 so what is this 2 raise to 4 2

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.220 
1 2 3 4 so what is this 2 raise to 4 2
raise<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.450> 3<00:03:24.200> hand<00:03:25.060> raise<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.360> 0<00:03:26.390> 2<00:03:26.780> raise<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:26.959> 4

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
raise to 3 hand raise to 0 2 raise to 4

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.550 
raise to 3 hand raise to 0 2 raise to 4
is<00:03:27.350> 16<00:03:27.500> plus<00:03:28.130> 2<00:03:28.310> raise<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.489> 3<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:28.880> 8<00:03:29.090> 24<00:03:29.870> plus<00:03:30.380> 2

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
is 16 plus 2 raise to 3 is 8 24 plus 2

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.000 
is 16 plus 2 raise to 3 is 8 24 plus 2
raised<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.739> 0<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:31.190> 1<00:03:31.220> 24<00:03:31.970> plus<00:03:32.150> 1<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.330> 25<00:03:32.480> okay<00:03:33.350> so

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
raised to 0 is 1 24 plus 1 is 25 okay so

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.190 
raised to 0 is 1 24 plus 1 is 25 okay so
this<00:03:34.160> is<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.610> right<00:03:35.320> representation<00:03:36.320> of<00:03:36.650> 25

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
this is the right representation of 25

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.330 
this is the right representation of 25
or<00:03:39.400> 25<00:03:40.400> yeah<00:03:40.640> this<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.300> 25<00:03:41.950> what<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.100> my<00:03:43.280> next

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
or 25 yeah this is 25 what is my next

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.660 
or 25 yeah this is 25 what is my next
step<00:03:43.760> add<00:03:44.120> an<00:03:44.390> extra<00:03:44.780> bit<00:03:45.020> 0<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.709> positive<00:03:45.920> 1<00:03:46.459> if

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
step add an extra bit 0 is positive 1 if

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.290 
step add an extra bit 0 is positive 1 if
negative

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
negative

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.660 
negative
I<00:03:47.450> am<00:03:47.510> saying<00:03:47.780> plus<00:03:48.050> 25<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:48.800> my<00:03:49.220> number<00:03:49.550> is

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
I am saying plus 25 so my number is

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:59.010 
I am saying plus 25 so my number is
positive<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:53.050> add<00:03:54.050> an<00:03:54.500> extra<00:03:55.400> bit<00:03:55.790> over<00:03:56.330> here<00:03:57.340> 0

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
positive so add an extra bit over here 0

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.760 
positive so add an extra bit over here 0
so<00:04:00.020> similarly<00:04:00.620> if<00:04:00.920> you<00:04:01.160> have<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.670> represent

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
so similarly if you have to represent

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.270 
so similarly if you have to represent
oops<00:04:03.770> if<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.730> have<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.300> represent<00:04:05.560> minus<00:04:06.560> 25

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
oops if you have to represent minus 25

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.800 
oops if you have to represent minus 25
you<00:04:08.120> are<00:04:08.150> going<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.600> repeat<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.170> same<00:04:09.470> process

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
you are going to repeat the same process

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.680 
you are going to repeat the same process
first<00:04:11.200> what<00:04:11.590> is<00:04:11.620> 25<00:04:12.130> 25<00:04:12.760> is<00:04:12.790> one<00:04:13.150> one<00:04:13.360> zero<00:04:13.569> zero

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
first what is 25 25 is one one zero zero

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.789 
first what is 25 25 is one one zero zero
one<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:15.280> are<00:04:15.370> going<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.910> add<00:04:16.209> one<00:04:16.799> since

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
one and you are going to add one since

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.280 
one and you are going to add one since
this<00:04:18.130> number<00:04:18.549> is<00:04:19.290> negative<00:04:20.669> okay<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.750> that's

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
this number is negative okay so that's

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.640 
this number is negative okay so that's
how<00:04:23.830> you<00:04:23.889> represent<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.760> number<00:04:24.970> in

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
how you represent a number in

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.940 
how you represent a number in
sign-magnitude<00:04:27.780> method<00:04:28.780> okay

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
sign-magnitude method okay

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.950 
sign-magnitude method okay
now<00:04:30.580> my<00:04:31.620> second<00:04:32.620> method<00:04:32.950> is<00:04:34.770> ones<00:04:35.770> complement

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
now my second method is ones complement

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:46.830 
now my second method is ones complement
method<00:04:38.940> ones<00:04:40.350> complement<00:04:41.350> method<00:04:45.389> here<00:04:46.389> what

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
method ones complement method here what

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:55.590 
method ones complement method here what
I<00:04:46.870> do<00:04:47.080> is<00:04:51.150> my<00:04:52.680> positive<00:04:54.120> number<00:04:55.120> is

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
I do is my positive number is

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.260 
I do is my positive number is
represented
