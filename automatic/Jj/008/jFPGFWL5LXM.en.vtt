applications<00:00:33.120> i<00:00:36.649> will<00:00:37.649> demonstrate<00:00:37.829> gravity

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
applications i will demonstrate gravity

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.000 
applications i will demonstrate gravity
board<00:00:40.760> you<00:00:41.760> shake<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.239> phone<00:00:42.770> once<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.860> get

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
board you shake the phone once you get

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.180 
board you shake the phone once you get
that<00:00:44.100> little<00:00:44.280> arrow<00:00:44.579> grab<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> day<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.039> do

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that little arrow grab a day you can do

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.450 
that little arrow grab a day you can do
it<00:00:47.340> every<00:00:47.610> foot<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> phone<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.840> shakes

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.920 

you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.640> change<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> zero<00:00:54.329> gravity<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you can change it to zero gravity to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.119 
you can change it to zero gravity to
change<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> learn<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.890> could<00:00:56.039> do

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
change it to learn and you could do

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.490 
change it to learn and you could do
whatever<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.460> want<00:00:56.670> into<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.329> custom<00:00:57.539> see

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
whatever you want into it the custom see

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.770 
whatever you want into it the custom see
they're<00:00:58.649> all<00:00:58.739> messed<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.300> and<00:01:00.300> once<00:01:00.449> i<00:01:00.539> click

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
they're all messed up and once i click

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.009 
they're all messed up and once i click
the<00:01:00.989> home<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.559> goes<00:01:01.739> back<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.010> normal<00:01:02.750> so<00:01:03.750> yeah

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the home it goes back to normal so yeah

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.530 
the home it goes back to normal so yeah
that's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.439> demonstration<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.570> how<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
that's a demonstration so how and

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.359 
that's a demonstration so how and
barrels<00:01:09.540> will<00:01:10.439> show<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:11.010> now<00:01:11.900> barrels

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
barrels will show you right now barrels

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:22.070 
barrels will show you right now barrels
what<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:18.090> slide<00:01:18.740> yeah<00:01:19.740> slide

what you do is you you slide yeah slide
which<00:01:22.740> how<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:24.260> it's<00:01:25.260> an<00:01:25.410> app<00:01:25.620> on

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
which how do you get that it's an app on

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.360 
which how do you get that it's an app on
cydia<00:01:27.170> download<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.950> whatever<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.280> want

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
okay so really you can change it to

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.370 
okay so really you can change it to
whatever<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:34.800> whatever<00:01:35.570> okay<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:37.230> is

mine if you go slow you can see two hot
songs<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.000> apps<00:01:43.970> right<00:01:44.970> there<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.720> that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
songs of the apps right there see that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.000 
songs of the apps right there see that
yeah<00:01:47.150> and<00:01:48.150> it's<00:01:48.360> tube<00:01:48.600> slide

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010

show you the inside and outside version

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.800 
show you the inside and outside version
of<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.850> cube<00:03:50.760> I'll<00:03:51.760> show<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.330> outside

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
of the cube I'll show you the outside

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.390 
of the cube I'll show you the outside
version<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.350> think<00:03:53.560> that's<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.860> second<00:03:54.250> best

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
version I think that's the second best

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.930 
version I think that's the second best
the<00:03:55.360> first<00:03:55.600> best<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:56.230> curl<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.150> turn<00:03:58.150> whatever

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
the first best is curl and turn whatever

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.259 
the first best is curl and turn whatever
you<00:04:00.940> can<00:04:01.120> see<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.390> cube<00:04:01.720> right<00:04:02.290> there<00:04:02.940> yeah<00:04:03.940> it

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
you can see the cube right there yeah it

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.140 
you can see the cube right there yeah it
makes<00:04:04.510> like<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.720> king<00:04:05.340> mine<00:04:06.930> mine<00:04:07.930> is<00:04:08.140> called<00:04:08.500> on

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
makes like a king mine mine is called on

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.449 
makes like a king mine mine is called on
curl<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.360> roll<00:04:10.660> away<00:04:11.019> that's<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:12.040> one<00:04:12.280> that's

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
curl and roll away that's the one that's

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:21.210 
curl and roll away that's the one that's
rated<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.090> most<00:04:13.120> out<00:04:13.810> of<00:04:13.870> all<00:04:14.470> those<00:04:15.060> eight<00:04:20.220> so
