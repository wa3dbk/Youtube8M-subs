00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.270
 two 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.050
 two 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.390
 let's determine is important to pass 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.390
 for a building 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.480
 that has the following data a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.600
 dead load of 300 kilograms on the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.449
 square meter same load of 190 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.950
 kilograms over the square meter a 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.760
 seismic coefficient 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.750
 of 0.36 and a behavior factor of 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.120
 test 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.450
 feels step is to get the street of 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.250
 service which we obtain adding the 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:02.270
 death charge to a total of 995 grams 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.140
 per square meter the area is 300 meters 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.380
 squares 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.229
 and the total load of the mezzanine that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.409
 get multiplying the 300 meters 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.119
 squares by the 990 kilograms we can 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.119
 then take the next step of this 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.900
 get the total weight of the building on 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.140
 which is obtained by multiplying the 297 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.330
 milligrams that starts at every 55 and 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.759
 is the number of levels we have in 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.930
 this building is not a result of a 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.450
 million 485 thousand kilograms 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.090
 this data will be used to attack the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.759
 important basal which they have with 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.759
 the formula v is equal to this between 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.390
 is the typical coefficient and q is the 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.860
 behavior factor that we have 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:58.670
 all this we do not justify by a million 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.780
 485 thousand and they gave us results of 172 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.930
 one thousand 200 kilograms 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.740
 next step is to determine which 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.200
 they exist in each of the levels 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.550
 this is not thirty and fifty with five 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.730
 levels 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.730
 then we went for the style 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.630
 h means the height that you have to 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.530
 stay that floor on the first level 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.110
 we have a height of 5 meters 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.240
 in the second we have a height of 4 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.240
 meters that added to the 59 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.269
 the room 17 meters 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.079
 and the fifth 20 meters 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.720
 the w is what we have in mind 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.960
 mezzanine we had said that we had 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.150
 a load of 297 thousand kilograms 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.150
 then like all the levels 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.410
 to get double today and yesterday and it 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.420
 comes multiplying the class height 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.420
 floor by the weight of it 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.030
 and that we will do in each of 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.030
 the levels to determine the force 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.890
 has the important wind go through the 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.890
 summation 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.010
 and Canada was the same as each of the 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.010
 our points 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.710
 once we build the accounts of 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:05.540
 each of the floors we are going to put them 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.380
 in the representation of our building 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:16.000
 nor is it in court on the first level 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.000
 we have 300 and 20 grams and so we go 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.350
 at the corresponding level 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.380
 to do that we had the result 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.930
 correct when adding all these doors 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.510
 they have to give us the same result 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.330
 that our important bazaar 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.960
 this means that our building is worth 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.300
 of the same force towards the side 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.449
 opposite and the strength of our 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.449
 side
