00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
I heard in other videos was that the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.380 
I heard in other videos was that the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.420 
does but I don't think it's like a
major<00:02:27.000> because<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.080> hair<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.160> longer

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
major because it is hair and the longer

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.010 
major because it is hair and the longer
the<00:02:29.550> hair<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.180> mean<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.630> more<00:02:30.810> it's<00:02:30.900> going

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
the hair is I mean the more it's going

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.320 
the hair is I mean the more it's going
to<00:02:31.140> share<00:02:31.320> especially<00:02:31.800> if<00:02:32.490> girls<00:02:32.910> would<00:02:33.120> play
