00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
here where we've got the possibility to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
here where we've got the possibility to
change<00:01:34.380> these<00:01:34.590> doors<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> four<00:01:35.700> key<00:01:35.939> code

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.640 
change these doors to the four key code
which<00:01:36.509> means<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.900> they'll<00:01:37.170> all<00:01:37.409> be

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
which means that they'll all be

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.109 
which means that they'll all be
surrounded<00:01:38.159> by<00:01:38.250> guards<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.820> you'll<00:01:38.970> get

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
surrounded by guards so you'll get

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.580 
surrounded by guards so you'll get
another<00:01:39.210> six<00:01:39.780> extra<00:01:41.270> people<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.450> security<00:01:43.259> if

easily dispatched up to the freeze room

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.250 
easily dispatched up to the freeze room
obviously<00:02:36.950> but<00:02:37.370> it's<00:02:37.550> quite<00:02:38.200> important<00:02:39.200> to

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
obviously but it's quite important to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.480 
obviously but it's quite important to
have<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.470> freeze<00:02:39.709> room<00:02:39.920> next<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.280> bio

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
have you freeze room next to the bio

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.140 
have you freeze room next to the bio
tanks<00:02:41.000> are<00:02:41.600> positioned<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.230> bio<00:02:42.470> tanks<00:02:42.830> here

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
tanks are positioned the bio tanks here

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.990 
tanks are positioned the bio tanks here
so<00:02:44.150> I'll<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.690> do<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:44.990> now<00:02:45.400> right<00:02:46.400> click<00:02:46.670> on

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
on the bio tank there you go you gonna

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.420 
on the bio tank there you go you gonna
the<00:02:54.260> Freak<00:02:54.650> being<00:02:55.310> produced

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
the Freak being produced

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.009 
the Freak being produced
so<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:59.620> I<00:02:59.709> said<00:02:59.769> this<00:03:00.099> whole<00:03:00.569> south<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.810> north

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
so as I said this whole south to north

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.170 
so as I said this whole south to north
access<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.829> base<00:03:03.010> moving<00:03:03.730> up<00:03:03.909> through

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
access of the base moving up through

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.399 
access of the base moving up through
this<00:03:04.900> area<00:03:05.230> into<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.430> armory<00:03:06.879> itself<00:03:07.409> with

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
this area into the armory itself with

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.539 
this area into the armory itself with
multiple<00:03:08.890> death<00:03:09.099> cubicles<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:11.549> then

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
multiple death cubicles and then

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.080 
multiple death cubicles and then
basically<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:13.599> configuration<00:03:14.319> takes<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:15.090> in

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
basically the configuration takes you in

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.500 
basically the configuration takes you in
a<00:03:16.209> corridor<00:03:16.659> right<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.439> way<00:03:17.590> around<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
a corridor right the way around the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.420 
a corridor right the way around the
volcano<00:03:21.030> opening<00:03:22.030> itself<00:03:22.599> so<00:03:23.590> going<00:03:23.920> running

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
volcano opening itself so going running

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.030 
volcano opening itself so going running
round<00:03:24.810> all<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.840> way<00:03:26.019> around<00:03:26.139> and<00:03:26.680> obviously

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
round all the way around and obviously

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.780 
round all the way around and obviously

principle<00:04:28.800> in<00:04:28.889> the<00:04:29.039> design<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:30.350> carried<00:04:31.350> on<00:04:31.500> so

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
principle in the design is carried on so

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.240 
principle in the design is carried on so
we<00:04:31.919> go<00:04:32.100> carry<00:04:32.550> on<00:04:32.639> going<00:04:32.880> north<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.510> we<00:04:33.570> get<00:04:33.750> to

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
we go carry on going north and we get to

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.120 
we go carry on going north and we get to
this<00:04:35.250> symmetrical<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.449> control<00:04:37.289> room<00:04:37.560> keep

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
this symmetrical and control room keep

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.730 
this symmetrical and control room keep
your<00:04:38.310> control<00:04:38.760> rooms<00:04:39.030> quite<00:04:39.389> thin<00:04:39.840> because

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
your control rooms quite thin because

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.090 
your control rooms quite thin because
these<00:04:41.130> two<00:04:41.490> white<00:04:41.820> screens<00:04:42.919> when<00:04:43.919> they're<00:04:44.070> on

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
these two white screens when they're on

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.400 
these two white screens when they're on
you'll<00:04:44.610> get<00:04:44.789> an<00:04:44.910> arc<00:04:45.180> of<00:04:45.419> influence<00:04:45.930> from<00:04:46.110> them

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
you'll get an arc of influence from them

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.460 
you'll get an arc of influence from them
we<00:04:47.220> won't<00:04:47.370> get<00:04:47.550> much<00:04:47.820> more<00:04:48.120> than<00:04:48.539> about<00:04:49.260> this

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
we won't get much more than about this

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.010 
we won't get much more than about this
area<00:04:49.770> here<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:51.060> keep<00:04:51.300> your<00:04:51.449> control<00:04:51.840> rooms

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020

quite<00:04:52.320> thin<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:52.740> long<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.550> get<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.120> best

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
quite thin and long and get the best

and<00:05:07.200> then<00:05:07.860> obviously<00:05:07.979> in<00:05:08.370> most<00:05:08.550> expensive

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
and then obviously in most expensive

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.629 
and then obviously in most expensive
pieces<00:05:09.419> of<00:05:09.570> equipment<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.229> research<00:05:10.620> area<00:05:11.099> is

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
pieces of equipment the research area is

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.230 
pieces of equipment the research area is
in<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.060> final<00:05:12.510> section<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:14.250> volcano<00:05:14.729> cave

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
in the final section of the volcano cave

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.610 
in the final section of the volcano cave
and<00:05:15.800> with<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:17.460> furthest<00:05:17.910> point<00:05:18.300> but<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:19.020> far

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
and with the furthest point but the far

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.250 
and with the furthest point but the far
north<00:05:20.010> of<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.430> axis<00:05:22.310> obviously<00:05:23.310> kept<00:05:23.849> for<00:05:24.260> the

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
north of the axis obviously kept for the

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.589 
north of the axis obviously kept for the
man<00:05:25.530> or<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.400> robot<00:05:27.200> himself<00:05:28.580> from<00:05:29.580> so<00:05:30.389> just

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
man or the robot himself from so just

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.999 
man or the robot himself from so just
flying<00:05:30.840> back<00:05:31.169> south

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
flying back south

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.790 
flying back south
over<00:05:34.009> this<00:05:34.639> entire<00:05:34.880> base<00:05:35.389> and<00:05:36.350> we'll<00:05:36.590> get<00:05:36.770> a

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
over this entire base and we'll get a

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.469 
over this entire base and we'll get a
good<00:05:37.070> idea<00:05:37.250> of<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:38.830> layout<00:05:39.830> so<00:05:40.490> from<00:05:41.360> the

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
good idea of the layout so from the

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.409 
good idea of the layout so from the
inner<00:05:41.570> sanctum<00:05:41.870> going<00:05:42.680> across<00:05:43.419> training

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
inner sanctum going across training

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.890 
inner sanctum going across training
rooms<00:05:45.550> didn't<00:05:46.550> show<00:05:46.729> you<00:05:46.789> that<00:05:46.940> barrack<00:05:47.419> area

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
rooms didn't show you that barrack area

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.909 
rooms didn't show you that barrack area
here<00:05:48.380> all<00:05:48.740> individual<00:05:49.550> cubicles<00:05:51.490> coming<00:05:52.490> back

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
here all individual cubicles coming back

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:01.480 
here all individual cubicles coming back
across<00:05:54.919> the<00:05:57.070> volcano<00:05:59.560> opening<00:06:00.560> which<00:06:00.949> is<00:06:01.160> one

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
across the volcano opening which is one

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.909 
across the volcano opening which is one
of<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.759> parts<00:06:02.150> for<00:06:02.419> the<00:06:02.479> doomsday<00:06:03.470> rocket

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
of the parts for the doomsday rocket

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.790 
of the parts for the doomsday rocket
probably<00:06:04.699> built<00:06:04.910> and<00:06:05.180> ready<00:06:05.300> to<00:06:05.570> go<00:06:05.750> and<00:06:06.050> then

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
probably built and ready to go and then

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.080 
probably built and ready to go and then

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
carrying on down back through this

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.529 
carrying on down back through this
linear<00:06:12.280> shaped<00:06:14.889> entrance<00:06:15.889> past<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:17.000> hotel

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
linear shaped entrance past the hotel

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:21.520
