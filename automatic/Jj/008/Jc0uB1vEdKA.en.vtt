so you know everyone's familiar with the
tripod<00:00:14.270> three<00:00:14.780> legs<00:00:15.020> they<00:00:15.350> pack<00:00:15.590> down<00:00:15.620> but<00:00:16.610> the

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
tripod three legs they pack down but the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.580 
tripod three legs they pack down but the
thing<00:00:17.000> about<00:00:17.030> these<00:00:17.420> ones<00:00:17.720> is<00:00:17.960> well<00:00:18.380> if<00:00:18.470> you

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
thing about these ones is well if you

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.500 
thing about these ones is well if you
stop<00:00:18.800> there<00:00:18.980> it<00:00:19.070> looks<00:00:19.220> kinda<00:00:19.550> naughty<00:00:19.730> but

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
stop there it looks kinda naughty but

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.230 
stop there it looks kinda naughty but
you<00:00:21.230> can<00:00:21.439> fold<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.130> legs<00:00:22.369> so<00:00:22.880> then<00:00:23.060> they

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
you can fold the legs so then they

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.060 
you can fold the legs so then they
actually<00:00:23.600> all<00:00:23.720> pack<00:00:24.020> flat<00:00:24.380> this<00:00:24.619> will<00:00:24.800> Bank<00:00:24.950> a

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
actually all pack flat this will Bank a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.310 
actually all pack flat this will Bank a
lot<00:00:25.220> more<00:00:25.400> sense<00:00:25.610> if<00:00:25.760> you<00:00:25.850> see<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:26.180> close-up<00:00:26.480> so

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
lot more sense if you see it close-up so

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.780 
lot more sense if you see it close-up so
you<00:00:27.410> can<00:00:27.560> see<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:27.860> top<00:00:28.070> plate<00:00:28.279> on<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:28.550> one

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
you can see the top plate on this one

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.810 
you can see the top plate on this one
runs<00:00:29.210> in<00:00:30.169> a<00:00:30.380> straight<00:00:30.439> line<00:00:30.710> rather<00:00:31.279> than<00:00:31.669> in

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
runs in a straight line rather than in

kind of a triangular shape as a normal
one<00:00:33.950> which<00:00:34.640> is<00:00:34.910> what<00:00:35.150> allows<00:00:35.570> it<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.870> pack<00:00:36.500> flat

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
one which is what allows it to pack flat

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.560 
one which is what allows it to pack flat
like<00:00:37.130> this<00:00:37.310> guy<00:00:37.550> down<00:00:38.210> here<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:41.090> rest<00:00:41.300> of<00:00:41.450> the

you<00:02:22.870> have<00:02:23.020> that<00:02:23.530> becomes<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.190> really<00:02:24.430> really

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
you have that becomes a really really

tall one these are they come in four and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.790 
tall one these are they come in four and
five<00:02:27.340> section<00:02:27.790> legs<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.360> it's<00:02:28.959> eight<00:02:29.200> eight

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
five section legs and it's eight eight

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
layers of carbon on the legs okay now

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.280 
layers of carbon on the legs okay now
first<00:02:33.040> looking<00:02:33.520> at<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.910> did<00:02:34.180> think<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:34.989> how's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
first looking at it I did think so how's

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.260 
first looking at it I did think so how's
the<00:02:35.590> stability<00:02:36.160> going<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.430> be<00:02:36.610> with<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.120> like

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
the stability going to be with it like

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.540 
the stability going to be with it like
this<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.690> legs<00:02:37.930> aren't<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.770> perfect

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
this the legs aren't in a perfect

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.610 
this the legs aren't in a perfect
configuration<00:02:40.150> with<00:02:40.780> equal<00:02:41.230> distance

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
configuration with equal distance

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.250 
configuration with equal distance
between<00:02:41.800> them<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.459> that's<00:02:43.390> true<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.200> still

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
between them and that's true I still

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.170 
between them and that's true I still
have<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.890> concern<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.670> guess<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.030> would

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
have that concern but I guess you would

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.000 
have that concern but I guess you would
need<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.660> make<00:02:47.290> sure<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.650> weight<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:47.980> your

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
need to make sure the weight of your

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.890 
need to make sure the weight of your
camera<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.520> definitely<00:02:48.850> over<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.630> front<00:02:49.840> leg

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
camera is definitely over the front leg

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.840 
camera is definitely over the front leg
to<00:02:50.320> make<00:02:50.470> sure<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.770> doesn't<00:02:51.100> fall<00:02:51.130> backwards

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
to make sure it doesn't fall backwards

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.280 
to make sure it doesn't fall backwards
and<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.930> one<00:02:53.140> which<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:54.420> c-119<00:02:55.420> 2t

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
and this one which is the c-119 2t

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.210 
and this one which is the c-119 2t
carbon<00:02:56.950> fiber<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.400> mag<00:02:57.640> alloy<00:02:58.090> is

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
carbon fiber and mag alloy is

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.729 
carbon fiber and mag alloy is
extraordinarily<00:03:00.220> light<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:02.380> know<00:03:02.500> there's

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
extraordinarily light you know there's

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.699 
extraordinarily light you know there's
always<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:03.070> trade-off<00:03:03.430> between<00:03:04.709> potentially

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
always a trade-off between potentially

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.160 
always a trade-off between potentially
between<00:03:05.860> rigidity<00:03:06.610> but<00:03:06.850> then<00:03:07.060> light<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.930> good

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
between rigidity but then light is good

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.770 
between rigidity but then light is good
for<00:03:08.200> travel<00:03:08.769> but<00:03:09.010> heavy<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.519> good<00:03:09.790> for<00:03:10.120> making

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
for travel but heavy is good for making

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.920 
for travel but heavy is good for making
sure<00:03:10.989> with<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.470> knock<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:12.070> doesn't<00:03:12.459> get<00:03:12.610> moved

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
sure with a knock it doesn't get moved

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.820 
sure with a knock it doesn't get moved
rigidity<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.019> something<00:03:14.350> different<00:03:14.530> that's

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
rigidity is something different that's

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.270 
rigidity is something different that's
how<00:03:15.100> actually<00:03:15.840> flexible<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.500> fabric<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.190> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
how actually flexible the fabric and the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.220 
how actually flexible the fabric and the
material<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:18.820> it's<00:03:19.030> made<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:19.780> if

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
material that it's made of is and if

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.140 
material that it's made of is and if
there's<00:03:20.470> any<00:03:20.680> wobble<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.850> going<00:03:22.090> to

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
there's any wobble is that going to

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.850 
there's any wobble is that going to
translate<00:03:22.299> through<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.140> thing<00:03:23.350> which<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.709> you

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
translate through the thing which is you

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.949 
translate through the thing which is you
know<00:03:23.980> aluminium<00:03:24.820> is<00:03:24.910> actually<00:03:25.299> lighter<00:03:25.570> than

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
know aluminium is actually lighter than

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.500 
know aluminium is actually lighter than
carbon<00:03:26.650> fiber<00:03:26.920> but<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.580> transmits<00:03:28.150> all<00:03:28.360> of

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
carbon fiber but it transmits all of

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.720 
carbon fiber but it transmits all of
that<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.720> lot<00:03:29.019> worse<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.920> this<00:03:30.100> one's<00:03:30.310> very

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
that a lot worse so this one's very

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.390 
that a lot worse so this one's very
light<00:03:31.030> for<00:03:31.660> travel<00:03:32.110> absolutely<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:32.920> think<00:03:33.070> this

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
light for travel absolutely I think this

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.660 
light for travel absolutely I think this
would<00:03:33.610> be<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.760> good<00:03:34.120> option<00:03:34.299> for<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:35.580> pricing<00:03:36.580> I

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
would be a good option for you pricing I

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.039 
would be a good option for you pricing I
don't<00:03:36.910> know<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.150> exact<00:03:37.390> pricing<00:03:37.840> on<00:03:37.930> the

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
don't know the exact pricing on the

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.300 
don't know the exact pricing on the
market<00:03:38.350> but<00:03:38.440> I'm<00:03:38.530> guessing<00:03:38.860> it's<00:03:39.010> somewhere

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
market but I'm guessing it's somewhere

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.340 
market but I'm guessing it's somewhere
sort<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:39.610> mid<00:03:39.820> range<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.660> just<00:03:40.959> want<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.230> be<00:03:41.320> a

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
sort of mid range you just want to be a

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.750 
sort of mid range you just want to be a
little<00:03:41.530> bit<00:03:41.680> careful<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.280> don't<00:03:42.489> put<00:03:42.730> any

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
little bit careful and don't put any

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.940 
little bit careful and don't put any
weight<00:03:43.150> over<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.570> back<00:03:43.840> section<00:03:44.230> because<00:03:44.799> as

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
weight over the back section because as

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.650 
weight over the back section because as
