00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hi, the ox people should discuss everything well today. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.340
 subject is about hair loss is a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.230
 question that many people ask is a 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.509
 of the most common complaints that the use 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.400
 blog then I decided to bring this subject 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.580
 here also for the ox channel in the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.619
 youtube what happens to our wires 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.689
 hair I've been there also to 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.269
 45 months ago my hair was 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.830
 falling is that our children 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.289
 they can be in three phases 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.599
 different or in the growth phase or 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.059
 in the transition or fall phase 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.100
 and it happens sometimes because of 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.770
 a shock in the system that can be 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.570
 stress may be some surgery or 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 some disease that you took for example 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.789
 have a stronger flu can cause 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.309
 this or any hormonal changes these 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.590
 three phases are very close and then more 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.449
 hair falls at the same time and we 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.660
 begins to realize this 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.300
 on the pillow sheet or else when 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.480
 wake up and when are you going to take a shower, huh? 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.579
 many strands falling hair loss 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.650
 can also be caused by several 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.430
 types of diseases have 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.200
 thyroid deficiencies of vitamin anemia 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.790
 so if your hair has fallen too much 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.470
 more than normal 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.150
 it is worth seeking a doctor to 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.090
 make a checate see if it's alright 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.189
 it is normal in your body to have 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.930
 periods when your hair falls more 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.740
 This is already bothering you. 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.210
 time 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.549
 it's worth checking to see if everything is 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.369
 right with your health 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.619
 in terms of treatment has no 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.229
 so you can pass on the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.450
 hair that will lessen the fall wash 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.640
 keeping hair clean is always good 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.400
 preferably with more neutral shampoos 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.200
 that are not too aggressive and avoid 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.329
 all these product types 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.850
 mainly these three books only 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.280
 of these products that stay in their hair 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.009
 may also weaken and may 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.780
 to ease the fall arresting hair as 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.790
 I'm learning now is also a 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.570
 which is to stimulate the fall of 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.000
 wires 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.799
 so if your hair is falling too much 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.990
 it's worth you to leave him the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.170
 correct then avoid doing tail 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.330
 of horse coke wear baby liss 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.569
 all that harms hair does with 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.909
 he then fell more wires 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.450
 let the hair simply clean well 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:20.959
 is a way to protect 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.319
 and prevent it from falling too far in relation to 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.749
 to food supplements or food 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.370
 that have biotin then biotin here 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:33.349
 where we will find biotin 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.840
 orange wheat germ eggs yoghurt honey 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.909
 All these are foods that have 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.370
 rich in biochemistry and also has 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.530
 some supplements of biotin 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.480
 help prevent hair loss 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.849
 The problem with these supplements is that 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.590
 well, it's more or less likely to have 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.319
 big clues that this is true 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.730
 that biotin accelerates weight gain 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.219
 just as most people do not 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.650
 want to gain weight sometimes 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:00.049
 of biotin is not going to do well 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.290
 more than biotin-containing foods are 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.269
 always good and vitamin B12 also helps 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.400
 to strengthen the wires 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.230
 the element that most have vitamin b12 is the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.769
 food that I hate that is liver of 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.840
 Ox if you like like but if you do not 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.849
 likes also have alternatives then to 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.139
 Most seafood seafood 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.000
 shrimp crab has vitamin b12 and if 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.579
 none of this matters to some fish 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.189
 Also salmon these fish of tuna 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.650
 cold water sea also has vitamin b12 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.840
 and pro-vitamin b12 there are also the 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.419
 supplements you can take 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.879
 if none of these had worked, 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.590
 a drug called minoxidil that 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.479
 it is usually indicated for men who 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.579
 they are starting to look bald but nothing 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:46.040
 prevents women from using 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.019
 stimulates yarn growth but this 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.090
 is a medicine then before use 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.280
 you need a doctor see if that is the case or 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.810
 same as I said before check if it is 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.359
 It's okay with your health, it 's just a 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.759
 phil falls problem and even there 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.500
 you can use these lotions based on 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.090
 corn that spiked that stimulate the 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.040
 yarn growth 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.500
 It's good, I hope you liked it.
