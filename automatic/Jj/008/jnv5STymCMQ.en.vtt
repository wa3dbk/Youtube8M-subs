your<00:00:15.000> weapon<00:00:15.450> at<00:00:15.599> different<00:00:16.020> ranges<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:17.160> at

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
your weapon at different ranges so at

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.189 
your weapon at different ranges so at
close<00:00:17.670> range<00:00:18.029> at<00:00:18.449> around<00:00:18.750> like<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.109> know

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
close range at around like you know

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.080 
close range at around like you know
point-blank<00:00:19.670> obviously<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.760> want<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.000> be

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
point-blank obviously you want to be

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.580 
point-blank obviously you want to be
holding<00:00:21.270> down<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> trigger<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.230> hope<00:00:22.380> that

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
holding down the trigger and I hope that

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.429 
holding down the trigger and I hope that
you<00:00:23.100> kill<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.430> guy<00:00:23.550> before<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.910> kills<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.439> but

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
you kill the guy before it kills you but

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.230 
you kill the guy before it kills you but
at<00:00:25.619> medium<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.220> long<00:00:26.400> range<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.910> stores<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
at medium to long range the stores a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.689 
at medium to long range the stores a
little<00:00:27.510> bit<00:00:27.630> different<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:29.400> distance

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
little bit different so this distance

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.759 
little bit different so this distance
that<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.269> right<00:00:30.480> here<00:00:30.539> from<00:00:31.260> me<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
that I have right here from me to the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.740 
that I have right here from me to the
wall<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.610> what<00:00:32.940> i<00:00:32.969> consider<00:00:33.360> medium

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
wall is about what i consider medium

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.950 
wall is about what i consider medium
distance<00:00:34.170> i<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.880> lot<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.180> my<00:00:36.329> engagements

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
distance i have a lot of my engagements

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.569 
distance i have a lot of my engagements
at<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:38.430> range<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.770> at<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.070> range<00:00:41.370> you

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
at this this range and at this range you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.459 
at this this range and at this range you
want<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.879> fire<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.329> around<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> five<00:00:43.020> round

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
want to fire at around the five round

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.440 
want to fire at around the five round
burst<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:44.579> I'm<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:45.059> right<00:00:45.090> now

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
burst so what I'm going to do right now

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.000 
burst so what I'm going to do right now
is<00:00:45.690> I'm<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.350> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> hold<00:00:46.770> down<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
is I'm just going to hold down the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.459 
is I'm just going to hold down the
trigger<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:48.090> let<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> guys<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
trigger to let you guys see what the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.209 
trigger to let you guys see what the
what<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.250> groupings<00:00:50.730> look<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:52.219> there

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
what the groupings look like and there

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.640 
what the groupings look like and there
we<00:00:53.309> go

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.230 

alright<00:00:58.650> so<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.190> don't<00:00:59.460> think<00:00:59.610> that's<00:00:59.700> too<00:01:00.060> bad

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
alright so I don't think that's too bad

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.530 
alright so I don't think that's too bad
for<00:01:00.450> an<00:01:00.540> assault<00:01:01.230> rifle<00:01:01.350> um<00:01:01.970> that's<00:01:02.970> primarily

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
for an assault rifle um that's primarily

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.990 
for an assault rifle um that's primarily
the<00:01:04.290> reason<00:01:04.440> why<00:01:04.710> i<00:01:04.740> use<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.950> AK<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.460> groupings

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the reason why i use a AK the groupings

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.930 
the reason why i use a AK the groupings
are<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.360> small<00:01:07.340> with<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> attachments

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
are really small with the attachments

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.790 
are really small with the attachments
that<00:01:08.970> I'm<00:01:09.150> using<00:01:09.330> alright<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.320> five<00:01:10.560> round

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
that I'm using alright so five round

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.670 
that I'm using alright so five round
burst<00:01:10.980> look<00:01:11.160> like<00:01:11.280> this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.600 

yeah<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:17.890> let's<00:01:18.040> take<00:01:18.189> a<00:01:18.220> look<00:01:18.430> at<00:01:18.520> the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
yeah so let's take a look at the

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.950 
yeah so let's take a look at the
groupings<00:01:19.060> you<00:01:19.780> can<00:01:19.900> see<00:01:20.020> it's<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.200> lot<00:01:20.350> smaller

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
groupings you can see it's a lot smaller

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.149 
groupings you can see it's a lot smaller
then<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.020> control<00:01:23.500> group<00:01:23.650> where<00:01:23.799> I<00:01:23.830> just<00:01:23.860> held

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
then the control group where I just held

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.350 
then the control group where I just held
it<00:01:24.220> on<00:01:24.310> triggers<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:24.850> that's<00:01:25.030> going<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.210> kill

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
it on triggers so that's going to kill

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.710 
it on triggers so that's going to kill
in<00:01:25.540> your<00:01:25.659> opponent<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.170> lot<00:01:26.380> faster<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.720> this

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
in your opponent a lot faster and this

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.780 
in your opponent a lot faster and this
is<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:28.899> whole<00:01:29.140> magazine<00:01:29.380> so<00:01:30.009> usually<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.490> kill

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
is a whole magazine so usually you kill

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.050 
is a whole magazine so usually you kill
your<00:01:31.060> phone<00:01:31.240> in<00:01:31.420> about<00:01:31.630> half<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.930> magazine<00:01:32.350> or<00:01:33.060> a

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
your phone in about half a magazine or a

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.700 
your phone in about half a magazine or a
quarter<00:01:34.630> depending<00:01:35.080> on<00:01:35.080> how<00:01:35.259> good<00:01:35.409> your<00:01:35.560> name

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
quarter depending on how good your name

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.990 
quarter depending on how good your name
is<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.009> how<00:01:36.130> cuz<00:01:36.280> your<00:01:36.369> recoil<00:01:36.640> control<00:01:36.880> is

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
is and how cuz your recoil control is

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.120 
is and how cuz your recoil control is
all<00:01:40.000> right<00:01:40.149> so<00:01:40.360> add<00:01:40.539> a<00:01:40.570> long<00:01:40.869> or<00:01:41.080> distance<00:01:41.500> you

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
all right so add a long or distance you

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.710 
all right so add a long or distance you
want<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.399> shoot<00:01:42.580> at<00:01:42.759> around<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.180> two<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.479> three

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
want to shoot at around a two to three

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.690 
want to shoot at around a two to three
round<00:01:43.930> bursts<00:01:44.320> with<00:01:44.619> breaks<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.130> between<00:01:45.159> to

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
round bursts with breaks in between to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.960 
round bursts with breaks in between to
reset<00:01:46.060> your<00:01:46.090> crosshair<00:01:46.840> on<00:01:46.869> your<00:01:47.319> opponent<00:01:47.770> so

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
reset your crosshair on your opponent so

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.820 
reset your crosshair on your opponent so
here's<00:01:48.970> what<00:01:49.149> that<00:01:49.179> looks<00:01:49.330> like<00:01:55.740> let's<00:01:56.740> see

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
here's what that looks like let's see

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.480 
here's what that looks like let's see
what<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.039> groupings<00:01:57.429> are<00:02:02.220> all<00:02:03.220> right<00:02:03.310> now

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
what the groupings are all right now

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.490 
what the groupings are all right now
there's<00:02:03.670> first<00:02:03.970> one<00:02:04.119> second<00:02:04.569> third<00:02:04.869> fourth

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
there's first one second third fourth

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.090 
there's first one second third fourth
fifth<00:02:05.770> sixth<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:06.700> seventh<00:02:07.240> so<00:02:08.049> I<00:02:10.920> mean<00:02:11.920> it

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
fifth sixth and seventh so I mean it

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.729 
fifth sixth and seventh so I mean it
depending<00:02:12.700> on<00:02:12.910> how<00:02:13.900> good<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.350> are<00:02:14.440> with

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
depending on how good you are with

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.289 
depending on how good you are with
recoil<00:02:15.220> control<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.730> groupings<00:02:16.060> will<00:02:16.209> be

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
recoil control the groupings will be

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.420 
recoil control the groupings will be
smaller<00:02:16.569> but<00:02:16.870> pretty<00:02:17.470> much<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.160> pretty

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
smaller but pretty much this is pretty
