going to need is some paper towels or an
old<00:00:42.030> towel<00:00:42.380> that<00:00:43.380> would<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.590> fine<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:43.980> well<00:00:44.390> in

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
old towel that would be fine as well in

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.030 
old towel that would be fine as well in
terms<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> location<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.530> where<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.890> rail

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.380 
terms of the location of where the rail
tape<00:00:47.280> goes<00:00:47.490> typically<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.060> mean<00:00:48.210> when<00:00:48.330> you

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
tape goes typically I mean when you

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.200 
tape goes typically I mean when you
think<00:00:48.420> about<00:00:48.630> your<00:00:48.930> paddling<00:00:49.350> stroke<00:00:50.210> once

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
think about your paddling stroke once

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.970 
think about your paddling stroke once
you<00:00:51.420> once<00:00:51.900> you<00:00:51.990> end<00:00:52.230> your<00:00:52.440> stroke<00:00:52.770> your

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you once you end your stroke your

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.770 
you once you end your stroke your
release<00:00:53.340> actually<00:00:53.790> happens<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.270> past<00:00:54.510> your

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
release actually happens right past your

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.990 
release actually happens right past your
heel<00:00:55.010> for<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.070> most<00:00:56.310> part<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.640> mean<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.820> lot<00:00:56.970> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
heel for the most part I mean a lot of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.250 
heel for the most part I mean a lot of
people<00:00:57.090> kind<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.480> go<00:00:57.630> a<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:57.870> bit<00:00:58.020> further

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
people kind of go a little bit further

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.220 
people kind of go a little bit further
behind<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.400> point<00:00:59.900> you<00:01:00.900> know<00:01:00.990> when<00:01:01.110> they're

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
behind that point you know when they're

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.810 
behind that point you know when they're
paddling<00:01:01.500> even<00:01:01.740> though<00:01:01.800> they<00:01:01.920> try<00:01:02.130> not<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.550> so

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
paddling even though they try not to so

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
paddling even though they try not to so
we<00:01:03.450> typically<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.990> to<00:01:04.049> go<00:01:04.259> from<00:01:04.559> about<00:01:04.650> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
we typically like to go from about you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.140 
we typically like to go from about you
know<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> midpoint<00:01:05.729> we're<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> be

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
know the midpoint we're going to be

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.789 
know the midpoint we're going to be
standing<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.229> probably<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.619> about

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
standing and then we probably go about

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.770 
standing and then we probably go about
six<00:01:08.189> six<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.610> eight<00:01:08.700> inches<00:01:09.060> beyond<00:01:09.570> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
six six to eight inches beyond that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.310 
six six to eight inches beyond that
point<00:01:09.990> further<00:01:10.530> back<00:01:11.990> alright<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.290> start

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
point further back alright so to start

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.050 
point further back alright so to start
you<00:01:13.799> want<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.009> apply<00:01:14.100> your<00:01:14.340> soapy<00:01:14.880> water

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
solution again I didn't kind of go over

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.790 
solution again I didn't kind of go over
the<00:01:17.360> amounts<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.540> about<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.930> part<00:01:19.290> so

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
the amounts but it's about one part so

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.950 
the amounts but it's about one part so
two<00:01:20.100> about<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.490> ten<00:01:20.729> times<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.240> water<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.780> you
