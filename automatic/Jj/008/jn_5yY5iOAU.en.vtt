00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Today I will tell you how to do 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:09.890
 sims 2 spyware interceptor 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.890
 keyboards based on the module and sleep 82 66 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.570
 hi there, this is a draft of the amp me 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.270
 name is Cyril and now we will collect 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.430
 device that intercepts data 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.410
 with everywhere keyboard and distributes them by 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.320
 Wi-Fi as a manager 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.700
 devices will use a mini spark 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.989
 analog arduino mini 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.450
 well, we also need a module and 182 66 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.090
 which will play the role of a bridge between 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.820
 serial of our platform and wireless 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.489
 network with it we will create a yew pi 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.920
 server to share data 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.350
 deciphered and and also hide us 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.980
 need some time and fluff for 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.230
 strapping 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.960
 to fulfill our task is necessary 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.329
 connect the device between the keyboard and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.199
 computer and not destroying communication 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.199
 in the following way 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.520
 call sparks will not and give speed 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.340
 search data packets from shinee screeching 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.560
 searching for information and pressing 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.200
 so come on and we had to 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.600
 use sm ent code not insert 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.230
 through the library in the hut but let you have it 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.420
 not scared 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.940
 all finished code with instructions you 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.490
 You can find further on 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.520
 sparks do not decipher the angle of compliance 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.500
 with table scan codes and publish through 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.020
 the server on from and 820 is open to us 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.960
 need two separate firmware 1 for 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.280
 control spark another to control and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.320
 sleep 82 66 for the new arduino and i.e. there is 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.630
 special application that allows 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.030
 select and drink as a target 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.030
 devices and install a sketch on it 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.220
 and right from Wednesday do not forget also about 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.899
 usb to serial adapter with it easier 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.900
 total program and 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.630
 spark less and and go to sleep now let's 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.700
 gaming device to start us 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.830
 bradford 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.620
 our wanderings module and from and with us 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.120
 powered by three and three volts therefore 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.770
 must use a converter 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.420
 tension in order to be 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.540
 need to connect some more 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.360
 piping connect the converter 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.550
 now using a variable resistor 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.550
 we will change the input voltage 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.660
 now connect the tx module ok rx spark 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.450
 and vice versa transmit data to 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.720
 module we will be using a resistor on 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.860
 12 kilo divider to high 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.660
 Signal inadvertently not to burn our from 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.030
 ne-8 266 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.910
 now a few pins have time left 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.650
 we need to pull up to the plus 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.650
 do it with resistors 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.860
 here's what our ready device looks like 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.780
 on the breadboard to 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.959
 use it in practice you decide 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.440
 solder it on the breadboard 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:36.110
 Here is nonsense get out here scheme 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.989
 Added here is such a yusbi wire itself 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.060
 In fact, this is nothing more than the usual usb 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.160
 extension cord on one side here is a mom with 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.739
 another dad we just cut it 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.830
 in half and included in our scheme not 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.790
 betraying the connection that is parallel to 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.840
 note that 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.220
 pin d + usb bus must be connected to 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.730
 pin support 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.400
 interrupts in our case is the second pin 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.120
 from flint well and in the end we decided 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.730
 put our device like this 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.019
 box of candy for will not accept 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.650
 Nastina because we are not profane 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.180
 any real agents 6 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.169
 let's test for spy lager in action 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.870
 we connect one side to the computer 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:24.080
 another country connect the keyboard 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.900
 which we will watch for so little 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.810
 it works all lit blanks tested 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.160
 now on computer spy 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:37.669
 we run the terminal in transit which 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.400
 connect to the server created and and 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.919
 sleeps and will show us everything 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.479
 decrypted and data like it through 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.600
 telnet 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.160
 now we connect now without a text 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.740
 which we will recruit on this 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.110
 the keyboard we can see on 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.940
 computer spying through the terminal 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.940
 let's try ways 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:06.159
 and 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:17.719
 works the word 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:21.019
 spy you can not only laptop but 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:23.149
 from a mobile phone is true android 

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:26.389
 have a great telnet app 

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:28.189
 which will allow you to check the server for 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.249
 and sleep directly with your 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:33.529
 mobile device but if you want 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:35.989
 make a device which window is it not 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.059
 the problem is just take a spark of me without 

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:40.789
 legs and watered log all draw 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:43.099
 get in two smaller than ours 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.409
 now and if you want to at all 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:48.199
 no one could find just binge log in 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:50.629
 the whole circuit inside the keyboard is cool 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.069
 liked it but then click like under 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:55.129
 video tells about him to his friends 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.599
 and leave your ideas in the comments 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.449
 projects because they can 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.610
 become future projects amperca 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.289
 Well, subscribe to the channel amperka.ru 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.119
 because there are still a lot of cool 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:09.949
 glands and novelties but for now see you soon 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:12.939
 dragan melon melon melon cardiograph baton 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.939
 i'm drawing 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:23.010
 hi so 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.010
 good 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.480
 now I sinned like a place
