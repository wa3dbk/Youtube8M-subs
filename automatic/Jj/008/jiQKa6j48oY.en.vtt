00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.990

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.280 
the mirrors are attached to a plastic
sprue<00:01:21.300> and<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.510> first<00:01:21.720> thing<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.200> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
sprue and the first thing to do is to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.900 
sprue and the first thing to do is to
get<00:01:22.410> them<00:01:22.530> off<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.550> you<00:01:23.610> can't<00:01:23.790> be

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
get them off and if you can't be

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.460 
get them off and if you can't be
bothered<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.330> modeling<00:01:24.720> knife<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.320> can

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
bothered with a modeling knife you can

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.400 
bothered with a modeling knife you can
just<00:01:25.650> twist<00:01:25.770> them<00:01:26.070> off<00:01:26.690> it's<00:01:27.690> then<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> fairly

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
just twist them off it's then a fairly

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.050 
just twist them off it's then a fairly
straightforward<00:01:28.680> matter<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.490> press<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
straightforward matter to press the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.150 
straightforward matter to press the
mirrors<00:01:30.420> into<00:01:30.660> holes<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.320> are<00:01:31.440> preformed<00:01:32.040> in

an attempt at cornering one issue not so
good<00:02:57.080> on<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.320> review<00:02:57.620> model<00:02:57.650> was<00:02:58.100> that<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
good on the review model was that the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.430 
good on the review model was that the
rear<00:02:58.700> doors<00:02:59.030> didn't<00:02:59.480> have<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.660> good<00:02:59.870> fit<00:03:00.170> and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
rear doors didn't have a good fit and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.230 
rear doors didn't have a good fit and
they<00:03:01.280> wouldn't<00:03:01.490> really<00:03:01.730> close<00:03:01.970> properly

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
they wouldn't really close properly

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.440 
they wouldn't really close properly
achieving<00:03:03.080> a<00:03:03.140> nice<00:03:03.350> flush<00:03:03.680> finish<00:03:04.450> it's

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
achieving a nice flush finish it's

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.120 
achieving a nice flush finish it's
unusual<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.020> see<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.410> on<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.560> model<00:03:06.830> like<00:03:06.980> this

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
unusual to see that on a model like this

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.920 
unusual to see that on a model like this
and<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.400> might<00:03:07.580> be<00:03:07.610> because<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.390> doors<00:03:08.630> are<00:03:08.840> in

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
and it might be because the doors are in

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.260 
and it might be because the doors are in
fact<00:03:09.110> made<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.440> plastic<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.130> maybe<00:03:11.030> the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
fact made of plastic and maybe the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.810 
fact made of plastic and maybe the
tolerances<00:03:11.780> are<00:03:11.990> just<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.260> little<00:03:12.380> bit<00:03:12.590> out<00:03:12.820> but

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
tolerances are just a little bit out but

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.370 
tolerances are just a little bit out but
one<00:03:14.030> thing<00:03:14.210> you<00:03:14.300> can<00:03:14.480> do<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.900> try<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.140> trim

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
one thing you can do is to try and trim

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.750 
one thing you can do is to try and trim
the<00:03:15.530> plastic<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.950> little<00:03:16.190> bit<00:03:16.310> with<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.520> sharp

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
the plastic a little bit with a sharp

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.720 
the plastic a little bit with a sharp
knife<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:17.360> try<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.750> get<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.870> better<00:03:18.050> fit<00:03:18.730> this

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
knife and try and get a better fit this

knife and try and get a better fit this
version<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.240> van<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.450> also<00:03:20.840> unusual

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
version of the van is also unusual

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.810 
version of the van is also unusual
because<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.710> doesn't<00:03:21.950> have<00:03:22.130> an<00:03:22.220> opening<00:03:22.520> side

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
because it doesn't have an opening side

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.210 
because it doesn't have an opening side
door<00:03:23.120> like<00:03:23.390> previous<00:03:23.780> versions<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.560> it's

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
door like previous versions and it's

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.620 
door like previous versions and it's
surprising<00:03:25.700> that<00:03:25.730> functionality<00:03:26.300> has<00:03:26.570> been

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
surprising that functionality has been

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.390 
surprising that functionality has been
removed<00:03:27.080> in<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.500> model<00:03:27.770> with<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:27.980> same<00:03:28.190> model

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
removed in a model with the same model

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.390 
removed in a model with the same model
number<00:03:29.200> looking<00:03:30.200> inside<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.740> van<00:03:30.920> nose<00:03:31.130> also

another<00:03:31.640> difference<00:03:31.850> which<00:03:32.360> is<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:32.660> there's

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
another difference which is that there's

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.260 
another difference which is that there's
no<00:03:32.960> plastic<00:03:33.230> lining<00:03:33.680> inside<00:03:34.220> which<00:03:34.880> suggests

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
no plastic lining inside which suggests

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.910 
no plastic lining inside which suggests
that<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.750> lower-cost<00:03:36.260> version<00:03:36.710> of<00:03:36.800> the

that this is a lower-cost version of the

that this is a lower-cost version of the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.620 

this<00:03:57.070> model<00:03:57.400> has<00:03:57.550> more<00:03:57.760> plastic<00:03:58.210> and<00:03:58.330> less

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
this model has more plastic and less

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.540 
this model has more plastic and less
functionality<00:03:59.140> than<00:03:59.560> previous<00:04:00.010> versions<00:04:00.430> of

functionality than previous versions of

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.340 
functionality than previous versions of
the<00:04:00.610> model<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.900> would<00:04:01.990> have<00:04:02.080> been<00:04:02.140> better

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
the model and it would have been better

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.020 
the model and it would have been better
just<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.770> have<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.010> earlier<00:04:03.310> version<00:04:03.640> making

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
just to have the earlier version making

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.390 
just to have the earlier version making
card<00:04:04.300> M<00:04:04.450> colors<00:04:04.920> however<00:04:05.920> if<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:06.220> do<00:04:06.370> have

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
card M colors however if you do have

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.550 
card M colors however if you do have
other<00:04:06.790> models<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.300> card<00:04:07.570> M<00:04:07.720> colors<00:04:08.110> then<00:04:08.380> this

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
other models in card M colors then this

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.610 
other models in card M colors then this
one<00:04:08.740> matches<00:04:09.160> them<00:04:09.370> well
