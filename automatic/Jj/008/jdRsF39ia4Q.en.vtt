00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
supposedly the our universe could be

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.810 
supposedly the our universe could be
connected<00:02:20.920> with<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.220> Cinematic<00:02:21.790> Universe

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
connected with the Cinematic Universe

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.300 
connected with the Cinematic Universe

with which is the man of steel now

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.280 
with which is the man of steel now
honestly<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.630> don't<00:02:25.840> think<00:02:26.020> that's<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.200> great

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
honestly I don't think that's a great

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.630 
honestly I don't think that's a great
idea<00:02:26.380> because<00:02:26.890> that's<00:02:27.070> basically<00:02:27.190> like

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
idea because that's basically like

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.930 
idea because that's basically like
bringing<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.150> movie<00:02:28.570> type<00:02:28.930> those<00:02:29.710> actors<00:02:30.430> down

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
bringing a movie type those actors down

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.750 
bringing a movie type those actors down
to<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.300> TV<00:02:32.230> show<00:02:32.560> level<00:02:32.980> which<00:02:33.130> isn't<00:02:33.460> that<00:02:33.490> good

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
to a TV show level which isn't that good

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.530 
to a TV show level which isn't that good
of<00:02:33.790> idea<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:35.050> if<00:02:35.860> we<00:02:36.070> do<00:02:36.400> do<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.240> means

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
of idea but if we do do this that means

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.330 
of idea but if we do do this that means
the<00:02:37.990> whole<00:02:38.200> universe<00:02:38.500> would<00:02:38.770> be<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.920> lot<00:02:39.130> bigger

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
the whole universe would be a lot bigger

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.730 
the whole universe would be a lot bigger
like<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.210> means<00:02:40.390> we'll<00:02:40.480> be<00:02:40.540> seeing<00:02:40.900> in

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
like that means we'll be seeing in

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.550 
like that means we'll be seeing in
actual<00:02:42.220> movie<00:02:42.550> we<00:02:42.700> could<00:02:42.850> be<00:02:42.940> seeing<00:02:43.560> already

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
actual movie we could be seeing already

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.200 
actual movie we could be seeing already
be<00:02:44.710> seeing<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.100> flash<00:02:45.430> Green<00:02:45.760> Lantern<00:02:45.790> and

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
be seeing the flash Green Lantern and

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.420 
be seeing the flash Green Lantern and
green<00:02:46.390> arrow<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.930> mean<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.680> could<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.250> would

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
green arrow I mean that could that would

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.150 
green arrow I mean that could that would
widen<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.030> DC<00:02:49.390> Cinematic<00:02:49.870> Universe<00:02:49.900> but<00:02:50.530> it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
widen the DC Cinematic Universe but it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.920 
widen the DC Cinematic Universe but it
would<00:02:51.250> all<00:02:51.430> show<00:02:51.640> lower<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.240> aspect<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.840> all

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
would all show lower the aspect of all

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.590 
would all show lower the aspect of all
the<00:02:53.050> movies<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.590> would<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:53.770> be<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> lot<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.600> lot

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
the movies it would just be a lot a lot

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.260
