00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
glued to the spinal and I'm going to

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.970 
glued to the spinal and I'm going to
figure<00:04:21.100> out<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.310> way<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.900> connect<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.080> spinal

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980

piece<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.970> abdominal<00:04:25.750> piece<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:27.600> yeah<00:04:28.600> I

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
piece to the abdominal piece and yeah I

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.110 
piece to the abdominal piece and yeah I

figured it out and this is what it

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
figured it out and this is what it
should<00:04:31.270> look<00:04:31.330> like<00:04:31.480> once<00:04:32.440> you're<00:04:32.770> done<00:04:34.140> front

should look like once you're done front
the<00:04:35.890> back<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:37.210> side<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:38.440> awesome
