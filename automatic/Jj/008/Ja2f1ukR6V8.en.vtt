00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
to play leader I think it is a little

to play leader I think it is a little
weird<00:01:31.260> because<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.710> am<00:01:31.830> young<00:01:32.040> um<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:34.070> you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
weird because I am young um so and you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.620 
weird because I am young um so and you
know<00:01:35.160> I<00:01:35.190> was<00:01:35.460> young<00:01:35.610> for<00:01:35.790> my<00:01:35.880> grade<00:01:35.910> anyway<00:01:36.360> and

know I was young for my grade anyway and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080 
know I was young for my grade anyway and
then<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.780> moved<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.440> so<00:01:37.620> it's<00:01:38.160> been<00:01:38.370> we're

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
