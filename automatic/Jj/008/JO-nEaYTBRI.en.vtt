00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello friends here chicks and thieves and 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.350
 let's show you how to make a sailboat in 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.350
 minecraft we started 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:28.980
 mm and hello chick we are in a 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.540
 tutorial here with our friend danone 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.960
 clear accompanying us and here we are 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.690
 sitting because we were thinking that 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.170
 is what we are going to do robben and what 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.239
 let's do today is a sailboat so 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.570
 you have to pay take us away where we are going to 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.570
 build good I had built it is not worth 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.860
 It's worth first what we're going to start 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.680
 doing is putting everything on planks 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.230
 well and then on the one hand another shore 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.310
 good on both sides we are going to put 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.259
 9 in the last part you have to leave more 1 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.270
 space of the front must 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:15.550
 leave 2 then you have to put up the same 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.280
 during along the banks as well as they see that 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.759
 is being my friend danone like that so 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.009
 it looks more cool boat good the sailboat 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.830
 what are we doing and again 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.110
 we do the same 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.860
 along the shore we also passed the two 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.619
 planks to edit it from fabero I think 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.740
 which is this does not trust the board but 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.289
 same with this one that was cooler there 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.610
 sailboat that then young there is 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.060
 doing 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.320
 another part of the sea and then below 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.910
 let's put plank here come there 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.200
 where is my friend telling me 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.969
 then up we're going to put 3 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:05.860
 to three and one at the tip such is it so 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:08.410
 of very well coupled the sailboat 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.569
 and here right here we are going to break one there 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.330
 where my friend broke snow in ezeiza 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.830
 after the test we break one and then 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.330
 let's put and down 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.740
 of the sailboat 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:28.490
 let's put what would be the 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:31.340
 to make it more efficient and efficient 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.280
 walk then in that part where they are 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.280
 watching let's put stairs down 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.620
 7 on the 2 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:56.590
 that's where we're going to put stairs that 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.590
 look down up then 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.120
 the two highs of the banks where they are 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:11.330
 seeing in the all and we replaced them by 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.640
 pink to make it clearer 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:19.190
 and then what are we going to do about this 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.740
 step we are going to put fences of the underworld 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.350
 I do not know how it's called very well so that 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.410
 be this for what starts the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.150
 sailboats I do not know how to call him I forgot 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.270
 the name but good does not matter and here 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.760
 let's put iron grate 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:39.110
 ok between the edges so that according to this 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:44.730
 be the law where we grabbed with 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:47.700
 hands and parts with is called 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.940
 from the edges of the grasp of a 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.460
 thing when you go down stairs is given 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.570
 same 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:00.380
 after this what we are going to do is 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.720
 put a block right in the middle 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.370
 where you want for this 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.900
 is symmetrical what we are going to do what 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.200
 of the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.629
 sail is from the ship and what we are going to 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.810
 make 12 height fence 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.910
 Underworld I do not know how to call it good 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.630
 you already know what this is called but 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.259
 I almost did not give me his name and now what 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.810
 What we are going to do is put white wool 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:29.330
 between the banks of 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.090
 and 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.879
 the crossbow of the underworld and here as 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:40.300
 come let's go putting of 12 25 of 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:40.300
 wide so 56 sorry 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.130
 if they are 6 then we are going towards 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.500
 down upwards two-in- two forgiveness 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.710
 and here next we do the same thing again 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.560
 but this is 5 and we do the same two 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.830
 in two so up up here up 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.870
 no matter remains always just one 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.370
 there is one candle smaller than the other and 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.770
 good of equal and here we are going to put two 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.580
 iron blocks that are going to be where 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:14.930
 bay the lever this chain already put the 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.960
 palanquita another palanquita and the last 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.440
 step that we need is to put a man 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.990
 here according to driving the non-tico boat 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.650
 of the sailboat sorry here as you already are 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:31.130
 driving the good and so it would be 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.650
 the sailboat no and well that's how we 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:37.330
 it's day 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:40.120
 is too low the same today if 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.199
 they knew their creative world to deal with 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:47.440
 of 16 can leave it for anybody 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.539
