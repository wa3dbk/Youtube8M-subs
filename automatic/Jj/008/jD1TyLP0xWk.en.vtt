puppy<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:09.239> think<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:09.869> my<00:02:10.020> point<00:02:10.050> anyway<00:02:10.649> it

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
puppy I think you get my point anyway it

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.290 
puppy I think you get my point anyway it
is<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.489> complicated<00:02:11.730> issue<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
is a really complicated issue and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.130 
is a really complicated issue and
obviously<00:02:12.510> our<00:02:12.959> judge

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
obviously our judge

Tina found on behalf of the orangutan

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.230 
Tina found on behalf of the orangutan
and<00:02:16.740> arguably<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:17.340> behalf<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.940> animals

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.390 
and arguably on behalf of animals
however<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.290> New<00:02:19.440> York<00:02:19.620> chimpanzees<00:02:20.220> were

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
however in New York chimpanzees were

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.460 
however in New York chimpanzees were
found<00:02:20.700> not<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> have<00:02:21.810> those<00:02:22.110> rights

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
found not to have those rights

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.190 
found not to have those rights
interestingly<00:02:23.209> one<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.360> lawyers<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.990> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
interestingly one of the lawyers for the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.380 
interestingly one of the lawyers for the
nonhuman<00:02:25.680> Rights<00:02:25.709> Project<00:02:25.920> had<00:02:26.400> argued<00:02:26.910> that

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
nonhuman Rights Project had argued that

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.650 
nonhuman Rights Project had argued that
the<00:02:27.510> chimpanzee<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.170> much<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> child<00:02:29.660> in

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
the chimpanzee is much like a child in

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
the chimpanzee is much like a child in
which<00:02:30.959> case<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.380> should<00:02:31.590> be<00:02:31.680> treated<00:02:32.070> as<00:02:32.190> such

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
which case it should be treated as such

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.790 
which case it should be treated as such
so<00:02:32.730> maybe<00:02:33.690> that's<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.170> line<00:02:34.320> in<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> sand

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
so maybe that's the line in the sand

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.830 
so maybe that's the line in the sand
that<00:02:35.190> if<00:02:35.430> an<00:02:35.640> animal<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:36.150> really<00:02:36.540> close<00:02:36.810> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
that if an animal is really close to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.720 
that if an animal is really close to
humans<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.620> their<00:02:37.740> behavior<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.490> in<00:02:38.580> their

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
humans in their behavior and in their

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.030 
humans in their behavior and in their
cognitive<00:02:39.300> abilities<00:02:39.780> they<00:02:40.470> should<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:40.770> given

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
cognitive abilities they should be given

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.460 
cognitive abilities they should be given
those<00:02:41.220> rights<00:02:41.550> I'm<00:02:42.420> sure<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.050> will<00:02:43.140> not<00:02:43.319> be

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
those rights I'm sure this will not be

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.280 
those rights I'm sure this will not be
the<00:02:43.590> last<00:02:44.310> case<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.670> deals<00:02:45.060> with<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.510> and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the last case that deals with this and

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.540 
the last case that deals with this and
it<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.709> really<00:02:46.980> interesting<00:02:47.160> question

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
it is a really interesting question

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.310 
it is a really interesting question
something<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.600> I'm<00:02:48.780> sure<00:02:48.930> Peter<00:02:49.170> would<00:02:49.290> have

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
something that I'm sure Peter would have

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.500 
something that I'm sure Peter would have
a<00:02:49.440> lot<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.709> say<00:02:49.860> about<00:02:49.890> as<00:02:50.820> well<00:02:51.030> as<00:02:51.060> many<00:02:51.300> other

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
a lot to say about as well as many other

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.210 
a lot to say about as well as many other
animal<00:02:51.870> rights<00:02:52.019> groups<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.470> tell<00:02:52.980> us<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
animal rights groups so tell us in the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.160 
animal rights groups so tell us in the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
comments down below do you think animals

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.410 
comments down below do you think animals
deserve<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.709> same<00:02:55.950> rights<00:02:56.190> as<00:02:56.459> humans<00:02:56.850> or<00:02:57.269> do

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
deserve the same rights as humans or do

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.610 
deserve the same rights as humans or do
you<00:02:57.480> think<00:02:57.660> there<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.930> line<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.440> sand

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
you think there is a line in the sand

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.979 
you think there is a line in the sand
and<00:02:58.920> what<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.610> line<00:02:59.790> as<00:03:00.060> always<00:03:00.660> thanks

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
and what is that line as always thanks

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.240 
and what is that line as always thanks
