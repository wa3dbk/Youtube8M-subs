00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.010
 guillaume monta review finally your first 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.330
 match against your truthers I guess 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.520
 you were very happy 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.400
 yeah that's very nice especially it's 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.690
 home and then so we started 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.760
 by a victory what held us to 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.890
 heart 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.600
 that was the best you was 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.250
 maybe a little bit is not all about 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.510
 made physically ready already faced the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.650
 championship yeah I had done a 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.350
 preparation completely 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.020
 ok i did a lot of cycling a lot 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.000
 of muscu and and we'll say two weeks 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.579
 specific training with with his 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.800
 vein that and albert steckel is true 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.970
 a little short of competition you have to 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.460
 still a little work to get to 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.930
 what are we going to have to do a little bit more 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.820
 of time and prevents any search 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.199
 some balloon balloon invalid 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.980
 finally we will try to compensate by 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.330
 experience and good concentration 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.460
 the advantage in quotation marks 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.110
 absence was able to say to himself that the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.769
 racing this year will count on two 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.500
 very good guardians 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.820
 yeah even I would say she is at 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.650
 vauvert the help of young people behind 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.780
 pushes and it's still fine 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.040
 to have good guardians 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.170
 in a workforce that goes well there is 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.330
 a real a competition or not between 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.130
 two guards it's always of course 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.490
 you have a very good goalkeeper and he me 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.979
 pushed me to go beyond me and snapped 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.740
 competition it's mandatory good this 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.570
 match was saying if not needed the rap is 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.490
 clearly was the only match tale 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.409
 at home of the month of 10 months of August 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.190
 it's important important comes from 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.870
 to pass is what is felt 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.340
 the tense team still came during 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.080
 20 minutes half an hour is that 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.640
 that was the pressure of this 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.620
 first match in the meinau whose audience 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.570
 yeah I think it's always the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.330
 the start the first match we always have 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.530
 at heart to do well so I think that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.870
 all we are a little bit 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.570
 pressure but after we know we 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.040
 quickly released and is moved that is that has 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.480
 makes a death the purpose of the bond that has everything 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.730
 exchange 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.320
 we started to take the measure of 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.810
 the opponent we started playing more 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.660
 on the ground and then is that goal we have a little 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.940
 released second half time was appointed to 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.770
 level we say we often say that when 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.580
 everything is fine in football but we have 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.110
 we really feel like there is 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.060
 there is really something special 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.520
 is happening this season I think that 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.980
 wall and climbs welded them 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.920
 played back and his voice that it creates a 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.110
 team then the team goes up in rank 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.460
 had passed from cfa 2 to cfa now 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.530
 national and you are part of 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.230
 players who have already known above 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.420
 especially league 2 a win in 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.120
 cup of France in guingamp against against 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.570
 reindeer what are you bringing 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.120
 in this in this context there I try to 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.010
 do my job well to bring the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.280
 serenity my defenders after I am 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.760
 not someone of the hyper talkative before 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.550
 the matches or not that day but 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.110
 I try to bring my calm and the 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.459
 serenity in the goals and for that 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.080
 reflects on my defenders he can 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.780
 to get off the ground 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.730
 and in the locker room 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.769
 until then 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.000
 I have not had the opportunity but it can 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.280
 happen of course if there is something 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.620
 that bothers me about an investment on a 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.629
 marking or mistakes of course that's 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.870
 obligatory it is a parent to say oneself 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.330
 things 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.799
 your experience also allows you to head 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.500
 to say what will make this year the 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.480
 difference in national and what quality 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.489
 will allow the best to be 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.780
 in front of it is very difficult a 2-2 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.390
 to explain what makes a season 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:40.099
 going well or not but I think that already 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.989
 if the group is very supportive and 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.980
 live well together it can be a 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.690
 much of success 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.090
 all teams are very good 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.569
 trained and at +2 and more differences 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.940
 physical as could have in cfa and 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.530
 is sent to a gap level of course 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.500
 it seems very open anyway 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.359
 championship there is no no 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.010
 of favorite everyone has a chance and 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.599
 the impression one can perhaps speak 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.420
 again this August which is when 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.940
 even 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.800
 has yet complicated that has 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.040
 started with our point outside 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.920
 and 3 homicide there two displacements 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.330
 very very hard after jc ajaccio there it is 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.120
 complicate now yeah there we go 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.090
 really get into the thick of it 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.500
 go to two competitors 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.260
 for the climb we will say fo who have 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.380
 leap ambitions in league 2 so we 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.210
 go see what we are worth if we are able 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.880
 to travel in the big of this 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.950
 championship mostly frejus that has a real 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.330
 candidate who will lose twice to 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.690
 the outside who in his first match to 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.460
 home to one can think that the case of 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.840
 the crisis will be otherwise warm but on 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.830
 certainly yeah well they'll get 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.940
 find in situations that 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.370
 news last week with envy 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.200
 to win him their home games and 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.460
 so we expect a big opposition 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.590
 so will have roots as we've seen since 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.690
 a year and again these first two 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.190
 matches we are very very very supportive 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.780
 we will have to keep up the momentum of this 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.210
 that we did at the end of the season being 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.840
 solid full behind and so it's 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.850
 place some counters well placed thank you 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.610
 guillaume and then good game friday 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.940
 after the es16 jean marc and then we will do 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.940
 our best
