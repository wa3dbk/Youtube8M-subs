00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.740 

what<00:00:10.070> we<00:00:10.160> just<00:00:10.339> observed<00:00:10.699> was<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:11.209> electron

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
what we just observed was the electron

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.169 
what we just observed was the electron
injection<00:00:12.230> into<00:00:12.410> an<00:00:12.740> organic<00:00:12.980> matter<00:00:13.309> now

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
injection into an organic matter now

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.900 
injection into an organic matter now
that's<00:00:14.420> a<00:00:14.539> fancy<00:00:15.289> way<00:00:15.529> for<00:00:15.559> simply<00:00:15.980> saying<00:00:16.189> if

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
that's a fancy way for simply saying if

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.760 
that's a fancy way for simply saying if
I<00:00:17.090> go<00:00:17.210> ahead<00:00:17.390> and<00:00:17.480> inject<00:00:17.689> some<00:00:17.960> charge<00:00:18.349> on<00:00:18.650> one

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
I go ahead and inject some charge on one

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.170 
I go ahead and inject some charge on one
end<00:00:19.009> and<00:00:19.160> some<00:00:19.369> opposite<00:00:19.789> charge<00:00:19.970> on<00:00:20.119> the

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
end and some opposite charge on the

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.429 
end and some opposite charge on the
other<00:00:20.300> end<00:00:20.480> they<00:00:20.930> can<00:00:21.079> meet<00:00:21.230> in<00:00:21.349> the<00:00:21.380> middle

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
other end they can meet in the middle

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.139 
other end they can meet in the middle
and<00:00:22.000> excite<00:00:23.000> a<00:00:23.210> molecule<00:00:23.779> that<00:00:24.489> molecule<00:00:25.489> will

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:26.149 
and excite a molecule that molecule will

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.119 
and excite a molecule that molecule will
glow<00:00:26.469> especially<00:00:27.469> if<00:00:27.529> it<00:00:27.619> happens<00:00:27.829> to<00:00:27.919> a<00:00:27.950> lot

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:28.129 
glow especially if it happens to a lot

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:29.380 
glow especially if it happens to a lot
of<00:00:28.250> sodium<00:00:28.489> like<00:00:28.820> you're<00:00:28.939> seeing<00:00:29.149> right<00:00:29.329> here

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
of sodium like you're seeing right here

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.139 
of sodium like you're seeing right here
so<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.500> consequence<00:00:30.950> is<00:00:31.070> that<00:00:31.250> given<00:00:31.820> any

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
so the consequence is that given any

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.209 
so the consequence is that given any
material<00:00:32.989> I<00:00:33.140> can<00:00:33.260> electrically<00:00:33.770> excited

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
material I can electrically excited

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.279 
material I can electrically excited
often<00:00:34.910> things<00:00:35.149> are<00:00:35.239> not<00:00:35.390> very<00:00:35.629> very<00:00:35.809> efficient

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
often things are not very very efficient

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.110 
often things are not very very efficient
in<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.469> way<00:00:36.590> they<00:00:36.739> glow<00:00:36.950> and<00:00:37.610> hence<00:00:37.820> we<00:00:37.940> don't

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
in the way they glow and hence we don't

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.700 
in the way they glow and hence we don't
necessarily<00:00:38.239> observe<00:00:38.719> it<00:00:38.870> here<00:00:39.140> we're

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
necessarily observe it here we're

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.979 
necessarily observe it here we're
passing<00:00:40.070> a<00:00:40.129> lot<00:00:40.280> of<00:00:40.460> current<00:00:40.790> through<00:00:41.660> a<00:00:41.750> very

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
passing a lot of current through a very

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.990 
passing a lot of current through a very
small<00:00:42.110> amount<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.530> material<00:00:42.790> even<00:00:43.790> if<00:00:43.850> it's

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
small amount of material even if it's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.540 
small amount of material even if it's
not<00:00:44.120> very<00:00:44.270> efficient<00:00:45.110> in<00:00:45.200> glowing<00:00:45.710> it's<00:00:46.310> gonna

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
not very efficient in glowing it's gonna

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.979 
not very efficient in glowing it's gonna
still<00:00:46.790> be<00:00:46.820> observed<00:00:47.270> because<00:00:47.480> you're<00:00:47.780> just

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
still be observed because you're just

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.930 
still be observed because you're just
doing<00:00:48.200> is<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:48.470> repeatedly<00:00:48.980> over<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:49.370> over<00:00:49.820> and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
doing is so repeatedly over and over and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.910 
doing is so repeatedly over and over and
over<00:00:50.060> and<00:00:50.360> over<00:00:50.510> again<00:00:50.720> so<00:00:51.320> by<00:00:51.470> no<00:00:51.590> means<00:00:51.800> is

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
over and over again so by no means is

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.920 
over and over again so by no means is
this<00:00:52.040> a<00:00:52.070> very<00:00:52.340> efficient<00:00:52.820> LED<00:00:53.300> that<00:00:53.780> you

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
this a very efficient LED that you

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.840 
this a very efficient LED that you
observe<00:00:54.200> but<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.950> essence<00:00:55.370> of<00:00:55.460> it<00:00:55.610> is<00:00:55.700> very

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
observe but the essence of it is very

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.150 
observe but the essence of it is very
similar<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:56.930> what<00:00:57.110> happens<00:00:57.500> in<00:00:57.590> these<00:00:57.829> very

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
similar to what happens in these very

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.190 
similar to what happens in these very
slick<00:00:58.640> looking<00:00:59.059> displays<00:00:59.480> this<00:00:59.989> is<00:01:00.079> an

organic light-emitting devices which

organic light-emitting devices which

off a photon very much the same as

thing you need to do next is make sure
