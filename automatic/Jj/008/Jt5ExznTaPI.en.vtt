00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.389
 nice guys and nice love from me and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.680
 welcome to this new tutorial on 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.140
 unity 3d with networks I did quite a bit 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.650
 of modifications I added a pickaxe and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.170
 viewfinder and I'm going to challenge them in 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.420
 this video how to make a perfect one 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.690
 first of all I would like to put a skybox 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.780
 to the room because this is a bit 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.600
 ugly to see so we import the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.570
 sky box or thai boxing and zoe now the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.150
 I'm importing and the right amount for 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.309
 put a little sky effect that 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.739
 unfortunately it will be that unfortunately it is not 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.199
 then I will explain later 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:05.100
 also how to do it admits a sky that is 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.500
 then move to a skybox ne 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.500
 choose one naturally will choose it 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:20.670
 so which one we choose I look for I live 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:27.540
 in the area we choose this year 16 years 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.280
 aged 23 years, but two perfect summit 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.440
 we put 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.440
 and here we have enough in the pits 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.220
 here we are with our perfect skybox 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.400
 as you see in the pits and deep 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.530
 no no no can anyone 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.890
 as you can see when I press the button 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.610
 left performs an animation not yet 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.050
 put the timer you need to take a 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.850
 but sometimes I decided not to 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.240
 put it because to destroy a 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.790
 block we will bend a little so I know 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:08.429
 that I will redo the animation 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:12.180
 as you see here we have two models 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.030
 I will delete this because it is useless or a 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.750
 model if you want them to put them 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.770
 on 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.690
 to download it on mega not mega not 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.730
 does not work does not work yet 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.860
 you didn't know yet mygale not like 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.670
 gap that has opened and you can reach it 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.770
 from the mac site and precisely c.ne z 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.830
 however we have our own model of 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.750
 pick and here now you can't see but there is 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.800
 a platform with a pickaxe above and 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.340
 this picks up the Hon 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.160
 I put sofres lost a controller 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.670
 in fact, here it is 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.810
 well positioned and I did it 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:59.459
 Also an animation that is not here 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.310
 also because we put out ok it has it 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.540
 made an animation and I made one 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.959
 script that we are going to see now that is 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.630
 then I made some changes to the script 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:21.890
 of the blocks which is what we have 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:26.209
 put on the main room and see here 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:30.209
 blocks I created a variable pickaxe 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:37.049
 and go to start I did that takes away the 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:39.560
 mouse and here when is when 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.209
 we must destroy something then 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.390
 I will start animation animation 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.670
 pick other than an animation you see 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.180
 this one that I created using the 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:55.650
 nervous tool of unity for animations 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:59.430
 however I did it is not the best 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.110
 as an animation but it's something you see already 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.940
 it is very buggy it also goes through so 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.440
 however nothing is already something then 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.120
 of course your rock will do it 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:16.890
 much better perfect then you remember 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:20.700
 that when it is not tosca mind that when 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.850
 we looked very low and press the 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.290
 left 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.680
 that destroyed our character 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:32.520
 here I have fixed the bug 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.520
 in fact now looking down 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.700
 and pressing with the left button does not occur 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.080
 self-destruct I love more but we destroy the 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.630
 block this as I solved it 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.500
 I took the main room and moved it 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.440
 forward 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.930
 let 's see it in the water you see it in it 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.660
 that starts water or moves further 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:00.310
 respect to the character 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.890
 then I went to the main room and 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:10.260
 I put changed mouse values 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:14.800
 look like senses xy sensitivity to 5 because 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:19.830
 is better in my opinion and maximum hicks e 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.980
 270 come 360 and the minimum y in 60 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:28.000
 so now don't 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:32.380
 nothing more perfect happens then for 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.180
 for the viewfinder has been provided 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.130
 image of a master viewfinder already 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.180
 call that is my collaborator who 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.310
 thank you of course and we can 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.650
 go find mena mandates here two 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:52.670
 auto slugging crossair you see are black 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:56.570
 a black background so here you have to 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:06:00.350
 click alfa from the grace cheil ee 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.510
 then then it will take away the game 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:08.150
 obviously press exact apply that 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:10.310
 will remove the black part here 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.670
 see how they work where you want them 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:17.750
 put all of which two variables 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:22.280
 we take the height and the length 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:26.060
 which are cross sayer which is none other than 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.360
 this to have here 2d texture which is the 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:32.780
 our texture divided two so it will be 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:37.570
 it will be great this way 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:42.380
 then variable position that this already 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:45.680
 that this is the position precisely and then 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:49.550
 here at the end hydro texture in the 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.310
 position that we have said here 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.560
 draw texture which texture continues the 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.150
 what we put these here 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.990
 script put the well on break 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.760
 copy now I will not be here to explain 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.600
 so much does nothing but calculate 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:09.440
 the length etcetera 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:15.980
 so here it works as you can see it is 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:18.940
 But when we fall remains so here 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:24.290
 this is a script I created that 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:26.500
 when he touched a trigger called 

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:34.240
 movie 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:38.100
 to do these two appear here and there 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:42.600
 nothing writes what is written 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:46.630
 also here oh well now here you see 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:50.860
 I throw down aspect of touching less a 

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:55.840
 100 meters here is back menu low I click and 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:58.390
 you should open the menu scene which 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.950
 but now there is no beat in the ween 

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:03.820
 settings 

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:07.150
 anyway this was what i wanted 

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:09.400
 say in the next tutorial we'll go to 

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:12.580
 see the death from falling as I have it 

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.980
 call and nothing I can just say 

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:19.050
 which for this video is everything and sees us 

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.050
 in the next beautiful pretty
