00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
alright here's the New Castle 30 this is

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.959 
alright here's the New Castle 30 this is
an<00:00:13.320> original<00:00:13.769> circuit<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.429> Jackson<00:00:14.820> amp

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
an original circuit for Jackson amp

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.750 
an original circuit for Jackson amp
works<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.719> great<00:00:16.109> great<00:00:16.949> circuit<00:00:17.460> very

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
works it's a great great circuit very

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.750 
works it's a great great circuit very
simple<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.720> very<00:00:18.990> functional<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:20.490> got<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
simple but very functional it's got a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.210 
simple but very functional it's got a
passive<00:00:21.270> tone<00:00:21.480> control<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.740> not<00:00:22.920> really

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
passive tone control so it's not really

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.609 
passive tone control so it's not really
gonna<00:00:23.430> you're<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.180> gonna<00:00:24.359> cream<00:00:24.960> anything<00:00:25.500> in

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
gonna you're not gonna cream anything in

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.830 
gonna you're not gonna cream anything in
the<00:00:25.710> tone<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.449> dial<00:00:27.689> it

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the tone it's it's just you can dial it

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.419 
the tone it's it's just you can dial it
in<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.019> roll<00:00:28.260> back<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.800> need<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.340> I'm

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
in and roll back what you need to so I'm

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.640 
in and roll back what you need to so I'm
gonna<00:00:29.580> play<00:00:29.789> at<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.539> Telecaster<00:00:31.230> will<00:00:31.380> start

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
gonna play at this Telecaster will start

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.670 
gonna play at this Telecaster will start
it<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.239> you<00:00:33.239> know<00:00:33.390> three<00:00:33.930> o'clock<00:00:34.200> nothing

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
it just a you know three o'clock nothing

00:00:34.680 --> 00:01:08.230 
it just a you know three o'clock nothing
too<00:00:34.910> nice<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> clean<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.660> too<00:00:36.690> crazy

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.760 

alright<00:01:09.240> I'm<00:01:09.300> gonna<00:01:09.420> take<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.690> gain<00:01:09.930> up

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
alright I'm gonna take the gain up

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:50.590 
alright I'm gonna take the gain up
let's<00:01:11.760> go<00:01:11.910> Midway

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:16.570 

that's<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:52.340> great<00:01:53.340> way<00:01:53.579> up

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.340 

now<00:02:17.580> we<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:18.120> make<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.420> thing<00:02:18.480> incredibly

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
now we can make this thing incredibly

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.530 
now we can make this thing incredibly
quiet<00:02:19.620> with<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.040> power<00:02:20.310> scaling<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.240> here<00:02:21.450> it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
quiet with the power scaling so here it

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.040 
quiet with the power scaling so here it
is

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
is

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.190 
is
we'll<00:02:22.320> go<00:02:22.470> kind<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.830> low<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.930> somewhere

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
we'll go kind of a low and somewhere

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.729 
we'll go kind of a low and somewhere
around<00:02:26.420> ten<00:02:27.420> o'clock<00:02:27.450> nine<00:02:27.990> ten<00:02:28.230> o'clock

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:03:13.190 

and<00:02:33.549> engage<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.030> power<00:02:34.269> scaling

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.300 

there's<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.319> Telecaster<00:03:15.040> through<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
there's a Telecaster through the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:36.350 
there's a Telecaster through the
Newcastle<00:03:15.610> 30

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:45.280 

you

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.349 

you
