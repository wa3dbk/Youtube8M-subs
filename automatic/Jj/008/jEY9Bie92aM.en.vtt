the term fluid mosaic model let's get

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.200 
the term fluid mosaic model let's get
started<00:00:25.500> by<00:00:25.650> talking<00:00:25.710> about<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.670> function<00:00:26.910> of

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
started by talking about the function of

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.950 
started by talking about the function of
the<00:00:27.840> plasma<00:00:27.990> membrane<00:00:29.570> basically<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> serves

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the plasma membrane basically it serves

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.690 
the plasma membrane basically it serves
as<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> boundary<00:00:31.830> between<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.279> outside

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
as a boundary between the outside

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.490 
as a boundary between the outside
environment<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.420> cell<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.170> inside

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
environment of the cell and the inside

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
environment of the cell and the inside
environment<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> cell<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.030> controls

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
environment of the cell and it controls

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.750 
environment of the cell and it controls
what<00:00:36.630> enters<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.140> leaves<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.500> cell<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:38.610> say

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
what enters and leaves the cell we say

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.459 
what enters and leaves the cell we say
that<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.030> selectively<00:00:39.480> permeable<00:00:39.809> because

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
that it's selectively permeable because

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.650 
that it's selectively permeable because
it<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.800> control<00:00:41.190> exactly<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:42.059> comes<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.510> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it can control exactly what comes in and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.049 
it can control exactly what comes in and
exactly<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.559> leaves<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:45.030> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
exactly what leaves and it can have a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.970 
exactly what leaves and it can have a
little<00:00:45.360> bit<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> regulatory<00:00:45.989> control<00:00:46.590> over

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
little bit of regulatory control over

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.889 
little bit of regulatory control over
the<00:00:47.250> amount<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.730> stuff<00:00:48.059> entering<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.840> leaving

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
the amount of stuff entering and leaving

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:49.549 
the amount of stuff entering and leaving
as<00:00:49.200> well

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
as well

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.200 
as well
we'll<00:00:49.950> talk<00:00:50.129> about<00:00:50.250> how<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.640> does<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.000> in

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
we'll talk about how it does that in

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.889 
we'll talk about how it does that in
just<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.539> second<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.719> cell

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
just a second so what is the cell

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.779 
just a second so what is the cell
membrane<00:00:55.350> well<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.250> made<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
membrane well it's made up of a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.979 
membrane well it's made up of a
phospholipid<00:00:57.180> bilayer

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
phospholipid bilayer

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.279 
phospholipid bilayer
now<00:00:58.530> phospholipids<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.449> glycerol

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
now phospholipids are a glycerol

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.709 
now phospholipids are a glycerol

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
phosphate groups that's peel 4 3 - and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.510 
phosphate groups that's peel 4 3 - and
they<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.200> different<00:01:10.619> properties<00:01:10.830> different

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
they have different properties different

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.670 
they have different properties different

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
got some other stuff so let's explore

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.940 
got some other stuff so let's explore
that<00:01:47.670> we've<00:01:48.570> got<00:01:48.750> some<00:01:48.930> transport<00:01:49.500> proteins

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that we've got some transport proteins

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.270 
that we've got some transport proteins
or<00:01:50.220> carrier<00:01:50.880> proteins<00:01:51.439> here<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.590> an<00:01:52.680> intrinsic

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
or carrier proteins here is an intrinsic

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
or carrier proteins here is an intrinsic
protein<00:01:53.670> an<00:01:53.820> intrinsic<00:01:54.509> protein<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.200> that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
protein an intrinsic protein is one that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.080 
protein an intrinsic protein is one that
spans<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> entire<00:01:55.890> bilayer<00:01:56.729> from<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
spans the entire bilayer from the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.060 
spans the entire bilayer from the
outside<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.719> cell<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.320> inside<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
outside of the cell to the inside of the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.090 
outside of the cell to the inside of the
cell<00:01:59.329> we<00:02:00.329> also<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:00.869> extrinsic<00:02:01.469> proteins

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
cell we also have extrinsic proteins

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.060 
cell we also have extrinsic proteins
which<00:02:02.399> go<00:02:02.640> sort<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.030> halfway<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:04.710> intrinsic

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
which go sort of halfway the intrinsic

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.709 
which go sort of halfway the intrinsic
proteins<00:02:05.610> are<00:02:05.790> involved<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.299> transporting

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
proteins are involved in transporting

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.719 
proteins are involved in transporting
stuff<00:02:07.259> from<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.920> side<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> membrane<00:02:08.459> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
stuff from one side of the membrane to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.669 
stuff from one side of the membrane to
the<00:02:09.000> other<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.929> how<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.170> cell<00:02:10.470> can

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
the other and this is how the cell can

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.770 
the other and this is how the cell can
be<00:02:10.770> selectively<00:02:11.280> permeable<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.480> these

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
be selectively permeable so these

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.520 
be selectively permeable so these
proteins

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
proteins

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.890 
proteins
are<00:02:13.709> specific<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.640> certain<00:02:14.670> substrates<00:02:15.360> so

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
are specific to certain substrates so

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.930 
are specific to certain substrates so
only<00:02:16.110> certain<00:02:16.800> things<00:02:17.130> can<00:02:17.400> move<00:02:17.580> through

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
only certain things can move through

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.660 
only certain things can move through
different<00:02:18.390> protein<00:02:19.020> channels<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:20.250> extrinsic

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
different protein channels the extrinsic

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.309 
different protein channels the extrinsic
proteins<00:02:21.209> they<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.660> more<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.110> role<00:02:22.290> in

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
proteins they have more of a role in

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.530 
proteins they have more of a role in
cell<00:02:22.680> signaling<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.340> combination<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.510> our

cell signaling in combination with our
next<00:02:25.080> feature<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.100> cell<00:02:26.310> membrane<00:02:26.700> which

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
next feature of the cell membrane which

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.960 
next feature of the cell membrane which
is<00:02:27.180> glycoproteins<00:02:28.170> now<00:02:28.950> glycoproteins<00:02:29.760> where

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
is glycoproteins now glycoproteins where

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.420 
is glycoproteins now glycoproteins where
we<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.239> an<00:02:30.360> extrinsic<00:02:30.870> protein<00:02:31.709> associated

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
we have an extrinsic protein associated

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.160 
we have an extrinsic protein associated
with<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.000> carbohydrate<00:02:33.360> branch

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
with a carbohydrate branch

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.530 
with a carbohydrate branch
now<00:02:35.010> these<00:02:35.130> carbohydrate<00:02:35.910> branches<00:02:36.239> can<00:02:36.360> also

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
now these carbohydrate branches can also

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.390 
now these carbohydrate branches can also
be<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:36.840> intrinsic<00:02:37.470> proteins<00:02:37.890> for<00:02:38.100> certain

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
be on intrinsic proteins for certain

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.910 
be on intrinsic proteins for certain
things<00:02:38.550> but<00:02:39.480> they<00:02:39.600> act<00:02:39.750> as<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.959> receptor<00:02:40.590> for

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
things but they act as a receptor for

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.410 
things but they act as a receptor for
cell<00:02:41.130> signaling<00:02:41.400> our<00:02:41.790> hormones<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:45.060> these<00:02:45.239> are

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
cell signaling our hormones so these are

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.640 
cell signaling our hormones so these are
the<00:02:45.480> different<00:02:45.840> components<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.470> cell

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the different components the cell

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.320 
the different components the cell

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
membrane and the final one we need to

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.630 
membrane and the final one we need to
know<00:02:48.540> about<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.870> cholesterol<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:50.370> role<00:02:50.610> of

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
know about is cholesterol the role of

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.550 
know about is cholesterol the role of
cholesterol<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.900> add<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.050> little<00:02:52.260> bit<00:02:52.530> of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
cholesterol is to add a little bit of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.770 
cholesterol is to add a little bit of
stability<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.459> membrane<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.239> maintains

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
stability to the membrane it maintains

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.070 
stability to the membrane it maintains
the<00:02:54.930> structure<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> bilayer<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.610> add

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
the structure of the bilayer so add

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.750 
the structure of the bilayer so add
structural<00:02:58.080> stability<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.580> cell

the cholesterol well they're like the

tiles in a mosaic the different tiles

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.920 
tiles in a mosaic the different tiles
this<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.370> where<00:03:14.670> we<00:03:14.790> get<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.090> term<00:03:15.120> mosaic

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
this is where we get the term mosaic

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.500 
this is where we get the term mosaic
structure<00:03:16.620> from<00:03:16.830> but<00:03:17.790> why<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.180> called<00:03:18.329> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
structure from but why is it called the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.770 
structure from but why is it called the
fluid<00:03:18.780> mosaic<00:03:19.079> model<00:03:20.180> well<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.269> reason<00:03:21.630> for

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
fluid mosaic model well the reason for

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.289 
fluid mosaic model well the reason for
this<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.290> because<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:23.400> cell<00:03:23.610> membrane<00:03:24.090> is

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
this is because the cell membrane is

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.840 
this is because the cell membrane is
dynamic<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.140> moves<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.519> all<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.730> those

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
dynamic it moves and all of those

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.810 
dynamic it moves and all of those
proteins<00:03:27.420> sort<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.870> drift<00:03:28.200> around<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.579> move

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
proteins sort of drift around and move

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.280 
proteins sort of drift around and move
through<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.660> soup

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
through the soup

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.979 
through the soup
there<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.940> phospholipids<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:33.870> they're

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
there is the phospholipids so they're

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.720 
there is the phospholipids so they're
never<00:03:34.170> really<00:03:34.500> in<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.920> same<00:03:35.130> place<00:03:35.400> for<00:03:35.430> very

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
never really in the same place for very

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.090 
never really in the same place for very
long<00:03:35.850> they<00:03:36.450> move<00:03:36.840> relatively<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.739> one<00:03:37.860> another

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
long they move relatively to one another

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.250 
long they move relatively to one another
so<00:03:38.670> that's<00:03:38.850> where<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.180> term<00:03:39.390> fluid<00:03:40.019> comes

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
so that's where the term fluid comes

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.620 
so that's where the term fluid comes
from<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:41.100> mosaic<00:03:41.579> part<00:03:41.970> refers<00:03:42.359> to<00:03:42.390> the

different molecules different components

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:45.920 
different molecules different components
that<00:03:44.670> are<00:03:44.850> present<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.359> cell<00:03:45.540> membrane

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
that are present in the cell membrane

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.250 
that are present in the cell membrane
and<00:03:46.079> that's<00:03:47.040> pretty<00:03:47.280> much<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:49.170> to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
and that's pretty much it so to

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.930 
and that's pretty much it so to
summarize<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.890> plasma<00:03:53.220> membrane<00:03:53.579> is<00:03:53.609> more

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
summarize the plasma membrane is more

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.920 
summarize the plasma membrane is more
than<00:03:54.090> just<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.359> phospholipid<00:03:54.690> bilayer<00:03:56.930> it

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
than just a phospholipid bilayer it

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.930 
than just a phospholipid bilayer it
contains<00:03:58.380> proteins<00:03:58.890> glycoproteins<00:03:59.790> and

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
contains proteins glycoproteins and

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.060 
contains proteins glycoproteins and
cholesterol<00:04:00.750> that's<00:04:01.350> why<00:04:01.590> it's<00:04:01.769> called<00:04:01.920> a

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
cholesterol that's why it's called a

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.330 
cholesterol that's why it's called a
mosaic<00:04:02.549> and<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:03.500> membrane<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.620> dynamic<00:04:05.160> so

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
mosaic and the membrane is dynamic so

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.550 
mosaic and the membrane is dynamic so
all<00:04:05.640> components<00:04:06.060> are<00:04:06.329> fluid<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:06.930> move

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
all components are fluid and move

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.620 
all components are fluid and move
relative<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.160> one<00:04:08.370> another<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:09.510> that's

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
relative to one another and that's

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.500 
relative to one another and that's
everything<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:10.380> LIKE<00:04:10.620> comment<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.310> subscribe
