even<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:45.440> tattoos<00:01:47.210> are<00:01:48.210> actually<00:01:48.810> pretty

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
even do the tattoos are actually pretty

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.490 
even do the tattoos are actually pretty
good<00:01:49.910> part<00:01:50.910> from<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:51.960> its<00:01:52.229> own

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
good part from like this one its own

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.240 
good part from like this one its own
life<00:01:53.930> full<00:01:54.930> when<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> actually<00:01:55.500> listed<00:01:55.950> arm

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
life full when you actually listed arm

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.430 
life full when you actually listed arm
up<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:57.300> their<00:01:58.070> otherwise<00:01:59.070> like<00:02:00.080> pop<00:02:01.080> it's<00:02:01.320> all

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
up for their otherwise like pop it's all

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.640 
up for their otherwise like pop it's all
stays<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.080> got<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.290> tuck<00:02:04.440> you<00:02:04.530> under

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
stays that so you got to tuck you under

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.160 
stays that so you got to tuck you under
there<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.040> well<00:02:05.900> and<00:02:08.209> articulation<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:11.060> like

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
there as well and articulation is like

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:23.449 
there as well and articulation is like
me<00:02:15.590> foot<00:02:17.630> um<00:02:19.220> die<00:02:20.220> set<00:02:21.709> all<00:02:22.709> this<00:02:23.010> other<00:02:23.220> good

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
me foot um die set all this other good

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.420 
me foot um die set all this other good
stuff<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.680> its<00:02:26.070> head<00:02:26.340> move<00:02:27.209> side<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.570> side<00:02:27.720> a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
stuff and its head move side to side a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.930 
stuff and its head move side to side a
little<00:02:29.430> bit<00:02:29.580> up<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:29.970> down<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.510> should<00:02:31.170> climb<00:02:31.320> up

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
little bit up and down I should climb up

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:40.860 
little bit up and down I should climb up
and<00:02:34.910> Marcus<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.120> another

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.180 

so<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.200> think<00:02:42.620> it's<00:02:42.710> pretty<00:02:42.860> good<00:02:43.010> life

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
so I think it's pretty good life

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.650 
so I think it's pretty good life
actually<00:02:45.400> as<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.520> say<00:02:46.700> probably<00:02:47.090> not<00:02:47.150> revert<00:02:47.630> to

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
actually as I say probably not revert to

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.720 
actually as I say probably not revert to
this<00:02:48.430> but<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:50.120> know<00:02:50.860> another<00:02:51.860> thing<00:02:51.890> which<00:02:52.550> I

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
this but you know another thing which I

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.260 
this but you know another thing which I
don't<00:02:53.470> understand<00:02:54.470> with<00:02:54.740> this<00:02:54.980> actually<00:02:55.730> is

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
don't understand with this actually is

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.890 
don't understand with this actually is
