00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.779
 and so we proceed to the second part of our 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.890
 review honda idea 62 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.950
 Now I will tell you what is not told before 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.679
 in the first part it means that I am 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.900
 he was surprised at the first thing he had 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.600
 Trial surprised him that the wheel 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.670
 he turns 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.949
 huge corners here pour on others 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.090
 mopeds do not turn so you see 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.670
 these are at 90 degrees 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:34.309
 second he is very very soft not going 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.309
 notice any dimples not dimples 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.610
 the third is not at all important for you 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.539
 what's on the cold it starts up well 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.690
 I will come the process of the first half turnovers in 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.930
 puddle to start the engine here I took from me 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.230
 stood for these 2 weeks because it fell out 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.260
 snow 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.879
 it was very cold somewhere Vince 10 -15 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.070
 degrees snow lay somewhere for two weeks 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.880
 now he set as you see 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.030
 I went to take a think of his face 1 out of 5 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.930
 he flakes wound up with a half turn I was 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.200
 extremely surprised now car 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.200
 Hello 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.170
 now we will pass in it and we will listen as 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:28.260
 he is being driven 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.260
 I say when you go in it 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:37.700
 quieter than just worth it so wait 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.170
 will have cars 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.530
 to extreme speeds of course 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.179
 I will not accelerate because firstly 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:52.670
 100 on the one hand and secondly the road such 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:54.319
 weak as words are filmed by 20 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.710
 accelerate plus just listen as we 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.710
 working 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.340
 going to keep exactly 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.340
 Not sure it's going to happen . road is everything . 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.270
 how I slowed down that probably everyone 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.460
 heard that work he is just incredible 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:05.330
 I take this moped at once not for racing 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.410
 not off-road it is very comfortable 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.100
 very quiet with little expense moped 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.470
 I personally am not a fan of such speed 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:19.670
 off-road motorcycles and mopeds 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.120
 for me personally , comfort is important here 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.700
 layout 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.360
 does not fit your best and thanks for all 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.070
 Attention 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.250
 If you like, put likes not 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.960
 I liked to put dislikes all ATP for 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.960
 attention see you soon
