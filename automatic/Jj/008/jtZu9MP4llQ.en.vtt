to<00:06:14.670> console<00:06:15.270> developers<00:06:15.780> allowing<00:06:16.200> them<00:06:16.320> to

to console developers allowing them to

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
do a lot more stuff with the GPU so

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.990 
do a lot more stuff with the GPU so
basically<00:06:19.170> the<00:06:19.320> new<00:06:19.500> ps4<00:06:19.830> is<00:06:20.280> built<00:06:20.640> on<00:06:20.850> the

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
basically the new ps4 is built on the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.460 
basically the new ps4 is built on the

the<00:06:22.560> PC<00:06:22.950> chip<00:06:23.190> industry<00:06:23.670> by<00:06:23.850> combining<00:06:24.390> both

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
the PC chip industry by combining both

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.720 
the PC chip industry by combining both
serial<00:06:25.050> and<00:06:25.200> parallel<00:06:25.430> processing<00:06:26.430> into<00:06:26.700> a

serial and parallel processing into a

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.850 
serial and parallel processing into a
more<00:06:27.000> efficient<00:06:27.480> yet<00:06:27.630> powerful<00:06:28.290> single<00:06:28.620> chip

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
more efficient yet powerful single chip

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.740 
more efficient yet powerful single chip
that<00:06:29.010> is<00:06:29.070> easier<00:06:29.580> to<00:06:29.730> develop<00:06:29.880> games<00:06:30.180> for<00:06:30.330> but

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
that is easier to develop games for but

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.750 
that is easier to develop games for but
again<00:06:30.960> the<00:06:31.140> secret<00:06:31.530> sauce<00:06:31.710> lies<00:06:32.010> in<00:06:32.250> the<00:06:32.370> API

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
again the secret sauce lies in the API

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.240 
again the secret sauce lies in the API
is<00:06:32.910> that<00:06:33.090> Sony<00:06:33.510> gives<00:06:33.870> to<00:06:34.050> developers<00:06:34.590> so<00:06:35.010> stay

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
is that Sony gives to developers so stay

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.620 
is that Sony gives to developers so stay
