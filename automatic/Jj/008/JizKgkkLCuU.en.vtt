00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.170
 can anyone who can can 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.769
 kaká can ask can can 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.769
 How much can she do? 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.740
 It was pretty cool in the calangos of Brazil. 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.650
 It's happening here for you two more. 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.510
 What's up, man? Hi, what 's today's value? 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.130
 Let's start by talking about a game that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.920
 people was 3 that was the great news 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.350
 ubisoft for that year a plan that 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.410
 Come, but I 'm not the one that I quit. 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 cindy op learning that I do not know what 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.100
 everybody already knows only this time 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.020
 you can look from both sides of me 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.480
 years of the opportunity to play a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.149
 multiplayer doublesix modes in which 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.640
 there is a side of villains right now that the galley 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.129
 mother of the bandit of the baked galley and has 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.989
 that the good side that is one of the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.380
 the bandits had to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.630
 protect the house reinforce it or is to think 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.030
 where they are going to hide hostage and things like 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.729
 while the police had to pick up 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.830
 a drone and scratch the house in 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.990
 search for the new information 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.780
 are the barricades where the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.210
 protections to be able to invade the house more 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.400
 is more pure there . 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.590
 the tactic is a game you have to go 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.450
 very mingled with his team and I 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.430
 sincerely i think it goes with something 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.090
 in the sport scene because it is 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.090
 very 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.369
 which is very competitive because it does not 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.380
 It is how you play the game alone 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.869
 unless you are a closed party 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.969
 Why is communication so important? 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.250
 the knowledge of the map and the like 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.829
 because it is an extremely tactical and 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.689
 There's no way you can play alone. 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.250
 in a closed face because you need 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.990
 a lot of communication strategy is 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.329
 essential and knowledge of the map also 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.459
 have no control not to play alone and 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.469
 fall into the team of people you never 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.880
 saw your life never talked speak 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.740
 different languages 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.989
 It's complicated there, I feel 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.940
 lived it there in the ebx show case 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.829
 where was rolling one was rolling 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.049
 demonstration of developers playing 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.819
 to help later we must face playing 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.420
 It was really cool because we play. 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.549
 because they had all interaction is 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.310
 between the team between the map and 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.420
 was exciting and when we played 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.610
 nobody knows anybody nobody 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.510
 I could make it beautiful, it did not die well. 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.970
 fast 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.860
 so that's why it's essential 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.690
 communication I think it will be very 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.670
 crazy and this is what the audience will be 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.959
 everybody who does not even crazy screaming at tse 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.880
 Just like we do when we play 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.690
 cup and also a lot of 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.280
 competitiveness and put you in legal and 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.170
 that's all we've seen from the game until 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.730
 now that is one of the non- multiplayer modes 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.810
 we have more information about the single 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.930
 player or any other mode 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.150
 multiplayer or cope 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.459
 so we're just probably going to have 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.440
 this information next year then 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.430
 Took and wait, Clô, we 'll go. 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.349
 know more things 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.389
 if you want to check out an entire video 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.400
 of the robot pre- alpha gameplay was 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.500
 shown below in the e3 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.299
 You 're fully booked. 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.900
 for you to understand everything you understand 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.010
 English 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.010
 now you will understand that you are 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.630
 scheduled a favor to be pretending but not 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.519
 has been easy to transfer in the window but 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.739
 came out news came out the first big 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.010
 update to pretend that nothing else 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.380
 nothing less than tournaments little thing in the game 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.410
 you can win there's got to be xpta 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:40.489
 Money in a game is very simple I do not know 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.660
 there pass the accumulating phases to the 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.920
 not get a good score on 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.800
 first tournament 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.450
 to them are results from time to time 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.459
 so if you did not get the first 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.380
 You can try as many times as you want. 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.370
 then afterwards and accumulating 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.050
 money getting rich xp ii has a lot 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.750
 thing that I healed another nice news 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.970
 and also against China that will leave 6 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.220
 should be pro game and if you want you can 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.290
 purchase each separately or 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.880
 If you are one of those professionals who 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.590
 likes to save money on the hand of 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.280
 cow went to los angeles and bought a 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.930
 flight 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.450
 Can you buy a fish and 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.489
 then see where with cool at the end there 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.620
 as they were leaving already have it will 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.570
 gaining something else legal is also that 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.470
 now the triumph we already understand that the xbox 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.550
 one 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.919
 so if you do not have a game either 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.900
 know and help a little there only 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.610

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.070
 He got off of that bacaninha's 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.720

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.550
 the challenge of the madalena the challenge of 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.790
 last week was born and raised in 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.870
 my life in the same life or in the 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.880
 my mother's village 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.650

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.639

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.620
 my enemies 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.030
 I adopted it simpler because my 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.479
 true is very difficult to describe 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.940
 pronounce and anything my name 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.919
 true is the honestly I do not know 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:02.720
