00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
Chelsea they defended resolutely I

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.430 
Chelsea they defended resolutely I
thought<00:02:58.280> we<00:02:58.370> pushed<00:02:58.610> them<00:02:58.730> all<00:02:58.880> away<00:02:59.350> and<00:03:00.350> the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
thought we pushed them all away and the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.080 
thought we pushed them all away and the
timing<00:03:00.770> of<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.920> second<00:03:01.280> goal<00:03:01.430> just<00:03:01.670> really

timing of the second goal just really

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.880 
timing of the second goal just really
was<00:03:02.810> crucial<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.290> thought<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.680> time

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
was crucial I thought in the time

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.990 
was crucial I thought in the time
because<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.250> thought<00:03:04.430> we<00:03:04.580> had<00:03:04.670> them<00:03:04.820> on<00:03:04.910> the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
because I thought we had them on the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.260
