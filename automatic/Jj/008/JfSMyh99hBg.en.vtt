actually we'll see maybe I'll clean

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:34.990 
actually we'll see maybe I'll clean

white should be able to pull that off

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.660 
white should be able to pull that off
there<00:02:35.269> are<00:02:35.420> three<00:02:35.690> google<00:02:36.410> golems<00:02:36.859> left<00:02:37.340> 45

for<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.299> golems<00:02:38.599> left<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:40.700> she<00:02:40.910> going<00:02:41.090> for

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
for the golems left and is she going for

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.839 
for the golems left and is she going for
the<00:02:41.329> wall<00:02:41.510> though<00:02:41.690> or<00:02:41.930> she<00:02:42.290> going<00:02:42.530> inside<00:02:43.340> and

the wall though or she going inside and
now<00:02:44.420> she's<00:02:44.630> brought<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.900> into<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.170> wall<00:02:45.349> six

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
now she's brought it into the wall six

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.710 
now she's brought it into the wall six
years<00:02:45.799> we<00:02:46.250> jumped<00:02:46.549> this<00:02:46.609> area<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.150> there<00:02:47.329> is<00:02:47.450> no

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
years we jumped this area so there is no

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.659 
years we jumped this area so there is no
possibility<00:02:47.900> for<00:02:48.319> her<00:02:48.560> actually<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:49.040> walk

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:49.669 
possibility for her actually to walk

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.610 
possibility for her actually to walk
over<00:02:49.940> there<00:02:50.120> let's<00:02:50.780> only<00:02:50.930> have<00:02:51.139> eight<00:02:51.319> balls

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
over there let's only have eight balls

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.059 
over there let's only have eight balls
so<00:02:52.190> it's<00:02:52.540> getting<00:02:53.540> quite<00:02:53.780> fast<00:02:54.019> no<00:02:54.560> joint<00:02:54.889> Bob

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
so it's getting quite fast no joint Bob

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.479 
so it's getting quite fast no joint Bob
not<00:02:55.760> good<00:02:56.769> okay<00:02:57.769> let's<00:02:57.980> see<00:02:58.160> what<00:02:58.250> are<00:02:58.400> we

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
not good okay let's see what are we

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.940 
not good okay let's see what are we
going<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.819> do<00:02:58.910> with<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.150> wizard<00:02:59.950> when

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
going to do with that wizard when

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.350 
going to do with that wizard when
probably<00:03:01.730> now

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
probably now

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.690 
probably now
since<00:03:02.990> someone<00:03:03.860> is<00:03:03.950> going<00:03:04.100> for<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.400> tunnel

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
since someone is going for that tunnel

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.790 
since someone is going for that tunnel
now<00:03:04.820> Canada<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:05.810> going<00:03:06.020> down<00:03:06.200> still<00:03:06.560> clockwork

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
now Canada is going down still clockwork

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.980 
now Canada is going down still clockwork
up<00:03:07.160> depends<00:03:08.060> what<00:03:08.150> my<00:03:08.300> team<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.600> doing<00:03:08.720> now

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
up depends what my team is doing now

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.920 
up depends what my team is doing now
she's<00:03:09.290> going<00:03:09.470> for<00:03:09.740> that<00:03:10.640> wall<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.720> then

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
she's going for that wall and then

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.870 
she's going for that wall and then
prolly<00:03:12.110> for<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.380> tunnel<00:03:12.590> then<00:03:12.890> for<00:03:13.160> the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
prolly for the tunnel then for the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.000 
prolly for the tunnel then for the
Builder<00:03:14.120> hurts<00:03:14.380> we'll<00:03:15.380> see<00:03:15.560> we<00:03:15.650> have<00:03:15.770> a<00:03:15.800> which

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
Builder hurts we'll see we have a which

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.710 
Builder hurts we'll see we have a which
left<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.550> which<00:03:16.700> is<00:03:16.820> X<00:03:17.000> 2<00:03:17.210> which<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.450> actually

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
left the which is X 2 which is actually

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.980 
left the which is X 2 which is actually
in<00:03:18.430> whoa<00:03:19.430> that's<00:03:19.700> good<00:03:19.880> there<00:03:20.210> may<00:03:20.660> be<00:03:20.690> yeah

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
in whoa that's good there may be yeah

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.870 
in whoa that's good there may be yeah
they're<00:03:21.170> geisha<00:03:21.380> getting<00:03:21.740> tanked<00:03:22.070> know<00:03:22.520> that

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
they're geisha getting tanked know that

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.240 
they're geisha getting tanked know that
bomb<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.600> close<00:03:23.860> could<00:03:24.860> be<00:03:24.980> one<00:03:25.130> other

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
bomb so close could be one other

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.580 
bomb so close could be one other
percentages<00:03:25.840> depends<00:03:26.840> probably<00:03:27.110> not<00:03:27.410> because

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
percentages depends probably not because

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.880 
percentages depends probably not because
of<00:03:27.710> the<00:03:27.830> clock<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:28.880> we<00:03:29.120> will<00:03:29.410> not<00:03:30.410> be<00:03:30.620> able<00:03:30.740> to

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
of the clock so we will not be able to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.090 
of the clock so we will not be able to
get<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.130> twister<00:03:31.520> on<00:03:31.670> this<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:33.620> time<00:03:33.890> is

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
get a twister on this the time is

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.010 
get a twister on this the time is
running<00:03:34.459> out<00:03:34.580> way<00:03:35.120> too<00:03:35.180> quickly<00:03:35.570> it's<00:03:35.780> just

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
running out way too quickly it's just

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.380 
running out way too quickly it's just
push<00:03:36.290> her<00:03:36.830> ability<00:03:37.250> so<00:03:37.490> we<00:03:37.610> get<00:03:37.760> some<00:03:38.030> more<00:03:38.240> of

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
push her ability so we get some more of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.110 
push her ability so we get some more of

something wrong we're going to use two

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.950 
something wrong we're going to use two
golems<00:04:22.400> here<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:22.970> two<00:04:23.210> golems<00:04:23.450> here<00:04:23.750> and

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
somehow well you can see it 3 golems are

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.870 
somehow well you can see it 3 golems are
in<00:04:27.320> this<00:04:27.530> area<00:04:27.919> and<00:04:28.190> they're<00:04:28.490> all<00:04:28.669> going

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880

in this area and they're all going
through<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.180> same<00:04:29.330> spot<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:29.990> this<00:04:30.650> golem<00:04:30.979> is

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
through the same spot and this golem is

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.190 
through the same spot and this golem is
getting<00:04:31.340> quite<00:04:31.490> low<00:04:31.790> already<00:04:32.000> since<00:04:32.570> he<00:04:32.990> has

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
getting quite low already since he has

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.420 
getting quite low already since he has
no<00:04:33.560> golden<00:04:34.100> body<00:04:34.780> well<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.560> Wahlburgers<00:04:37.250> got

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
no golden body well the Wahlburgers got

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.190 
no golden body well the Wahlburgers got
killed<00:04:37.669> here<00:04:37.910> by<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.090> way<00:04:38.270> from<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.780> model<00:04:39.110> as

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
killed here by the way from a model as

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.140 
killed here by the way from a model as
well<00:04:39.410> so<00:04:39.710> my<00:04:39.860> goal<00:04:40.040> one<00:04:40.190> is<00:04:40.460> already<00:04:40.729> split

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
well so my goal one is already split

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.080 
well so my goal one is already split
here<00:04:41.390> that's<00:04:41.840> why<00:04:42.050> I<00:04:42.080> pushed<00:04:42.530> in<00:04:42.880> jump<00:04:43.880> spell

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
here that's why I pushed in jump spell

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.120 
here that's why I pushed in jump spell
right<00:04:44.270> here<00:04:44.419> because<00:04:44.570> more<00:04:44.870> of<00:04:44.900> my<00:04:45.110> units<00:04:46.010> were

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
right here because more of my units were

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.659 
right here because more of my units were
going<00:04:46.370> this<00:04:46.490> way<00:04:46.760> but<00:04:47.150> somehow<00:04:48.280> maybe<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.400> bit

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
going this way but somehow maybe a bit

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.610 
going this way but somehow maybe a bit
early<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.300> jump<00:04:50.540> spell<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:51.290> I<00:04:51.320> could<00:04:51.530> have

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
early that jump spell so I could have

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.010 
early that jump spell so I could have
waited<00:04:52.040> a<00:04:52.310> bit<00:04:52.460> longer<00:04:52.520> in<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.510> end<00:04:53.630> my<00:04:53.660> golems

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
waited a bit longer in the end my golems

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.480 
waited a bit longer in the end my golems
are<00:04:54.169> jumping<00:04:54.470> in<00:04:54.560> there<00:04:54.710> are<00:04:54.830> some<00:04:55.010> Tesla's

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
are jumping in there are some Tesla's

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.750 
are jumping in there are some Tesla's

the if that gone dark elixir surge would

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.939 
the if that gone dark elixir surge would
not<00:07:11.969> have<00:07:12.389> been<00:07:12.690> destroyed<00:07:13.080> he<00:07:13.710> would<00:07:13.860> have

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:13.949 
not have been destroyed he would have

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:16.219 
not have been destroyed he would have
had<00:07:14.069> a<00:07:14.099> problem<00:07:14.400> because<00:07:14.699> then<00:07:15.330> the<00:07:15.750> barb<00:07:15.990> king

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:16.229 
had a problem because then the barb king

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:17.990 
had a problem because then the barb king
could<00:07:16.440> have<00:07:16.529> gone<00:07:16.710> for<00:07:17.159> the<00:07:17.250> dark<00:07:17.430> elixir

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
could have gone for the dark elixir

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.360 
could have gone for the dark elixir
surge<00:07:18.360> and<00:07:18.659> the<00:07:18.690> Queen<00:07:19.560> could<00:07:19.800> have<00:07:19.919> gone<00:07:20.069> for

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
surge and the Queen could have gone for

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.730 
surge and the Queen could have gone for
the<00:07:21.180> Alexa<00:07:21.630> storage<00:07:21.930> and<00:07:22.080> they<00:07:22.199> would<00:07:22.380> spread

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
the Alexa storage and they would spread

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.510 
the Alexa storage and they would spread
up<00:07:22.949> and<00:07:23.330> not<00:07:24.330> been<00:07:24.630> able<00:07:24.990> to<00:07:25.529> actually<00:07:25.740> get<00:07:26.279> the

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:28.169 
tunnel in the end or they're going to

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:31.370 
tunnel in the end or they're going to
get<00:07:28.380> sensible<00:07:28.860> it's<00:07:29.130> just<00:07:29.630> get<00:07:30.630> the<00:07:30.750> faster

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 
get sensible it's just get the faster

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.019 
get sensible it's just get the faster
you<00:07:31.469> can<00:07:31.500> see<00:07:31.770> barkings<00:07:32.219> running<00:07:32.580> to<00:07:32.699> Alexa

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:33.029 
you can see barkings running to Alexa

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:34.760 
you can see barkings running to Alexa
solid<00:07:33.300> screen<00:07:33.539> as<00:07:33.659> well<00:07:33.810> and<00:07:34.050> if<00:07:34.169> if<00:07:34.440> the<00:07:34.500> dark

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:34.770 
solid screen as well and if if the dark

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.379 
solid screen as well and if if the dark
elixir<00:07:34.979> so<00:07:35.250> it<00:07:35.310> would<00:07:35.669> have<00:07:35.699> been<00:07:35.909> still<00:07:36.090> up

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389 
elixir so it would have been still up

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.129 
elixir so it would have been still up
that<00:07:36.930> might<00:07:37.229> split<00:07:37.590> them<00:07:37.800> so<00:07:38.550> very<00:07:39.509> very<00:07:39.659> nice
