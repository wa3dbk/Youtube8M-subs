00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 and another iphone reaches the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.200
 fresh from the shop 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.240
 namely iphone 6 plus in silver 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.320
 Here the pack has changed 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.670
 is on the side only the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.170
 lettering iphone to see 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.940
 who actually in 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.520
 body color and here on it 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.890
 simply a giant big white iphone 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.600
 So a bit indicated the phone 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.220
 you can not see it yourself 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.279
 is then nice again the price 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.609
 799 euros for 16 gb 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.289
 that's a whole lot of money but it 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.239
 is also a really big iphone 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.030
 and let's have a look at it now 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.219
 unboxing on 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.680
 Just as with other just too 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.649
 work a bit with precision 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.059
 The foil is a beautiful cardboard box can 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.410
 you do not tell me otherwise personally 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.450
 has the picture on top of it 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.899
 Bit better but good 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.020
 that's how it is and it comes to light 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.670
 iphone 6 plus this is a real crusher 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.510
 you can not do that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.219
 underestimate 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.199
 how big that is when I do that 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.920
 so hold in your hand then you see 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.090
 pretty good anyway with 180 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.799
 then the mobile phone dominates the hand 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.960
 and no longer hand the cellphone though 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.580
 well, what else in the box have it 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.350
 is again the pad with the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.049
 recess for the camera with in there because 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.820
 the one piece stands out the whole 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.740
 Font and sticker collection is 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.409
 of course, I also put white stickers in it 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.689
 Believe something bigger than the iphone 6 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.210
 We have a lot of paperwork now 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.220
 do not go through it individually and that is 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.100
 tool that 's it's not in there 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.140
 then of course the apple comes to her 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.189
 No beats there again 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.869
 probably the cooperation 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.579
 just do not develop long enough 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.320
 can that somehow like that now 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.780
 There is also a bit of influence in it 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.909
 then once the new brand 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.070
 charger and of course the lightning 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.320
 cable that was more than in the box at all 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.259
 not in it but it is as always only 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.079
 around the device and that is the iphone 6 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.340
 Plus, I'm packing now 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.860
 the film way and then we have too 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.069
 we already look at the device in hand 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.349
 Now he's on the screen too 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.090
 nothing flickers you have to 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.590
 really say it is totally clean 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.330
 worked as well 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.209
 these passages here at the strokes 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.800
 that's all you do not realize what 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.120
 you realize is really the camera 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.260
 which stands out that is also the case 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.300
 iphone 6 the case 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.590
 I do not believe that you hang on it 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.840
 stay because it's a bit sideways 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.450
 is sanded but somehow disturbs 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.239
 it the total optics I guess that 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.250
 you just because of technical 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.540
 things a little bit on top of it 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.670
 this has to be more or less involved 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.319
 compromise is because that is not 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.910
 handwriting by jony ive that's more 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.519
 handwriting physics it just does not work 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.650
 otherwise good otherwise the usual we 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.790
 have a touch id button here that is 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.860
 Of course, again with it 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.319
 it is not bigger than the normal one 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.680
 but it's still very good 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.390
 achievable and the top feature on the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.129
 Of course, this device is unbelievable 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.810
 big screen and how in the 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.620
 test will start soon 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.620
