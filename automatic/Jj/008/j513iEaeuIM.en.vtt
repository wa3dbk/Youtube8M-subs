00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.480
 today we'll take care of it a bit 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.280
 around the men I'll show you one today 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.529
 very fast technology like us 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.390
 also create because our customers 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.800
 a little bit of structure to become pure 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.050
 I use our new one today 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.609
 product under base braker was 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.070
 can this base braker within 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.050
 Ten minutes 1 factors on precipitation no 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.710
 warm reflex everything stays green 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.180
 Area 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.180
 I show you now need 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.850
 In any case, the perfect 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.350
 difference see if I still have it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.579
 so very small window everyone 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.280
 lower area let 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.720
 We let nature and the rest wear 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.720
 I'm guessing now 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.950
 so theoretically announce now 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.390
 finally send out of ours again 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.370
 Of course, as long as you can see, I believe you 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.440
 the whole thing it really is 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.270
 a tone brighter everything in cool area 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.160
 or does agree apart so no 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.510
 fresh from the sun holiday but comes 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.100
 Of course we do a little bit more 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.600
 further I show you again technique so 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.030
 I said yes for lars I have me 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.680
 two colors prepared that contour like 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.930
 said half an inch with 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.670
 let out and what I'm doing now is 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:04.440
 just small triangles out of the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.619
 slice is with take out and arbitrary 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.200
 so that one or two colors with 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.380
 a slight transition to approach not 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.280
 apply directly to it always does 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.280
 like with the back of the hand 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.910
 advantage of this short film is me 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.850
 can always look under the bottom where mine 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.070
 rove just sitting and then you can now 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.630
 vision checkerboard pattern again and again 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.700
 my strands or highlights 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.770
 interpose that he works i 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.010
 here at the whole complete top 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.010
 deck
