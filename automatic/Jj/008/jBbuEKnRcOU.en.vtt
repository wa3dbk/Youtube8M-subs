I<00:02:42.549> cut<00:02:43.549> this<00:02:43.760> sliver<00:02:44.170> with<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.379> circular<00:02:46.099> saw

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
I cut this sliver with the circular saw

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.020 
I cut this sliver with the circular saw
first<00:02:46.730> plunged<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.659> and<00:02:47.959> I<00:02:48.920> just<00:02:49.219> put<00:02:49.430> these

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
first plunged it and I just put these

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.179 
first plunged it and I just put these
hinges<00:02:50.269> on<00:02:50.569> these<00:02:51.139> nice<00:02:51.409> stainless<00:02:51.829> in<00:02:52.010> just

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
hinges on these nice stainless in just

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.390 
hinges on these nice stainless in just
with<00:02:52.370> some<00:02:52.519> stainless<00:02:52.849> bolts<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.859> know

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
with some stainless bolts so that I know

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.280 
with some stainless bolts so that I know
it'll<00:02:56.209> line<00:02:56.540> back<00:02:56.810> up

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
it'll line back up

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.569 
it'll line back up
it'll<00:02:57.650> be<00:02:57.739> a<00:02:57.769> pain<00:02:58.010> in<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.159> ass<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:58.459> the

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
it'll be a pain in the ass but the

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.860 
it'll be a pain in the ass but the
hinges<00:02:58.879> on<00:02:58.969> after<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.329> doors<00:02:59.540> loose<00:03:00.489> so

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
hinges on after the doors loose so

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.770 
hinges on after the doors loose so
they're<00:03:02.870> kind<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.590> straight<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:05.120> know<00:03:05.209> just

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
they're kind of straight you know just

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.599 
they're kind of straight you know just
kind<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.260> making<00:03:06.439> this<00:03:06.560> up<00:03:06.739> as<00:03:06.889> I<00:03:06.980> go<00:03:07.010> along<00:03:07.129> my

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
kind of making this up as I go along my

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.089 
kind of making this up as I go along my
ball<00:03:07.819> on<00:03:07.939> it<00:03:08.060> now<00:03:08.150> look<00:03:08.480> we're<00:03:08.629> good<00:03:08.919> but<00:03:09.919> the

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
ball on it now look we're good but the

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.140 
ball on it now look we're good but the
the<00:03:10.970> holes<00:03:11.180> do<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:13.159> holes<00:03:13.370> are<00:03:13.519> just<00:03:13.639> a<00:03:13.790> smidge

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
the holes do the holes are just a smidge

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.569 
the holes do the holes are just a smidge
bigger<00:03:14.180> than<00:03:14.629> a<00:03:14.659> quarter-inch<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.650> they<00:03:16.280> have

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
bigger than a quarter-inch so they have

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:17.949 
bigger than a quarter-inch so they have
a<00:03:16.609> little<00:03:16.879> bit<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.090> movement<00:03:17.329> which<00:03:17.629> is<00:03:17.780> good

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
a little bit of movement which is good

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.349 
a little bit of movement which is good
so<00:03:18.169> I<00:03:18.200> can<00:03:18.409> if<00:03:19.400> I<00:03:19.489> have<00:03:19.669> some<00:03:19.849> issues<00:03:20.120> with<00:03:20.269> the

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
so I can if I have some issues with the

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.289 
so I can if I have some issues with the
two<00:03:20.510> bonding<00:03:20.870> against<00:03:21.109> each<00:03:21.260> other<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:23.180> got

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
two bonding against each other and I got

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.490 
two bonding against each other and I got
this<00:03:23.450> latch<00:03:24.909> which<00:03:25.909> will<00:03:26.060> go<00:03:26.180> over<00:03:26.480> here<00:03:26.840> just

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
this latch which will go over here just

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.309 
this latch which will go over here just
a<00:03:27.680> ring<00:03:27.829> or<00:03:28.010> stainless<00:03:28.939> latch<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.629> I<00:03:30.019> think

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
a ring or stainless latch and I think

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.569 
a ring or stainless latch and I think
I'm<00:03:30.469> gonna<00:03:30.590> have<00:03:30.799> a<00:03:30.829> problem<00:03:31.069> with<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.430> door

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
I'm gonna have a problem with the door

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.599 
I'm gonna have a problem with the door
swinging<00:03:32.060> in<00:03:32.530> but<00:03:33.530> I'll<00:03:33.949> probably<00:03:34.159> put<00:03:34.459> some

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
swinging in but I'll probably put some

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.960 
swinging in but I'll probably put some
tabs<00:03:34.879> on<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.209> bottom<00:03:35.599> or<00:03:36.040> wherever<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.819> keep

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
tabs on the bottom or wherever to keep

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.899 
tabs on the bottom or wherever to keep
the<00:03:38.060> door<00:03:38.209> from<00:03:38.239> swinging<00:03:38.810> in<00:03:39.760> because<00:03:40.760> it's

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
the door from swinging in because it's

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.729 
the door from swinging in because it's
gonna<00:03:41.000> be<00:03:41.239> pretty<00:03:41.599> jagged<00:03:41.989> edge<00:03:42.290> I'll

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
gonna be pretty jagged edge I'll

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.149 
gonna be pretty jagged edge I'll
probably<00:03:42.979> clean<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.340> up<00:03:43.549> with<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.859> grinder<00:03:45.859> just

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
probably clean it up with a grinder just

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.559 
probably clean it up with a grinder just
you<00:03:46.609> know<00:03:46.729> I<00:03:46.760> don't<00:03:47.030> want<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.209> there's<00:03:47.449> gonna

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
you know I don't want to there's gonna

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.030 
you know I don't want to there's gonna
be<00:03:47.659> a<00:03:47.689> lot<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.810> wires<00:03:48.079> hanging<00:03:48.439> in<00:03:48.680> there<00:03:48.859> and

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
be a lot of wires hanging in there and

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.619 
be a lot of wires hanging in there and
 so<00:03:49.609> I<00:03:49.639> don't<00:03:49.879> want<00:03:50.000> them<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.239> cut<00:03:50.419> it<00:03:50.510> up

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
 so I don't want them to cut it up

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.420 
 so I don't want them to cut it up
yeah<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.049> got<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:51.470> door<00:03:51.620> cut<00:03:51.919> out<00:03:54.250> works<00:03:55.250> pretty

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
yeah I got the door cut out works pretty

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.939 
yeah I got the door cut out works pretty
good<00:03:55.549> I<00:03:55.760> had<00:03:55.909> to<00:03:56.030> use<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.199> zip<00:03:57.409> wheel<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.769> clean

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:57.949 
good I had to use the zip wheel to clean

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.149 
good I had to use the zip wheel to clean
up<00:03:58.040> that<00:03:58.220> corner<00:03:58.639> and<00:03:58.819> that<00:03:58.879> corner<00:03:59.030> and<00:04:00.159> it's

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
up that corner and that corner and it's

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.189 
up that corner and that corner and it's
sagging<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:01.669> little<00:04:01.879> bit<00:04:02.000> right<00:04:02.209> here<00:04:02.479> I'm

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.679 

probably<00:04:06.199> gonna<00:04:06.470> put<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:07.280> piece<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.180> trim<00:04:08.540> all

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
probably gonna put a piece of trim all

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:09.939 
probably gonna put a piece of trim all
the<00:04:08.720> way<00:04:08.810> around<00:04:09.139> it<00:04:09.259> actually<00:04:09.650> thought<00:04:09.889> about

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:09.949 
the way around it actually thought about

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:15.460 
the way around it actually thought about
it<00:04:10.280> but<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:12.290> opens<00:04:12.620> pretty<00:04:13.370> nicely<00:04:14.379> plenty<00:04:15.379> of

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
it but it opens pretty nicely plenty of

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.330 
it but it opens pretty nicely plenty of
room<00:04:15.650> now<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.919> can<00:04:16.269> seal<00:04:17.269> it<00:04:17.299> up<00:04:17.479> in<00:04:17.690> here<00:04:18.139> and

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
room now I can seal it up in here and

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.240 
room now I can seal it up in here and
and<00:04:19.340> built<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.120> feet<00:04:20.329> to<00:04:20.659> mount<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.250> mount

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
and built the feet to mount the mount

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
the console to the floor I'm gonna put a

the console to the floor I'm gonna put a
little<00:04:24.710> piece<00:04:24.919> of<00:04:24.949> plate<00:04:25.220> all<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.400> way<00:04:25.490> around

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
little piece of plate all the way around

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.370 
little piece of plate all the way around
it<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.270> a<00:04:27.759> nice

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
it and a nice

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.710 
it and a nice
nice<00:04:31.190> stainless<00:04:31.670> I<00:04:31.850> couldn't<00:04:32.180> put<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.330> bolt<00:04:32.540> on

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
nice stainless I couldn't put a bolt on

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.020 
nice stainless I couldn't put a bolt on
that<00:04:32.900> one<00:04:33.080> there<00:04:33.290> because<00:04:33.910> we<00:04:34.910> would

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
that one there because we would

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.320 
that one there because we would
interfere<00:04:35.270> with<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:36.280> latch<00:04:37.280> but<00:04:37.820> it's<00:04:38.210> on

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
interfere with the latch but it's on

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.830 
interfere with the latch but it's on
there<00:04:38.540> and<00:04:39.410> I'll<00:04:39.860> finish<00:04:40.390> drilling<00:04:41.390> holes

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
there and I'll finish drilling holes

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.240 
there and I'll finish drilling holes
putting<00:04:42.410> bolts<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.160> stainless<00:04:43.760> hinges<00:04:44.150> and

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
putting bolts and stainless hinges and

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.500 
putting bolts and stainless hinges and
pretty<00:04:46.250> happy<00:04:46.400> with<00:04:46.670> it<00:04:46.730> so<00:04:46.850> far<00:04:47.950> I<00:04:49.240> was<00:04:50.240> afraid

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
pretty happy with it so far I was afraid

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.960 
pretty happy with it so far I was afraid
the<00:04:50.690> door<00:04:50.870> was<00:04:51.020> gonna<00:04:51.110> warp<00:04:51.440> a<00:04:51.740> lot<00:04:52.400> I<00:04:52.640> might

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
the door was gonna warp a lot I might

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.490 
the door was gonna warp a lot I might
end<00:04:53.090> up<00:04:53.210> putting<00:04:53.420> some<00:04:53.540> angle<00:04:53.960> on<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.170> inside

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
end up putting some angle on the inside

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.330 
end up putting some angle on the inside
of<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:54.650> door<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:56.680> strengthen<00:04:57.680> it<00:04:57.800> up<00:04:57.890> but<00:04:58.160> it's

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
of the door to strengthen it up but it's

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.480 
of the door to strengthen it up but it's
three<00:04:58.520> sixteenths<00:04:59.000> plate<00:04:59.240> so<00:05:00.460> should<00:05:01.460> be

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
three sixteenths plate so should be

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.610 
three sixteenths plate so should be
should<00:05:02.240> be<00:05:02.360> okay<00:05:03.010> in<00:05:04.010> theory<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.810> don't<00:05:06.500> want

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
should be okay in theory and don't want

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.900 
should be okay in theory and don't want
to<00:05:06.650> put<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.860> piece<00:05:07.040> a<00:05:07.070> angle<00:05:07.430> on<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.580> inside<00:05:07.850> of

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
to put a piece a angle on the inside of

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.030 
to put a piece a angle on the inside of
the<00:05:07.970> door<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.300> have<00:05:08.480> it<00:05:08.630> bind<00:05:09.110> with<00:05:09.440> something

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
the door and have it bind with something

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.090 
the door and have it bind with something
else<00:05:10.190> inside<00:05:10.570> but<00:05:11.570> might<00:05:12.200> just<00:05:12.410> leave<00:05:13.010> it

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
else inside but might just leave it

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.950 
else inside but might just leave it
alone<00:05:13.130> I'm<00:05:13.630> definitely<00:05:14.630> going<00:05:14.720> to<00:05:14.780> put<00:05:14.930> a

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
alone I'm definitely going to put a

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.840 
alone I'm definitely going to put a
piece<00:05:15.140> of<00:05:15.290> trim<00:05:15.560> piece<00:05:15.980> all<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.460> way<00:05:16.490> around

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
piece of trim piece all the way around

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.170 
piece of trim piece all the way around
on<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.240> inside<00:05:17.600> and<00:05:18.700> it's<00:05:19.700> gonna<00:05:19.850> be<00:05:19.970> a<00:05:20.000> bitch

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
on the inside and it's gonna be a bitch

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.880 
on the inside and it's gonna be a bitch
to<00:05:20.210> weld<00:05:20.540> but<00:05:20.810> I<00:05:21.050> think<00:05:21.260> I'll<00:05:21.350> feel<00:05:21.590> happy

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
to weld but I think I'll feel happy

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.980 
to weld but I think I'll feel happy
about<00:05:21.950> that<00:05:22.220> because<00:05:22.420> we<00:05:23.420> used<00:05:23.600> a<00:05:23.660> circular

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
about that because we used a circular

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.450 
about that because we used a circular
saw<00:05:24.170> blade<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.560> there's<00:05:24.710> a<00:05:24.770> pretty<00:05:24.980> good<00:05:25.220> gap

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
saw blade and there's a pretty good gap

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.440 
saw blade and there's a pretty good gap
I<00:05:25.670> mean<00:05:25.820> I<00:05:26.090> did<00:05:26.990> my<00:05:27.140> best<00:05:27.290> but<00:05:28.360> there's<00:05:29.360> a

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
I mean I did my best but there's a

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.270 
I mean I did my best but there's a
pretty<00:05:29.660> pretty<00:05:30.020> pretty<00:05:30.530> big<00:05:30.710> gap<00:05:30.980> all<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.220> way

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
pretty pretty pretty big gap all the way

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.120 
pretty pretty pretty big gap all the way
around<00:05:31.580> it<00:05:31.730> which<00:05:31.850> could<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:33.740> know<00:05:33.860> if<00:05:34.010> it

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
around it which could you know if it

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.550 
around it which could you know if it
rained<00:05:34.370> on<00:05:34.580> it<00:05:34.730> it<00:05:34.880> could<00:05:34.970> probably<00:05:35.210> a<00:05:35.630> little

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
rained on it it could probably a little

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.410 
rained on it it could probably a little
too<00:05:36.770> much<00:05:36.920> water<00:05:37.130> in<00:05:37.250> there<00:05:38.410> you<00:05:39.410> know<00:05:39.530> so

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
too much water in there you know so

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.660 
too much water in there you know so
coming<00:05:41.420> along
