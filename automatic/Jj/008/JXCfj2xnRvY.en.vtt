like<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.100> said<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.430> can<00:03:41.580> say<00:03:41.850> Todd<00:03:42.180> Dylan<00:03:42.540> came

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
like I said you can say Todd Dylan came

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.380 
like I said you can say Todd Dylan came
down<00:03:42.960> or<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.380> can<00:03:43.410> say<00:03:43.800> that<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.490> Larson<00:03:44.970> got

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
down or you can say that that Larson got

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.960 
down or you can say that that Larson got
in<00:03:45.570> too<00:03:45.780> deep<00:03:46.050> it<00:03:46.350> certainly<00:03:46.920> was<00:03:47.550> just<00:03:47.880> a

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
in too deep it certainly was just a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.500 
in too deep it certainly was just a
situation<00:03:48.180> where<00:03:48.780> Kyle<00:03:49.410> Larson<00:03:50.070> needed<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.910> be

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
situation where Kyle Larson needed to be

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.480 
situation where Kyle Larson needed to be
able<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.750> stay<00:03:52.290> off<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.500> Todd<00:03:52.950> deal<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.340> if

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
able to stay off the Todd deal and if

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.250 
able to stay off the Todd deal and if
that's<00:03:53.700> what<00:03:53.820> Todd<00:03:54.120> was<00:03:54.150> going<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.510> do<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:55.080> can

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
that's what Todd was going to do you can

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.380 
that's what Todd was going to do you can
