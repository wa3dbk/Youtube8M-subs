00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
I like calculator watches obviously I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.660 
I like calculator watches obviously I
guess<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.940> nerd<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.330> me<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.830> they're

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
guess this the nerd in me and they're

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.160 
guess this the nerd in me and they're
quite<00:01:18.030> collectible<00:01:18.270> which<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.900> wouldn't

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
quite collectible which you wouldn't

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.550 
quite collectible which you wouldn't
think<00:01:20.180> for<00:01:21.180> instance<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.690> one<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.230> sell<00:01:22.440> up

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
think for instance this one can sell up

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.670 
think for instance this one can sell up
to<00:01:22.590> 350<00:01:23.550> bucks<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> probably<00:01:24.810> more<00:01:25.200> depending

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to 350 bucks and probably more depending

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.160 
to 350 bucks and probably more depending
on<00:01:25.800> it's<00:01:26.790> actually<00:01:27.120> stainless<00:01:27.600> steel<00:01:27.870> which

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
on it's actually stainless steel which

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.990 
on it's actually stainless steel which
is<00:01:28.320> cool<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.830> not<00:01:28.920> some<00:01:29.160> cheap<00:01:29.400> plastic

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
is cool so it's not some cheap plastic

running<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> got<00:01:57.480> it<00:01:57.690> so<00:01:57.900> I<00:01:57.930> had<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.290> to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
running when I got it so I had to go to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.380 
running when I got it so I had to go to
Radio<00:01:58.710> Shack<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> battery<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.090> it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
Radio Shack and get a battery for it

Radio Shack and get a battery for it
now<00:02:01.200> something<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.100> remember<00:02:02.190> with<00:02:02.850> this

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
now something to remember with this

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.560 
now something to remember with this
particular<00:02:04.229> CFX<00:02:04.830> 200<00:02:05.550> it's<00:02:06.150> that<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
particular CFX 200 it's that the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.710 
particular CFX 200 it's that the
original<00:02:07.020> battery<00:02:07.260> that<00:02:08.039> was<00:02:08.250> used<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:08.819> which

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
original battery that was used for which

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.520 
original battery that was used for which
I<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.409> the<00:02:11.330> 2020

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
I think is the 2020

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.140 
I think is the 2020
CR<00:02:14.519> lithium<00:02:15.090> battery<00:02:15.330> 2020<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:17.730> no<00:02:17.940> longer

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
CR lithium battery 2020 is no longer

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.149 
CR lithium battery 2020 is no longer
being<00:02:18.360> made<00:02:18.629> or<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.260> if<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.830> it's

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
being made or and if it is it's

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.100 
being made or and if it is it's
extremely<00:02:20.670> hard<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.360> find<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.780> mean<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:21.959> could

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
extremely hard to find I mean you could

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.860 
extremely hard to find I mean you could
buy<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.290> on<00:02:22.440> eBay<00:02:22.769> somewhere<00:02:23.159> like<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.870> but

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
buy it on eBay somewhere like that but

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.630 
buy it on eBay somewhere like that but
you're<00:02:25.500> not<00:02:25.560> gonna<00:02:25.740> walk<00:02:25.950> into<00:02:26.130> RadioShack

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
you're not gonna walk into RadioShack

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.340 
you're not gonna walk into RadioShack
fine<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.150> had<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.420> substitute<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:27.990> for

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
fine so I had to substitute that for

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.860 
fine so I had to substitute that for
2016

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
2016

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.440 
2016
and<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:30.769> had<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.190> actually<00:02:31.370> put<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.910> little<00:02:32.209> piece

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
and I had to actually put a little piece

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.030 
and I had to actually put a little piece
of<00:02:32.629> cardboard<00:02:34.269> behind<00:02:35.269> it<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:36.319> act<00:02:36.769> as

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
of cardboard behind it to act as

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.949 
of cardboard behind it to act as
additional<00:02:37.700> reinforcement<00:02:38.510> because<00:02:38.629> every

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
additional reinforcement because every

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.170 
additional reinforcement because every
time<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.200> wiggled<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.650> watch<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:40.040> lot<00:02:40.190> if<00:02:41.060> I

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
time I wiggled the watch a lot if I

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.970 
time I wiggled the watch a lot if I
shook<00:02:41.629> it<00:02:41.660> up<00:02:41.870> or<00:02:42.140> something

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980
