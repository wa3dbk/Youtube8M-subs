we'll go ahead and grab these legs and

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.249 
we'll go ahead and grab these legs and
they<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.460> simply<00:01:41.610> snap<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:45.270> then

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
they just simply snap right on and then

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.370 
they just simply snap right on and then
from<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:47.390> we're<00:01:48.390> snap<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.899> onto<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
from here we're snap it onto the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:58.500 
from here we're snap it onto the
existing<00:01:51.350> ro/di

before I start rewriting hoses I want to
show<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.370> accessories<00:02:01.790> that<00:02:01.820> are<00:02:02.000> put<00:02:02.270> on

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
show you the accessories that are put on

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.570 
show you the accessories that are put on
the<00:02:02.570> 75<00:02:02.990> gallon<00:02:03.380> unit<00:02:03.530> if<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.250> don't<00:02:04.430> have

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
the 75 gallon unit if you don't have

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.700 
the 75 gallon unit if you don't have
them<00:02:04.760> don't<00:02:05.000> worry<00:02:05.180> about<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:06.140> setup<00:02:06.620> is

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
them don't worry about it the setup is

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.770 
them don't worry about it the setup is
gonna<00:02:06.860> be<00:02:06.980> the<00:02:07.070> same<00:02:07.250> exact<00:02:07.640> way<00:02:07.910> this<00:02:08.690> is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
gonna be the same exact way this is

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.470 
gonna be the same exact way this is
gonna<00:02:08.899> be<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.140> auto<00:02:09.320> shutoff<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.480> then

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
gonna be the auto shutoff and then

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.340 
gonna be the auto shutoff and then
behind<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:12.050> we<00:02:12.350> have<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:13.100> flush<00:02:14.030> valve<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.720> flow

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
behind it we have a flush valve a flow

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.770 
behind it we have a flush valve a flow
restrictor<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.250> then<00:02:17.000> we<00:02:17.120> also<00:02:17.300> have<00:02:17.570> this

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
restrictor and then we also have this

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.130 
restrictor and then we also have this
check<00:02:18.200> valve<00:02:18.230> here<00:02:19.750> next<00:02:20.750> thing<00:02:20.930> we're<00:02:21.020> gonna

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
check valve here next thing we're gonna

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.960 
check valve here next thing we're gonna
do<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.320> remove<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.190> existing<00:02:22.490> waste<00:02:23.000> line<00:02:24.970> and

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
do is remove the existing waste line and

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.560 
do is remove the existing waste line and
replace<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.540> with<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.810> straight<00:02:27.500> line<00:02:31.570> these

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
replace it with the straight line these

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.910 
replace it with the straight line these
are<00:02:32.630> push<00:02:32.959> fittings<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:33.410> just<00:02:33.560> gotta<00:02:33.709> push

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
are push fittings you just gotta push

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.540 
are push fittings you just gotta push
them<00:02:34.100> in<00:02:34.190> there

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
them in there

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.100 
them in there
and<00:02:34.640> then<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.090> other<00:02:35.239> end<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.570> gonna<00:02:35.660> go<00:02:35.870> on

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
and then the other end is gonna go on

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.949 
and then the other end is gonna go on
the<00:02:36.200> top<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.130> cap<00:02:37.580> here<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.630> second

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
the top of the cap here of the second

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.720 
the top of the cap here of the second
membrane<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:43.010> you're<00:02:43.130> done<00:02:43.280> with<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.459> part

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
membrane and you're done with that part

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.400 
membrane and you're done with that part
the<00:02:44.090> next<00:02:44.360> step<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.570> did<00:02:44.750> off<00:02:44.870> camera<00:02:45.200> because<00:02:45.260> I

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
the next step I did off camera because I

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.160 
the next step I did off camera because I
had<00:02:45.530> cut<00:02:45.739> some<00:02:45.920> hose<00:02:46.580> but<00:02:46.959> it's<00:02:47.959> very

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
had cut some hose but it's very

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.890 
had cut some hose but it's very

restrictor<00:03:14.780> I'm<00:03:14.989> using<00:03:15.430> dictates<00:03:16.430> which<00:03:16.700> way

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
restrictor I'm using dictates which way

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.120 
restrictor I'm using dictates which way
the<00:03:17.030> water<00:03:17.209> goes<00:03:17.570> so<00:03:18.230> in<00:03:18.380> this<00:03:18.500> case<00:03:18.769> because

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
the water goes so in this case because

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.770 
the water goes so in this case because
we're<00:03:19.250> gonna<00:03:19.370> put<00:03:19.640> this<00:03:19.910> flow<00:03:20.150> restrictor<00:03:20.480> up

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
we're gonna put this flow restrictor up

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.140 
we're gonna put this flow restrictor up
on<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.140> second<00:03:21.500> membrane<00:03:21.830> now<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.640> water<00:03:22.970> is

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
on the second membrane now the water is

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.970 
on the second membrane now the water is
actually<00:03:23.299> going<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:23.660> be<00:03:23.780> pushing<00:03:24.140> out<00:03:24.380> this

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
actually going to be pushing out this

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.190 
actually going to be pushing out this
way<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.670> way<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:25.850> have<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.150> oriented<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:27.080> I'm

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
way the way I have it oriented so I'm

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.259 
way the way I have it oriented so I'm
gonna<00:03:27.320> go<00:03:27.560> ahead<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.769> undo<00:03:28.430> this<00:03:28.580> hose<00:03:28.850> here

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
gonna go ahead and undo this hose here

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.740 
gonna go ahead and undo this hose here
and<00:03:29.450> put<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.350> on<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.950> opposite<00:03:31.700> end<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.239> then

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
and put it on the opposite end and then

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.990 
and put it on the opposite end and then

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.720 
the filter stages the reason I have that
is<00:03:58.160> because<00:03:58.940> visually<00:03:59.780> inspecting<00:04:00.380> these<00:04:00.730> two

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
is because visually inspecting these two

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.659 
is because visually inspecting these two
carbons<00:04:02.480> or<00:04:02.750> carbon<00:04:03.169> blocks<00:04:03.350> right<00:04:03.530> here<00:04:03.669> you

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
carbons or carbon blocks right here you

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.970 
carbons or carbon blocks right here you
can't<00:04:04.970> tell<00:04:05.209> when<00:04:05.389> they<00:04:05.480> need<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:05.720> be<00:04:05.980> changed

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
can't tell when they need to be changed

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.010 
can't tell when they need to be changed
out<00:04:07.130> so<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.609> way

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
out so the way

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.720 
out so the way
terming<00:04:08.260> that<00:04:08.380> is<00:04:08.590> when<00:04:08.860> this<00:04:09.100> drops<00:04:09.430> to

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
terming that is when this drops to

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.260 
terming that is when this drops to
around<00:04:09.820> 55<00:04:10.720> 60<00:04:11.530> psi<00:04:12.010> I<00:04:12.310> know<00:04:12.670> it's<00:04:12.970> time<00:04:13.120> to

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
around 55 60 psi I know it's time to

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.300 
around 55 60 psi I know it's time to
change<00:04:13.510> these<00:04:13.750> two<00:04:13.960> out<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:14.380> can<00:04:14.890> visually

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
change these two out I can visually

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.370 
change these two out I can visually
inspect<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:16.060> first<00:04:16.330> sediment<00:04:16.870> stage<00:04:17.110> when

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
inspect the first sediment stage when

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.320 
inspect the first sediment stage when
that<00:04:17.500> turned<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.980> gunky<00:04:18.430> Brown<00:04:18.640> I<00:04:18.880> change<00:04:19.180> it

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
that turned a gunky Brown I change it

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.680 
that turned a gunky Brown I change it
out

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
out

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.180 
out
that'll<00:04:20.260> ask<00:04:20.350> me<00:04:20.500> about<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.709> month<00:04:20.920> and<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.160> half

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
that'll ask me about a month and a half

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.460 
that'll ask me about a month and a half
and<00:04:21.550> then<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.240> DI<00:04:22.450> stage<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:23.050> can<00:04:23.170> see<00:04:23.200> it's

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
and then the DI stage you can see it's

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.050 
and then the DI stage you can see it's
turning<00:04:23.650> brown<00:04:23.830> at<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.070> bottom<00:04:24.460> when<00:04:24.910> that

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
turning brown at the bottom when that

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.940 
turning brown at the bottom when that
whole<00:04:25.210> thing<00:04:25.450> turns<00:04:25.690> wrong<00:04:25.930> it's<00:04:26.560> time<00:04:26.830> to

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
whole thing turns wrong it's time to

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.540 
whole thing turns wrong it's time to
change<00:04:27.160> that<00:04:27.880> out<00:04:29.040> right<00:04:30.040> now

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
change that out right now

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.100 
change that out right now
pre-filter<00:04:31.480> I'm<00:04:31.720> getting<00:04:32.080> 82<00:04:32.650> psi<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:34.110> after

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
pre-filter I'm getting 82 psi and after

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.910 
pre-filter I'm getting 82 psi and after
the<00:04:35.200> filter<00:04:35.530> stages<00:04:36.010> I'm<00:04:36.250> getting<00:04:36.670> 70<00:04:37.180> psi<00:04:37.920> if

the filter stages I'm getting 70 psi if

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.070 
the filter stages I'm getting 70 psi if
you<00:04:39.160> are<00:04:39.310> getting<00:04:39.670> a<00:04:39.940> low<00:04:40.240> reading<00:04:40.540> coming

75 gallon per day unit at one minute so
I'm<00:05:54.520> getting<00:05:54.789> about<00:05:54.879> two<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.419> one<00:05:55.449> ratio<00:05:55.779> not

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
I'm getting about two to one ratio not

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.769 
I'm getting about two to one ratio not
bad<00:05:56.469> so<00:05:57.279> we'll<00:05:57.400> see<00:05:57.580> what<00:05:57.729> we<00:05:57.759> get<00:05:57.939> with<00:05:58.120> 150

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
okay so we are over two cups of water in

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.590 
okay so we are over two cups of water in
a<00:06:26.120> minute<00:06:26.570> that<00:06:27.200> is<00:06:27.410> an<00:06:27.680> entire<00:06:28.340> cup<00:06:28.700> more<00:06:29.300> than

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
a minute that is an entire cup more than

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.190 
a minute that is an entire cup more than
the<00:06:30.050> 75<00:06:30.590> gallon<00:06:31.120> double<00:06:32.120> it<00:06:32.240> so<00:06:32.480> it<00:06:32.810> did<00:06:33.020> live

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
the 75 gallon double it so it did live

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.260 
the 75 gallon double it so it did live
up<00:06:33.230> the<00:06:33.470> Turks<00:06:33.770> expectations<00:06:34.520> as<00:06:34.730> far<00:06:35.030> as<00:06:35.120> the

up the Turks expectations as far as the
product<00:06:35.690> water<00:06:35.870> goes<00:06:36.170> will<00:06:37.070> go<00:06:37.220> and<00:06:37.400> try<00:06:37.520> the

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
product water goes will go and try the

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.560 
product water goes will go and try the
waste<00:06:37.880> water<00:06:38.030> not<00:06:39.820> waste<00:06:40.820> water<00:06:41.120> for<00:06:41.360> the<00:06:41.480> one

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
a little bit over two cups of wastewater

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.840 
a little bit over two cups of wastewater
from<00:06:58.290> the<00:06:58.470> water<00:06:58.680> and<00:06:58.860> a<00:06:58.920> 50<00:06:59.220> gallon<00:06:59.370> day<00:06:59.640> per

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
from the water and a 50 gallon day per

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.610 
from the water and a 50 gallon day per
unit<00:07:00.210> that's<00:07:00.720> about<00:07:00.990> the<00:07:01.140> same<00:07:01.320> that<00:07:01.470> we're

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
unit that's about the same that we're

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.620 
unit that's about the same that we're
getting<00:07:01.800> from<00:07:02.100> the<00:07:02.190> 75<00:07:02.700> gallon<00:07:03.060> per<00:07:03.180> day<00:07:03.210> unit

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
getting from the 75 gallon per day unit

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.660 
getting from the 75 gallon per day unit
except<00:07:04.410> now<00:07:04.680> we're<00:07:04.920> getting<00:07:05.190> double<00:07:05.400> the

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670 
except now we're getting double the

one part of wastewater we're with the 75
beyond<00:07:13.590> we<00:07:14.220> were<00:07:14.430> wasting<00:07:15.120> two<00:07:15.360> parts<00:07:15.720> of
