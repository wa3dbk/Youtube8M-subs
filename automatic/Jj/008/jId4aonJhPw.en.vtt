some gussets that are going to support

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.479 
some gussets that are going to support
kind<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.430> go<00:02:28.549> inside<00:02:28.909> here<00:02:30.159> just<00:02:31.159> to<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.310> some

kind of go inside here just to get some
added<00:02:31.760> support<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:34.099> then<00:02:34.489> I'll<00:02:34.670> probably

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
added support and then I'll probably

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.140 
added support and then I'll probably
make<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.150> gusset<00:02:35.629> for<00:02:35.930> any<00:02:36.349> fun<00:02:36.849> appear<00:02:37.849> by<00:02:38.090> the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.339 
three air there's a whole salt and then
you<00:03:23.930> have<00:03:24.049> to<00:03:24.260> pin<00:03:24.590> on<00:03:24.769> both<00:03:24.949> sides<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:26.349> just

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
you have to pin on both sides so just

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.949 
you have to pin on both sides so just
regular<00:03:27.680> standard<00:03:28.010> pens<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.840> gotta<00:03:29.840> replace

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
regular standard pens you gotta replace

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.250 
regular standard pens you gotta replace
the<00:03:30.319> wheels<00:03:30.500> at<00:03:30.769> section<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.310> rather<00:03:31.489> fast<00:03:32.260> or

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
the wheels at section a rather fast or

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.670 
the wheels at section a rather fast or
two<00:03:33.409> wheels<00:03:33.590> at<00:03:33.829> Harbor<00:03:34.159> Freight<00:03:34.190> they<00:03:35.000> were

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
two wheels at Harbor Freight they were

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.399 
two wheels at Harbor Freight they were
15<00:03:36.680> bucks<00:03:36.859> apiece<00:03:37.239> they're<00:03:38.239> rated<00:03:38.540> at<00:03:38.659> 330

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
15 bucks apiece they're rated at 330

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.009 
15 bucks apiece they're rated at 330
pounds<00:03:39.470> apiece<00:03:39.979> so<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:40.609> think<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.810> should<00:03:41.989> be

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
pounds apiece so I think that should be

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.149 
pounds apiece so I think that should be
adequate<00:03:42.919> for<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.340> as<00:03:43.819> a<00:03:43.879> lock<00:03:44.239> skater<00:03:45.489> and

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
adequate for this as a lock skater and

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.319 
adequate for this as a lock skater and
we're<00:03:49.159> going<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.340> use<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.579> in<00:03:49.669> February<00:03:50.120> we're

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
we're going to use it in February we're

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.490 
we're going to use it in February we're
going<00:03:50.449> to<00:03:50.510> go<00:03:50.569> up<00:03:50.659> to<00:03:50.750> our<00:03:50.780> mountain<00:03:51.109> house<00:03:51.229> and

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
going to go up to our mountain house and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.099 
going to go up to our mountain house and
cut<00:03:51.919> some<00:03:52.040> wood<00:03:52.190> track<00:03:53.120> some<00:03:53.299> trees<00:03:53.510> so<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:53.930> get

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
cut some wood track some trees so I get

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.140 
cut some wood track some trees so I get
some<00:03:54.199> firewood<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:55.430> I'll<00:03:55.729> be<00:03:55.819> putting<00:03:56.060> this

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
some firewood and I'll be putting this

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.119 
some firewood and I'll be putting this
to<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.419> test

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
to the test

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.199 
to the test
so<00:03:58.129> I'll<00:03:58.250> certainly<00:03:58.579> have<00:03:58.699> to<00:03:58.849> make<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.000> video

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
so I'll certainly have to make a video

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:08.839 
so I'll certainly have to make a video
and<00:03:59.510> let<00:03:59.629> everybody<00:03:59.810> check<00:04:00.079> it<00:04:00.169> out

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.610 

here's<00:04:09.269> another<00:04:09.420> update<00:04:09.659> I'm<00:04:10.379> going<00:04:10.530> to

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
here's another update I'm going to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.339 
here's another update I'm going to
process<00:04:10.830> up<00:04:11.269> capping<00:04:12.269> off<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.450> two-inch

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
process up capping off the two-inch

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.219 
process up capping off the two-inch
square<00:04:13.530> stock<00:04:14.360> just<00:04:15.360> making<00:04:15.689> just<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.959> piece<00:04:16.199> of

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
square stock just making just a piece of

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.270 
square stock just making just a piece of
sheet<00:04:16.530> metal<00:04:17.269> capping<00:04:18.269> this<00:04:18.389> off<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:19.280> already

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
sheet metal capping this off I already

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.159 
sheet metal capping this off I already
did<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.519> down<00:04:20.760> here<00:04:21.530> both<00:04:22.530> ends<00:04:23.750> if<00:04:24.750> anything

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
did it down here both ends if anything

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.379 
did it down here both ends if anything
keeps<00:04:25.380> moisture<00:04:25.620> at<00:04:25.949> it<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.850> a<00:04:26.970> single<00:04:27.270> most

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
keeps moisture at it it's a single most

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.150 
keeps moisture at it it's a single most
likely<00:04:27.750> be<00:04:28.280> kept<00:04:29.280> outside<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:30.240> cap<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:31.160> cap

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
likely be kept outside so cap that cap

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.520 
likely be kept outside so cap that cap
that<00:04:32.190> one<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:33.630> very<00:04:34.410> last<00:04:34.860> there<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.940> there

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
that one and very last there and there

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.850 
that one and very last there and there
then<00:04:37.530> I'll<00:04:37.710> wire<00:04:38.220> wheel<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.610> real<00:04:38.760> good<00:04:39.860> clean

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
then I'll wire wheel it real good clean

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.830 
then I'll wire wheel it real good clean
it<00:04:40.979> all<00:04:41.070> up<00:04:41.100> acetone<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.090> that'll<00:04:42.539> be<00:04:42.630> ready
