00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.270 
the neck like this I'm going to tie
together<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.300> legs<00:02:35.660> now<00:02:36.500> usually<00:02:37.040> if<00:02:37.160> I

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
together the legs now usually if I

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.400 
together the legs now usually if I
wasn't<00:02:37.550> brining<00:02:38.240> my<00:02:38.390> turkey<00:02:38.810> I'd<00:02:39.020> do<00:02:39.230> this

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
wasn't brining my turkey I'd do this

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.680 
wasn't brining my turkey I'd do this
step<00:02:39.680> right<00:02:40.010> before<00:02:40.400> roasting<00:02:40.640> but<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.450> dry

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
step right before roasting but the dry

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.990 
step right before roasting but the dry
brine<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.200> really<00:02:42.560> gonna<00:02:42.709> firm<00:02:43.130> up<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.370> skin

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
brine is really gonna firm up that skin

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.970 
brine is really gonna firm up that skin
so<00:02:44.540> it's<00:02:44.660> easier<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.080> do<00:02:45.200> this<00:02:45.320> now<00:02:45.530> while<00:02:45.800> your

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980
