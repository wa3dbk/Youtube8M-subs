 in front of you is a new winter tire from nokian 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.930
 tires 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.480
 nokian hakkapeliitta 8 tire is not 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.019
 common winter tire nokian hakkapeliitta 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.269
 eight 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.860
 this is the leader among all winter studded 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.410
 tires in the world 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.420
 its characteristics are so impressive 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.369
 that we used this particular bus 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.039
 to surpass our own world 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.019
 speed record on ice 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.670
 new stands apart from the rest of the tires 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.300
 thanks to her 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.619
 innovative solution 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.120
 take a closer look at this new 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.450
 tire 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.250
 this tread pattern seems like it 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.010
 looks like any other 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.450
 but immediately noticeable in the new nokian tire 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.140
 hakkapeliitta 8 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.700
 much more spikes than other tires 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.770
 if we compare nokian hakkapeliitta 8 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.719
 this is the forerunner of the famous 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.030
 winner of comparative tests 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.989
 you can easily see what we increased by 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.640
 50 percent spikes 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.649
 more spikes is one of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.270
 constituents ingenious concept 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.450
 nokian tires studs 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.490
 nokian ecostat 8 we managed 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.250
 simultaneously increase the number of spikes 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.260
 and reduce road wear while we still 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.890
 improved grip and reduced level 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.950
 noise 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.689
 new eco 100 studing concept from 8 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.290
 this is excellent acceleration and braking 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.840
 but also maneuverability and comfort but not 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.119
 only spikes improve grip in winter we 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.420
 also worked on the tread pattern 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.310
 now there are even more checkers in it why 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.530
 more tread sticks 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.600
 increases the number of grooves 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.939
 and it increases the number of edges 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.650
 which tire touches the road new 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.320
 pattern and unique rubber compound 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.140
 tread provide better grip 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.259
 fuel economy and comfort by the way 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.790
 thanks to tread wear indicator 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.250
 patented nokian tires easily 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.020
 check tread depth and condition 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.000
 tire 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.190
 enough technical details of the most 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.610
 the main thing that we managed to do better and 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.060
 even better we managed to do better and 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.200
 even better and most importantly tire 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.229
 hakkapeliitta 8 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.630
 simplifies our daily life she 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.940
 embodies the best grip combination 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.250
 comfort and safety on icy and 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.440
 snowy roads with changeable 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.280
 weather conditions and unpredictable 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.740
 road situations by the way do you know 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.870
 that nokian tires is the only tire 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.030
 manufacturer who develops 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.800
 tests and produces its tires on 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.300
 north 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.430
 This suggests that we offer 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.760
 the best tires for the most difficult winter 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.540
 nokian hackapelite tire conditions 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.930
 multiple ladies 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.930
 comparative tests and this is a fact
