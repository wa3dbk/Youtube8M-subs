another aspect of how you're going to
work<00:02:35.260> on<00:02:35.409> your<00:02:35.560> dribbling<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.129> by<00:02:36.670> having<00:02:36.939> that

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
work on your dribbling is by having that

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.989 
work on your dribbling is by having that
ball<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:38.049> comfortable<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:38.859> your<00:02:39.069> hands<00:02:39.639> that

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:39.999 
ball so comfortable in your hands that

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.000 
ball so comfortable in your hands that
has<00:02:40.150> become<00:02:40.450> second<00:02:40.900> nature<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.560> we<00:02:41.709> have<00:02:41.859> the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
has become second nature so we have the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.690 
has become second nature so we have the
drill

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
drill

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.970

where<00:02:43.090> we<00:02:43.239> go<00:02:43.390> around<00:02:43.989> our<00:02:44.200> backs<00:02:44.439> in<00:02:44.799> both

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
where we go around our backs in both

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.470 
where we go around our backs in both
directions<00:02:45.930> around<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.110> head<00:02:47.519> anything<00:02:48.519> it's

okay<00:03:22.900> our<00:03:23.139> mathematical<00:03:24.069> calculations<00:03:24.790> are

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
okay our mathematical calculations are

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.660 
okay our mathematical calculations are
very<00:03:25.209> sharp<00:03:26.079> today<00:03:26.500> here<00:03:26.829> everybody<00:03:27.310> gets<00:03:27.549> an

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
very sharp today here everybody gets an

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.940 
very sharp today here everybody gets an
A+<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.060> for<00:03:28.389> that<00:03:28.540> how<00:03:29.260> about<00:03:29.439> giving<00:03:29.680> me<00:03:29.769> five

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
A+ in for that how about giving me five

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.400 
A+ in for that how about giving me five
more<00:03:30.189> push-ups

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.620 

it's<00:03:38.340> important<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.910> differentiate<00:03:39.390> between

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
it's important to differentiate between

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.470 
it's important to differentiate between
the<00:03:39.960> distinct<00:03:40.470> types<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:41.100> dribbling<00:03:41.640> we<00:03:42.150> first

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
the distinct types of dribbling we first

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.810 
the distinct types of dribbling we first
have<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:43.050> demonstration<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:44.160> how<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.370> have<00:03:44.790> a

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
have a demonstration of how to have a

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.700 
have a demonstration of how to have a
controlled<00:03:45.600> dribble<00:03:46.110> when<00:03:46.260> you're<00:03:46.440> in<00:03:46.590> a

this<00:03:58.020> is<00:03:58.170> where<00:03:58.350> you're<00:03:58.470> going<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.620> be<00:03:58.740> able<00:03:58.830> to

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
this is where you're going to be able to
