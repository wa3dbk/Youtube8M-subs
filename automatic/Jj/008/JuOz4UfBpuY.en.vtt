00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 Gold finger 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.680
 Dear friends, everyone, today we are going to teach a gold finger with a very good performance! 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:23.260
 There are two ways to do it. At the beginning, we will teach you how easy it is for beginners to learn. 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.560
 Is the practice of hanging around the neck 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.480
 The other is the practice of taking the bell directly from the line. 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.400
 The two kinds of emphasis, we will explain for you one by one in the future. 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.860
 Ah 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.494
 Basic work 

00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:10.434
 Oh~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.160
 The basic skill part, "Golden Chicken Independence" must have at least five seconds of level! 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.520
 If it can reach 10 seconds, it is better. 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.380
 Hey~ 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.952
 Decomposition teaching 

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:25.620
 ㄚ~ㄚ~ 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.820
 Gesture 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.500
 At the beginning, we held our hands like this. 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.820
 We tilted our handles slightly forward 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.060
 You will find that there is actually a gap in the finger. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.420
 This gap can be used to put the bell. Wait a moment, remember how nervous, hands must be clamped, can't open! 

00:01:47.404 --> 00:01:49.684
 2. Hang neck gold fingers 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.440
 In the beginning: the bell is an empty bell. Then the person goes to the right 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.300
 The stick head is aligned with the stick head in a straight line 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.660
 Let's take the right hand stick high and put it on the neck. At this time, the right hand is let go. 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.120
 Take out the standard gesture and slowly pull the bell up. 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.240
 The line is taken out from the side, so it will be successful! 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.380
 Try it and you won't stop for five seconds. If you can, put it back. Congratulations, you are done! 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.780
 Let’s look at it another angle. 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.380
 3. Do gold fingers directly. 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.460
 At the beginning we were the same as the "empty bell" and went to the right. 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.080
 At this time, we handed the stick to the left hand, and the stick was opened. The better it would be to wait for the bell to be taken. 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.080
 So we would suggest that when you start your first time, you can hold the stick to the end of the stick. 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.540
 The golden finger is the same, but the line like this will be looser. 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.820
 So be careful when taking it, don't let the thread roll in. After taking it out, it will be successful! ! 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.920
 Let’s look at it another angle. 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.620
 Fixed axis demonstration 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.100
 The fixed axis can be done, but the acceleration must be added enough, or there will be no ringing speed soon. 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.900
 Oh 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.960
 Common mistakes 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.760
 Common mistakes: Generally speaking, it is also possible to use a bell to clamp it by hand. 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.680
 But it is recommended to learn to use our hands to control and balance the balance. 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.020
 But if it is a fixed axis: once the hand is opened, the bell will fall and it will soon stop! 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.280
 Master these principles and you will soon be familiar with them. 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.140
呜

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.660
 Extended action 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:29.700
 The "Silver Finger" action is a fancy action that is very common afterwards! We have been here today. Class!
