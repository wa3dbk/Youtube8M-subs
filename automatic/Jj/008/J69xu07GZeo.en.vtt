00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.820
 good to everyone here 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.560
 why 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:37.480
 of that 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:37.480
 suddenly on the floor 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:52.930
 is the game that people jumping and I 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.930
 I'm filming, I'm going to record the normal 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.480
 of the battery or imagined I imagined 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.290
 it was a hardware but nothing freaking 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.290
 flipping friends 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.620
 when he comes to settle everything 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.180
 parts 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.120
 clear but people fighting over the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.900
 rooftop staying blown and me too 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.540
 I can be because I would be killing people who 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.370
 they kill people jumping I stayed all 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.460
 signed I did not want to teach the I guess that 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.340
 you will have seen a lot of hacks and all that 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.000
 but it's the first time I see why the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.160
 truth is that I see one more live or 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.160
 I 'm playing the martyr itself 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:56.410
 the normal thing is that you stay 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.479
 we are hallucinated hallucinated and friendly and 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.480
 Come on, let's go, nothing, let's say nothing 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.770
 the companions 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.820
 I do not color to see if the name comes out that 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.580
 he already called me and he tells me no that's what 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.370
 someone who has someone who has 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.750
 left the game or something like that and gives us 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:23.840
 permissions to all so that we can use and 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.840
 I without knowing this, imagine the normal 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.180
 true 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.629
 a curious anecdote the truth is that 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.069
 I had never found a couple that 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.069
 make grace 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.200
 to vote for the soil and the animals 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.420
 because more than 10 meters but you do not die 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.819
 whether or not you die when falling you come back 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.049
 someone shoots you from above nothing the 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.680
 truth is that I was hallucinating with 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.680
 this game 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.790
 jumping what are you going to do 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.500
 I hope you enjoyed a greeting to 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.500
 all and until my next video 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.910

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.280
