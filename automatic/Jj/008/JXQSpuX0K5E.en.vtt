thing's<00:02:18.040> heavy<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.760> feels<00:02:19.000> like<00:02:19.209> about<00:02:19.480> ten

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
thing's heavy it feels like about ten

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.530 
thing's heavy it feels like about ten
pounds<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.069> power<00:02:24.310> supply<00:02:24.730> section<00:02:25.300> on

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
pounds in the power supply section on

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.010 
pounds in the power supply section on
board<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.000> amplifier<00:02:28.000> section<00:02:28.540> and

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
board just so the amplifier section and

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.090 
board just so the amplifier section and
gain<00:02:29.319> stages<00:02:30.870> work<00:02:31.870> optimally<00:02:32.200> they<00:02:32.800> actually

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
gain stages work optimally they actually

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.390 
gain stages work optimally they actually
have<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> power<00:02:34.120> filtration<00:02:34.900> area<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.560> just

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
have a power filtration area just just

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.190 
have a power filtration area just just
for<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.760> AC<00:02:37.060> power<00:02:37.390> coming<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.080> it

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
for the AC power coming in so it

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.870 
for the AC power coming in so it
actually<00:02:38.470> cleans<00:02:38.680> up<00:02:38.950> its<00:02:39.130> own<00:02:39.280> power<00:02:39.580> you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
actually cleans up its own power you

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.970 
actually cleans up its own power you
don't<00:02:40.030> need<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.959> plug<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.319> into<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.680> power

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
don't need to plug this into a power

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.340 
don't need to plug this into a power
conditioner<00:02:42.550> or<00:02:42.670> anything<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:43.989> has<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.110> nice

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
conditioner or anything so it has a nice

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.500 
conditioner or anything so it has a nice
clean<00:02:44.860> noise<00:02:45.190> free<00:02:45.519> power<00:02:45.820> then<00:02:46.239> it<00:02:46.360> goes

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
clean noise free power then it goes

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.660 
clean noise free power then it goes
through<00:02:46.540> all<00:02:47.019> discrete<00:02:47.530> circuitry<00:02:48.190> it's<00:02:48.550> all

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
through all discrete circuitry it's all

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.640 
through all discrete circuitry it's all
Class<00:02:49.030> A<00:02:49.360> gain<00:02:49.840> stages<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:53.170> nice<00:02:53.410> and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
Class A gain stages so it's nice and

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.670 
Class A gain stages so it's nice and
clean<00:02:53.860> very<00:02:54.310> little<00:02:54.580> distortion

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
clean very little distortion

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.229 
clean very little distortion

greater<00:02:58.959> than<00:02:59.140> 98<00:02:59.650> DB<00:03:00.690> means<00:03:01.690> if<00:03:01.930> you're

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
greater than 98 DB means if you're

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.040 
greater than 98 DB means if you're
listening<00:03:02.530> at<00:03:02.709> say<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.459> hundred<00:03:03.730> decibels<00:03:04.050> the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
listening at say a hundred decibels the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.220 
listening at say a hundred decibels the
noise<00:03:05.319> is<00:03:05.620> going<00:03:05.800> to<00:03:05.980> be<00:03:06.130> 2<00:03:07.090> decibels<00:03:07.569> or<00:03:07.959> lower

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
noise is going to be 2 decibels or lower

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.990 
noise is going to be 2 decibels or lower
which<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.769> can't<00:03:09.010> even<00:03:09.160> hear<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.670> couldn't

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
which you can't even hear you couldn't

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.620 
which you can't even hear you couldn't
hear<00:03:10.150> 2<00:03:10.420> decibels<00:03:10.780> if<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.140> wanted<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:13.239> so

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
hear 2 decibels if you wanted to so so

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.509 
hear 2 decibels if you wanted to so so
basically<00:03:13.989> all<00:03:14.080> you're<00:03:14.440> hearing<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.950> signal

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
basically all you're hearing is signal

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.610 
basically all you're hearing is signal
and<00:03:15.790> all<00:03:16.120> those<00:03:16.299> low-level<00:03:16.870> details<00:03:17.049> that

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
and all those low-level details that

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.280 
and all those low-level details that
were<00:03:17.709> masked<00:03:18.070> before<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:19.239> can<00:03:19.450> now<00:03:19.600> hear<00:03:19.660> and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
were masked before you can now hear and

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.800 
were masked before you can now hear and
they<00:03:20.590> become<00:03:21.150> texture<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.390> part<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.690> the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
they become texture and part of the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.530 
they become texture and part of the
music<00:03:25.530> there's<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:27.910> pretty<00:03:28.090> much<00:03:28.180> dual

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540

mono<00:03:28.840> there's<00:03:29.760> there's<00:03:30.760> not<00:03:30.940> two<00:03:31.120> complete

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480

inside<00:03:37.959> you've<00:03:38.470> got<00:03:38.500> audio<00:03:38.860> great<00:03:39.220> capacitors

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
inside you've got audio great capacitors

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.270 
inside you've got audio great capacitors
one<00:03:41.140> thing<00:03:41.350> that's<00:03:41.500> really<00:03:41.680> nice<00:03:42.010> on<00:03:42.190> this

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
one thing that's really nice on this

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.509 
one thing that's really nice on this
unit<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:42.670> get<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.880> 24<00:03:43.480> step<00:03:43.780> attenuator<00:03:44.519> it

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
unit you get a 24 step attenuator it

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.310 
unit you get a 24 step attenuator it
clicks<00:03:45.910> sitting<00:03:46.180> stop<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:46.720> only<00:03:46.840> have<00:03:46.930> 24

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
clicks sitting stop so you only have 24

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.360 
clicks sitting stop so you only have 24
possible<00:03:48.070> positions<00:03:48.579> for<00:03:48.880> volume<00:03:50.370> it's

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
possible positions for volume it's

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.680 
possible positions for volume it's
usually<00:03:51.549> not<00:03:51.820> a<00:03:51.850> problem<00:03:51.910> because<00:03:52.299> there's

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
usually not a problem because there's

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.009 
usually not a problem because there's
it's<00:03:53.170> usually<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:54.010> three<00:03:54.760> or<00:03:54.880> four<00:03:55.150> step<00:03:55.690> range

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
it's usually a three or four step range

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.270 
it's usually a three or four step range
that<00:03:56.350> you'll<00:03:56.530> be<00:03:56.650> using<00:03:57.010> with<00:03:57.130> your

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
that you'll be using with your

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.830 
that you'll be using with your
headphones<00:03:57.519> at<00:03:57.940> any<00:03:58.120> one<00:03:58.299> time<00:03:58.329> you<00:03:58.720> might

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
headphones at any one time you might

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.970 
headphones at any one time you might
want<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.170> listen<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.410> something<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.769> little

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
want to listen to something a little

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.640 
want to listen to something a little
louder<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.310> little<00:04:00.400> quieter<00:04:00.910> but<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:02.530> can

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
louder a little quieter but it you can

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.080 
louder a little quieter but it you can
usually<00:04:02.769> find<00:04:03.100> one<00:04:03.250> that's<00:04:03.609> right<00:04:03.790> where<00:04:03.970> you

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
usually find one that's right where you

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.479 
usually find one that's right where you
wanted<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.510> hear<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.920> it's<00:04:06.040> not<00:04:06.190> really<00:04:06.459> a

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
wanted to hear it so it's not really a

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.280 
wanted to hear it so it's not really a
problem<00:04:06.760> only<00:04:07.329> thing<00:04:07.570> I<00:04:07.630> wouldn't<00:04:07.989> recommend

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
problem only thing I wouldn't recommend

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.170 
problem only thing I wouldn't recommend
this<00:04:08.500> for<00:04:08.680> is<00:04:08.829> like<00:04:08.980> a<00:04:09.010> super<00:04:09.609> efficient

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
this for is like a super efficient

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.580 
this for is like a super efficient
headphone<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:13.390> steps<00:04:13.750> between<00:04:14.290> the

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
headphone so the steps between the

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.630 
headphone so the steps between the
volume<00:04:15.030> clicks<00:04:16.030> are<00:04:16.329> going<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.780> be<00:04:17.280> pretty<00:04:18.280> big

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
volume clicks are going to be pretty big

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.430 
volume clicks are going to be pretty big
if<00:04:18.880> you<00:04:19.000> have<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.180> really<00:04:19.570> efficient<00:04:20.049> headphone

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
if you have a really efficient headphone

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.610 
if you have a really efficient headphone
I<00:04:20.739> mean<00:04:21.099> I've<00:04:21.220> got<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.430> Sennheiser

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
I mean I've got the Sennheiser

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.189 
I mean I've got the Sennheiser
hd5<00:04:23.220> 55s<00:04:24.060> which<00:04:24.180> are<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.570> efficient<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.110> the

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
hd5 55s which are so efficient in the

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.030 
hd5 55s which are so efficient in the
drag<00:04:25.410> month<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.800> I'm<00:04:25.889> kind<00:04:26.130> of<00:04:26.220> fine<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:28.620> it's

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
drag month and I'm kind of fine and it's

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.800 
drag month and I'm kind of fine and it's
it's<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.370> pretty<00:04:29.550> big<00:04:29.820> jump<00:04:30.060> but<00:04:30.330> it's<00:04:30.540> still

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
it's a pretty big jump but it's still

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.090 
it's a pretty big jump but it's still
there's<00:04:31.440> still<00:04:32.570> some<00:04:33.570> detent<00:04:34.350> set<00:04:34.620> I<00:04:34.650> find

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
there's still some detent set I find

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.850 
there's still some detent set I find
pleasing<00:04:35.669> so<00:04:36.350> but<00:04:37.350> if<00:04:37.470> you<00:04:37.560> have<00:04:37.680> something

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
pleasing so but if you have something

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.680 
pleasing so but if you have something
really<00:04:38.100> efficient<00:04:38.610> might<00:04:39.210> not<00:04:39.389> be<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.660> right

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
really efficient might not be the right

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.050 
really efficient might not be the right
headphone<00:04:40.229> amp<00:04:40.440> for<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.800> they<00:04:41.580> said<00:04:41.790> phoneme

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
headphone amp for you they said phoneme

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.990 
headphone amp for you they said phoneme
has<00:04:42.240> lots<00:04:42.510> of<00:04:42.660> power<00:04:42.900> so<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:44.010> can<00:04:44.160> drive<00:04:44.370> your

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
has lots of power so it can drive your

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.189 
has lots of power so it can drive your
inefficient<00:04:45.630> headphones<00:04:45.990> just<00:04:46.260> fine<00:04:48.199> so

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
inefficient headphones just fine so

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.750 
inefficient headphones just fine so
that's<00:04:49.320> that's<00:04:49.590> really<00:04:49.949> what<00:04:50.130> it's<00:04:50.280> that's

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
that's that's really what it's that's

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.950 
that's that's really what it's that's
really<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.000> thing<00:04:51.240> when<00:04:51.389> it's<00:04:51.510> designed<00:04:51.870> for

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
really a thing when it's designed for

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.439 
really a thing when it's designed for
now<00:04:52.500> it's<00:04:52.620> all<00:04:52.740> class<00:04:53.010> saying<00:04:53.220> operation<00:04:53.880> and

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
now it's all class saying operation and

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.090 
now it's all class saying operation and
you<00:04:54.600> think<00:04:54.810> it<00:04:54.900> would<00:04:54.990> get<00:04:55.110> really<00:04:55.260> hot<00:04:55.560> but<00:04:55.830> it

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
you think it would get really hot but it

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.950 
you think it would get really hot but it
doesn't<00:04:56.520> it's<00:04:56.699> got<00:04:56.850> so<00:04:57.090> much<00:04:57.240> aluminum<00:04:57.780> here

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
doesn't it's got so much aluminum here

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.439 
doesn't it's got so much aluminum here
it<00:04:58.110> dissipates<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.949> heat<00:04:58.979> really<00:04:59.400> well<00:04:59.550> it's

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
it dissipates the heat really well it's

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.450 
it dissipates the heat really well it's
it's<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:01.110> can<00:05:01.500> only<00:05:01.620> even<00:05:01.919> tell<00:05:02.130> that<00:05:02.160> it's

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
it's I can only even tell that it's

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.189 
it's I can only even tell that it's
warmed<00:05:02.880> up<00:05:03.060> after<00:05:03.449> it's<00:05:03.570> been<00:05:03.690> on<00:05:03.870> for<00:05:03.900> about

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
warmed up after it's been on for about

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.710 
warmed up after it's been on for about
40<00:05:04.680> minutes<00:05:04.979> or<00:05:05.130> so<00:05:05.160> where<00:05:05.729> it<00:05:06.030> just<00:05:06.330> starts

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
40 minutes or so where it just starts

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.300 
40 minutes or so where it just starts
getting<00:05:06.900> this<00:05:07.139> slight<00:05:07.560> little<00:05:07.860> bit<00:05:07.949> of<00:05:08.039> warmth

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
getting this slight little bit of warmth

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.510 
getting this slight little bit of warmth
and<00:05:08.400> then<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.639> never<00:05:08.820> gets<00:05:09.000> any<00:05:09.180> hotter<00:05:09.770> I<00:05:10.770> left

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
and then it never gets any hotter I left

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.240 
and then it never gets any hotter I left
it<00:05:11.699> on<00:05:11.789> for<00:05:12.320> several<00:05:13.320> days<00:05:13.470> straight<00:05:13.889> just

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
it on for several days straight just

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.100 
it on for several days straight just
burning<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.699> in<00:05:14.820> before<00:05:15.210> I<00:05:15.240> really<00:05:15.630> listen

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
burning it in before I really listen

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.980 
burning it in before I really listen
critically<00:05:16.590> I<00:05:16.620> put<00:05:16.889> about<00:05:17.120> 150<00:05:18.120> hours<00:05:18.270> of

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
critically I put about 150 hours of

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.719 
critically I put about 150 hours of
playback<00:05:19.289> on<00:05:19.770> it<00:05:19.949> just<00:05:20.130> to<00:05:20.250> get<00:05:20.460> everything

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
playback on it just to get everything

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.189 
playback on it just to get everything
all<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.570> electrons<00:05:22.110> flowing<00:05:22.470> nicely<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.960> it

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
all the electrons flowing nicely and it

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.520 
all the electrons flowing nicely and it
does<00:05:25.380> sound<00:05:25.620> good<00:05:27.169> really<00:05:28.169> a<00:05:28.200> little<00:05:28.320> noise

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
does sound good really a little noise

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.219 
does sound good really a little noise
for<00:05:28.860> channel<00:05:29.370> separation<00:05:29.849> is<00:05:30.389> is<00:05:30.720> great

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
for channel separation is is great

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.350 
for channel separation is is great
everything<00:05:32.070> that's<00:05:32.430> in<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.669> left<00:05:32.880> ear<00:05:33.030> or

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
everything that's in the left ear or

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.790 
everything that's in the left ear or
right<00:05:33.660> is<00:05:33.810> supposed<00:05:34.080> to<00:05:34.200> be<00:05:34.289> in<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.470> right<00:05:34.650> ear

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
right is supposed to be in the right ear

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.920 
right is supposed to be in the right ear
and<00:05:35.010> vice-versa

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
and vice-versa

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.490 
and vice-versa
very<00:05:37.919> quiet<00:05:38.370> background<00:05:38.870> so<00:05:39.870> very<00:05:40.110> low<00:05:40.289> noise

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
very quiet background so very low noise

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.070 
very quiet background so very low noise
for<00:05:40.919> all<00:05:41.220> the<00:05:41.789> music<00:05:42.120> just<00:05:42.330> seems<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:42.720> come<00:05:42.900> out

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
for all the music just seems to come out

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.279 
for all the music just seems to come out
of<00:05:43.110> silence<00:05:43.789> which<00:05:44.789> is<00:05:44.910> really<00:05:45.210> nice<00:05:45.389> very

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
of silence which is really nice very

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.589 
of silence which is really nice very
well<00:05:46.500> made<00:05:46.680> unit<00:05:47.070> and<00:05:47.310> it<00:05:47.639> performs<00:05:48.120> way<00:05:48.450> out

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
well made unit and it performs way out

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.870 
well made unit and it performs way out
of<00:05:48.690> its<00:05:48.810> price<00:05:49.020> range<00:05:49.349> so<00:05:49.500> this<00:05:50.400> is<00:05:50.580> a<00:05:50.610> great

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
of its price range so this is a great

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.110 
of its price range so this is a great
great<00:05:51.750> piece<00:05:51.990> not<00:05:52.500> not<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.130> most<00:05:53.280> features<00:05:53.880> if

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
great piece not not the most features if

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.550 
great piece not not the most features if
you're<00:05:54.240> looking<00:05:54.570> for<00:05:54.720> something<00:05:54.960> with<00:05:55.289> a

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
you're looking for something with a

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.969 
you're looking for something with a
built-in<00:05:56.340> DAC<00:05:56.669> or<00:05:57.320> several<00:05:58.320> inputs<00:05:58.710> that<00:05:58.860> you

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
built-in DAC or several inputs that you

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.650 
built-in DAC or several inputs that you
can<00:05:59.099> just<00:05:59.280> change<00:05:59.520> easily<00:05:59.789> it's<00:06:00.210> not<00:06:00.389> as<00:06:00.510> easy

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
can just change easily it's not as easy

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.820 
can just change easily it's not as easy
a<00:06:00.840> setup<00:06:01.110> like<00:06:01.199> that

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
a setup like that

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.800 
a setup like that
but<00:06:02.160> if<00:06:02.250> you<00:06:02.340> set<00:06:02.550> this<00:06:02.669> up<00:06:02.849> for<00:06:02.910> one<00:06:03.180> dedicated

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
but if you set this up for one dedicated

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.969 
but if you set this up for one dedicated
source<00:06:04.080> to<00:06:04.349> it<00:06:04.500> it's<00:06:05.160> a<00:06:05.250> great<00:06:05.460> unit<00:06:05.820> and<00:06:06.500> and<00:06:07.500> a

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
source to it it's a great unit and and a

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.150 
source to it it's a great unit and and a
really<00:06:08.340> good<00:06:08.460> value<00:06:08.639> so<00:06:09.320> so<00:06:10.320> that's<00:06:10.530> that<00:06:10.800> this

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
really good value so so that's that this

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.010 
really good value so so that's that this
one<00:06:11.370> I<00:06:11.610> actually<00:06:11.820> purchased<00:06:12.360> for<00:06:12.510> myself<00:06:12.660> as

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
one I actually purchased for myself as

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.500 
one I actually purchased for myself as
well<00:06:13.050> so<00:06:14.510> you<00:06:15.510> know<00:06:15.599> it's<00:06:15.960> I<00:06:16.320> did<00:06:17.070> my<00:06:17.220> research

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
well so you know it's I did my research

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
well so you know it's I did my research
everybody<00:06:18.510> said<00:06:18.750> it<00:06:18.810> was<00:06:18.870> the<00:06:19.020> best<00:06:19.169> thing<00:06:19.410> you
