powerful here at Cal Poly that students

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.330 
powerful here at Cal Poly that students
get<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.390> chance<00:00:58.630> to<00:00:58.780> really<00:00:58.930> dive<00:00:59.230> in<00:00:59.470> to<00:01:00.010> an

you

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.490 

where<00:01:18.150> did<00:01:18.300> your<00:01:18.420> passion<00:01:18.660> for<00:01:18.900> meat<00:01:19.230> science

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
where did your passion for meat science

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.250 
where did your passion for meat science
first<00:01:19.920> begin<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:21.300> I<00:01:21.330> was<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.930> junior<00:01:21.960> college

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
first begin when I was in junior college

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.170 
first begin when I was in junior college
I<00:01:22.770> started<00:01:23.190> working<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.730> small<00:01:23.820> meat

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
I started working in a small meat

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.970 
I started working in a small meat
processing<00:01:24.660> facility<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.710> was<00:01:25.830> studying

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
processing facility and I was studying

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.650 
processing facility and I was studying
animal<00:01:26.460> science<00:01:26.760> at<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> time<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:27.570> all

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
animal science at the time and then all

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.390 
animal science at the time and then all
of<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.810> sudden<00:01:27.870> things<00:01:28.710> started<00:01:28.980> to<00:01:29.070> make<00:01:29.160> a<00:01:29.190> lot

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
of a sudden things started to make a lot

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.370 
of a sudden things started to make a lot
more<00:01:29.460> sense<00:01:29.910> when<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.300> was<00:01:30.570> working<00:01:31.140> with

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
more sense when I was working with

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.320 
more sense when I was working with
carcasses<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.040> me<00:01:32.190> all<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.850> things<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.180> we

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
carcasses in me all the things that we

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.470 
carcasses in me all the things that we
were<00:01:33.480> talking<00:01:33.870> about<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.170> animal<00:01:34.500> science<00:01:34.680> I

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
were talking about in animal science I

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.640 
were talking about in animal science I
could<00:01:36.480> just<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.870> all<00:01:37.050> of<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> sudden<00:01:37.470> why<00:01:37.590> it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
could just see it all of a sudden why it

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.200 
could just see it all of a sudden why it
was<00:01:37.800> so<00:01:37.920> important<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.520> from<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.060> day

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
was so important and so from that day

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.730 
was so important and so from that day
forward<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.780> knew<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.110> wanted<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.500> occur<00:01:40.650> in

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
forward I knew that I wanted to occur in

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.850 
forward I knew that I wanted to occur in
meat<00:01:40.920> industry<00:01:42.260> what<00:01:43.260> are<00:01:43.350> your<00:01:43.470> plans<00:01:43.620> for

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
meat industry what are your plans for

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.520 
meat industry what are your plans for
the<00:01:44.070> future<00:01:44.100> involving<00:01:44.880> meat<00:01:45.120> science<00:01:45.530> well

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the future involving meat science well

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.500 
the future involving meat science well
currently<00:01:46.800> I'm<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.880> finishing<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.390> my

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the venting in July and I'm going on to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.560 
the venting in July and I'm going on to
Texas<00:01:54.750> Tech<00:01:55.410> University<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.820> lubbock<00:01:57.540> texas

Texas Tech University in lubbock texas

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.140 
Texas Tech University in lubbock texas
where<00:01:58.260> I'm<00:01:58.410> going<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.860> studying<00:01:59.310> meat<00:01:59.880> science

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
where I'm going to studying meat science

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.550 
where I'm going to studying meat science
and<00:02:00.420> most<00:02:00.540> biology<00:02:01.170> learning<00:02:01.560> more<00:02:01.920> about<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
and most biology learning more about the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.719 
and most biology learning more about the
conversion<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.619> muscle<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.040> meet<00:02:05.190> power<00:02:05.430> goes

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
conversion of muscle to meet power goes

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.050 
conversion of muscle to meet power goes
from<00:02:05.970> an<00:02:06.180> animal<00:02:06.780> eventually<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:08.060> meet

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
from an animal eventually to meet

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.720 
from an animal eventually to meet
essentially<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.869> then<00:02:10.310> my<00:02:11.310> ultimate<00:02:11.490> goal

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
essentially and then my ultimate goal

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.470 
essentially and then my ultimate goal
would<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:13.140> my<00:02:13.290> PhD<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.160> teach<00:02:14.480> what

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
would be to have my PhD and teach what

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.460 
would be to have my PhD and teach what
is<00:02:15.570> your<00:02:15.720> favorite<00:02:16.050> thing<00:02:16.230> about<00:02:16.260> teaching

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
is your favorite thing about teaching

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.790 
is your favorite thing about teaching
here<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:17.190> Cal<00:02:17.430> Poly<00:02:17.459> oh<00:02:18.030> that's<00:02:18.660> easy<00:02:18.870> when

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
here at Cal Poly oh that's easy when

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.740 
here at Cal Poly oh that's easy when
students<00:02:20.160> start<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.730> take<00:02:21.390> meat<00:02:21.570> science

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
students start to take meat science

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.050 
students start to take meat science
classes<00:02:22.080> they<00:02:22.680> don't<00:02:23.459> really<00:02:23.580> understand

classes they don't really understand

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.490 
classes they don't really understand
that<00:02:24.269> there's<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.570> career<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.320> good

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
that there's a career and a good

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.900 
that there's a career and a good
opportunity<00:02:25.769> indeed<00:02:26.190> science<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.820> then

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
opportunity indeed science and then

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.060 
opportunity indeed science and then
after<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.480> few<00:02:27.540> weeks<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.200> few<00:02:28.380> years<00:02:28.560> they

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
after a few weeks in a few years they

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.560 
after a few weeks in a few years they
start<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.430> see<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.700> opportunity<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.420> that's

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
start to see the opportunity and that's

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.180 
start to see the opportunity and that's
the<00:02:30.720> best<00:02:30.930> part<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:31.560> being<00:02:31.890> able<00:02:31.950> to

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the best part that I like being able to
