feature that it has is optical character

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.250 
feature that it has is optical character
recognition<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:41.150> what<00:00:41.660> this<00:00:41.780> allows<00:00:42.020> you<00:00:42.170> to

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260

do<00:00:42.380> is<00:00:42.500> actually<00:00:42.680> scan<00:00:43.280> in<00:00:43.520> text<00:00:44.360> that<00:00:44.660> you<00:00:44.780> can

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
do is actually scan in text that you can

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.619 
do is actually scan in text that you can
edit<00:00:45.170> later<00:00:45.379> on<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.879> instead<00:00:47.239> of<00:00:47.450> just

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
edit later on so instead of just

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.420 
edit later on so instead of just
scanning<00:00:47.989> in<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.410> text<00:00:48.739> as<00:00:48.830> if<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.100> were<00:00:49.190> some

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.760 
scanning in the text as if it were some
kind<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.700> an<00:00:49.790> image<00:00:49.970> it<00:00:50.270> actually<00:00:50.770> recognizes

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
color in some of my graphs and then we

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.910 
color in some of my graphs and then we
press<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.260> menu<00:02:27.560> button

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
press the menu button

press the menu button
I<00:02:28.130> go<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.120> paper<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.510> copy<00:02:29.840> settings<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:31.420> here

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
I go to paper and copy settings and here

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.990 
I go to paper and copy settings and here
where<00:02:32.570> it<00:02:32.630> says<00:02:32.660> two-sided<00:02:33.500> printing<00:02:34.000> I'm

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
where it says two-sided printing I'm

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.590 
where it says two-sided printing I'm
actually<00:02:35.300> gonna<00:02:35.570> turn<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:35.989> on<00:02:37.420> double<00:02:38.420> check

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
actually gonna turn that on double check

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600 
actually gonna turn that on double check
and<00:02:38.750> quickly<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.320> see<00:02:39.620> that<00:02:39.769> my<00:02:39.860> paper<00:02:40.070> size<00:02:40.400> has

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
and quickly I see that my paper size has

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.360 
and quickly I see that my paper size has
already<00:02:40.880> set<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.120> letter<00:02:43.630> on<00:02:44.950> document<00:02:45.950> type<00:02:46.190> I

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
already set to letter on document type I

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.460 
already set to letter on document type I
do<00:02:46.489> have<00:02:46.880> text<00:02:47.209> but<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:47.690> also<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.230> some<00:02:48.440> of

do have text but I also have some of

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.560 
do have text but I also have some of
those<00:02:48.650> graphs<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.760> I'm<00:02:49.850> gonna<00:02:50.000> select<00:02:50.150> text

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
those graphs so I'm gonna select text

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.170 
those graphs so I'm gonna select text
and<00:02:50.810> image<00:02:51.170> when<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.220> comes<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.760> binding

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
and image when it comes to the binding

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.300 
and image when it comes to the binding
direction<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.900> choices<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:54.500> make<00:02:54.709> could<00:02:55.190> be

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
direction the choices you make could be

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.660 
direction the choices you make could be
important<00:02:56.709> I'm<00:02:57.709> going<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.980> select<00:02:58.130> binding

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
important I'm going to select binding

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.550 
important I'm going to select binding
direction<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.360> you'll<00:02:59.870> see<00:03:00.049> the<00:03:00.200> list<00:03:00.440> of

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.370 
direction and you'll see the list of
options<00:03:01.040> here<00:03:01.280> there's<00:03:01.580> vertical<00:03:01.790> long

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
options here there's vertical long

options here there's vertical long
vertical<00:03:03.380> short<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.670> difference<00:03:05.180> between

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
vertical short the difference between

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.820 
vertical short the difference between
these<00:03:05.780> two<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.320> is<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:07.549> bound<00:03:07.790> like<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.060> book<00:03:08.390> or

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
these two is is it bound like a book or

these two is is it bound like a book or
is<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:10.310> bound<00:03:10.519> like<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.880> pad<00:03:12.070> either<00:03:13.070> along<00:03:13.580> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
is it bound like a pad either along the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.860 
is it bound like a pad either along the
top<00:03:14.030> or<00:03:14.360> along<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.290> side<00:03:15.500> like<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.799> book<00:03:16.070> is

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
top or along the side like a book is

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.810 
top or along the side like a book is
just<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.049> simple<00:03:18.260> then<00:03:19.160> there's<00:03:19.400> horizontal

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
just that simple then there's horizontal

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.070 
just that simple then there's horizontal
long<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:21.610> horizontal<00:03:22.610> short<00:03:23.080> horizontal

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
long and horizontal short horizontal

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.840 
long and horizontal short horizontal
long<00:03:24.620> it's<00:03:24.830> gonna<00:03:24.950> work<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.459> lot<00:03:25.640> like<00:03:25.790> a

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
long it's gonna work a lot like a

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.600 
long it's gonna work a lot like a
calendar<00:03:26.480> does<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:27.019> show<00:03:27.230> nature<00:03:28.010> photography

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
calendar does to show nature photography

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.030 
calendar does to show nature photography
and<00:03:28.820> while<00:03:29.269> we're<00:03:29.420> on<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.570> subject<00:03:30.019> a<00:03:30.410> lot<00:03:30.920> of

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
and while we're on the subject a lot of

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.590 
and while we're on the subject a lot of
photography<00:03:31.640> books<00:03:31.910> will<00:03:32.060> also<00:03:32.390> use

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
photography books will also use

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.840 
photography books will also use
horizontal<00:03:33.049> short<00:03:33.739> which<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.250> like<00:03:34.549> a<00:03:34.580> regular

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
horizontal short which is like a regular

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.729 
horizontal short which is like a regular
book<00:03:35.269> format<00:03:35.840> that<00:03:35.989> you'd<00:03:36.110> open<00:03:36.470> from<00:03:36.650> the

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
book format that you'd open from the

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.099 
book format that you'd open from the
side<00:03:36.980> except<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.970> stretched<00:03:38.419> out<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.690> bit<00:03:38.959> so

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
side except it stretched out a bit so

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.150 
side except it stretched out a bit so
that<00:03:39.139> you<00:03:39.290> can<00:03:39.410> see<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.799> landscape
