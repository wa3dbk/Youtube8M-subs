 hello everyone and welcome to fast 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.330
 Guide on Giovanni Crusader Zakarum 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.849
 sacrificed your life and to clear 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.769
 her reputation joanna came to nexus from 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.019
 universe of diablo and became one of the most 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.150
 Persistent fighters in the game unlike other 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.980
 tanks that are trying to bring chaos 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.720
 John's enemy protects his rear 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.090
 controlling the movement of the opponent 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.619
 the unique ability of joans iron 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.779
 skin after activation it becomes 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.080
 irresistible gets chip absorbing 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.390
 damage 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.130
 keep in mind that this ability cannot 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.170
 activate being already derived from 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.369
 building the control of the enemy so you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.430
 must use your shield 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.140
 advance first punishment skill 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.129
 joanna beats the bills in a small area 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.559
 ahead of myself 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.760
 inflict damage and slows enemies by 60 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.399
 percent for two seconds 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.800
 I repeat before the ability very well 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.989
 little 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.700
 second skill censure after a second 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.320
 large-area action 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.930
 opponents are attracted to desire 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.760
 I take damage and a small camp is important 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.460
 remember that regardless of the distance to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.460
 the rival he is attracted to the support Jami 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.189
 third ability shining shield possesses 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.659
 big range cause damage and blinds 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.180
 the opponent leaving him to miss 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.400
 the next house attacks are easier to steam 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.200
 turnips 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.119
 1 Heroic Sword Feeder 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.250
 when activated, joanna takes off into the sky and 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.020
 lands in a specified area of air 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.729
 you can change the landing area with 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.890
 using move in two seconds 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.990
 joe she lands dealing damage and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.009
 throws enemies air also you 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.350
 can use this ability 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.299
 to overcome the obstacle and escape 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.880
 enemies through the relief because the air and you 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.070
 invulnerable another ulta consecrated shield 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.360
 john throwing a chip causing damage and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.790
 deafening first hit 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.710
 opponent for 2 seconds then shield 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.689
 bounces us another two prices 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.850
 half damage and bed one second 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.590
 consider that the shield acts on any 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.960
 enemies so use it wisely 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.820
 next to rival creeps or mercenaries 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.600
 In this build, I'll show you how to do it. 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.909
 Juan 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.470
 standing machine to absorb damage on 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.509
 reception paths but if you are using those 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.310
 strength and control will also highlight 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.780
 some alternative talents who 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.490
 you can pump the match against the strong 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.470
 killer inflicting auto attack 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.580
 for example a very balanced illidan 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.709
 sergeant sledgehammer 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.850
 Rainer tour or gazlow if it's still 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.280
 somehow peak it at all 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.220
 or appearing in every second match 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.140
 the shaft of her beginning on the first level we take 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.630
 the talent of the master of generation he increases 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.280
 Health regeneration at 4 for another 4 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.380
 every three health areas collected 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.269
 a hero in the game the beginning of the game you 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.130
 may not notice at the end it will give 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.709
 real prophet vs auto attackers 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.690
 take fortifications of this attack god but 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.280
 slightly improved there is only ujang and 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.650
 every time you use the ability 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.300
 it reduces the damage taken from 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.190
 following two auto attack two times 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.900
 true for profitable use of it 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.910
 talent will have to make a delay between 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.120
 using skills is not the most 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.860
 the best option for Giovanna is 4 we take 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.930
 principle hope this talent is passive 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.430
 regenerates hp a when the slade is activated 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.170
 Hero 20 percent ataeva 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.239
 maximum health for 4 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.340
 seconds you need to notice that the enhanced 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.950
 healing does not fit worse especially when 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.720
 We are looking for a support type game or this 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.640
 talent is also well combined with 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.190
 master may regeneration on the first level 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.989
 and holy restoration on 16 on 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.790
 level seven take it there moment 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.030
 each attack will reduce where it is 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.560
 abilities for 0.5 seconds allowing 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.480
 we often use our skills and 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.950
 look more effective kneading not 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.170
 Remember that the decrease but where 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.720
 act on the ulta but does not work on 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.180
 our 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.790
 on the tenth level we take a sacred shield 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.680
 with recharge in 60 seconds will buy battle 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.690
 moment he is this guy will be yours 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.820
 arsenal in each batch can 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.780
 use it for both initiation and 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.780
 for protective actions 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.100
 Further level 13 and here you are free 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.200
 choose yourself if you play against 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.120
 magical damages like jain or ki 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.460
 tasa then take a shield spell to 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.870
 reduce instant damage by van if you 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.480
 have noticed that the dough goes enough 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.070
 long you are in the thick of things 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.410
 can i take a fiery i'm glad that you 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.060
 do a little more damage if you 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.700
 don't like these two talents then boldly 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.860
 take a step back to boost your 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.440
 survival is better in the shield from the iron 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.990
 skin and reducing where it is for 4 seconds 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.910
 if his opponent destroys him on the 16th 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.010
 we take the holy restoration perfectly 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.110
 talent for our build heals wishes 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.820
 100 hp for each affected radiant 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.380
 the shield of the enemy and again the twentieth 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.340
 level you hit all players 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.470
 enemy team 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.150
 you will get a hill of about 20 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.040
 percent of your health like 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.050
 alternative against auto attackers we take 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.360
 pressure presence reduces speed 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.669
 attacks of such heroes by 50 percent while 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.340
 attack on you and in total with a clutch from 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.380
 shining cheat makes JoÃ£o real 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.540
 nightmare of every batter with hand 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.220
 hero at the twentieth level, we also 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.380
 there is a choice if you always break in 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.360
 first one of your teammates has already taken 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.870
 sing storm it is worth taking impenetrable 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.820
 armor 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.400
 every time when joe she will take damage 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.320
 which I was supposed to kill she gets 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.150
 shield strength equal to its maximum 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.130
 health for 5 seconds where to us 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.320
 2 minutes abilities on the other hand 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.270
 if you are not under the focus pulls 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.070
 storms would be an excellent choice when 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.350
 activation of the road to an ally in radius 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.330
 actions than 20 percent of their 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.669
 maximum health for three seconds and 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.410
 so we have build now and three 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.780
 small tips to help you 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.610
 haul caviar first john for real 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.470
 protector does that mean you have to stand 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.270
 next to the killer from your team and 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.230
 defend them from a rival which 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.390
 trying to break through to their rear 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.800
 it makes vividly on a good canter peak 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.510
 against heroes with fishes 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.160
 secondly consider that your 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.290
 abilities have a specific 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.780
 appointment and don't use them just 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.850
 so when you want to carry about these 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.830
 heroes who do not hit auto attack not 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.780
 slow down the enemy which is already worth it 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.280
 in place and try not to squeeze 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.070
 heroes to yourself so that from this 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.810
 hurt your allies always watch 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.480
 in order to properly use 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.030
 skills because every once again it's a waste 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.680
 time and mana and thirdly remember that 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.780
 using iron skin is not always 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.520
 need to repay damage and live longer 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.800
 sometimes do not fall under the line of the camp 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.450
 the enemy is much more useful for example 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.130
 if you see like the songs starts 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.260
 roll on your team fast 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.630
 press your vaschet then you can knock down 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.400
 multi we and save the batch and it's all on 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.440
 today translated and voiced specifically 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.440
 for this over Kirovsk
