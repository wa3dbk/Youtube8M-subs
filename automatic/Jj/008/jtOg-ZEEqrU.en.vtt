kind of apply some pressure
now<00:02:50.750> these<00:02:50.930> activators<00:02:51.769> actually<00:02:52.310> go<00:02:52.489> down

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
now these activators actually go down

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.190 
now these activators actually go down
individually<00:02:53.750> they<00:02:54.230> go<00:02:54.410> down<00:02:54.560> individually

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
individually they go down individually

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.160 
individually they go down individually
the<00:02:57.200> only<00:02:57.440> way<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.680> activate<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.549> motor<00:02:59.019> is<00:03:00.019> to

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
the only way to activate the motor is to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.410 
the only way to activate the motor is to
put<00:03:00.350> all<00:03:00.470> three<00:03:00.830> of<00:03:00.950> them<00:03:01.070> down

that's<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.750> whole<00:04:55.900> thing<00:04:56.200> I<00:04:56.470> guess<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:56.890> you

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
that's the whole thing I guess so you

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.170 
that's the whole thing I guess so you
got<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.310> use<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.460> little<00:04:57.730> bit<00:04:57.820> of<00:04:57.880> warm<00:04:58.120> water

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
got to use a little bit of warm water

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.630 
got to use a little bit of warm water
kind<00:04:58.720> of<00:04:58.810> tilt<00:04:59.020> up<00:04:59.140> to<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.380> side<00:04:59.620> a<00:05:00.010> little

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
kind of tilt up to the side a little

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.320 
kind of tilt up to the side a little
warm<00:05:00.880> water<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:02.110> uh<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:03.220> really<00:05:04.060> don't

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
warm water and uh I really don't

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.530

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 
adjustments when they made it and didn't

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.220
