00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
bit better strategically now we didn't

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.850 
bit better strategically now we didn't
really<00:00:41.460> care<00:00:42.300> at<00:00:42.480> all<00:00:42.510> about<00:00:42.660> wave<00:00:43.260> control<00:00:43.680> or

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
really care at all about wave control or

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.440 
really care at all about wave control or
 like<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.309> before<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.030> started<00:00:45.329> we

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
 like this before the started we

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.060 
 like this before the started we
were<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.719> screaming<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.350> trying<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.890> fight

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
were just screaming and trying to fight

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.100 
were just screaming and trying to fight
and<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.670> was<00:00:48.149> working<00:00:48.510> kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.809> well<00:00:48.899> but

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
and I was working kind of well but

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.209 
and I was working kind of well but
when<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.320> played<00:00:49.500> against<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> top<00:00:49.980> teams

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
when we played against the top teams

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
when we played against the top teams
they<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.640> today<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.870> took<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> Opera<00:00:52.289> hand

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
they just today just took the Opera hand

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.090 
they just today just took the Opera hand
like<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.210> with<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> castle<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.840> just

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
like that and with the castle in is just

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.470 
like that and with the castle in is just
easier<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.129> play<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.730> completely<00:00:57.329> no

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
easier to play like it's completely no

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.900 
easier to play like it's completely no
skill<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:59.010> don't<00:00:59.190> only<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> press<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
skill so you don't only have to press a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.520 
skill so you don't only have to press a
couple<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.390> buttons<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.930> win<00:01:01.050> most<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
couple of buttons to win most of the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.410 
couple of buttons to win most of the
time<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.430> wise<00:01:02.579> working<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> know

why<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.240> Rockettes<00:01:06.659> games<00:01:06.869> run<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.350> long

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
why is that Rockettes games run so long

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.830 
why is that Rockettes games run so long
and<00:01:07.970> against<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> top<00:01:09.240> teams<00:01:09.450> we've<00:01:09.570> seen<00:01:09.750> you

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and against the top teams we've seen you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.050 
and against the top teams we've seen you
putting<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.170> our<00:01:10.530> long<00:01:10.950> epics<00:01:11.340> multiple<00:01:11.820> times

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
putting on our long epics multiple times

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
putting on our long epics multiple times
what<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.869> about<00:01:12.960> your<00:01:13.200> early<00:01:13.290> game<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.770> is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
what is it about your early game that is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.340 
what is it about your early game that is
forcing<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.060> fall<00:01:15.270> behind<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.049> dig

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
forcing you to fall behind and then dig

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.730 
forcing you to fall behind and then dig
deep<00:01:16.560> late<00:01:17.240> i'm<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.450> sure<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:19.020> game<00:01:19.229> we

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
deep late i'm not sure like this game we

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.320 
deep late i'm not sure like this game we
had<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> little<00:01:20.220> bit<00:01:20.340> better<00:01:20.490> lay<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.939> come<00:01:21.150> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
had a little bit better lay can come so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.450 
had a little bit better lay can come so
it's<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> bit<00:01:21.689> justified<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.920> tend<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> fall

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it's a bit justified but we tend to fall

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.219 
it's a bit justified but we tend to fall
behind<00:01:23.580> early<00:01:23.850> most<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.420> our<00:01:24.540> games<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:25.080> like

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
behind early most of our games it's like

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
behind early most of our games it's like
our<00:01:25.409> biggest<00:01:25.530> weakness<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.220> our<00:01:26.430> early<00:01:26.759> game

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
our biggest weakness is our early game

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.149 
our biggest weakness is our early game
so<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.470> work<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.040> then

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
so we just get to work on that and then

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830 
so we just get to work on that and then
I<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.640> contend<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.329> best

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
I think we can contend with the best

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.539 
I think we can contend with the best
teams<00:01:31.020> yeah<00:01:31.799> well<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:31.979> definitely<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
teams yeah well I definitely think you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.590 
teams yeah well I definitely think you
