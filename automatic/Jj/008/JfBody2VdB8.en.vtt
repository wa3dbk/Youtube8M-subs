listening to sports talk radio at a
really<00:01:52.259> young<00:01:52.440> age<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.800> I<00:01:52.830> always<00:01:52.979> thought<00:01:53.250> I'm

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
really young age so I always thought I'm

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.880 
really young age so I always thought I'm
gonna<00:01:53.820> end<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.210> being<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.110> some<00:01:55.320> sports<00:01:55.649> talk

gonna end up being on some sports talk
radio<00:01:56.130> show<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.960> over<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.050> years<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.409> kind<00:01:58.619> of

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
radio show and over the years I kind of

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.859 
radio show and over the years I kind of
started<00:01:59.610> figuring<00:01:59.850> out<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.479> really

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
started figuring out that I really

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.080 
started figuring out that I really
wanted<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.259> change<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.070> meant<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.550> a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
wanted to change what it meant to be a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.580 
wanted to change what it meant to be a
female<00:02:03.539> sportscaster<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.590> women

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
female sportscaster I think that women

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.229 
female sportscaster I think that women
have<00:02:07.679> come<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.890> long<00:02:08.160> way<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.489> sports<00:02:09.030> but<00:02:09.179> I

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
