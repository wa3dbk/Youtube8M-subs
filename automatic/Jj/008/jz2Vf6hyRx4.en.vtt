00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.770

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.130
 second creepy pasta I hope you 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.910
 like creepy pasta number 2 the doll 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.770
 Renco ran the year of 1988 a new 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.470
 doll had gone to the market with the 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.240
 baby name lauga lloyd his role 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.800
 main was to produce laughter and 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.830
 they pressed the button on his chest 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.440
 while laughing he rocked in his chair and did not 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.300
 I stopped laughing in that year was a 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.910
 novelty see a doll make that guy 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.309
 of such natural actions I was a 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.170
 girl full of whims as soon as I saw the 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.420
 commercial I ran with my mother to 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.120
 ask him to buy it however 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.860
 we always live in humility now I 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.800
 I feel grateful for not having had 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.300
 so much money many friends of mine 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.370
 They presumed that their parents 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.350
 they would buy the doll he watched them with 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.710
 envy while pretending joy 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.660
 them and that's how my friends got 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.729
 the doll and they came to show me the one 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.890
 in their packaging I asked them to play 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.680
 with her but they were selfish and 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.410
 they denied my request the following do not 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.960
 I remember clearly it was just a girl 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.080
 and I can not explain everything that happened 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.820
 but I know it was the afternoon of March 14 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.700
 note that the commercial of the doll no longer 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.400
 was broadcast on television emma one of 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.409
 my friends fell seriously ill my 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.210
 mother told me I had the flu but because 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.490
 the window of my room I saw arriving 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.280
 numerous cars and men dressed 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.320
 with a robe coming out of them I knew that 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.140
 it was not a simple flu but nobody 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.970
 he wanted to tell me the truth shortly after 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.860
 I found out that he had fallen into a trance 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.350
 schizophrenic where he could not leave 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.720
 from laughing out loud his parents were 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.360
 terrified totally desperate 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.250
 to find an explanation but the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.140
 situation began to get worse 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.130
 emma expelled blood from her nose I 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.170
 ears 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.570
 I had the opportunity to visit it and I was 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.179
 surprised of what I saw was almost 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.820
 dead did not look like a ten-year-old girl 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.640
 She was a little old woman tied to everything 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.530
 kind of medical devices I looked at their 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.810
 room and I found the doll in its 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.480
 bedside table looked like I was watching her 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.150
 he watched the deliriums and 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.160
 sudden laughter that most suffered a 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.290
 week after I saw a long 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.400
 black car to my mom's house 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.709
 said that hand 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.260
 it is aria of the trip after it was rose 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.329
 started with delusions he shouted at the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.610
 nights that the doll wanted to take her 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.500
 later he began to laugh whipping his 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.409
 head on the wall leaving spots of 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.360
 blood impossible to clean too 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.430
 I could visit her her forehead was 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.500
 healing and although his parents had 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.810
 painted the wall I could still see the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.569
 faint spots of blood and of equal 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.730
 way I felt the doll look no 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.040
 I knew more about roush his mother took her to 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.650
 home of his grandparents I know he found the 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.049
 Same ending as emma but before leaving 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.090
 left the doll at the door of my house 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.730
 my mother took it and put it on top of the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.530
 closet of my room at night 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.450
 I heard the sound of hollow wood and 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.000
 I could see that the doll was swinging in its 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.280
 chair I jumped out of my bed and I fell fright 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.349
 down the stairs I ended up in a hospital 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.900
 for the fracture of my left arm and 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.030
 slight wounds on my neck I screamed at my 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.459
 mother who did not want the doll to order 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.439
 that he would burn it but he refused to get to 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.720
 my house I took ethyl alcohol and 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.060
 kitchen lighter whips the doll 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.000
 I completely covered it and the green one in front of 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.280
 I could hear him laughing while 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.500
 it was calcined little by little do not stop 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.830

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.170
 four years of psychological therapy
