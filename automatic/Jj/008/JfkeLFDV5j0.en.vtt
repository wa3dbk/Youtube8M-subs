other companies when they make their
lightweight<00:04:07.580> helmets<00:04:08.090> make<00:04:08.540> bigger<00:04:08.810> vents

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
lightweight helmets make bigger vents

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.350 
lightweight helmets make bigger vents
and<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:09.650> offset<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:10.160> safety<00:04:10.940> ratings<00:04:11.210> they

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
and to offset that safety ratings they

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.230 
and to offset that safety ratings they
have<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.630> use<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:12.020> denser<00:04:12.700> foam<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:14.000> what<00:04:14.090> does

have to use a denser foam and what does

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.400 
have to use a denser foam and what does
that<00:04:14.270> mean<00:04:14.390> for<00:04:14.630> your<00:04:14.750> head<00:04:14.900> well<00:04:15.200> it

that mean for your head well it

that mean for your head well it

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
something that is not required and it's

above and beyond any safety ratings they

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.860 
above and beyond any safety ratings they

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
use a composite fusion plus which is an

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.040 
use a composite fusion plus which is an

density foam to be protecting your head
and<00:04:32.810> they<00:04:33.260> don't<00:04:33.380> just<00:04:33.560> do<00:04:33.740> too<00:04:33.920> they<00:04:34.130> do<00:04:34.190> three

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
and they don't just do too they do three

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.970 
and they don't just do too they do three
and<00:04:35.000> they<00:04:35.750> also<00:04:35.960> do<00:04:36.320> something<00:04:36.560> called<00:04:36.710> the

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
and they also do something called the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.950 
and they also do something called the
super<00:04:37.160> vent<00:04:37.490> which<00:04:37.640> reinforces<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.660> vents

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
super vent which reinforces the vents

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.260 
super vent which reinforces the vents
allowing<00:04:39.410> them<00:04:39.530> get<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.740> larger<00:04:40.520> event<00:04:40.700> which

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
allowing them get a larger event which

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.390 
allowing them get a larger event which
means<00:04:41.540> more<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.780> an<00:04:41.900> elation<00:04:42.220> also<00:04:43.220> more

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
means more of an elation also more

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.460 
means more of an elation also more
safety<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:44.570> other<00:04:44.810> nice<00:04:45.080> thing<00:04:45.320> is<00:04:45.440> that

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
safety the other nice thing is that

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.560 
safety the other nice thing is that
there's<00:04:45.770> a<00:04:45.980> carbon<00:04:46.490> cage<00:04:46.700> on<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.030> rear<00:04:47.270> which

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
there's a carbon cage on the rear which

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.680 
there's a carbon cage on the rear which
reinforces<00:04:48.140> it<00:04:48.440> from<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.220> back<00:04:49.400> side<00:04:49.690> this

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
reinforces it from the back side this

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.110 
reinforces it from the back side this
comes<00:04:51.020> in<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.320> road<00:04:51.680> version<00:04:52.130> and<00:04:52.340> also<00:04:53.030> a

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
comes in a road version and also a

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.120 
comes in a road version and also a
bummer<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:54.020> only<00:04:54.200> difference<00:04:54.410> between<00:04:54.980> the

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
bummer the only difference between the

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.310 
bummer the only difference between the
two<00:04:55.310> is<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.790> road<00:04:55.940> does<00:04:56.120> not<00:04:56.150> have<00:04:56.570> the

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
two is that the road does not have the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.250 
two is that the road does not have the
amounts<00:04:57.830> for<00:04:58.010> advisors<00:04:58.810> I've<00:04:59.810> been<00:05:00.110> using

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
amounts for advisors I've been using

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.810 
amounts for advisors I've been using

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
check it out it is the most expensive

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.430 
check it out it is the most expensive
helmet<00:05:08.330> that<00:05:08.420> we've<00:05:08.570> looked<00:05:08.720> at<00:05:08.930> today<00:05:09.140> and

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
helmet that we've looked at today and

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.180 
helmet that we've looked at today and
won<00:05:09.950> 89<00:05:10.220> 99<00:05:10.670> but<00:05:11.600> you<00:05:11.900> get<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:12.290> much<00:05:12.470> more<00:05:12.740> in

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
won 89 99 but you get so much more in

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.580 
won 89 99 but you get so much more in
this<00:05:13.490> helmet<00:05:13.810> then<00:05:14.810> any<00:05:15.080> other<00:05:15.170> ones<00:05:15.500> that

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
we've looked at and it comes to

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.110 
we've looked at and it comes to
protecting<00:05:17.750> my<00:05:17.960> noggin<00:05:18.440> I<00:05:18.760> prefer<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.790> best

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
so again this is the way

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:32.169 
so again this is the way
the<00:05:22.740> week<00:05:22.920> and<00:05:23.280> check<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.150> out
