00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.680 
going okay I did the first coat it's
looking<00:02:36.040> pretty<00:02:36.310> good<00:02:36.670> I'm<00:02:36.880> not<00:02:37.150> sure<00:02:37.450> if<00:02:37.600> I

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
looking pretty good I'm not sure if I

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.790 
looking pretty good I'm not sure if I
like<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.140> color<00:02:39.210> but<00:02:40.210> then<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.480> got<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.620> on<00:02:41.770> a

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
like the color but then I got it on a

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.010 
like the color but then I got it on a
clearance<00:02:42.460> because<00:02:43.090> somebody<00:02:43.450> else<00:02:43.540> didn't

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
clearance because somebody else didn't

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.490 
clearance because somebody else didn't
like<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.350> color<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.970> think<00:02:46.870> only<00:02:47.050> because

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
like the color but I think only because

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.350 
like the color but I think only because
it<00:02:47.650> doesn't<00:02:47.980> go<00:02:48.130> with<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.490> counter<00:02:49.030> over

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
it doesn't go with this counter over

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.710 
it doesn't go with this counter over
here<00:02:49.690> but<00:02:50.440> that's<00:02:50.650> not<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:50.920> problem<00:02:51.720> it's

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
here but that's not a problem it's

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.890 
here but that's not a problem it's
looking<00:02:53.200> better<00:02:54.330> let's<00:02:55.330> see<00:02:55.510> after<00:02:55.630> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
looking better let's see after the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.470 
looking better let's see after the
second<00:02:56.320> coat<00:02:56.530> first<00:02:57.070> coat<00:02:57.460> took<00:02:58.120> 35<00:02:59.050> minutes

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
alright that was to coats within the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.650 
alright that was to coats within the
hour<00:03:04.080> one<00:03:05.080> hour<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.560> do<00:03:05.740> two<00:03:05.950> coats

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
hour one hour to do two coats

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.650

it's<00:03:07.660> looking<00:03:08.260> good<00:03:09.240> humidity<00:03:10.240> is<00:03:10.270> a<00:03:10.360> little

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
it's looking good humidity is a little

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.480 
it's looking good humidity is a little
higher<00:03:10.900> than<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.290> hoped<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.800> would<00:03:11.980> be<00:03:12.010> but<00:03:12.430> I

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
higher than I hoped it would be but I

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.460 
higher than I hoped it would be but I
think<00:03:12.850> it's<00:03:13.060> still<00:03:13.390> within<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:14.050> realm<00:03:16.290> but<00:03:17.290> it

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
think it's still within the realm but it

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.540 
think it's still within the realm but it
says<00:03:17.710> at<00:03:17.920> right<00:03:18.640> at<00:03:19.350> 85%<00:03:20.350> mmm<00:03:20.770> this<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.430> the
