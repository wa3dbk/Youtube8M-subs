00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:11.639
 today's video about that is you 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:16.849
 here there is such a problem as myself 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.849
 he goes hot air from here 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.470
 from the panel this is plastic 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.539
 why does it come with time in this skin 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.990
 rubber who's this gum here then 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.349
 eat around 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.230
 levers I'm on the pier for 3 and screws here 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.489
 so small they are inserted 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:45.329
 metal caps here 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.100
 inserts a very plastic sheet 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.989
 You disassemble see yonder something that is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.020
 apparently she glistens this here she and I 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.550
 piston pulled them all down here 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.510
 In fact, this dink begins to hang out 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.420
 but everything went girth very hot 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.149
 winter, summer is not very well who that is, 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.159
 gives trouble how to get rid 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.260
 I will not put regular moans because 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.659
 that they are so with me and I do not favor them 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.260
 because they still fall apart 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.000
 the problem must be solved more cardinally 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.070
 By the way in Yiddish, piston checks are screwed 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.549
 mine goes blank sign the same thing you 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.630
 may lose me immediately to 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.630
 homemade 1 and show you how to do 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.810
 they are made 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.910
 in this stage the gud will drown us out 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.790
 mounted plating well they are everywhere he 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.580
 cap on the ceiling 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.310
 caps so called caption here it will 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.810
 worth pistons are here and that's the way 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.330
 the license plate here stands on them no longer 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.180
 I know how much 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.290
 Here hangs a bit but they do not have them 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.940
 fly the fact of the matter is that they hold 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:02.590
 nominally me 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:04.750
 the first winter fell like that caps 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.520
 would be the basics they are cheap penny 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.790
 do not need that need to be given in 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.260
 square nasty here on the verge 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.520
 mock knife well, what a little he 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.310
 big and not at the end then he doesn't get up 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.510
 fixed will bulge over 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.510
 the surface of what we do not need 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.870
 plastic pretty chaff take care 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.870
 fingers allowed not to cut myself 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.170
 here the body turns out more why 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.620
 keeps building what we have 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.790
 the right melted 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.459
 A little more plastic station 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.500
 Mushrooms this leave the whole keeps better 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.240
 like that cut 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.710
 is not 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.170
 what is tetra 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.500
 and now it shorten so that's not a movie 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.500
 need to 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:18.540
 here and the corner of the body a little cut to 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:22.110
 make it easier because there 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:26.400
 uncomfortable just like you in ordinary 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.590
 conditions and I do not do it here 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.540
 because it is inconvenient or has already removed everything 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.989
 elect well here he can see him cut 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.620
 a little cone and here it is a square 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:42.980
 it's all formed enough 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.980
 created also 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.510
 so first a little movement 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.890
 why very much who submit the section so as not 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.760
 Russian rights will start 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.270
 Screw unscrew the screws can be stately 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.270
 can 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.090
 which is with a big corner methadone and and by 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.860
 galvanized you see which license plates 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.860
 the signs are galvanized all rusted 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.430
 type everywhere 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.790
 because 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.720
 to redo something completely drilled 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.720
 but I don't see the point 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.780
 you can do so little 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.280
 the means especially the piston always with 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:34.220
 you are gaining a lot 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.520
 from where it is useful to hide anyway 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.520
 need to 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.980
 little corners just a little bit 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.850
 press, and so he will go to his life 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:54.000
 ease so that later there were no problems with 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:58.240
 montage here is such a thing kids I cut out 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.340
 now there are not three such but 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.070
 I decided to show you something to someone 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.400
 probably such things come in handy 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.400
 do 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.640
 Well, actually everything remains to be inserted 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:17.470
 collect pull and hot air is not 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.470
 will spoil the coolness of air conditioners
