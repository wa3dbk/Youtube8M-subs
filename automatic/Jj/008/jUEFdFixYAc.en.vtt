00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.570
 some pictures 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.300
 you move them on the desktop if you 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.970
 did it directly the file you 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.600
 launch the is up 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.600
 it was like 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.170
 I executed mafia launcher 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.170
 install them 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.909

 yes I really 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.780
 and resume any time 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.350
 then they ask the cd2 a dose 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.270
 it was 2 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.270
 expect that it goes wrong 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.940
 okay 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.370
 and you do the same with this 3 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:40.580
 after having downloaded everything 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:45.550
 you played but after the rest 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:49.970
 file crackles so you open yourself 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.860
 your local disk the in the file 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.800
 mafia do not know where you got it 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.190
 registered so here I should 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.440
 crackle files take the game point m 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.090
 what happened in mafia 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.140
 exceeded replace 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.500
 wattignies 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.429
 here 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.429
 and normally you have 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.379
 and we 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.379
 just before casting 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.850
 you return to your mafia file 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.800
 and you launch the seventh point ex 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.900
 here you choose a resolution 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.050
 the last one as you want 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.120

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.709
 then here in these mafias 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.730
