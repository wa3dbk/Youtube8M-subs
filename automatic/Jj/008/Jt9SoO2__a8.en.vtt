wall of water this was invented a few
years<00:02:43.079> ago<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.680> very<00:02:43.950> efficient<00:02:44.489> and

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
years ago and it's very efficient and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
very effective these are plastic this is

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.649 
very effective these are plastic this is
a<00:02:47.129> piece<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.459> plastic<00:02:47.909> and<00:02:48.060> then<00:02:48.209> it's<00:02:48.420> been

a piece of plastic and then it's been

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.899 
a piece of plastic and then it's been

you<00:02:50.969> fill<00:02:51.180> them<00:02:51.269> full<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.510> water<00:02:51.870> put<00:02:52.590> them

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
you fill them full of water put them

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.559 
you fill them full of water put them
around<00:02:52.980> your<00:02:53.219> tomato<00:02:53.579> plant<00:02:53.939> during<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.420> day

around your tomato plant during the day
the<00:02:54.780> Sun<00:02:54.989> warms<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.829> water<00:02:55.859> up<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.670> at<00:02:57.239> night

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
the Sun warms the water up and at night

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.869 
the Sun warms the water up and at night
when<00:02:57.659> the<00:02:57.750> bad<00:02:57.930> weather<00:02:58.170> comes<00:02:58.500> in<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:59.519> just

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
when the bad weather comes in it just

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.599 
when the bad weather comes in it just
that<00:03:00.090> warmth<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.319> plastic<00:03:01.859> and<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.370> water

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
that warmth of the plastic and the water

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.300 
that warmth of the plastic and the water
keeps<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.329> inside<00:03:03.749> warm<00:03:04.109> and<00:03:04.439> so<00:03:05.040> it

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
keeps the inside warm and so it

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.909 
keeps the inside warm and so it
continues<00:03:05.849> to<00:03:05.969> grow<00:03:06.120> at<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.510> regulated<00:03:07.230> heat

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
continues to grow at a regulated heat

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.190 
continues to grow at a regulated heat
now<00:03:08.519> if<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.969> will<00:03:09.180> take<00:03:09.329> any<00:03:09.629> one<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:09.959> these
