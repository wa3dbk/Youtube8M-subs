00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello to all I find today 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.920
 for a new video today we 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.960
 will do little dinosaurs on our 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.849
 fingers so nothing very complicated I 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.830
 chose the big fat ease since 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.820
 I did that at this inverted campsite and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.500
 those who follow me on this theme 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.990
 pussy will surely recognize this 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.910
 manna reading I used a plate of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.380
 at bundle monster I will put you to the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.740
 reference if you do not see well but 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.119
 that's the xl 15 of what I see 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.250
 you can find them on their website 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.810
 directly or at some resellers 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.480
 I believe I will put you the links in 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.880
 the info bar I will look at it all at 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.040
 the time so I'm doing a normal stamping 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.020
 very very normal even I put a lot 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.600
 of time to do it I used in 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.309
 black varnish a varnish from bindo des 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.110
 currencies what they are super super 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.879
 pigmented and that really works 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.530
 very very good for him this camping then 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.120
 I started directly by preparing 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.039
 but because that patch but still 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.539
 a small between 10 and 15 minutes to 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.890
 to dry and suddenly it left me the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.390
 time to ask my basic varnish 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.070
 quietly I advise to do 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.129
 without an obvious time wasting at 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.510
 wait and do nothing between the moment 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.579
 where the patch break etc 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.229
 I used two varnishes and if I you 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.970
 would also put references in 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.950
 the info bar if you actually want 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.689
 just coloring angers coloring a 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.189
 a little rudely yeah a little 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.780
 roughly to try not 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.070
 overtaking lines but I'm pretty 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.619
 no coloring so 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.630
 so here I did it quickly and 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.610
 a college is finished we will ask a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.920
 layer of well liquid top coat have not 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.049
 of top coat 16 fast because the cesu 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 Talence to curl up on 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.619
 same so I took in top coat which I 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.390
 do not remember the name anymore but you 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.700
 have seen on camera it's a knock 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.960
 really does not cost low end but 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.670
 finally the first job cause I have 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.990
 found that is not a it's just you 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.220
 can take those who che co who 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.380
 works very well I believe 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.940
 the transparent top coat just everything 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.220
 simple of this one works very very 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.780
 well I put my stamp in a corner 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.190
 and let them dry during this 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.100
 time there I laid my base and my 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.810
 colors and I was old had taken off 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.380
 gently patch with a small clip 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.550
 tweezers 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.840
 so I advise you when you 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.760
 put some transparent varnish 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.800
 put a little more on the side 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.480
 so that if it breaks it rips 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.130
 not in the in the reason me I do 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.660
 all will have buffer like that I 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 am quiet and I have a little bit of 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.430
 margin to take off quietly my 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.430
 drawing 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.290
 so here is once I took off my 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.920
 little patch I take it 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.770
 carefully and I'll come on 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.090
 place on my color base that did not 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.040
 no top coat it's important to 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.810
 clarify I think are maybe not I 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.850
 do not know actually it sticks better done 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.410
 notice if your nail polish does not have a top 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.490
 coat over it then it's useless to 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.560
 put the top coat of you go 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.200
 put something over I 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.390
 stick I gently press with with my 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.740
 angle also to put it on the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.360
 side of houses of those as I was 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.700
 shadow the bulge it must be really good 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.130
 smoothed and then I'll take a couple 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.840
 alive for to remove the biggest and 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.440
 then after my little brush with 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.030
 acetone 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.130
 I actually ask some questions 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.140
 seconds for that breaks the seal actually 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.020
 between where I want it 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.760
 stops and the and the patch and then like 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.870
 that without a super base easily so you have to 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.370
 do it right away because otherwise 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.170
 it tends to stick on the skin and it 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.550
 does a little more cleaning and I put 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.300
 immediately a layer of top road 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.770
 thick gold or coating well 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.910
 it me down I finally found my 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.900
 words today the bottom of my fingernail 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.900
 so that it fits well 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.200
 I 'm doing exactly the same thing 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.240
 for my age hours I had prepared the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.160
 patch on another buffer during this 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.720
 time there and then got off the hook so I 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.490
 you can do so finally short I think 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.740
 that there was so I put them on my 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.180
 nail I support well I will clean I 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.840
 will finish with a layer of top coat and 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.910
 It's over 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.890
 I hope this is the rdt you will have 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.540
 rain tomorrow there is no live I play 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.190
 a reminder and it is super nice this 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.260
