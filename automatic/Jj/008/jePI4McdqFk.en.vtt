00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.690
 a literary workshop is basically an experience we both had to come 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.649
 to participate 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:12.759
 This server 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.100
 is the way to find our own voice our own style our 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.199
 way of writing 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.820
 no indoctrination synthesis of the person that what you should think that what 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.800
 what should he say 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.669
 if he has to speak only the good the bad 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.199
 but rather those techniques strategies and possibilities that are given 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.880
 both on a practical level and at a theoretical level to improve 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.949
 writing for blind writing or quality writing 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.700
 and have a projection that readers 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.880
 percent have 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.700
 the respect that we as writers have to give them and that 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.150
 they can develop 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.420
 your own writing 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.200
 like no other person could be no 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.560
 It is good to be able to find there that niche that allows one to be 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.699
 so that people arrive with crowds 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.000
 that people arrive 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.500
 with many desires to produce to generate quality texts to generate a 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.290
 innovative literature that has its proposals and simply us what 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.189
 we treat the subject 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.580
 willemstad those proposals to generate 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.210
 those strategies of their possibilities for what the writer finds his 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.730
 way for the writer 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.430
 the initial initial has gone with bush 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.790
 with experience 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.030
 his experience has asked him 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.230
 to say things differently most people are afraid of 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.860
 attend a literary workshop 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.490
 and they do not have to have 90 we have a strategy that does 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.930
 we work with people who have some kind of stage fright 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.210
 we work individually and I particularly attend them 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.560
 I'm fine here to initial about improvement in the first month second month 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.690
 then they incorporate a group i and that is the idea whether we all have 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.070
 great possibilities to express ourselves 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.490
 this is what we do not know if it agrees to commit them 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.280
 and the fear is removed curiously when the person is in contact 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.270
 with own consumption consumption 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.600
 os possibilities the mustache generate those fish realizes that it is also capable 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.220
 he must do things that he did not know before that he could be 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.179
 the fear of the week is removed and the person is on the list 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:17.169
 to start developing with a lot more amplitude 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.879
 all those possibilities and also their skills that each position 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.439
 I felt the need that we sometimes have before you tell 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.259
 something 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.259
 occurrences your story are things that are given 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.729
 what we do is that we help the person 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:37.359
 oscar the way to wait for it in a better way the workshop allowed me 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:42.769
 l find a voice of its own a way of saying the things you wanted to say 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.840
 but with an original form in a way without falling into common places ever 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.629
 was touched was he the subject of the fund what always worked was the way 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.219
 every writer is self-evident, yes, because he has to love his creature 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.060
 have to 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.290
 be convinced of your creature that's why the ego tineo a perspective perhaps 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.220
 positive and negative the point is to know how to orientate it ponce raw at the moment where 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.209
 one 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.559
 think you can 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.009
 have more inspiration an all in one 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:14.989
 and you just have to have the patience of bp for a workshop it's always the pita 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.029
 tolerance 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.700
 hence, he certified 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.700
 and you have to be self-critical that helps us discover for themselves 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.019
 the possibility 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.599
 that others can see new visions of our text and we 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.150
 they also contribute from others 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.689
 our mission 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.169

 percent and they can be allowed for me 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.439
 i the failure came the network 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.759
 they called me from Spain 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:51.009
 because there is a human being and to be able to share with others
