00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.420 
pattern okay take your four by six tall
match<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.200> I'll<00:03:48.290> need<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.470> cut<00:03:48.650> in<00:03:48.769> half<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.250> get

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
match so I'll need to cut in half to get

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.900 
match so I'll need to cut in half to get
to<00:03:49.940> two<00:03:50.540> by<00:03:50.720> six<00:03:51.079> sections<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:52.549> drop<00:03:52.760> the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
weights on your finish platform what we

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.069 
weights on your finish platform what we
did<00:03:55.609> is<00:03:55.790> we<00:03:57.040> shocked<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.280> line<00:03:58.600> halfway<00:03:59.600> down

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
did is we shocked a line halfway down

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.309 
did is we shocked a line halfway down
the<00:04:00.230> middle<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:02.810> these

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
the middle of these

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.410 
the middle of these
and<00:04:04.680> then<00:04:05.099> my<00:04:05.310> preferred<00:04:05.670> method<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.150> stick

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
and then my preferred method is to stick

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.080 
and then my preferred method is to stick
