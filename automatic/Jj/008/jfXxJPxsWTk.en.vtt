lines and ridges
so<00:04:23.960> there<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:24.990> go<00:04:25.620> it's<00:04:26.070> very<00:04:26.220> glossy<00:04:26.670> finish

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
so there you go it's very glossy finish

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.720 
so there you go it's very glossy finish
that<00:04:28.290> first<00:04:28.470> wasn't<00:04:28.830> too<00:04:28.950> big<00:04:29.160> of<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.460> fan<00:04:29.700> of

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
that first wasn't too big of a fan of

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.380 
that first wasn't too big of a fan of
the<00:04:30.240> soft<00:04:30.780> plastic<00:04:31.320> rope<00:04:31.620> but<00:04:32.000> I've<00:04:33.000> gotten<00:04:33.360> to

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
the soft plastic rope but I've gotten to

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.820 
the soft plastic rope but I've gotten to
like<00:04:33.600> it<00:04:33.810> kind<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.140> really<00:04:34.350> like<00:04:34.380> how<00:04:34.710> its

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
like it kind of really like how its

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.450 
like it kind of really like how its
molded<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:35.370> just<00:04:35.640> flows<00:04:36.150> off<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.570> one<00:04:36.750> side<00:04:36.780> so

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
molded and just flows off to one side so

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.610 
molded and just flows off to one side so
I<00:04:38.460> mean<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.120> didn't<00:04:39.330> like<00:04:39.480> just<00:04:40.170> the<00:04:40.320> person

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
I mean I didn't like just the person

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.670 
I mean I didn't like just the person
just<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:41.100> fact<00:04:41.310> it<00:04:41.490> looks<00:04:41.640> so<00:04:41.760> wide<00:04:42.030> here<00:04:42.750> but

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
just the fact it looks so wide here but

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.720 
just the fact it looks so wide here but
I'm<00:04:44.070> going<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.460> like<00:04:44.610> it

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.010 

which<00:04:47.730> just<00:04:47.880> gives<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.240> know<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.750> legs

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
which just gives you know that the legs

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.980 
which just gives you know that the legs
too<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.380> mean<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:51.030> legs<00:04:51.240> are<00:04:51.390> kind<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:51.810> to

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
too I mean the legs are kind of to

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.920 
too I mean the legs are kind of to
spread<00:04:52.860> apart<00:04:53.190> but<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.210> does<00:04:54.360> help<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.600> figure

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
spread apart but it does help the figure

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.400 
spread apart but it does help the figure
stand<00:04:55.669> so<00:04:56.669> I've<00:04:57.480> gotten<00:04:57.750> used<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.140> really

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
stand so I've gotten used to that really

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.710 
stand so I've gotten used to that really
going<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.800> like<00:04:58.950> this<00:04:59.130> figure<00:04:59.460> a<00:04:59.490> lot<00:04:59.760> and<00:05:00.150> then

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
going to like this figure a lot and then

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.390 
going to like this figure a lot and then
the<00:05:00.840> belt<00:05:01.080> there<00:05:01.380> is<00:05:01.410> just<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.860> silver<00:05:02.100> paint

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
the belt there is just a silver paint

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.470 
the belt there is just a silver paint
app<00:05:03.260> not<00:05:04.260> much<00:05:04.500> there<00:05:04.860> this<00:05:05.430> is<00:05:05.669> removal<00:05:06.150> I'm

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
app not much there this is removal I'm

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.730 
app not much there this is removal I'm
not<00:05:06.630> going<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.840> do<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:07.050> just<00:05:07.350> seems<00:05:07.500> like<00:05:07.650> it

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
not going to do that just seems like it

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.930 
not going to do that just seems like it
would<00:05:07.800> be<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:07.950> pain<00:05:09.020> there<00:05:10.020> you<00:05:10.110> guys<00:05:10.290> go

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
would be a pain there you guys go

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.400 
would be a pain there you guys go
it's<00:05:11.940> got<00:05:12.090> some<00:05:12.270> black<00:05:12.510> wrappings<00:05:13.050> around<00:05:13.169> the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
it's got some black wrappings around the

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.310 
it's got some black wrappings around the
arms<00:05:14.000> fingers<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.690> then<00:05:15.960> here's<00:05:16.140> your

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
arms fingers and then here's your

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.920 
arms fingers and then here's your
lightsaber<00:05:17.120> which<00:05:18.120> I'm<00:05:18.300> not<00:05:18.390> sure<00:05:18.630> if<00:05:18.720> it's<00:05:18.840> a

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
lightsaber which I'm not sure if it's a

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.530 
lightsaber which I'm not sure if it's a
new<00:05:19.110> lightsaber<00:05:19.730> but<00:05:20.730> I<00:05:20.760> do<00:05:20.850> like<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.300> black

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
new lightsaber but I do like the black

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.020 
new lightsaber but I do like the black
part<00:05:22.050> in<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.200> middle<00:05:22.380> there<00:05:22.680> I<00:05:22.919> think<00:05:23.820> that's

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
part in the middle there I think that's

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.420 
part in the middle there I think that's
nice<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:24.780> then<00:05:25.260> you've<00:05:25.410> got<00:05:25.590> your<00:05:25.770> green<00:05:25.980> hilt

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
nice and then you've got your green hilt

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.040 
nice and then you've got your green hilt
which<00:05:26.850> is<00:05:27.060> not<00:05:27.210> removable<00:05:27.600> from<00:05:27.870> that

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
which is not removable from that

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.820 
which is not removable from that
mistaken<00:05:28.500> okay

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.610 

so<00:05:31.830> I<00:05:32.040> think<00:05:32.190> it's<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.550> really<00:05:32.880> cool<00:05:33.180> looking

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
so I think it's a really cool looking

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.530 
so I think it's a really cool looking
representation<00:05:34.620> of<00:05:34.770> Luke<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.430> with<00:05:36.090> one<00:05:36.390> that

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
representation of Luke and with one that

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.770 
representation of Luke and with one that
I'm<00:05:36.660> really<00:05:36.690> happy<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.260> add<00:05:37.410> to<00:05:37.620> my<00:05:37.740> EU<00:05:38.130> shelf
