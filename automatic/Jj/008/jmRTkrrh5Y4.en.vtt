00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.750
 make-up part of the last week i 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.490
 I know that many of them are also with the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.619
 autumn dark and red lipstick 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.900
 maybe connecting colors 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.970

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.320
 he just this ox blood red what he 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.630
 extreme is a bit of a nasty 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.090
 expression also or raspberry 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.830
 blackberry or just these wines red 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.929
 lips and there it is always special 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.820
 difficult just make an eye make up 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.800
 find something that fits well and in the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.989
 connection is not too much, that is now 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.940

 the palette I have is very good 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.510
 This part is taken by bobby brown 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.719
 you only need four colors 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.850
 it even goes with 33 brown levels and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.250
 the last relatively dark so almost one 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.320
 fun a light brown and medium brown 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.059
 and just a highlighter 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.340
 or something to blind you 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.809

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.000

 Do you see all the products again 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.020

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.720
 palette my concealer of clinic the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.970
 artic sea shadow base the mat 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.490
 foundation of astor the mats 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.700
 eyeshadow the browser only very completely 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.450
 Already the medium of mac in the little 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.780
 color supernova the clear facebook my 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.700
 dearest then a highlight a mascara 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.250
 and of course the lipstick all over 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.909
 important on the nails I wear 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.399
 By the way, it's chris of this 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.679
 tutorial the focus is on the lips 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.810
 they should look especially well-kept 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.880
 Best removes old skin cells 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.130
 in front of with a toothbrush and used 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.410
 then a lip balm next 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.150
 I use my foundation from Astor 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.280
 the matte foundation in the brightest 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.670
 color I wear with the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.670
 fingering 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.350
 Next, I'll take the even better 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.990
 concealer of clinic also in the 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.310
 brightest color and lightly patted him in 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.530
 my dark circles 1 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.660
 then I think of others 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.730
 either small blemishes or 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.430
 just redness then comes the clear 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.800
 facebooker from manhattan klier face and 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.500
 I use a broad and very 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.420
 fluffy powder brush you should but 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.370
 Be careful that the face is not closed 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.370
 Katie does not look like her 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.530
 covering everything too hard 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.750
 Next I'll wear the shadow 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.000
 base of adecco on an absolute 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.690
 recommendation from me on the upper lid 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.390
 and also a little under the eye 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.130
 with the browser of babor i care for 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.220
 but you should have a small contour 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.840
 really very economical with it 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.970
 I recommend you for this look 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.190
 very strong red or pink 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.830
 place here the mini-plus of mac in the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.480
 color supernova as you see associations 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.400
 I do it again but extra because that 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.460
 Otherwise, simply put on 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.740
 I also recommend this time 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.140
 you a hai head of the gold he stings 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.550
 or yellowish is we will too 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.930
 again as a small highlight 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.930
 use for the lips 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.460
 then comes my bobby brown jug range 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.170
 Here you can also say like the 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.600
 to use ewald palette 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.150
 and I wear the brightest brown first 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.890
 I'm just using this tone 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.050
 essens brush from the new range 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.520
 But you can do a flat separator 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.520
 Use brasch from every brand 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.049
 do not forget anything about the color 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.819
 wear under the eye then take 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.519
 Make a blindfold brush and take the 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.200
 second half color that makes you up 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.060
 the brush and spreads it quite loose 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.769
 in the eyelid and blinds the am 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.769
 best already well up 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.100
 next you use with the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.530
 same brush a matte color the on 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.209
 best your skin color corresponds to the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.890
 you also find in la to their distress 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.410
 palette or you use here like me 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.570
 only eyeshadow from manhattan essens 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.070
 also has an assortment with it 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.510
 you best blind the colors 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.410
 times together and hey people the 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.570
 eyebrows 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.010
 then you take your darkest brown it 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.150
 but it can also be a dull black 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.740
 and you give something deeper in the eye 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.570
 Incidentally, I use it for a pence 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.790
 airbrush from the assortment of zuewa 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.590
 then I take my kaya of max 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.590
 factor and blacken the waterline 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.920
 with my currently favorite mascara 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.630
 from make-up factory I ink myself 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.630
 eyelashes twice up and down 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.949
 then finally comes the lipstick 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.229
 I use the color here 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.060
 that was from mac with a matte finish 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.819
 but you can also do media for example 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.009
 take or just a color from one 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.900
 completely different assortment at patrice or 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.360
 at p2 you will definitely be 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.610
 I do it with a lip 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.650
 brush because that's not the case in this case 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.229
 has a strong color and much 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.639
 one should become more defined and cleaner 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.590
 really pay attention when you do such a thing 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.479
 used strong intense colors 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.879
 the disadvantage is of course that you at 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.520
 make-up in the restaurant or in the 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:41.529
 Best practice a lipstick one 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.289
 brush and of course a hand mirror 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:45.729
 you have something nice to the result 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.080
 but also less 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.940
 Durable I give something else 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.980
 lip balm over it 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.020
 now comes the said highlighter 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.450
 again for use and thus emphasize 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.430
 I the little column over the upper lip 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.040
 That's where the lip make-up comes from 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.660
 more to the validity yes that is the finished 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.440
 results you see me now again 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.730
 before 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.440
 I think that definitely one 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.090
 autumnal transformation worthwhile 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.460
 and I hope the tutorial has you 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.350
 like 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.020
 please leave your comments and 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.330
 feedback because like new video chris 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.250
 I link you now a video 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.050
 that you can watch if that 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.389
 you have not done anything outside 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.250

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.610
