00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
have done this a little bit earlier you

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.610 
have done this a little bit earlier you
look<00:03:51.670> at<00:03:51.819> a<00:03:51.849> client's<00:03:52.409> technology<00:03:53.409> and

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
look at a client's technology and
