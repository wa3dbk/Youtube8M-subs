tonight last night we lost about one

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.280 
tonight last night we lost about one
point<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.480> teams<00:00:33.690> working<00:00:33.899> really<00:00:34.170> hard

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
point so the teams working really hard

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020

fighting<00:00:34.770> really<00:00:35.040> hard<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.850> matter

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
fighting really hard it's just a matter

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.549 
fighting really hard it's just a matter
of<00:00:36.120> changing<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.690> momentum<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.230> those<00:00:37.350> three

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
of changing the momentum on those three

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.229 
of changing the momentum on those three
all<00:00:37.649> points<00:00:38.010> that's<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> beauty<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> Team

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
all points that's the beauty of Team

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.240 
all points that's the beauty of Team
Tennis<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.660> think<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> system<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.559> well

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
Tennis I think the system is so well

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.130 
Tennis I think the system is so well
done<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.329> matches<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.809> really

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
done that the matches can be really

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.290 
done that the matches can be really
close<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.399> difference<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> matches

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
close and the difference in the matches

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.270 
close and the difference in the matches
so<00:00:45.629> maybe<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:46.500> three<00:00:46.739> or<00:00:46.829> point<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so maybe that one three or point that

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.250 
so maybe that one three or point that
you<00:00:47.370> win<00:00:47.550> or<00:00:48.030> tonight<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.960> your<00:00:49.020> point

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you win or tonight the one to your point

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.569 
you win or tonight the one to your point
that<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.440> lose<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.890> that's<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> real

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
that you lose and that's the real

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
that you lose and that's the real
difference<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.059> think<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.379> always<00:00:52.649> seem

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
difference I think and you always seem

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.709 
difference I think and you always seem
to<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:53.399> intense<00:00:53.879> matches<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
to have very intense matches with the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.110 
to have very intense matches with the
sport<00:00:55.020> times<00:00:55.289> how<00:00:56.129> awesome<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> have

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
sport times how awesome is it to have

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.639 
sport times how awesome is it to have
your<00:00:57.390> teammates<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.960> court<00:00:58.260> with<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
your teammates on court with you and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.380 
your teammates on court with you and
really<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> team<00:01:00.090> supporting

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
really have you know a team supporting

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.160 
really have you know a team supporting
you<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.230> don't<00:01:01.440> necessarily<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.309> in

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
you that you don't necessarily get in

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.620 
you that you don't necessarily get in
regular<00:01:04.170> tournaments<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.820> think<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
regular tournaments I think that for a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.120 
regular tournaments I think that for a
sport<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.080> tennis<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.710> normally<00:01:08.040> an

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
sport like tennis which is normally an

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.710 
sport like tennis which is normally an
individual<00:01:08.610> sport<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.479> team

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
individual sport to get a team

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
individual sport to get a team
atmosphere<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.380> wonderful<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.670> see

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
atmosphere is wonderful you see

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
atmosphere is wonderful you see
different<00:01:12.270> personalities<00:01:12.810> come<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
different personalities come out on the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.980 
different personalities come out on the
court<00:01:14.159> off<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.400> court<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> help<00:01:15.840> each

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
