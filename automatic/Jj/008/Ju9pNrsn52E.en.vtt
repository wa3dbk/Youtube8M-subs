00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
is a lot simpler than doing it per user

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.050 
is a lot simpler than doing it per user
because<00:03:54.650> someday<00:03:55.100> down<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.549> track<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:55.790> might

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
because someday down the track you might

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.250 
because someday down the track you might
not<00:03:56.239> want<00:03:56.810> finance<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.410> be<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.530> domain<00:03:57.799> admin

so let's create a computer now we'll
right<00:04:41.500> click<00:04:41.530> on<00:04:41.980> here<00:04:42.310> new<00:04:44.220> computer<00:04:45.750> I'll

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
right click on here new computer I'll

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:56.430 
right click on here new computer I'll
call<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:47.230> computer<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:49.210> then<00:04:50.850> Windows<00:04:55.440> now

call this computer and then Windows now
if<00:04:56.560> this<00:04:56.710> was<00:04:56.920> a<00:04:56.950> pre<00:04:57.690> 2002<00:04:58.690> computer<00:05:00.360> we'd<00:05:01.360> do

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
if this was a pre 2002 computer we'd do

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.900 
if this was a pre 2002 computer we'd do
that<00:05:01.720> which<00:05:02.020> hopefully<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:02.920> don't<00:05:03.250> have<00:05:03.400> pre

later<00:05:24.010> on<00:05:24.190> I'll<00:05:24.310> show<00:05:24.340> you<00:05:24.550> how<00:05:24.700> to<00:05:24.760> add<00:05:25.090> this

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
later on I'll show you how to add this

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.060 
later on I'll show you how to add this
when<00:05:25.780> you<00:05:25.870> actually<00:05:25.990> add<00:05:26.350> a<00:05:26.380> computer<00:05:26.890> to<00:05:27.040> a

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
when you actually add a computer to a

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.270 
when you actually add a computer to a
domain<00:05:27.130> or<00:05:27.760> install<00:05:28.660> one<00:05:28.980> it's<00:05:29.980> good<00:05:30.130> for

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
domain or install one it's good for

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.330 
domain or install one it's good for
actually<00:05:30.550> installing<00:05:30.880> computers<00:05:31.390> by<00:05:31.510> WDS<00:05:32.340> but

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
actually installing computers by WDS but

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.120 
actually installing computers by WDS but
anyway<00:05:33.640> we'll<00:05:34.030> get<00:05:34.150> onto<00:05:34.360> that<00:05:34.600> another<00:05:34.870> day

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
anyway we'll get onto that another day

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.070 
anyway we'll get onto that another day
so<00:05:36.130> there's<00:05:36.280> how<00:05:36.430> you<00:05:36.490> create<00:05:36.820> a<00:05:36.850> computer<00:05:37.570> but

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
so there's how you create a computer but

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.300 
so there's how you create a computer but
when<00:05:38.200> you<00:05:38.290> join<00:05:38.500> a<00:05:38.530> computer<00:05:39.040> to<00:05:39.160> the<00:05:39.280> domain

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
when you join a computer to the domain

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.660 
when you join a computer to the domain
it'll<00:05:40.030> create<00:05:40.270> itself<00:05:40.690> anyway<00:05:41.080> here<00:05:41.520> sell<00:05:42.520> out

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
it'll create itself anyway here sell out

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.420 
it'll create itself anyway here sell out
my<00:05:42.820> other<00:05:43.000> computer<00:05:43.890> which<00:05:44.890> is<00:05:45.040> actually

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
my other computer which is actually

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.160 
my other computer which is actually
powered<00:05:45.730> down<00:05:46.180> at<00:05:46.450> the<00:05:46.540> minute<00:05:47.880> resume<00:05:48.880> it

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.170 
powered down at the minute resume it

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.290 
powered down at the minute resume it
yeah<00:05:51.150> go<00:05:52.150> back<00:05:52.360> to<00:05:52.570> the<00:05:52.660> server

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
yeah go back to the server

much about a modern light using them I
like<00:06:08.590> to<00:06:08.740> create<00:06:08.950> my<00:06:09.070> own<00:06:10.020> but<00:06:11.020> as<00:06:11.110> you<00:06:11.260> see

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440

like<00:06:11.650> if<00:06:11.800> we<00:06:12.010> look<00:06:12.370> at<00:06:12.520> users<00:06:12.910> properties

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
like if we look at users properties

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.730 
like if we look at users properties
members<00:06:15.370> see<00:06:15.880> domain<00:06:16.270> users<00:06:16.660> is<00:06:16.810> a<00:06:16.840> user<00:06:17.170> blah

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
members see domain users is a user blah

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.830 
members see domain users is a user blah
blah<00:06:17.890> blah<00:06:18.130> so<00:06:18.910> those<00:06:19.180> are<00:06:19.360> the<00:06:19.450> ones<00:06:19.600> they<00:06:19.810> use

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.830 

I<00:06:25.780> think<00:06:26.350> that's<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.710> for<00:06:26.740> today<00:06:27.480> but<00:06:28.480> let's<00:06:28.660> go

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
I think that's it for today but let's go

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.130 
I think that's it for today but let's go
over<00:06:29.170> a<00:06:29.200> couple<00:06:29.380> of<00:06:29.590> things<00:06:31.140> organizational

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
over a couple of things organizational

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.700 
over a couple of things organizational
units<00:06:32.500> our<00:06:33.460> administrative<00:06:34.500> containers<00:06:35.500> that

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
units our administrative containers that

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.310 
units our administrative containers that
collect<00:06:36.130> objects<00:06:36.810> sharing<00:06:37.810> similar

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
collect objects sharing similar
