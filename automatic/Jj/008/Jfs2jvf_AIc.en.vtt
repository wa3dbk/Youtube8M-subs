00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230

to<00:00:48.210> play<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.570> when<00:00:48.719> my<00:00:48.870> roster<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.320> just

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
to play it when my roster is just

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
to play it when my roster is just
completely<00:00:49.649> at<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> disadvantage<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.270> I've

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
completely at a disadvantage so I've

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.910 
completely at a disadvantage so I've
been<00:00:51.570> trying<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> build<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.559> much<00:00:52.680> as<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
been trying to build it up as much as I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.830 
been trying to build it up as much as I
can<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.280> feel<00:00:53.430> pretty<00:00:53.789> confident<00:00:54.329> about<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.690> now

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
can I feel pretty confident about it now

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.080 
can I feel pretty confident about it now
I'm<00:00:55.079> still<00:00:55.320> only<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:55.800> an<00:00:55.920> 86<00:00:56.460> or<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.820> but

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I'm still only out like an 86 or so but

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.119 
I'm still only out like an 86 or so but
anyway<00:00:57.899> though<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.379> still<00:00:58.710> think<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:58.949> I'm

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
anyway though I still think that I'm

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.549 
anyway though I still think that I'm
decent<00:00:59.399> enough<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.420> play<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.199> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
decent enough to actually play as you

decent enough to actually play as you

guys see here my team did pretty okay on
defense<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.129> game<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.519> that's<00:01:06.240> really

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
defense in this game and that's really

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.420 
defense in this game and that's really
what<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:06.900> worried<00:01:07.409> about<00:01:07.470> my<00:01:07.830> offense<00:01:08.280> I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
what I'm worried about my offense I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.280 
what I'm worried about my offense I
don't<00:01:08.640> necessarily<00:01:09.270> need<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> superstars

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
don't necessarily need the superstars

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.920 
don't necessarily need the superstars
for<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:10.860> my<00:01:11.010> defense<00:01:11.460> because<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.810> only

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
for but my defense because I can only

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.990 
for but my defense because I can only
control<00:01:13.320> one<00:01:13.560> player<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.010> defense<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.700> makes

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
control one player on defense it makes

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.510 
control one player on defense it makes
it<00:01:15.119> really<00:01:15.270> tough<00:01:15.799> because<00:01:16.799> these<00:01:16.950> guys<00:01:17.220> they

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
it really tough because these guys they

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.910 
it really tough because these guys they
like<00:01:17.759> they'll<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.540> allow<00:01:19.140> players<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.680> get

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
like they'll just allow players to get

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.830 
like they'll just allow players to get
open<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.790> some<00:01:21.000> reason<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.600> game<00:01:21.810> I
