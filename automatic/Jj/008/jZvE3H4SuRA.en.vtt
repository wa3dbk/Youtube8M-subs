skywriting<00:01:45.479> guys<00:01:46.220> really<00:01:47.220> curious<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> see

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
skywriting guys really curious to see

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.899 
skywriting guys really curious to see
the<00:01:47.820> quality<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.420> these<00:01:48.600> guys<00:01:49.640> right<00:01:50.640> off<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the quality of these guys right off the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.690 
the quality of these guys right off the
bat<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:52.110> doesn't<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:53.040> much<00:01:53.070> weight

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
bat it doesn't really have much weight

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.580 
bat it doesn't really have much weight
to<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.299> mean<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.750> weighted<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.470> not

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
to it I mean it's weighted but it's not

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.670 
to it I mean it's weighted but it's not
super<00:01:56.040> heavy<00:01:56.360> as<00:01:57.360> far<00:01:57.570> as<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> detail<00:01:58.290> you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
super heavy as far as you detail you

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.080 
super heavy as far as you detail you
really<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.549> see<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.479> fur<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.700> paint<00:02:02.969> is

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
really like see is fur the paint is

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.810 
really like see is fur the paint is
really<00:02:03.390> good<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:04.009> lot<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.040> complaints<00:02:05.460> people

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
really good a lot of complaints people

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.910 
really good a lot of complaints people
are<00:02:05.909> making<00:02:06.090> or<00:02:06.570> about<00:02:06.840> these<00:02:07.110> clear<00:02:07.530> things

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
are making or about these clear things

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.279 
are making or about these clear things
that<00:02:08.700> are<00:02:08.849> pretty<00:02:09.090> much<00:02:09.209> basing<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> figures

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
that are pretty much basing the figures

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.380 
that are pretty much basing the figures
people<00:02:10.709> don't<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.849> mean

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
people don't like that but I mean

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.570 
people don't like that but I mean
I<00:02:12.450> guess<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.620> needed<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.220> figure<00:02:14.460> to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
I guess it's needed for the figure to

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.390 
I guess it's needed for the figure to
hold<00:02:14.730> some<00:02:14.940> sort<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.330> position<00:02:16.250> instead<00:02:17.250> of

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
hold some sort of position instead of

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.830 
hold some sort of position instead of
just<00:02:17.520> standing<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:17.970> its<00:02:18.150> feet<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:18.630> all<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
just standing on its feet like all the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.390 
just standing on its feet like all the
other<00:02:19.080> figure<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.620> companies<00:02:22.280> here's<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
bottom this is where basically the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.240 
bottom this is where basically the
gamepad<00:02:27.900> needs<00:02:28.290> everything<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.980> stores
