00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
to all this set up with maybe punch it

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.960 
to all this set up with maybe punch it
can<00:01:16.619> run<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> mice<00:01:17.159> using<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.520> good<00:01:17.670> camera

can run of the mice using a good camera

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.880 
can run of the mice using a good camera
to<00:01:18.060> record<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.470> there's<00:01:19.619> no<00:01:19.680> bad

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
this basically can go to wherever you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.480 
this basically can go to wherever you
think<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.750> imagination<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.590> go<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> so

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
think that your imagination can go to so

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.639 
think that your imagination can go to so
then<00:01:44.939> once<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.390> hardly<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.560> just

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
then once we but hardly see but it just

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
then once we but hardly see but it just
sets<00:01:46.829> up<00:01:46.979> there<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.420> it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
sets up there and then you can have it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.990 
sets up there and then you can have it
wrong<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.140> these<00:01:49.740> also<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.850> move

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
wrong like that these also can move

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.700 
wrong like that these also can move
independently<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:52.110> well<00:01:52.290> eyes<00:01:52.409> do<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.649> have

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
independently as well eyes do you have

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.380 
independently as well eyes do you have
some<00:01:52.979> test<00:01:53.250> footage<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.640> us<00:01:53.820> here<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
some test footage of us here this is a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.600 
some test footage of us here this is a
very<00:01:54.540> very<00:01:54.810> quick<00:01:54.990> run<00:01:55.200> overview<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:56.100> us<00:01:56.310> here

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
very very quick run overview of us here

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.149 
very very quick run overview of us here
just<00:01:57.149> set<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.409> wheels<00:01:58.590> basically

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
just set that up so the wheels basically

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.819 
just set that up so the wheels basically
don't<00:01:59.369> touch<00:01:59.579> that<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.500> see<00:02:01.680> just

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
don't touch that as if you can see just

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.139 
don't touch that as if you can see just
to<00:02:01.950> be<00:02:02.040> small<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.310> dense<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
to be small and dense just that's a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.030 
to be small and dense just that's a
wheelset<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:04.229> don't<00:02:04.439> let<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.829> wheels

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
wheelset and just don't let the wheels

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.730 
wheelset and just don't let the wheels
touch<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.960> make<00:02:07.140> sure<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.530> logs

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
touch and then just make sure that logs

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.100 
touch and then just make sure that logs
are<00:02:07.920> very<00:02:08.190> very<00:02:08.399> tight<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:09.179> simple<00:02:09.539> that

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
are very very tight just simple that

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.930 
are very very tight just simple that
means<00:02:10.289> i'm<00:02:10.440> gonna<00:02:10.590> offer<00:02:10.649> offer<00:02:10.979> empty<00:02:11.370> this

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
means i'm gonna offer offer empty this

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.340 
means i'm gonna offer offer empty this
here<00:02:12.150> but<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.330> means<00:02:12.450> there

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
here but it means there

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.590 
here but it means there
that<00:02:13.530> as<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.710> can<00:02:13.830> see<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:14.790> do<00:02:14.970> complete

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
that as you can see you can do complete

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.480 
that as you can see you can do complete
full<00:02:15.870> circles<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:17.040> means<00:02:17.220> if<00:02:17.280> you've<00:02:17.370> got<00:02:17.460> a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
full circles so means if you've got a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.560 
full circles so means if you've got a
products<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.030> middle<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.330> put<00:02:18.480> your

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
products in the middle you put your

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.350 
products in the middle you put your
camera<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.280> put<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.520> on<00:02:20.730> what<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.210> will

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
camera on it and put it on what I will

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.380 
camera on it and put it on what I will
say<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.630> if<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.960> are<00:02:21.990> taking<00:02:22.730> your<00:02:23.730> camera<00:02:24.210> off

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
say is if you are taking your camera off

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.210 
say is if you are taking your camera off
the<00:02:24.570> top<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.990> here<00:02:25.290> how'd<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:25.950> just

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
the top of this here how'd you do just

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.250 
the top of this here how'd you do just
make<00:02:26.250> sure<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.580> hold<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.080> because<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.200> just

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
make sure and hold it because it just

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.750 
make sure and hold it because it just
basically<00:02:28.500> can't<00:02:28.920> fall<00:02:29.100> off<00:02:29.130> very<00:02:29.460> very<00:02:29.610> easy

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
basically can't fall off very very easy

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.300 
basically can't fall off very very easy
and<00:02:30.120> if<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.600> do<00:02:30.720> have<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.960> really<00:02:31.740> really<00:02:31.920> heavy

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
and if you do have a really really heavy

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.420 
and if you do have a really really heavy
digital<00:02:32.820> SLR<00:02:33.360> SLR<00:02:33.990> on<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.860> do<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.220> this

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
digital SLR SLR on and you do have this

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.420 
digital SLR SLR on and you do have this
sitting<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.270> way<00:02:36.360> way<00:02:36.540> out<00:02:36.570> at<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> front<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
sitting the way way out at the front the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.740 
sitting the way way out at the front the
whole<00:02:38.610> thing<00:02:38.850> Mississippi<00:02:39.270> can<00:02:39.450> become

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
whole thing Mississippi can become

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.810 
whole thing Mississippi can become
top-heavy<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.280> make<00:02:41.430> sure<00:02:41.460> probably

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
top-heavy so just to make sure probably

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.010 
top-heavy so just to make sure probably
better<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.300> something<00:02:42.630> on<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> bike

it<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.200> was<00:03:07.380> heavy<00:03:07.590> heavy<00:03:07.830> digital<00:03:08.280> SLR<00:03:08.820> make

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
it I was heavy heavy digital SLR make

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.270 
it I was heavy heavy digital SLR make
sure<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.660> put<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.870> certain<00:03:10.230> near<00:03:10.470> its<00:03:10.620> center

sure and put a certain near its center

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.150 
sure and put a certain near its center
of<00:03:11.430> gravity<00:03:11.490> there<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.450> two<00:03:13.230> older<00:03:13.500> holes<00:03:13.800> and

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
of gravity there is two older holes and

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.860 
of gravity there is two older holes and
here<00:03:14.520> in<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.640> middle<00:03:14.790> as<00:03:14.940> well<00:03:15.120> as<00:03:15.570> you<00:03:15.720> come
