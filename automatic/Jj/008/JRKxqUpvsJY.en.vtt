I<00:00:14.650> see<00:00:15.650> there<00:00:15.889> being<00:00:16.279> two<00:00:16.910> big<00:00:17.630> benefits<00:00:18.140> to

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
I see there being two big benefits to

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.370 
I see there being two big benefits to
being<00:00:18.410> a<00:00:18.500> small<00:00:18.739> independent<00:00:19.579> developer<00:00:20.380> one

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
being a small independent developer one

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.079 
being a small independent developer one
of<00:00:21.499> them<00:00:21.650> is<00:00:21.769> that<00:00:21.800> you<00:00:22.009> get<00:00:22.310> to<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:22.999> they're

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:23.089 
of them is that you get to and they're

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.870 
of them is that you get to and they're

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
of it is that you get to decide exactly

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.679 
of it is that you get to decide exactly
what<00:00:28.159> you're<00:00:28.339> going<00:00:28.489> to<00:00:28.609> do<00:00:28.729> right<00:00:29.149> if<00:00:29.359> we<00:00:29.509> were

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.399 
good in the ball started rolling like as
soon<00:01:55.969> as<00:01:56.119> we<00:01:56.240> did<00:01:56.329> that<00:01:56.389> I<00:01:56.569> said<00:01:56.929> hey<00:01:57.049> we<00:01:57.170> want<00:01:57.200> a

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
soon as we did that I said hey we want a

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.440 
soon as we did that I said hey we want a
kit<00:01:57.619> right<00:01:57.829> now<00:01:58.009> because<00:01:58.579> like<00:01:58.999> I<00:01:59.090> said<00:01:59.149> it's<00:01:59.389> a

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
kit right now because like I said it's a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.059 
kit right now because like I said it's a
much<00:01:59.569> more<00:01:59.719> complicated<00:02:00.049> game<00:02:00.439> than<00:02:00.829> our<00:02:00.950> last

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
much more complicated game than our last

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.679 
much more complicated game than our last
game<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:01.609> there's<00:02:01.789> a<00:02:01.849> lot<00:02:02.029> to<00:02:02.179> do<00:02:02.329> there's<00:02:02.630> a

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
game so there's a lot to do there's a

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.599 
game so there's a lot to do there's a
lot<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.959> think<00:02:02.990> about<00:02:03.229> but<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:04.159> trick<00:02:04.399> is<00:02:04.429> that

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
lot to think about but the trick is that

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.359 
lot to think about but the trick is that
there<00:02:04.939> is<00:02:05.149> there's<00:02:05.509> magic<00:02:06.049> there<00:02:06.099> in<00:02:07.099> the

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
there is there's magic there in the

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.550 
there is there's magic there in the
subject<00:02:07.789> that<00:02:07.939> we're<00:02:08.060> exploring<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.780> because

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
subject that we're exploring and because

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.010 
subject that we're exploring and because
the<00:02:09.740> game<00:02:09.920> was<00:02:09.950> not<00:02:10.250> constrained<00:02:10.790> by

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
the game was not constrained by

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.290 
the game was not constrained by
financial

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
financial

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.460 
financial
fedders<00:02:13.140> we<00:02:13.380> were<00:02:13.500> able<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:14.690> find<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:16.110> magic

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
fedders we were able to find the magic

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.400 
fedders we were able to find the magic
and<00:02:16.650> make<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.980> as<00:02:17.130> good<00:02:17.340> as<00:02:17.760> we<00:02:18.420> possibly<00:02:18.870> could

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
and make it as good as we possibly could

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.980 
and make it as good as we possibly could
and<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:20.610> game<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> multi-layered<00:02:21.690> thing

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
and the game is a multi-layered thing

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.520 
and the game is a multi-layered thing
and<00:02:22.200> every<00:02:23.160> layer<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:24.170> absolutely<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.350> best

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
and every layer is absolutely the best

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.310 
and every layer is absolutely the best
that<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:25.950> know<00:02:26.160> how<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.880> make<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.420> when<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.170> go

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
that we know how to make so when you go

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.980 
that we know how to make so when you go
in<00:02:28.500> if<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.970> are<00:02:30.210> interested<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.870> a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
in if you just are interested in a

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.380 
in if you just are interested in a
puzzle<00:02:31.770> game<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.310> you're<00:02:32.490> not<00:02:32.640> really

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
puzzle game and you're not really

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.590 
puzzle game and you're not really
looking<00:02:33.660> at<00:02:33.930> story<00:02:34.920> or<00:02:35.570> philosophy<00:02:36.570> or

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
looking at story or philosophy or

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.510 
looking at story or philosophy or
anything<00:02:36.990> like<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.140> there<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> really

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
anything like that there is a really

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.790 
anything like that there is a really
good<00:02:38.640> puzzle<00:02:38.820> game<00:02:39.120> there<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:40.080> if<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.650> want

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
good puzzle game there but if you want

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.350 
good puzzle game there but if you want
to<00:02:40.830> read<00:02:41.010> further<00:02:41.520> than<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.940> there's<00:02:42.210> other

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
to read further than that there's other

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.210 
to read further than that there's other
layers<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.900> that's<00:02:43.290> sort<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.800> provision

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
layers and that's sort of that provision

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.530 
layers and that's sort of that provision
for<00:02:44.880> deeper<00:02:45.270> engagement<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:46.530> allows<00:02:47.540> for

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
for deeper engagement that allows for

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.420 
for deeper engagement that allows for
that<00:02:48.690> little<00:02:48.900> bit<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.260> ambiguity<00:02:49.500> or<00:02:50.130> that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
that little bit of ambiguity or that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.160 
that little bit of ambiguity or that
little<00:02:51.210> bit<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.390> like<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.780> didn't<00:02:52.020> totally

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
little bit of like I didn't totally

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.600 
little bit of like I didn't totally
understand<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.860> but<00:02:52.950> then<00:02:53.100> when<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.280> go<00:02:53.400> look

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
understand it but then when you go look

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.890 
understand it but then when you go look
at<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.790> closely<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.180> open<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.600> up<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.780> you

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
at it closely you open it up and you

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.630 
at it closely you open it up and you
discover<00:02:55.230> there's<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.500> cute<00:02:55.890> ton<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.310> stuff<00:02:56.520> in

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
discover there's a cute ton of stuff in
