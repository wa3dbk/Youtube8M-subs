eyeball that's not safe

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.179 
eyeball that's not safe
you<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.900> careful<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.590> I've<00:01:34.770> used

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you have to be careful but I've used

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.630 
you have to be careful but I've used
this<00:01:36.380> underneath<00:01:37.380> my<00:01:39.020> shadows<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:41.189> haven't

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
this underneath my shadows and I haven't

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.210 
this underneath my shadows and I haven't
had<00:01:41.759> problems<00:01:41.939> creasing<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.020> haven't<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.009> I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
had problems creasing I haven't I I

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.550 
had problems creasing I haven't I I
think<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.820> really<00:01:45.090> works<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> primer<00:01:46.140> like

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
think it really works like a primer like

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.830 
think it really works like a primer like
if<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.340> could<00:01:47.520> compare<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.299> primers<00:01:48.659> I've

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
if I could compare it to primers I've

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.109 
if I could compare it to primers I've

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
similar I love that primer that else I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.889 
similar I love that primer that else I
lid<00:02:02.640> primer<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.689> my<00:02:03.780> all-time

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.490 
lid primer is one of my all-time
favorites<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> compare<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.509> which

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
favorites so to compare it to that which

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.930 
favorites so to compare it to that which
I'm<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.129> compare<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.580> because

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
I'm going to compare it to because

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.919 
I'm going to compare it to because
that's<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.330> use<00:02:09.629> all

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
that's what I use all

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.390 
that's what I use all
time<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.920> was<00:02:11.159> harder<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:12.120> use<00:02:13.040> but<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.189> works

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
time this was harder to use but it works

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.470 
time this was harder to use but it works
the<00:02:14.879> same<00:02:16.219> honestly<00:02:17.219> like<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.640> didn't<00:02:17.969> find<00:02:18.180> a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the same honestly like I didn't find a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.330 
the same honestly like I didn't find a

even put over top of shadows now I've

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.559 
even put over top of shadows now I've
never<00:02:33.810> used<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.889> way<00:02:35.159> I've<00:02:35.879> never<00:02:35.939> used

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
never used it that way I've never used

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.809 
never used it that way I've never used
anything<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.109> that<00:02:37.319> so<00:02:37.799> I'm<00:02:38.010> not<00:02:38.430> an<00:02:38.579> expert

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
anything like that so I'm not an expert

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.750 
anything like that so I'm not an expert
in<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.200> category<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.409> am<00:02:40.680> still<00:02:41.129> kind<00:02:41.579> of

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
in that category I am still kind of

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.390 
in that category I am still kind of
playing<00:02:42.000> around<00:02:42.180> with<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.680> but<00:02:43.680> I've<00:02:43.950> used<00:02:44.220> it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
playing around with it but I've used it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.670 
playing around with it but I've used it
a<00:02:44.489> few<00:02:44.519> times<00:02:44.909> enough<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.989> know<00:02:46.200> what<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.560> think

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
a few times enough to know what I think

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.140 
a few times enough to know what I think
about<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:48.389> like<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.290> really<00:02:50.129> like<00:02:50.909> it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
about it and I like it I really like it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.659 
about it and I like it I really like it
it's<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:52.530> know<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.709> have<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.310> know<00:02:53.430> how<00:02:53.609> to

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
it's you know you have to know how to

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.069 
it's you know you have to know how to
use<00:02:53.939> it<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.329> that's<00:02:54.540> one<00:02:54.719> thing<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:54.930> recommend

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
use it so that's one thing I recommend

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.830 
use it so that's one thing I recommend
is<00:02:55.500> maybe<00:02:56.370> watch<00:02:56.700> some<00:02:56.730> people<00:02:57.329> have<00:02:57.540> they<00:02:57.780> do

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
is maybe watch some people have they do

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.759 
is maybe watch some people have they do
and<00:02:58.200> how<00:02:58.349> they<00:02:58.379> use<00:02:58.829> it<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.959> find<00:03:01.530> what<00:03:01.739> works

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
and how they use it and find what works

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.300 
and how they use it and find what works
for<00:03:02.099> you<00:03:02.579> because<00:03:02.879> it's<00:03:03.870> liquid<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.069> don't

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
for you because it's liquid so you don't

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.920 
for you because it's liquid so you don't
want<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.609> get<00:03:05.760> too<00:03:06.060> much<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.299> your<00:03:06.450> eyelid<00:03:06.810> it

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
it goes into your eye you have to be

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.190 
it goes into your eye you have to be
really<00:03:08.730> really<00:03:08.760> careful<00:03:09.329> about<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.629> because

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
really really careful about that because

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.589 
really really careful about that because
you<00:03:10.769> don't<00:03:10.919> want<00:03:11.219> to<00:03:11.280> go<00:03:11.669> in<00:03:11.879> your<00:03:12.000> eye<00:03:12.060> believe

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
you don't want to go in your eye believe

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.869 
you don't want to go in your eye believe
me<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.680> could<00:03:13.889> have<00:03:13.979> happened<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.370> me<00:03:14.549> I<00:03:14.579> will
