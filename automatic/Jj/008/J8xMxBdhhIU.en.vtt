00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
well what's going on around the unit

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.059 
well what's going on around the unit
within<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.239> 15<00:02:29.630> foot<00:02:29.900> diameter<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.590> go<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.800> hear

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
within a 15 foot diameter you go to hear

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.920 
within a 15 foot diameter you go to hear
live<00:02:31.519> conversation<00:02:31.940> what's<00:02:32.510> going<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:32.810> around

live conversation what's going on around
the<00:02:33.110> unit<00:02:33.410> we<00:02:33.980> also<00:02:34.130> have<00:02:34.250> sound<00:02:34.670> activation

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
the unit we also have sound activation

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.880 
the unit we also have sound activation
so<00:02:35.569> you'll<00:02:35.750> be<00:02:35.930> able<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.170> have<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.500> unit<00:02:36.709> call

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
so you'll be able to have the unit call

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.759 
so you'll be able to have the unit call
you<00:02:37.160> when<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:37.970> detects<00:02:38.299> sound<00:02:38.630> okay<00:02:39.080> that's<00:02:39.620> an

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
you when it detects sound okay that's an

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.150 
you when it detects sound okay that's an
option<00:02:39.950> we<00:02:40.280> will<00:02:40.400> probably<00:02:40.640> integrate

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
option we will probably integrate

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.340 
option we will probably integrate
wiretapping<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.370> wired<00:02:43.580> captain<00:02:44.000> feature<00:02:44.350> so

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
wiretapping a wired captain feature so

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.559 
wiretapping a wired captain feature so
you<00:02:45.380> can<00:02:45.650> take<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:49.150> ethernet<00:02:50.150> connectors

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
you can take the the ethernet connectors

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.120 
you can take the the ethernet connectors
in<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.750> back<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.110> plug<00:02:51.230> in<00:02:51.440> your<00:02:51.590> phone<00:02:51.650> line

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
in the back and plug in your phone line

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.390 
in the back and plug in your phone line
and<00:02:52.720> we'll<00:02:53.720> take<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.989> look<00:02:54.170> at<00:02:54.319> an<00:02:55.010> optional

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
and we'll take a look at an optional

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.280 
and we'll take a look at an optional
upgrade<00:02:55.730> for<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.330> can<00:02:56.569> fill<00:02:57.260> a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
upgrade for that so you can fill a

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.070 
upgrade for that so you can fill a
little<00:02:57.530> bit<00:02:57.680> more<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.420> have<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.540> opportunity

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
little bit more and have the opportunity

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.820 
little bit more and have the opportunity
to<00:03:00.110> wiretap<00:03:01.180> your<00:03:02.180> landline<00:03:02.569> phone<00:03:02.959> okay

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
to wiretap your landline phone okay

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.250 
to wiretap your landline phone okay
using<00:03:04.340> these<00:03:04.519> are<00:03:04.819> eating<00:03:05.540> airports<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.080> will

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
using these are eating airports you will

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.650 
using these are eating airports you will
probably<00:03:06.500> be<00:03:06.709> modified<00:03:07.130> them<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.459> can

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
probably be modified them so you can

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.720 
probably be modified them so you can
plug<00:03:08.660> in<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.959> regular<00:03:09.459> phone<00:03:10.459> line<00:03:10.700> and

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
plug in a regular phone line and

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.030 
plug in a regular phone line and
therefore<00:03:11.180> go<00:03:11.299> to<00:03:11.530> we<00:03:12.530> have<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:12.769> on<00:03:12.950> our

one<00:03:50.560> else<00:03:50.740> because<00:03:51.160> we<00:03:51.310> just<00:03:51.490> came<00:03:51.640> up<00:03:51.790> with

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
one else because we just came up with

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.120 
one else because we just came up with
the<00:03:52.060> idea<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.930> dps<00:03:53.410> our<00:03:53.560> women's<00:03:53.770> equipment

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
the idea and dps our women's equipment

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.670 
the idea and dps our women's equipment
so<00:03:54.760> all<00:03:55.510> our<00:03:55.540> competitors<00:03:56.260> are<00:03:56.380> going<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.590> be

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
so all our competitors are going to be

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.530 
so all our competitors are going to be
scrambling<00:03:57.130> as<00:03:57.340> usual<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:58.000> try<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.240> figure<00:03:58.420> out

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
how to come up with this idea either

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.810 
how to come up with this idea either
duplicating<00:04:00.850> copy<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.770> but<00:04:02.770> rest<00:04:03.490> assured
