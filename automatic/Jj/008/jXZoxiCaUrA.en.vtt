00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 very good to everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.839
 talk about windows 9 this expected and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.730
 special operating system that could 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.790
 see the light in September this same 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.650
 year 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.830
 in this video I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.610
 characteristics the changes in theory 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.570
 that we believe will have this new new 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.910
 system and the security that microsoft has 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.270
 implemented today would feed the mode 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.399
 activation of the good system I'm going to said 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.960
 it is rumored that the windows 9 test 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.960
 could come at some time from this 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.500
 autumn and more specifically in September 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.900
 of this same year 2014 but I still do not know 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.690
 really knows when 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.750
 the previous one would be answered free of charge 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.490
 to test it and quite possibly the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.510
 final pressure is free for 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.609
 manufacturers 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.530
 the vision version is explained 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.730
 end of this operating system could 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 arrive in the first quarter of 2015 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.110
 but you do not know several things by 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.690
 example we do not know yet the real price 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.119
 of this system but although you think 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.380
 that its price will be defined fairly 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.159
 comparison to the other systems 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.030
 previous 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:19.179
 since it is the only systems provider 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.909
 so to speak, you charge for your purchase 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:25.480
 and your attention to buy the system and 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.300
 the support of it 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.890
 it is also believed that this is let 's say the 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.170
 Lowering the price could be a small 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.270
 space the microsoft so that it finishes 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.580
 leaving your operating systems 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.010
 for free 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.470
 even apple has ended giving away the 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.270
 operating systems because of this it is believed that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.550
 Microsoft will come a day when we 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.170
 will have free will not know 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.970
 the minimum requirements that must have 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.640
 in our computer to support this 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.020
 operating system but it is believed that no 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.960
 they will be very different from windows 8 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.690
 since with many changes there 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.790
 more or less they will have the same 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.260
 good requirements let's talk about 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.660
 some of the supposed changes that 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.540
 may have this operating system already 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.760
 one of the main changes and what more 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.710
 Attracts is the return of the start menu 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.290
 it was a tremendous failure they had in 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.390
 windows 8 to remove it in this menu 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.870
 start we would find both the buttons 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.690
 Restart shutdown and the most classic 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.280
 of windows but we would also find 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.900
 access to modern applications 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.060
 the extra applications that 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.280
 implemented in windows 8 also 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.240
 we have the possibility to run the 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.630
 modern applications on the desktop 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.990
 without having to 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.880
 and put it in the background, let's say 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.740
 then we will also have the disappearance 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.090
 from the sidebar of windows 8 where 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.200
 you will find good configuration of 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.490
 system among many other options 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.680
 we would also have one of the changes 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.720
 important good I think it will be 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.390
 important is having desks 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.940
 virtual 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.230
 where we can have several tabs 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.540
 open in different types of 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.900
 desks and I think smart will give you some 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.910
 versatility and certain speed to the system 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.180
 since we will not have so many tabs 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.760
 open on the same desk other than 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.770
 the changes is the arrival of cutting the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.720
 personal assistant windows phones and 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.459
 good another one of the changes let's say the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.200
 basis of the well-known operating system of 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.030
 microsoft sits on the pillars 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.260
 of what is known as legacy code 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.080
 from windows 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.390
 which microsoft let's say he wants 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.959
 renew it by betting strong as we can 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.299
 see by this operating system on 29 the 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.519
 which promises a lot because of the low 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.290
 fixing windows 8 microsoft wants 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.060
 bet strong for this new system 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.480
 operative which leaves much to be desired 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.549
 because it leaves much to be desired the same 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.440
 happened with windows vista and windows 7 in 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.900
 windows vista was not accepted as it has 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.540
 gone with windows 8 and what happened with 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.030
 windows 7 was something revolutionary 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.980
 let's say it was a great system in and had 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.409
 very many extraction even today 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.060
 has a lot of acceptance for me is from 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.409
 the best operating systems together 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.620
 with windows xp here 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:11.430
 Microsoft has been able to create 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.519
 it is believed that windows 9 could be say 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.380
 another windows 7 but at the level because 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.900
 are betting pretty hard or are 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.170
 he thinks they're betting pretty hard 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.030
 Well, this operating system 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.150
 and finally we are going to talk about the 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.240
 security point 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.040
 good the security point of microsoft 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.370
 will implement or implement because 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.370
 really still do not know if he if the 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.699
 final version of this operating system 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:42.250
 will be worth or not worth money but if in 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.919
 event that it will be marketed and adjusted 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.370
 money a new system would be implemented 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.160
 activation in windows 9 in an attempt 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.720
 to stop piracy good how is 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.520
 this 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.590
 microsoft has an intention to finish 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.650
 with the unique alphanumeric password of 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.920
 16 characters which has been used 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.340
 for the whole life of Microsoft sorry 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.440
 of windows to activate or quality 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.580
 the legitimate copy of your systems 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.759
 operational 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.710
 this method has been hacked and continues 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:18.540
 being hacked by tools 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.310
 available on the internet against 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.440
 well, the new system of 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.290
 activation of windows 9 would force to use 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.570
 a libreoft account history after 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.060
 to pay for the license by doing online 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.520
 of downloaded microsoft would be downloaded 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.710
 an installation disk image that 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.420
 if you install it on another machine it would leave 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.340
 to function in the first what 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.280
 would guarantee that only one license 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.100
 single user would run in a 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.440
 machine at a certain time and nothing 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.640
 so far today's video I hope that you 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:53.640
 have liked this little summary of what 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.890
 that could be windows 9 as soon as 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.790
 the previous one to download the download 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.040
 read about a video 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.390
 and looking nothing deeper to 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.190
 what can you see 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.020
 to those who referred to the changes and 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.449
 others and nothing 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.449
 up here the good see you later
