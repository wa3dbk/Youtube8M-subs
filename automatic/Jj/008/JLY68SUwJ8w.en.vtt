all<00:04:31.770> that<00:04:31.920> counts<00:04:32.070> but<00:04:32.370> as<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.580> tough<00:04:32.850> graph

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
this morning important is it to trust

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.590 
this morning important is it to trust
your<00:04:35.310> skills<00:04:35.580> when<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.120> clocks<00:04:36.300> running<00:04:36.390> down

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
your skills when the clocks running down

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.150 
your skills when the clocks running down
like<00:04:36.870> that<00:04:36.990> I<00:04:37.230> definitely<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.860> think<00:04:37.890> that's

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
like that I definitely I think that's

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.410 
like that I definitely I think that's
how<00:04:38.280> we've<00:04:38.490> done<00:04:38.670> well<00:04:38.790> in<00:04:38.940> these<00:04:39.060> last<00:04:39.240> two

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
how we've done well in these last two

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.120 
how we've done well in these last two
matches<00:04:39.810> that<00:04:39.840> we<00:04:40.050> went<00:04:40.410> badly<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.890> I<00:04:40.920> think

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
matches that we went badly and I think

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.470 
matches that we went badly and I think
when<00:04:41.310> we<00:04:41.430> trust<00:04:41.640> our<00:04:41.760> skills<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.150> just<00:04:42.330> stick

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
when we trust our skills and just stick

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.880 
when we trust our skills and just stick
to<00:04:42.600> our<00:04:42.630> basics<00:04:43.020> we<00:04:43.140> end<00:04:43.260> up<00:04:43.380> coming<00:04:43.680> through
