to me is that what connects my work is
not<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> specific<00:00:34.020> medium<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.640> rather<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.360> kind

the concepts of information my work
generally<00:00:41.820> begins<00:00:42.149> with<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.840> question<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
generally begins with a question and the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.160 
question behind this piece actually hit
me<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.730> was<00:00:47.850> sitting<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.750> therapy<00:00:49.140> session

me as I was sitting in a therapy session

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.970 
me as I was sitting in a therapy session
and<00:00:49.789> I<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:50.910> staring<00:00:51.210> at<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.690> print<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.829> wall

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and I was staring at a print on the wall

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.459 
and I was staring at a print on the wall
in<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> office<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.809> noticed<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
in the office and I noticed that the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.700 
in the office and I noticed that the
glass<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.100> was<00:00:56.219> covering<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.030> print<00:00:57.710> hi

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
glass that was covering this print hi

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.119 
glass that was covering this print hi
crack<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.050> as<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.140> was<00:01:01.289> closer<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
crack in it and as I was closer I

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.329 
crack in it and as I was closer I
noticed<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.750> crack<00:01:04.080> was<00:01:04.710> once<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
noticed that in that crack was once a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.899 
noticed that in that crack was once a
single<00:01:05.850> hair<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:07.140> start<00:01:07.439> imagining<00:01:07.920> who

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
single hair and I start imagining who

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.950 
single hair and I start imagining who
care<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.750> might<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.369> where<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.549> they<00:01:11.670> from

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
care this might be where are they from

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.440 
care this might be where are they from
what<00:01:12.960> did<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.260> look<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> decided

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
what did they look like so I decided

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.570 
what did they look like so I decided
that<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.720> should<00:01:15.750> make<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.530> idea<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.430> was

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that I should make this idea that I was

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.120 
that I should make this idea that I was
having<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> piece<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.020> should<00:01:19.259> make<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.409> into

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
having as a piece I should make it into

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.310 
having as a piece I should make it into
a<00:01:20.159> work<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.520> art<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.970> should<00:01:21.540> collect<00:01:21.869> DNA<00:01:22.049> from

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
a work of art I should collect DNA from

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.670 
a work of art I should collect DNA from
strangers<00:01:23.270> from<00:01:24.270> samples<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.140> find<00:01:25.409> in

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
strangers from samples that I find in

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.010 
strangers from samples that I find in
public<00:01:26.040> spaces<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.850> street<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
public spaces on the street in a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.980 
public spaces on the street in a
bathroom<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> bar<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> DNA<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
bathroom in a bar and use that DNA to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.950 
bathroom in a bar and use that DNA to
generate<00:01:31.470> actual<00:01:32.009> portraits<00:01:32.549> based<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.780> what

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
generate actual portraits based on what

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.999 
generate actual portraits based on what
I<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.259> learn<00:01:34.530> from<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.640> data<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.619> started

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
I can learn from that data and I started

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.010 
I can learn from that data and I started
collecting<00:01:38.189> samples<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.090> hair<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.659> public

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
collecting samples of hair in public

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.920 
collecting samples of hair in public
spaces<00:01:40.369> mainly<00:01:41.369> hairs<00:01:41.579> from<00:01:41.700> bathrooms<00:01:42.299> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
spaces mainly hairs from bathrooms and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.109 
spaces mainly hairs from bathrooms and
mainly<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.280> kept<00:01:44.460> noticing<00:01:44.729> them

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
mainly because I just kept noticing them

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.569 
mainly because I just kept noticing them
literally<00:01:45.630> every<00:01:46.110> time<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.320> went<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.070> would

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
literally every time I went out I would

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.490 
literally every time I went out I would
notice<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.000> hair<00:01:48.240> somewhere<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> subway

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
notice a hair somewhere on the subway

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.889 
notice a hair somewhere on the subway
next<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.920> me<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.820> bathroom<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.600> school

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
next to me or in a bathroom at school

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.649 
next to me or in a bathroom at school
and<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.460> here<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> portrait<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.540> was

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
and so here is the portrait that was

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.600 
and so here is the portrait that was
generated<00:01:54.990> from<00:01:55.380> my<00:01:56.810> DNA<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.049> digital<00:01:58.920> form<00:01:59.189> so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
generated from my DNA in digital form so

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.800 
generated from my DNA in digital form so
this<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> three-dimensional<00:02:00.360> model

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
this is a three-dimensional model

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.350 
this is a three-dimensional model
digital<00:02:01.649> model<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.060> see<00:02:06.119> it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
digital model and here you can see it

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.570 
digital model and here you can see it
printed<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.960> physical<00:02:07.469> form<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.399> is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
printed in physical form and so this is

overzealous<00:02:28.360> approach<00:02:29.909> so<00:02:30.909> this<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.269> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
overzealous approach so this is the
