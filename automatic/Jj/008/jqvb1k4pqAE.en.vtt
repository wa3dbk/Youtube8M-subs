 i have a very small box 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.789
 I expected her to be several 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.510
 less behind us 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.510

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:34.200
 top region and serial number 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.640

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:56.129
 the box beat inscriptions 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.489
 just the name of the game and such are the eyes 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.489

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:12.210
 let's open it this box so here 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:15.509
 we see three things to talk about with 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.040
 call of duty cards and read that this 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.500
 card gives and really do not know here with us 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.070
 round on the letter then I think so rank 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.240
 need we have some code and site on 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.759
 which is the length of this card to activate 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.150
 although the cards are stained 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:48.009
 plastics from which make business 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:50.930
 cards are different from us 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:59.420
 notebook one of the main 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:05.170
 heroes we have such a rezinochka like this 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.170
 evil as if he had been in the water 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:18.470
 to give him that opportunity we will do 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:24.650
 we have a notebook in a cage here we have 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.250
 various main plans are so fabulous 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.980
 scheme 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.980
 records drawings instructions some 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:48.370
 unrealistic to make it seem to him 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.370
 that they are straight drawn by the whole pen 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:16.970

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:21.500

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.549
 specially torn pages and at the end 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.549
 we have a pocket 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:38.640
 a small pile of waste paper we have it 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.910
 wasteland or most of these pieces of paper 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.870
 lay between the pages well I pulled everything 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:50.450
 from the amount in the pocket 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.450

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:07.550

 good condition our growing some 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.250
 incomprehensible thing is not even what it is 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:44.120
 then we have matches like matches 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.280
 there is no it's just a piece of cardboard 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.980
 appstore need to burn it present so 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.810

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:58.500

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:06.240
 although the publication is entirely in English 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:10.850
 game by the way, too, in English like this 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:14.990
 as the game takes place in the Russian 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:21.540
 some words are there and our enemies and 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:25.820
 speak something in Russian is not very much 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.820
 they don't speak English in temples 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.590
 can pause and read 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:42.210
