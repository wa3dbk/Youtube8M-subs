00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.319
 what we have here now so what 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 Seeing my face around here is like that 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.020
 especially extreme lights that have in 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.840
 different sizes 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.400
 this is a size of these three 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.690
 The biggest ones in the shop are the ones that make him 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.680
 just as an example here 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.980
 will introduce you 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.919
 what you do not actually make it clear 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.079
 was that on we should be nice 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.910
 halo looks great and there 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.110
 Can you look at portraits relatively well 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.250
 example also gives you a face 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.140
 illuminate there is a whole 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.820
 strange special light and man 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.200
 of course, that's nice too 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.140
 doing right and also the little witch 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.699
 in which it is here in the eyes wanted 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.890
 simply looks good actually a 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.359
 studio product alone because of that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.160
 the whole thing just with electricity 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.300
 works because stream personally at 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.670
 Buy us the comes out of the socket 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.109
 and here you have one on and one 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.190
 Ausschalter is the whole thing once 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.109
 seen as we said we have it in 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.059
 different diameters in your shop 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.140
 that is a size representative of him 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.460
 for everyone else and now I will 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.579
 They took a few more details 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.600
 demonstrate 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.550
 Here we have the heart of the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.329
 Fixing the attachment takes place 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.890
 a game god 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.320
 that means they need one 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.939
 have mockery and with the strategy 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.200
 connection could then just what here 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.399
 to attach 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.049
 which is meant for the non 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.060
 studio photography a bit of what that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.220
 is and then it will be here 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.979
 exists and screwed with this 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.140
 tightened and then the whole thing is too 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.549
 properly attached we have seen that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.079
 whole is also flexible so we have 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.790
 then here where the people are above 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.890
 attached to it we still have here 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.710
 the possibility of over this over 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.869
 this poor 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 to position the light differently 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.560
 you can use this joint here 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.850
 then light in different 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.979
 Bring positions without you now 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.509
 here the tripod from the point of view 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.640
 it has to change somehow so it will be in 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.049
 all directions below how can it as well 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.030
 I can turn it like an axis 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.540
 just over do it easy 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.590
 let go 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 It does not look like that here 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.530
 so down there you can really great 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.180
 things do the back 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.000
 we have the on and off button 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.990
 Until it is not so exciting 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.300
 a little bit the whole year round 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.550
 Associations dentist so on this 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.470
 Torture chair is located and then from above the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.070
 dentist then these lights always under 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.899
 you get terribly why I drink this 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.690
 mind but rarely has made me a 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.600
 little bit 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.280
 Well, anyway, great product 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.250
 you actually see studio product too 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.180
 net so they have to serve electricity 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.010
 Of course, then from the socket 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.310
 get it and so we can do this 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.330
 light very variable has just too 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.760
 set and use and that's just 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.750
 just also studio photographers go there 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.370
 maybe a little bit, too 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.959
 then want to have a special light 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.850
 a very nice thing is being photographed 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.080
 of course up here then through 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.090
 that mouth 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.590
 Everything else would not make sense 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.310
 of course, but just stop it all at once 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.200
 is not necessarily this 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.730
 would like to do portrait photography 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.070
 moment I make that just though 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.810
 that is me good so this aura 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.209
 Of course, it can happen to me around here 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.920
 also use the light for this 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.180
 any objects so how to 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.380
 example now has factual 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.120
 photography power stands beside 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.680
 photographed that is very beautiful is there 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.910
 I can face you for that 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.350
 Of course , it is also possible to use it 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.120
 So also portrait we just stop too 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.860
 For example , life is no problem 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.959
 so that was so now this was him as 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.280
 light in this size we have there 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.720
 are different sizes as in the shop 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.709
 then they must stop let's see what 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.510
 size you need what you need 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.760
 interesting then best for her 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.230
 work is suitable and have fun 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.510
 in order to 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.010
 I do the poetry is out and 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.310
 then we are a bit out 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.310
 the shock
