00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
can see I can just do that and there is

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.440 
can see I can just do that and there is
no<00:03:52.720> any<00:03:52.990> stripes<00:03:53.920> on<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.490> HTC<00:03:54.940> One<00:03:55.060> X<00:03:55.210> screen

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
no any stripes on the HTC One X screen

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.350 
no any stripes on the HTC One X screen
so<00:03:55.630> this<00:03:55.750> is<00:03:55.870> an<00:03:56.170> amazing<00:03:56.530> screen<00:03:57.010> for<00:03:57.550> HTC<00:03:58.209> one

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
so this is an amazing screen for HTC one

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.050 
so this is an amazing screen for HTC one
is<00:03:58.980> white<00:03:59.980> one<00:04:00.190> second<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:00.670> have<00:04:00.820> just

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
is white one second I have just

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.440 
is white one second I have just
something<00:04:01.870> like<00:04:02.050> that<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.470> as<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.190> can<00:04:03.400> see

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
something like that and as you can see

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.810 
something like that and as you can see
there's<00:04:04.450> absolutely<00:04:04.990> nothing<00:04:05.620> on<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.520> HTC

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
there's absolutely nothing on the HTC

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.960 
there's absolutely nothing on the HTC
One<00:04:07.060> X<00:04:07.180> screen<00:04:07.510> so<00:04:08.020> i<00:04:08.320> think<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.400> HTC<00:04:09.700> One<00:04:09.820> X

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
One X screen so i think the HTC One X

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.030 
One X screen so i think the HTC One X
plane<00:04:10.180> is<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.690> better<00:04:11.020> protection<00:04:11.590> than<00:04:11.620> this

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
plane is a better protection than this

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.760 
plane is a better protection than this
screen<00:04:12.400> protection<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:13.240> why<00:04:13.630> do<00:04:14.380> we<00:04:14.560> need<00:04:14.709> to

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
screen protection so why do we need to

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.430 
screen protection so why do we need to
use<00:04:15.070> this<00:04:15.280> one<00:04:15.490> for<00:04:15.670> example<00:04:15.959> okay<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.200> was

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
use this one for example okay that was

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.130 
use this one for example okay that was
the<00:04:17.709> key<00:04:18.100> test<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.609> why<00:04:19.060> Vicki<00:04:19.480> test<00:04:19.720> because

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
the key test and why Vicki test because

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.520 
the key test and why Vicki test because
we<00:04:20.560> have<00:04:20.830> a<00:04:21.160> lot<00:04:21.489> of<00:04:21.520> time<00:04:21.850> some<00:04:22.570> keys<00:04:22.870> with<00:04:23.200> or

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
we have a lot of time some keys with or

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.390 
we have a lot of time some keys with or
HTC<00:04:24.180> on<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.960> get<00:04:26.140> for<00:04:26.350> example<00:04:26.740> so<00:04:27.130> this<00:04:27.280> is

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
HTC on to get for example so this is

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.400 
HTC on to get for example so this is
just<00:04:27.550> amazing<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:28.060> see<00:04:28.240> what<00:04:28.330> yes<00:04:28.630> very<00:04:29.170> some

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
just amazing to see what yes very some

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.520 
just amazing to see what yes very some
glitches<00:04:29.770> where<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.310> this<00:04:30.760> is<00:04:30.910> not<00:04:31.060> stripes

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
glitches where and this is not stripes

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.230 
glitches where and this is not stripes
let's<00:04:32.530> go<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:33.240> this<00:04:34.240> test<00:04:34.840> just<00:04:35.590> now<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.240> let's

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
let's go to this test just now and let's

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.300 
let's go to this test just now and let's
go<00:04:37.390> to<00:04:37.450> this<00:04:37.750> cheat<00:04:37.960> on<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.290> screen<00:04:38.500> in
