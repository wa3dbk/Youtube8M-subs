00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
so some of my research just attempts to

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.470 
so some of my research just attempts to
demonstrate<00:00:23.230> whether<00:00:23.850> when<00:00:24.850> you<00:00:25.030> create<00:00:25.450> a

there in our cases for two and a half

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.680 
there in our cases for two and a half
hours<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.860> they're<00:02:51.700> attentive<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.420> they're
