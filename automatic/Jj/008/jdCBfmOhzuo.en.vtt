tripod down less likely to tip over in
the<00:01:25.170> breeze<00:01:25.409> along<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.490> lines<00:01:26.759> if<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.180> move

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the breeze along that lines if we move

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.569 
the breeze along that lines if we move
down<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.079> the<00:01:28.200> feet<00:01:28.469> of<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.829> tripod<00:01:29.310> they<00:01:29.520> do

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
down to the feet of this tripod they do

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
down to the feet of this tripod they do
have<00:01:29.909> spikes<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:30.840> retractable<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.829> you

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
have spikes that are retractable so you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920 
have spikes that are retractable so you
can<00:01:32.070> spike<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.399> into<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> turf<00:01:33.119> there's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
can spike it into the turf there's

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.719 
can spike it into the turf there's
little<00:01:34.170> rubber<00:01:34.380> bumpers<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.219> can<00:01:35.399> spin

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
little rubber bumpers that you can spin

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
little rubber bumpers that you can spin
then<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.539> hide<00:01:36.750> those<00:01:37.020> spikes<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.560> you're

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
then to hide those spikes if you're

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.219 
then to hide those spikes if you're
working<00:01:37.890> indoors<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.670> manoli<00:01:39.149> amor<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:40.079> maybe

hardwood floors or something like that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.539 
hardwood floors or something like that
but<00:01:42.810> probably<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.530> most<00:01:43.680> unique<00:01:44.009> feature<00:01:44.070> of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
but probably the most unique feature of

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.080 
but probably the most unique feature of
this<00:01:44.880> tripod<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.960> 7150<00:01:46.829> are<00:01:47.399> these<00:01:47.549> two<00:01:47.789> rings

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
this tripod the 7150 are these two rings

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.209 
this tripod the 7150 are these two rings
right<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.320> way<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.590> center<00:01:49.979> column

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
right here and the way the center column

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.700 
right here and the way the center column
moves<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.939> now<00:01:51.509> usually<00:01:51.719> with<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> tripod

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
moves up now usually with the tripod

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.230 
moves up now usually with the tripod
there's<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.399> some<00:01:53.670> kind<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.000> lock

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
there's going to be some kind of lock

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.149 
there's going to be some kind of lock
lever<00:01:54.570> for<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.380> release<00:01:55.679> the<00:01:55.859> center

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
lever for you to release the center

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.770 
lever for you to release the center
column<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.609> pull<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.390> hand<00:01:57.659> and

column you pull it up with your hand and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.330 
column you pull it up with your hand and
then<00:01:57.899> you've<00:01:58.079> got<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.200> replace<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.920> lot<00:01:59.130> or

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
then you've got to replace the lot or

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.060 
then you've got to replace the lot or
some<00:02:00.329> tripods<00:02:00.840> even<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> crank<00:02:01.770> system

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
some tripods even have a crank system

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.310 
some tripods even have a crank system
and<00:02:02.490> man<00:02:03.240> those<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> pain<00:02:04.109> because

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
and man those can be a pain because

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.529 
and man those can be a pain because
oftentimes<00:02:04.859> the<00:02:05.280> cranks<00:02:05.729> will<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
oftentimes the cranks will you know the

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.450 
oftentimes the cranks will you know the
knobs<00:02:06.780> will<00:02:07.079> break<00:02:07.289> off<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> teeth<00:02:08.190> get

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
knobs will break off or the teeth get

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.580 
knobs will break off or the teeth get
chewed<00:02:08.759> up<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.450> forget<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.470> know

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
chewed up because you forget to you know

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.890 
chewed up because you forget to you know
loosen<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.519> tensioning<00:02:12.060> knob<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.840> you

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
loosen the tensioning knob on it and you

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.720 
loosen the tensioning knob on it and you
just<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.500> tear<00:02:13.800> through<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.190> threading<00:02:14.610> on

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
just you tear through the threading on

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.830 
just you tear through the threading on
those<00:02:14.940> things

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
those things

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.990

promaster<00:02:16.349> did<00:02:16.709> with<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.040> unit<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.489> with

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
promaster did with this unit is with

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.089 
promaster did with this unit is with
these<00:02:18.180> two<00:02:18.420> rigs<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.900> works<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.410> with<00:02:19.980> this

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
these two rigs that works like with this

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.100 
these two rigs that works like with this
friction<00:02:20.610> system<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.209> pretty<00:02:21.450> unique<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:21.989> if

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
friction system it's pretty unique so if

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.960 
friction system it's pretty unique so if
I<00:02:22.230> want<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.590> position<00:02:22.830> my<00:02:23.129> camera<00:02:23.489> up<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.760> little

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
I want to position my camera up a little

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.699 
I want to position my camera up a little
bit<00:02:24.120> well<00:02:24.510> really<00:02:24.780> all<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:24.930> got<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.290> do<00:02:25.379> is<00:02:25.500> lift

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
bit well really all I got to do is lift

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.160 
bit well really all I got to do is lift
up<00:02:25.890> with<00:02:26.010> my<00:02:26.190> hand<00:02:26.459> when<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.180> release<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.629> it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
up with my hand when I release it it

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.830 
up with my hand when I release it it
stays<00:02:28.500> okay<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:30.060> will<00:02:30.209> support<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.720> great

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
stays okay and it will support a great

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.680 
stays okay and it will support a great
deal<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.170> weight<00:02:31.440> until<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:32.370> take<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.150> lift<00:02:33.480> up

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
deal of weight until I take and lift up

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.600 
deal of weight until I take and lift up
this<00:02:33.989> top<00:02:34.290> ring<00:02:34.620> when<00:02:34.799> I<00:02:34.830> lift<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.280> up<00:02:35.340> it

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
this top ring when I lift that up it

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.699 
this top ring when I lift that up it
releases<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.150> friction<00:02:36.810> or<00:02:36.900> tension<00:02:37.170> allows

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
releases that friction or tension allows

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.979 
releases that friction or tension allows
me<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.099> position<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.640> wherever<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:39.000> want<00:02:39.299> so

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
