00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.340
 basketball is a sport that 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.130
 you really still do not work it super well 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.800
 in all areas it is a sport that 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.200
 keeps very well not physically yet I 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.030
 I invite you to play 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.699
 basketball will really see that 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.710
 it really is played and what one feels 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.239
 inside really all the people that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.890
 we know basketball we know what 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.760
 we carry inside the blood is a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.500
 sport that one is passionate about and in the end 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.660
 can I really invite you to join in 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.590
 yes 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.590
 to play basketball 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.830
 It is important when practicing 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.240
 any sport really make a 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.240
 very good heating 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.210
 a very good stretch that is 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.280
 important also not to start at once 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.909
 stretching if one has not lubricated well 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.409
 one has not heated up a little on the court 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.820
 for example, when it comes to 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.040
 train always start doing 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.980
 certain warm-up exercises 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.750
 could do upstairs apart or back 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.060
 movement of arms really 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.740
 warms the whole body of first and 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.550
 then we started with 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.020
 stretch minutes 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.750
 in this type of sport is very 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.720
 important that you stay hydrated 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.280
 put on if in one day you have a very 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.890
 strong or you have a very strong match 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.540
 important it is good to be hydrating 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.080
 all day long drink lots of water 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.360
 pure and not drinking coffee is very little 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.930
 tail in that kind of thing and take many 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.930
 rehydrating drinks 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.950
 in basketball we do not carry 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.890
 like the stricter diet that 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.220
 it exists but it is good to always know 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.260
 what things are are better to eat let's say 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.179
 before a very strong match what things 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.130
 are better not to eat them because one of 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.050
 suddenly it does not digest them well then 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.090
 put on if you have a match 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.760
 and it's going to be something very strong and time 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.220
 of lunch that sometimes is not good 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.750
 eat contemplate meat really big 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.610
 because the body does not digest it too 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.860
 then before eating that piece of 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.860
 meat normally what one can do 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.110
 is to get a piece of fish eat 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.150
 pretty pasta the pasta and all the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.010
 carbohydrates at the end of the day of 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.840
 Training games are going to help you 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.270
 because that energy the basis of 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.850
 consuming during training or base 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.070
 using let's say during the game 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.920
 in basketball it is ideal to accompany the 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.200
 training not only ball training and 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.300
 all this but also with gym is 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.730
 very important the weights if one can 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.060
 do weights for legs weights for 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.160
 doing crunches because lumbar arms 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.380
 at the end a work in general of 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.970
 body is going to be very important and it's 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.510
 will help a lot to play better 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.510
 basketball 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.200
 if you want to keep fit by playing 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.630
 Basket is also very important 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.790
 Knowing certain techniques that can help you 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.310
 help improve such as 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.200
 bounce the ball is done with the yolks 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.940
 of the fingers and this part of here 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.550
 always posting down 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.160
 another important thing is how to pull 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.380
 the ball at the time of pulling towards the 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.600
 basket is not just pulling you have to 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.850
 place the ball in your way in your 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.040
 hand and with the other only half holding 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.050
 you do not have to grab it and then at 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.310
 final is almost alone with one and the 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.310
 another only gives a little bit of 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.110
 when pivoting is very important 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.430
 do not be like turning around to see 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.129
 very much one plays a lot of backs 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.260
 then one at the end works a lot with 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.450
 peripheral vision and one has to 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.650
 feel where it is that one has to the 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.650
 person who is not yet defending 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.810
 something that is very important is the 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.660
 repetition in basketball 1 to be able 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.920
 grab the shot the techniques and all one 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.680
 have to repeat and repeat 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.810
 then really when it comes to training 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.730
 you have to work hard in 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.860
 repeat do it the same and what 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.750
 perfecting and then at the time and 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.690
 of the game everything will come out very natural 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.790
 and one has to really train like 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.950
 one plays then already at the time of playing 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.040
 because you already get super things 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.040
 all right 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.229
 in basketball is a team game 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.479
 it is very important that the five that 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.150
 they are playing are in total harmony 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.800
 let everyone know where my partner is going 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.759
 where are you going to cut where will you put me 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.650
 a screen then at the end that we 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.479
 will make us bring better 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.250
 basketball because we're all going to know 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.860
 where is my partner at the time of a 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.460
 pass a cut of anything 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.289
 so in the end we need not to 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.440
 just a person made but throw 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:05.759
 all and that all play together 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.759
 to win that match 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.510
 Dublin and the most important of the 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.639
 news 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.020
 an international newspaper of metro and 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.020
 group united stations
