00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.510
 vehicles 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.870
 they started from the start with 21 we have 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.870
 in front of 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.020
 is the pilot in favorite favorite the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.110
 man to beat on this occasion is not 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.000
 patrick faiers who had prevented 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.070
 the fast try to achieve victory in the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.690
 previous appointment in the Belgian championship 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.059
 runs sporadically in this contest and 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.300
 treats them in principle part as 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.110
 favorite this year they call it finish 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.110
 with the porch 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.350
 the mitsubishi lancer evo center east 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.350
 speech debuting in this rally 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.460
 one of the most powerful vehicles in the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.620
 world of rallies and we see in the images 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.390
 Aveo again the case very quickly 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.520
 but that nevertheless I saw as in the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.620
 third special the clutch stopped 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.620
 work and said goodbye to the race 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.430
 but so much for the first time in a reality 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.850
 debuted 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.600
 in belgium and surprisingly it was placed 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.600
 as a leader 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.620
 to another cancer 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.620
 for 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.469
 or for the one who came from Finland 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.810
 to participate for the first time in a 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.810
 asphalt with asphalt rally in belgium 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.269
 this beni was certainly one of the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.269
 biggest surprises 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.130
 nobody expected to be placed as 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.130
 Leader 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.620
 while another score the sport 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.349
 it started slow pretty slow in 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.489
 beginning but little by little it was 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.970
 acquiring pace and was placed between 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.970
 the first five 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.950

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.280
 besser and in the series vehicles in the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.280
 group n consul was placed as leader 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.260
 that we have another ford 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.209
