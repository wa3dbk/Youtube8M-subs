00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.660
 hi to all dear short orbits fights 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.700
 new noemi and decuman with one I had 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.430
 mine has been present for some time now 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.609
 first video tutorial on how to build 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.680
 accessories 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:32.340
 it was time for both them and me 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:36.090
 too much time too long 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.660
 it's not my fault for other factors 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.950
 of greater cause after the robots and so 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.290
 after shooting a marathon of the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.620
 lord of the rings all 3rd whole 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.390
 the trilogy in full and later 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.980
 having seen the hobbit more than five times 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.500
 they travel waiting to learn by heart 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.260
 all the talk saying so does 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.449
 like my house i apologize and i like about 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.050
 break but you have to do with a 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:09.860
 flat ash from the holy fire mouth 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.860
 or by external contact and this value is 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.260
 I introduce myself here with an accessory 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:23.980
 Tolkenian as I had already said in the 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.790
 video this century of euro for those who do not 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.130
 saw it click a few karst above 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.170
 then I said he made a point 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.270
 the Kenyan accessory and the hammer of 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.040
 thor right here so sorry but the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.080
 thor's hammer I don't want to do it not 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.550
 I want can do it by banishing the talk 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.020
 let's start with tutorial what you are 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:52.060
 I present today it is along the way of child 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.400
 if of non-fraud pills because that 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.759
 made in hobbit version a 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.430
 intimate journey that you see is not there 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.070
 the engravings above are pose 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.640
 no fragrance of spiders written 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.560
 anything 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.570
 already just this line that crosses 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.290
 I don't tell you the lano anymore 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.670
 nothing else good tutorial of course 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.000
 let's start with the things you need 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.000
 arrange 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.830
 always remember first of all 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.260
 to make a paper pattern of the thing that 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.000
 I want this template and I am 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.250
 managed to do it simply by looking 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.110
 from images found on the net 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.480
 let's start drawing on them right away 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.970
 forms that we want to obtain two forms 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.460
 of the complete sword 2 of the handle 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.670
 condensate and two tabs we can 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.600
 so call them half- cut hilt 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.020
 all glued one layer above 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:02.420
 the other is thumb up for the big bang 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.170
 theory about the melting of the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.880
 glue 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.000
 I got help from weights in 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.020
 vinyl to improve grip once 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.990
 dried you will get this result is 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.780
 now go to the lime gouged sandpaper 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.870
 and modeled the whole 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.540
 remember that for the knob and you know 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.360
 where to keep the most protruding corners 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.660
 possible while for the handle and the blade 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.700
 you can also round rli once 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.250
 shape everything as you pass the stucco 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.350
 on all the sword so that after having 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.660
 scratched away all the access you get 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.150
 a smooth and perfect sword to them 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.100
 now we hope then we take again 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.180
 the fine sandpaper to brush up on 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:51.040
 all when and make it perfect past 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.040
 one painted in black spray paint 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.760
 and colored and everything with colors 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.760
 acrylics 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.290
 finally after redesigning the 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.629
 decorations on the handle passed on 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.379
 all the sword a layer of paint 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.379
 transparent 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.109
 and you're done 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:30.720
 because before I had well-defined crimes 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:34.530
 now I didn't do it this way 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.960
 see that it is a little hail this is the 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:42.170
 my face the blade is quite beautiful 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:46.140
 I made it in hobbit size 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.750
 fear the hobbits because what it would be like 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:53.100
 in the hands of a human being 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.020
 google would be like that and not hobbit 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.360
 how would it be bigger 3 while in fact 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.260
 he made it in cuts or pd you can do it 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.690
 bigger 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.700
 you can do it pro small do what you do 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.860
 we want to conclude the video 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.230
 we conclude the children can continue i 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.230
 gentlemen we conclude by suggesting some 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:13.920
 channel channels like that of the same me 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.140

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.850
 recently opened the channel mainly 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:24.510
 it is based on how pebbles based on manga 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.980
 it relies on manga anime related things 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.600
 the world of comics and animation 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.250
