00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
you install the double-a batteries in

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.470 
you install the double-a batteries in
the<00:00:22.740> controller<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.210> get<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
the controller then you have to get the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.660 
the controller then you have to get the
plane<00:00:24.780> together<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.800> if<00:00:25.950> you<00:00:26.070> notice<00:00:26.400> there's

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
plane together now if you notice there's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.490 
plane together now if you notice there's
a<00:00:26.730> little<00:00:26.850> wire<00:00:27.300> type<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.200> attach<00:00:28.470> to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
a little wire type that you attach to

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.670 
a little wire type that you attach to
the<00:00:28.860> plane<00:00:29.100> and<00:00:29.690> there's<00:00:30.690> a<00:00:30.780> piece<00:00:31.110> that

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
the plane and there's a piece that

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.279 
the plane and there's a piece that
attaches<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.399> pole<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.329> touch<00:00:33.570> comes

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 
attaches to this pole you touch comes

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:35.779 
attaches to this pole you touch comes
right<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.860> off<00:00:34.949> you<00:00:35.190> attach<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> the

right on and off you attach it to the
pole<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.930> fill<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.500> water

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
pole you have to fill this up with water

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.000 
pole you have to fill this up with water
or<00:00:38.160> else<00:00:38.700> it'll<00:00:39.090> fall<00:00:39.480> down<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:40.050> once<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.770> set

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
or else it'll fall down now once you set

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.760 
or else it'll fall down now once you set
to<00:00:41.160> play<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.300> lot<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.510> fun<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.290> turn

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
to play it's a lot of fun you just turn

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.040 
to play it's a lot of fun you just turn
on<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:44.010> controller<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.880> then<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.660> two

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
on your controller and then you have two

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.490 
on your controller and then you have two
controls<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:47.550> control<00:00:48.090> speed<00:00:48.720> and<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
controls one control speed and the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.069 
controls one control speed and the
propeller<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.220> other<00:00:50.820> one<00:00:51.059> controls<00:00:51.780> up

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
propeller and the other one controls up

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.840 
propeller and the other one controls up
and<00:00:52.350> down<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.040> beginners<00:00:53.489> there's<00:00:53.790> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
and down now for beginners there's a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.330 
and down now for beginners there's a
beginner<00:00:54.180> switch<00:00:54.540> that<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.410> won't<00:00:55.860> go<00:00:56.100> down

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
beginner switch that it won't go down

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.340 
beginner switch that it won't go down
you<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.760> control<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.180> speed<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.020> learn

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
you just control the speed and you learn

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.930 
you just control the speed and you learn
how<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> use<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:59.100> now<00:00:59.460> there's<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.760> learning

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
how to use it now there's a learning

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.150 
how to use it now there's a learning
curve<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.690> from<00:01:01.290> there<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.070> have

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
curve here from there you can have

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.520 
curve here from there you can have
dogfights<00:01:02.790> you<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.360> attach<00:01:03.660> multiple<00:01:03.899> planes

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
dogfights you can attach multiple planes

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100 
dogfights you can attach multiple planes
and<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.280> will<00:01:05.460> fly<00:01:05.820> around<00:01:06.000> as<00:01:06.329> you<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.840> fly

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
and it will fly around as you see it fly

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.949 
and it will fly around as you see it fly
around<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:08.100> really<00:01:08.819> cool<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.539> can<00:01:09.689> make<00:01:09.810> it

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:09.959 
around it is really cool you can make it

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:12.139 
around it is really cool you can make it
go<00:01:10.079> up<00:01:10.259> and<00:01:10.709> down<00:01:10.829> but<00:01:11.520> there's<00:01:11.729> some<00:01:11.909> things

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
go up and down but there's some things

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.510 
go up and down but there's some things
you<00:01:12.299> need<00:01:12.329> to<00:01:12.509> be<00:01:12.630> aware<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> number<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:13.799> with

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you need to be aware of number one with

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.669 
you need to be aware of number one with
the<00:01:14.670> instructions<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.810> doesn't<00:01:16.259> really<00:01:16.409> tell

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
the instructions it doesn't really tell

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.169 
the instructions it doesn't really tell
you<00:01:16.799> where<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> on/off<00:01:17.369> switches<00:01:17.999> on<00:01:18.149> the

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
you where the on/off switches on the

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.510 
you where the on/off switches on the
plane<00:01:18.569> and<00:01:19.079> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.649> here<00:01:19.889> on<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> bottom

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
plane and you can see here on the bottom

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.340 
plane and you can see here on the bottom
it's<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.819> tiny<00:01:21.119> little<00:01:21.270> switch<00:01:21.749> that<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.049> have

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
it's a tiny little switch that you have

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.249 
it's a tiny little switch that you have
to<00:01:22.560> flip<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:23.039> number<00:01:24.029> two<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.810> had<00:01:25.020> some

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
to flip on number two we had some

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.800 
to flip on number two we had some
problems<00:01:25.560> these<00:01:26.279> wheels<00:01:26.670> tend<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.270> pop<00:01:27.509> out

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
problems these wheels tend to pop out

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.690 
problems these wheels tend to pop out
when<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.259> hits<00:01:28.469> the<00:01:28.679> ground<00:01:28.889> it's<00:01:29.429> not<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
when it hits the ground it's not a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.809 
when it hits the ground it's not a
problem<00:01:30.029> they<00:01:30.630> pop<00:01:30.929> right<00:01:30.959> back<00:01:31.319> in<00:01:31.829> number

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
problem they pop right back in number

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.449 
problem they pop right back in number
three<00:01:33.179> you<00:01:33.749> have<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.469> fairly<00:01:34.979> smooth

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
three you have to have a fairly smooth

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.999 
three you have to have a fairly smooth
surface<00:01:36.029> we<00:01:36.509> tried<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.170> our<00:01:37.319> carpet<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.859> our

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
surface we tried it on our carpet in our

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.099 
surface we tried it on our carpet in our
studio<00:01:38.399> which<00:01:38.609> is<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.789> little<00:01:39.149> puppy<00:01:39.569> and<00:01:39.779> it

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
studio which is a little puppy and it

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:41.419 
studio which is a little puppy and it
would<00:01:40.289> not<00:01:40.409> take<00:01:40.679> off<00:01:40.859> would<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.189> work

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
would not take off would not work

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.580 
would not take off would not work
properly<00:01:41.819> now<00:01:42.479> when<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.779> went<00:01:42.899> outside<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
properly now when we went outside to a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.319 
properly now when we went outside to a
flat<00:01:43.920> surface<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.639> worked

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
you can do now here is the biggest thing

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.719 
you can do now here is the biggest thing
most<00:01:57.359> of<00:01:57.599> all<00:01:57.810> when<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.529> plane<00:01:58.859> stretches<00:01:59.520> out

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
most of all when the plane stretches out

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.440 
most of all when the plane stretches out
it's<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.659> good<00:02:00.989> three<00:02:01.439> feet<00:02:01.679> plus<00:02:02.039> out<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:03.090> need

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
it's a good three feet plus out you need

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.019 
it's a good three feet plus out you need
a<00:02:03.689> very<00:02:04.169> large<00:02:04.619> space<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.729> mean<00:02:05.999> a

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:06.029 
a very large space and what I mean a

large space you need literally about 8

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.350 
large space you need literally about 8
by<00:02:09.450> 8<00:02:09.720> feet<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.280> has<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.150> very

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
by 8 feet so it has to be in a very

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.750 
by 8 feet so it has to be in a very
large<00:02:12.660> room<00:02:12.990> or<00:02:13.320> you<00:02:14.160> could<00:02:14.310> do<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.610> outside

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
large room or you could do it outside

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.640 
we matter room or else oh won't work
properly<00:02:18.810> once<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.960> have<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.290> working

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650

properly it is a fun toy the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.960 
properly it is a fun toy the
instructions<00:02:23.110> say<00:02:23.320> this<00:02:23.860> might<00:02:24.160> nip<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.550> little

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
instructions say this might nip a little

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.090 
instructions say this might nip a little
we<00:02:25.390> crashed<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.930> many<00:02:26.170> times<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.770> held<00:02:26.950> together

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
we crashed it many times I held together

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.460 
we crashed it many times I held together
pretty<00:02:27.340> well<00:02:27.670> but<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.510> comes<00:02:28.750> with<00:02:28.870> some<00:02:29.200> tape

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
pretty well but it comes with some tape

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.740 
pretty well but it comes with some tape
so<00:02:29.800> if<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.280> piece<00:02:30.520> comes<00:02:30.880> off<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.570> can<00:02:31.720> just

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
so if a piece comes off you can just

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.200 
so if a piece comes off you can just
tape<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.350> right<00:02:32.410> back<00:02:32.800> on<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.820> will<00:02:33.970> work

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
tape it right back on and it will work

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.870 
tape it right back on and it will work
well<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.320> age<00:02:35.500> graded<00:02:35.920> 8<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.280> up<00:02:36.400> but<00:02:36.850> I

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
well this is age graded 8 and up but I

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.060 
well this is age graded 8 and up but I
strongly<00:02:37.390> suggest<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.200> parent<00:02:38.680> work<00:02:38.890> with

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
strongly suggest that a parent work with

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.460 
strongly suggest that a parent work with
a<00:02:39.100> child<00:02:39.490> in<00:02:39.730> terms<00:02:40.210> of<00:02:40.390> setup<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.900> playing

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
a child in terms of setup and playing

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.170 
a child in terms of setup and playing
with<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.710> child<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.340> get<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.580> going<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.030> they're
