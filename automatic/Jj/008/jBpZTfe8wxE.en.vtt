00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.759
 the question many clubs always ask 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.880
 why ask for what is a concept 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.800
 a training concept at all important 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.509
 We believe that from the point of view of 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.630
 player is important or 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.940
 interesting is what has the association with 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.039
 me before where does the club and where to go 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.830
 The club brings me, so to speak, the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.260
 play a plan not only that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.230
 dual education system that is school 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.460
 and sport or sport and occupation but 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.189
 if we stay at the sport for the time being 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.739
 that the player knows where they want to go 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.290
 with me what bring me in which 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.000
 age range respectively at and around the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.600
 of course, to be able to implement 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.020
 top down a concept 1 1 system 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.250
 an agreement of football 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.379
 be transported uniformly 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.270
 is communicated 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.480
 of course, every coach has his in 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.730
 his skills were social skills 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.289
 technical component 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.390
 investigative competences always affects 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.059
 Strengthen and weaken or focus 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.930
 but the entire one just has to go away 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.630
 be given 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.640
 and that must be understandable the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.350
 Trainers must be convinced of this 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.080
 its only because of something 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.780
 I am not convinced of life 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.150
 only verbal but also nonverbal that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.119
 is called in the whole must of the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.850
 recognize players that is haching that is 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.310
 my club this is the concept that is 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.540
 the goal and the path looks like that 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.100
 must be communicated by 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.750
 of course, in the club 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.970
 Everyday business from the trainers though 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.820
 also from informal coordinators of 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.210
 responsible in the club the trainer 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.750
 then the club will be implemented 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.850
 means being involved in the concept 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.860
 live this concept everyday and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.560
 need to communicate it again and again 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.200
 the players to the parents and to the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.020
 media but actually constantly in the life 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.909
 pass it on every day 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.149
 but not only the players not only the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.130
 Coaches are important but also the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.079
 entire club is the entire club 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.319
 the presidium is the board 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.629
 behind it is after the end of a youth 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.290
 is the castle or can the thing 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.900
 go further 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.489
 and us is always in the past 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.180
 again noticed that are many 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.849
 unite 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.650
 despite good youth work then at some point 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.900
 sometimes the so-called has come and 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.120
 above then plays the first or above 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.299
 play the pros and our understanding 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.459
 it is because we do not 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.019
 why must that be after the 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.510
 a-youth have an end and 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.980
 accordingly we have due to the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.930
 Chance given to us by our president 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.299
 has and I mean leading now 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.709
 even a poor tree a possibility the 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.379
 have given a chance 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.629
 because of the experiences we in the yes 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.760
 in the last ten or more than ten 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.129
 years in the youth field 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.200
 then to be allowed to implement and to 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.200
 can and live that every day
