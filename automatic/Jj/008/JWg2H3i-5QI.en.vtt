00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.000
 All 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.760
 All errors 

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.500
 All errors in part: 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.320
 Celebrating one 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.900
 Three or less minutes. 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900
 Three or less minutes. Showcase !!! 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.360
 Three or less minutes. Showcase !!! (YOU DO NOT SAY) 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.700
 Waving wings, not hooves, fool. 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.160
 The library looks a little empty today, don't you think? 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.420
 This picture. 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.200
 Signature tune. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.140
 It must be a terrible mistake to pour this pot of water out when the party ends. 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.680
 A clear mistake in Flash, which was to be easily noticed. 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.180
 These cups are once pink, and once transparent. 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.580
 Pinkie's cups might not be enough for her. 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.180
 Cocktail without gravity. 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.400
 We hear Rarity swallow, just before his drink bursts out. 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.140
 Did Twilight sleep on the floor? 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.200
 Pinkie Pie has a replacement invitation. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.400
 A week before graduation. 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.980
 What is the probability that all these bikes will rotate exactly the same way? 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.160
 This apple. 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520
 What would Rarity do with a man's sock? 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.500
 These doors suddenly move to the other side. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.980
 Is Rarity taking Pinkie as a fool? 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.660
 How would a hair pencil write at all? 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.880
 I'm not leaving your eyes. 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.760
 Twilight looks all the way, except for the window in Pinkie's room. 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.060
 Pinkie can't be overlooked so easily. 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.580
 "Is Pinkie Pie here?" 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.360
 She just lives in this house. 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.760
 In fact, it's possible she was the one who hung up the eavesdropping can directly in front of you. 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.460
 Don't make me a long nose, Twily. 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.340
 Transporting the cake doesn't make any sense at all. 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.920
 Why Dash couldn't pick him up and take him to Sweet Milk for ten seconds, 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.740
 than to pass it completely unreasonably across the city? 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.280
 It is not possible for Pinkie not to see at this moment. 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.560
 That's what a real lady whispers. 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.320
 At one point Dash has nothing on his back, then there is a saddlebag. 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.120
 Who among you was waiting for him to sign up. 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.440
 Does Rarity stand on Dash's back? 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.440
 Spike moves, but his shadow doesn't. 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.980
 "... Fluttershy, a pegasus who is afraid of heights, what is wrong with them?" 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.480
 "No!" 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.640
 "I don't have time to deal!" 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.520
 This picture speaks for itself. 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.640
 And as another spell, I conjure up a huge cake! 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.260
 This part is a children's story about how a psychopathic killer falls into madness. 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.740
 Pinkie Pie should seriously consider an application to speak characters. 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.740
 Shaky hoof. 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.240
 "The poor are perhaps a bit exaggerated, don't you think?" 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.560
 Probably yes for Canadian TV. 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.700
 The fact that Pinkie Pie is on the second floor implies that there is a pegasus landing platform. 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.080
 but there is no such platform. 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.040
 "Intellectual." 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.120
 The pebbler rolls up after a single fatal crunch in his nose. 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.700
 "... why is it on the cake I picked up from Sugar Corner: All the best, Pinkie Pie? 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.100
 Oh, is it written there? 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.720
 Dash eats a little cake, but it remains undamaged. 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.200
 Applejack steals Twilight's beanie in some scenes. 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.080
 Everyone here looks weird, but I think Dash will need some physical treatment. 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.560
 Wrong record in part: 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.040
 Wrong record in part: 44 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.300
 Judgment: 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.520
 Judgment: Pinkamena 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.660
 Judgment: Pinkamena (it's time for cupcakes)
