00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:19.790
 I think that I want to match the songbook of the usage memo s today . 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.790
 First, it will remove the objective side and ocular side of the cap 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.250
 then 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.550
 Object with horizontal angle 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:38.820
 It is 1km ahead if it is such a kind of iron tower 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.820
 Put in the field of view of that song eyebrow telescope 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:54.360
 Tip Align while Well here of focus adjustment ring 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.360
 Well then , I would like to look inside the song eyepiece telescope 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.640
 Something like this 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.640
 And turn round and round the design school in this state 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 tar 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:42.159
 The more you drive this, the higher the tracking accuracy. 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.210
 So if say or do I do to match firmly the optical axis of this song axis 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:49.780
 here 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.590
 First one point I'm here Aru Te's but I have a hexagonal hole 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.140
 3 points 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.720
 3 points These 3 holes 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.720
 Turn to adjust 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:10.110
 And when the clamp of this design group is freed and the design wheel is turned 180 degrees 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.010
 Misalignment of that optical axis is not correct 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.270
 Half of that amount 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.080
 Fix the distance foot screw 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.550
 As per center 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.280
 I'm turning it 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.880
 It is Well very subtle This is what I turn chatter feeling 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.800
 Especially a little 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.590
 It is such a feeling 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.590
 It may be difficult without getting used to it 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.500
 I managed to get some work done 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.370
 For example 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.790
 When you want to move to the bottom 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.620
 Loosen the lower screw and move the upper screw 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.530
 If you close that 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.510
 It seems that the trick is to do it while making minor adjustments so as not to overdo it 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.099
 is 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.629
 Yes then it is rotating with that light axis 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.629
 At first 90 degrees 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.060
 I'm not sure Check 8 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.010
 270 degrees 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.590
 Yes 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.590
 360 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:39.870
 It is like this 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:43.920
 Yes, I adjusted the light axis of the sky memo office's curved axis this time 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:49.410
 It is an impression that it is very difficult as that impression 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.250
 Much harder than the match Pas Inter but I'm also the Tteyuu was the first time 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.260
 is not it 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:59.439
 That especially here the screw of the screw 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.439
 I felt that the adjustment was very severe 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:10.390
 Well this sky memo s already say that it is poor even in the initial state 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.380
 Responsible person who does not have so big is not the for example Well song board is as well the amount of deviation 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.130
 From club 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:19.430
 If you have a far so it should be advantageous to the tune bar even etc. say absolutely that shift 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.669
 According to whether you ask 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.100
 A month when only exposed to such request much Well Well 23 minutes at the wide-angle until there Well, although I think 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.760
 Especially songs 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.430
 I think that I will not adjust to the external illness 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:39.070
 For example, about 100 mm 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:42.090
 3 minutes to Leah's focal length Cuban position is still better to put that tight 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.090
 I think not 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:50.710
 Mart is not for sty memos, though 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:56.760
 It is a compass of gpo , but put such things too much and that 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.760
 Well, there is also a way to say that the East, West, South, North and South are simply stated 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:05.920
 I think that this is enough depending on what you ask for 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:11.950
 Well maybe it's the best topic now 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:16.750
 Because I think that it is that portable Tadashi Akamichi a little from this over the new moon period that in this 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:19.680
 Thank you I would like to move the ad to which party's party is appropriate 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.680
 There was
