this one's just right by my head height
belt<00:00:43.320> six<00:00:43.469> feet<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:44.700> sometimes<00:00:44.969> it'll<00:00:45.090> be

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
belt six feet up but sometimes it'll be

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.630 
belt six feet up but sometimes it'll be
a<00:00:45.210> lot<00:00:45.329> higher<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.920> like<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> tree<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.280> this

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
a lot higher up like in a tree like this

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880 
a lot higher up like in a tree like this
way<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.989> there<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.530> got<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.800> is

way up there and so we got to do is
shake<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.340> tree<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:51.360> shake<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> branch<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
shake the tree you shake the branch of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.209 
shake the tree you shake the branch of
the<00:00:51.989> tree<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.710> ones<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.949> are<00:00:53.039> ripe

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the tree and all the ones that are ripe

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.350 
the tree and all the ones that are ripe
will<00:00:53.399> fall<00:00:53.550> off<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.300> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
leaves and they have this unique pattern

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.590 
leaves and they have this unique pattern
here<00:01:28.409> or<00:01:29.250> you'll<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:31.820> see<00:01:32.820> these<00:01:32.939> three

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
here or you'll see see these three

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.819 
here or you'll see see these three
leaves<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.020> side<00:01:34.200> through<00:01:34.560> these<00:01:34.710> on

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
leaves on this side through these on

leaves on this side through these on
that<00:01:34.950> side<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:36.030> kind<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> typical

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
that side that's kind of a typical

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.060 
that side that's kind of a typical
pattern<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:36.960> they<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.110> grow<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.920> one

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
pattern but they do grow all this one

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.100 
pattern but they do grow all this one
way<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.640> that's<00:01:38.930> three<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
way see this one that's three on the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.050 
way see this one that's three on the
side<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.439> only<00:01:40.590> two<00:01:40.829> here<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.700> kind<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.939> grow

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
side and only two here they kind of grow

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.270 
side and only two here they kind of grow
in<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> bunches<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.020> five<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.439> six<00:01:43.680> or<00:01:43.829> seven<00:01:44.159> or

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
in a bunches of five or six or seven or

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.399 
in a bunches of five or six or seven or
ten<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.329> one<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.810> just

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
ten like that one there so just

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.920 
ten like that one there so just
different<00:01:46.710> bunches<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:48.299> here's<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> smaller

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
different bunches and here's the smaller

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.710 
different bunches and here's the smaller
ones<00:01:49.549> you'll<00:01:50.549> notice<00:01:50.729> they<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.329> look

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
ones you'll notice they all if you look

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.030 
ones you'll notice they all if you look
around<00:01:51.930> there's<00:01:52.200> all<00:01:52.409> over<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:52.890> all

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
around there's all over here they all

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.859 
around there's all over here they all
grow<00:01:53.250> round<00:01:53.460> together<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.509> that's<00:01:54.630> because

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
grow round together and that's because

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.050 
grow round together and that's because
popov<00:01:55.259> spread<00:01:55.740> both<00:01:56.340> through<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> seeds<00:01:56.909> of

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
popov spread both through the seeds of

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.780 
popov spread both through the seeds of
the<00:01:57.149> fruit<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.630> well<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.890> through<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> root

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the fruit as well as through the root

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.340 
the fruit as well as through the root
system<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.180> they'll<00:02:00.479> actually<00:02:00.600> spread<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.200> in

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
system so they'll actually spread out in

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.230 
system so they'll actually spread out in
the<00:02:01.439> root<00:02:01.590> system<00:02:01.920> down<00:02:01.950> under<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> earth<00:02:02.640> all

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the root system down under the earth all

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.569 
the root system down under the earth all
along<00:02:03.659> here<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.930> form<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.259> big<00:02:04.469> mat<00:02:04.740> well

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
along here and form this big mat well

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.219 
along here and form this big mat well
they<00:02:05.670> all<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:06.030> grow<00:02:06.360> together<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
they all just grow together all on the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.889 
they all just grow together all on the
ground<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.770> that's<00:02:08.459> why<00:02:08.550> you'll<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:08.940> big<00:02:09.300> pop

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
ground and that's why you'll see big pop

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.960 
ground and that's why you'll see big pop
up<00:02:10.140> axes<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:10.679> they're<00:02:10.830> called<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.700> here<00:02:11.940> I

house and so I figured since I was left
out<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.170> house<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.590> might<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.459> well<00:02:41.519> walk

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730

out the house and I might as well walk
in<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:41.940> back<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.300> wonder<00:02:42.480> out<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.780> see

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
in the back and wonder out and see

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.750 
in the back and wonder out and see
what's<00:02:43.019> out<00:02:43.110> there<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.739> remember<00:02:44.489> we<00:02:44.640> had

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
what's out there and I remember we had
