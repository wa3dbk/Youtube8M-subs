cutting board especially useful for this
project<00:00:29.230> begin<00:00:30.230> by<00:00:30.410> making<00:00:30.619> small<00:00:31.099> marks<00:00:31.520> at

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
project begin by making small marks at

sheet

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.119 

using<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.090> straightedge<00:00:44.530> cut<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.710> sheet<00:00:45.949> in

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
using a straightedge cut the sheet in

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:54.610 
using a straightedge cut the sheet in
half

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.979 

you<00:00:55.190> can<00:00:55.370> also<00:00:55.610> simply<00:00:56.000> fold<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.660> sheet<00:00:56.870> in

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
you can also simply fold the sheet in

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.500 
you can also simply fold the sheet in
half<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:57.260> then<00:00:57.739> cut<00:00:58.039> it<00:00:58.070> but<00:00:58.969> we<00:00:59.090> found<00:00:59.270> this

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
half and then cut it but we found this

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.740 
half and then cut it but we found this
way<00:00:59.719> to<00:00:59.780> be<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.020> bit<00:01:00.260> more<00:01:00.440> accurate<00:01:04.509> go<00:01:05.509> ahead
