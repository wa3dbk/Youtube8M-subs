00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
to make sure Seth Rollins can't run away

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.990 
to make sure Seth Rollins can't run away
from<00:03:11.020> them<00:03:11.350> for<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.650> third<00:03:11.860> time<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.340> that

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
from them for a third time and that

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.160 
from them for a third time and that
basically<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.540> match<00:03:13.720> that's<00:03:13.989> going<00:03:14.110> to

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
basically the match that's going to

00:06:59.969 --> 00:06:59.979 
things I definitely see them using that

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:02.249 
things I definitely see them using that
later<00:07:00.220> on<00:07:00.430> in<00:07:00.699> the<00:07:01.240> year<00:07:01.270> November<00:07:02.080> December

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:02.259 
later on in the year November December

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:04.290 
later on in the year November December
when<00:07:02.830> the<00:07:02.949> movie<00:07:03.160> starts<00:07:03.190> that<00:07:03.639> you<00:07:03.759> dip<00:07:04.060> down

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
when the movie starts that you dip down

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.180 
when the movie starts that you dip down
and<00:07:04.660> that's<00:07:04.810> one<00:07:05.289> thing<00:07:05.319> they<00:07:05.560> can<00:07:05.710> do<00:07:05.860> to<00:07:05.979> sort

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
and that's one thing they can do to sort

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.100 
and that's one thing they can do to sort
of<00:07:06.310> they<00:07:06.849> don't<00:07:06.970> spike<00:07:07.240> up<00:07:07.479> what's<00:07:07.690> going<00:07:07.960> on

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
of they don't spike up what's going on

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.779 
of they don't spike up what's going on
with<00:07:08.289> them<00:07:08.380> teasing<00:07:08.860> that<00:07:08.889> deal<00:07:09.220> so<00:07:09.580> on

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:09.789 
with them teasing that deal so on

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:11.580 
with them teasing that deal so on
definitely<00:07:10.569> i'm<00:07:10.870> thinking<00:07:11.199> that<00:07:11.349> it's<00:07:11.470> going

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
definitely i'm thinking that it's going

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.719 
definitely i'm thinking that it's going
to<00:07:11.650> be<00:07:11.740> around<00:07:11.830> for<00:07:12.009> a<00:07:12.130> good<00:07:12.160> amount<00:07:12.280> or<00:07:12.550> time

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:12.729 
to be around for a good amount or time

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:14.520 
to be around for a good amount or time
so<00:07:13.000> I'm<00:07:13.419> going<00:07:13.630> to<00:07:13.690> take<00:07:13.780> Rollins<00:07:14.259> that<00:07:14.440> win

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
so I'm going to take Rollins that win

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.290 
so I'm going to take Rollins that win
this<00:07:14.650> match<00:07:14.889> but<00:07:15.400> definitely<00:07:15.819> to<00:07:15.970> me<00:07:16.090> in<00:07:16.210> my
