 I bring you a very sweet recipe 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.850
 and very cloying 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.890
 In fact, I had to do one or the other 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.619
 recipe because the last videos were 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.419

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.160
 the truth is that this week has been 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.900
 making a lot of heat here in the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.150
 beach so I gave myself the homework of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.710
 look for refreshing recipes I know not 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.320
 in all places it's hot 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.210
 obviously even in some states of 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.130
 Mexico is getting very cold but 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.990
 Well the truth is that you can not imagine the 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.610
 heat that is doing here but from 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.890
 any way they can make this recipe 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.020
 when you want and well we're going 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.270
 to do nothing more and nothing less than 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.300

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.750

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.500
 punctuated 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.260
 It is a super super simple dessert 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.390
 do you will take them if 10-15 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.340
 minutes to do it and that's a lot so 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.409
 let's go for the kitchen to start 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.240
 to work 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.929
 to make this delicious dessert 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.780
 we need fresh strawberries half a kilo 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.909
 a can of condensed milk two cans 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.679
 of average cream or cream common and current 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.679
 and a spoonful of lemon juice 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.429
 as I told you before it 's a dessert 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.130
 very easy to make we take a container 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.799
 deep and add the strawberries remember 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.659
 they have to be super disinfected 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.090
 do not forget to separate a few for the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.560
 decoration below we are going to 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.560
 crush all the strawberries 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.650
 add the two cans of half cream 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.780
 remember that you can add 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.050
 ordinary cream or from the one that 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.369
 Like you can add more or less cream 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.369
 depending on how you like it 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.299
 mix everything well and then add 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.299
 condensed milk 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.430
 If you feel that you lack sugar, add 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.430
 what do you think is necessary 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.420
 finally add the lemon juice this 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.490
 step is not in the family recipe without 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.490
 But it is in the recipe of Samuel Kunz 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.840
 you stop half of your strawberries with cream 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.150
 and you put them in the blender as it is 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.660
 totally liquid incorporate it with the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.660
 other half 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.100
 mix everything very well and they already believe 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.500
 we have some delicious strawberries with cream 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.130
 you just need to refrigerate a little 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.130
 minimum half hour 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.840
 and good in terms of decoration is 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.360
 question of you playing a little and you 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.200
 put something creative I'll leave you here 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.200

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.480
 yes 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.990
 as you can see it is a recipe but 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.270
 very simple they do not have anything of joke and 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.040
 it's a very rich recipe, you can 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.600
 eat at room temperature but I'll 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.090
 I recommend that the minimum goals a 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.280
 half an hour to the refrigerator so that what 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.830
 you can enjoy yourself fresh while more 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.830

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.359
 you can decorate it as you like 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.220
 put strawberries is not coconut raisins granola 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.340

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.320
