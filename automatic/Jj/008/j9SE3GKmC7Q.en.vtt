well<00:00:11.490> coconut<00:00:11.969> oil<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.630> one<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.290> most

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
well coconut oil is one of the most

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.980 
well coconut oil is one of the most
beneficial<00:00:14.190> oils<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> human<00:00:15.150> body<00:00:15.389> when

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
beneficial oils for the human body when

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.960 
beneficial oils for the human body when
consumed<00:00:16.500> internally<00:00:16.920> or<00:00:17.520> applied

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
consumed internally or applied

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.420 
consumed internally or applied
externally<00:00:18.600> as<00:00:18.720> well<00:00:19.010> beneficial<00:00:20.010> because<00:00:20.220> it

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
externally as well beneficial because it

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.689 
externally as well beneficial because it
has<00:00:21.000> been<00:00:21.300> seen<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.410> lot<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.680> tests<00:00:23.490> done<00:00:23.640> on

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
has been seen with lot of tests done on

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.019 
has been seen with lot of tests done on
it<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.990> as<00:00:25.470> said<00:00:26.160> earlier<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.670> doesn't

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
it that it as said earlier it doesn't

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.700 
it that it as said earlier it doesn't
raise<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.269> cholesterol<00:00:27.869> levels<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> body

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
raise the cholesterol levels in the body

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.800 
raise the cholesterol levels in the body
as<00:00:28.920> much<00:00:29.429> as<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.820> other<00:00:29.939> oils<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.539> and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
as much as the other oils do and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.170 
as much as the other oils do and
secondly<00:00:31.710> its<00:00:31.830> since<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.520> very<00:00:32.700> thin<00:00:33.030> its

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
secondly its since it's very thin its

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.630 
secondly its since it's very thin its
absorbability<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.989> very<00:00:34.200> fast<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.860> when

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
absorbability is very fast on when

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.330 
absorbability is very fast on when
applied<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.329> skin<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.829> one<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.190> these
