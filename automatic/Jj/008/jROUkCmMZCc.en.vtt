00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.850 

and<00:00:46.539> the<00:00:46.899> first<00:00:47.110> thing<00:00:47.230> you'll<00:00:47.379> notice<00:00:47.469> is<00:00:47.710> the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
and the first thing you'll notice is the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.959 
and the first thing you'll notice is the
size<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.370> it's<00:00:49.210> absolutely<00:00:49.329> tiny<00:00:50.850> I'm<00:00:51.850> a

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
size of it it's absolutely tiny I'm a

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.250 
size of it it's absolutely tiny I'm a
big<00:00:52.149> fan<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.629> stealthy<00:00:53.530> install<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:54.850> for<00:00:55.090> me

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
big fan of a stealthy install so for me

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.490 
big fan of a stealthy install so for me
the<00:00:56.260> it<00:00:57.070> being<00:00:57.399> predominantly<00:00:57.670> black<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:59.350> the

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
the it being predominantly black and the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.619 
the it being predominantly black and the
sheer<00:00:59.770> size<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.190> it<00:01:00.340> just<00:01:00.670> means<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.210> can<00:01:01.449> just

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
sheer size of it just means it can just

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.779 
sheer size of it just means it can just
tuck<00:01:01.809> away<00:01:01.960> behind<00:01:02.800> your<00:01:03.129> rear-view<00:01:03.430> mirror

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
tuck away behind your rear-view mirror

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.240 
tuck away behind your rear-view mirror
and<00:01:04.290> really<00:01:05.290> you<00:01:05.410> can't<00:01:05.680> make<00:01:05.800> it<00:01:05.920> out<00:01:06.010> at<00:01:06.070> all

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
and really you can't make it out at all

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.680 
and really you can't make it out at all
I<00:01:06.460> know<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.210> lot<00:01:07.360> of<00:01:07.420> people<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:08.890> hide<00:01:09.250> this

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
I know a lot of people like to hide this

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.020 
I know a lot of people like to hide this
text<00:01:10.690> here<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.550> thinking<00:01:12.550> it<00:01:12.670> can<00:01:12.790> be<00:01:12.850> seen

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
text here and thinking it can be seen

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.310 
text here and thinking it can be seen
through<00:01:13.360> your<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:15.250> windscreen<00:01:16.320> certainly

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
through your your windscreen certainly

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.960 
through your your windscreen certainly
in<00:01:17.380> my<00:01:17.470> case<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:17.950> really<00:01:18.070> doesn't<00:01:18.520> stand<00:01:18.760> out

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
in my case it really doesn't stand out

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.150 
in my case it really doesn't stand out
so<00:01:19.330> so<00:01:19.750> that's<00:01:19.930> a<00:01:20.080> personal<00:01:20.590> preference<00:01:20.830> there

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
so so that's a personal preference there

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.150 
so so that's a personal preference there
but<00:01:21.340> but<00:01:22.090> really<00:01:22.450> it's<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:23.320> small<00:01:26.070> there's<00:01:27.070> a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
again really small and what I like about

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.320 
again really small and what I like about
this<00:02:29.090> most<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.870> i<00:02:30.860> just<00:02:31.400> opened<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:32.000> up<00:02:32.180> so

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
this most is i just opened this up so

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:43.660 
this most is i just opened this up so
you<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.630> have<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:33.370> closer<00:02:34.370> look<00:02:34.730> at<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:42.580> here<00:02:43.580> we

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
you can have a closer look at it here we

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.940 
you can have a closer look at it here we
go<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.810> camera<00:02:45.080> actually<00:02:45.170> clips<00:02:45.530> into<00:02:45.709> this

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
go the camera actually clips into this

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.000 
go the camera actually clips into this
piece<00:02:46.220> here<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.140> power<00:02:48.320> cable<00:02:48.650> plugs<00:02:48.860> in

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
piece here and the power cable plugs in

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.800 
piece here and the power cable plugs in
here<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.340> actually<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.790> can<00:02:49.970> remove<00:02:50.600> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
here so actually you can remove the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.979 
here so actually you can remove the
camera<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.970> leave<00:02:52.970> this<00:02:53.209> in<00:02:53.420> place<00:02:53.630> with<00:02:53.900> the

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
camera and leave this in place with the

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.720 
camera and leave this in place with the
power<00:02:54.170> cable<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.890> don't<00:02:54.980> end<00:02:55.400> up

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
power cable in so you don't end up

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.570 
power cable in so you don't end up
having<00:02:56.060> power<00:02:56.690> cable<00:02:57.050> hanging<00:02:57.290> down<00:02:57.590> which

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
having power cable hanging down which

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.650 
having power cable hanging down which
can<00:02:58.760> look<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:58.940> bit<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.239> mess<00:02:59.390> all<00:02:59.510> right

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.990 
the size of it and certainly once you've
seen<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.109> footage<00:04:03.320> you'll<00:04:04.250> see<00:04:04.459> why<00:04:04.639> it's<00:04:04.850> so
