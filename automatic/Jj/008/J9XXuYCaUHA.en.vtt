calling a cold start that just means

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.800 
calling a cold start that just means

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
like a soft entry into the Marvel

Universe or movie universe versus like

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.200 
Universe or movie universe versus like
her<00:04:33.960> own<00:04:34.169> solo<00:04:34.680> movie<00:04:34.980> which<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.610> do<00:04:35.669> think<00:04:35.790> that

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
her own solo movie which I do think that

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.970 
her own solo movie which I do think that
she's<00:04:36.360> strong<00:04:36.630> enough<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.960> carry<00:04:37.200> so<00:04:37.860> if<00:04:37.919> we

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
she's strong enough to carry so if we

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.080 
she's strong enough to carry so if we
don't<00:04:38.070> see<00:04:38.160> her<00:04:38.280> in<00:04:38.340> Avengers<00:04:38.669> 2<00:04:38.700> it's

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
don't see her in Avengers 2 it's

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.190 
don't see her in Avengers 2 it's
probably<00:04:39.419> just<00:04:39.600> because<00:04:39.690> they're<00:04:39.930> holding

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
probably just because they're holding

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.170 
probably just because they're holding
her<00:04:40.290> for<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.530> bigger<00:04:40.800> movie<00:04:41.160> or<00:04:41.340> her<00:04:41.610> own<00:04:41.760> solo

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
her for a bigger movie or her own solo

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.940

Chewbacca<00:05:30.780> I<00:05:31.080> think<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.590> only<00:05:31.770> thing

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
Chewbacca I think the only thing

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.770 
Chewbacca I think the only thing
preventing<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:32.789> is<00:05:33.060> that<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.419> character

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
preventing that is that the character

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.450 
preventing that is that the character
has<00:05:33.810> a<00:05:33.990> human<00:05:34.500> origin<00:05:34.860> story<00:05:35.160> so<00:05:35.340> they

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
has a human origin story so they

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.890 
has a human origin story so they
probably<00:05:35.700> gonna<00:05:35.970> start<00:05:36.180> her<00:05:36.330> off<00:05:36.510> in<00:05:36.780> an

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
probably gonna start her off in an

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.440 
probably gonna start her off in an
earth-based<00:05:37.289> movie<00:05:37.740> but<00:05:38.280> moving<00:05:38.580> on<00:05:38.700> number<00:05:38.970> 4
