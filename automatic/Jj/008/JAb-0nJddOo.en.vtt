used<00:00:05.310> in<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.580> making<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:05.879> Japanese<00:00:06.390> swords

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
used in the making of Japanese swords

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.589 
used in the making of Japanese swords
and<00:00:06.990> their<00:00:07.319> mounts<00:00:07.740> so<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.429> was<00:00:08.790> talking<00:00:09.000> in<00:00:09.389> an

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
and their mounts so I was talking in an

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.560 
and their mounts so I was talking in an
earlier<00:00:09.990> video<00:00:10.260> about<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.309> planes<00:00:11.910> or<00:00:12.269> kana

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
earlier video about the planes or kana

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.039 
earlier video about the planes or kana
that<00:00:12.960> are<00:00:13.080> used<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.679> make<00:00:13.950> Japanese<00:00:15.049> scabbards

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
that are used to make Japanese scabbards

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.429 
that are used to make Japanese scabbards
now<00:00:16.800> our<00:00:17.340> about<00:00:18.330> planes<00:00:18.750> used<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
now our about planes used on the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.189 
now our about planes used on the
interior<00:00:19.760> surfaces<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.510> two<00:00:21.869> pieces

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
interior surfaces of the two pieces

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.929 
interior surfaces of the two pieces
which<00:00:22.650> are<00:00:23.269> used<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.510> form<00:00:25.500> together<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.550> make

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
which are used to form together to make

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.589 
which are used to form together to make
the<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.750> Japanese<00:00:28.170> scabbard<00:00:29.420> planes<00:00:30.420> are

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the the Japanese scabbard planes are

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.590 
the the Japanese scabbard planes are
also<00:00:30.779> used<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.590> profile<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.309> exterior<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
also used to profile the exterior of the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.049 
also used to profile the exterior of the
scabbard<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:35.100> pretty<00:00:35.309> obvious<00:00:35.790> how<00:00:36.000> you

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
scabbard so it's pretty obvious how you

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.709 
scabbard so it's pretty obvious how you
would<00:00:36.270> profile<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.200> outer<00:00:38.480> portion<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
would profile the outer portion of the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.869 
would profile the outer portion of the
curve<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.590> happens<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> get

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
curve but what happens is if you get

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.950 
curve but what happens is if you get
into<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> curved<00:00:42.780> surface<00:00:43.579> like<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> try

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
into a curved surface like this and try

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
into a curved surface like this and try
and<00:00:46.170> plane<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.710> off<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> conventional

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
and plane it off with a conventional

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.950 
and plane it off with a conventional
flat<00:00:48.329> plane<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.789> bottoms<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> corners

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
flat plane it bottoms out on the corners

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.470 
flat plane it bottoms out on the corners
and<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.620> can't<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> blade<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.329> way

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and you can't get the blade all the way

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.290 
and you can't get the blade all the way
in<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.140> basically<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.100> plane<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.120> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
in so basically a plane like this is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.939 
in so basically a plane like this is
intended<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> make<00:00:57.899> things<00:00:58.140> flat<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.800> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
intended to make things flat and it's of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.610 
intended to make things flat and it's of
no<00:00:59.160> use<00:00:59.190> whatsoever<00:00:59.550> on<00:01:00.149> interior<00:01:00.570> curves<00:01:01.170> so

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
no use whatsoever on interior curves so

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.070 
no use whatsoever on interior curves so
is<00:01:02.010> there<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> solution<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.600> terms<00:01:03.870> of

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
is there a solution to that in terms of

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.679 
is there a solution to that in terms of
planes<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.680> answer<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.070> yes<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
planes the answer is yes and it's this

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.870 
planes the answer is yes and it's this
it's<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.650> small<00:01:08.630> curved<00:01:09.630> radiused<00:01:10.590> plane<00:01:11.460> so

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it's a small curved radiused plane so

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.600 
it's a small curved radiused plane so
the<00:01:12.030> bottom<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.750> curved<00:01:13.549> there's<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the bottom is just curved there's a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.429 
the bottom is just curved there's a
there's<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.060> kind<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> plane<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
there's a kind of plane like this in the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.100 
there's a kind of plane like this in the
Western<00:01:16.799> tradition<00:01:17.360> that's<00:01:18.360> used<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:18.960> making

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
Western tradition that's used for making

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.330 
Western tradition that's used for making
I<00:01:19.350> believe<00:01:19.650> cheer<00:01:20.580> bottoms<00:01:21.770> same<00:01:22.770> principle

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
I believe cheer bottoms same principle

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.609 
I believe cheer bottoms same principle
it's<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.180> normal<00:01:24.360> plane<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> bottom

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
it's just a normal plane but the bottom

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.830 
it's just a normal plane but the bottom
is<00:01:25.740> kind<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.220> shaved<00:01:26.460> off<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.030> another<00:01:27.630> neat

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
is kind of shaved off so another neat

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.450 
is kind of shaved off so another neat
little<00:01:27.869> thing<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.409> made<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.829> particular

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
little thing I made this particular

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.950 
little thing I made this particular
plane<00:01:29.729> myself<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:32.030> very<00:01:33.030> handy<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.689> getting

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
plane myself and very handy for getting

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.499 
plane myself and very handy for getting
those<00:01:34.110> interior<00:01:34.590> curves<00:01:35.130> planed<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
those interior curves planed out of the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.630 
those interior curves planed out of the
curved<00:01:36.750> surface<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
curved surface that you have on the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.950 
curved surface that you have on the
exterior<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:40.409> saya<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.310> Japanese<00:01:42.240> scabbard
