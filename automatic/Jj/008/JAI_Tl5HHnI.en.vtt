in<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.000> review<00:02:00.450> i'll<00:02:00.540> show<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.170> um<00:02:02.000> see<00:02:03.000> as

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
in a review i'll show you now um see as

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.050 
in a review i'll show you now um see as
the<00:02:03.840> arm<00:02:04.159> movements<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.799> she's<00:02:08.580> got<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> hollow

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the arm movements and she's got a hollow

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.200 
the arm movements and she's got a hollow
body<00:02:09.209> that's<00:02:09.929> probably<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.379> only<00:02:10.590> bad<00:02:11.009> thing

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
so that's it for the alien commander and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.510 
so that's it for the alien commander and
that<00:02:17.550> quite<00:02:18.550> special<00:02:18.970> part<00:02:19.210> of<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:21.870> set<00:02:23.520> is

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
that quite special part of the set is

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.490 
that quite special part of the set is
the<00:02:25.030> repo<00:02:25.570> if<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:27.160> can<00:02:27.340> see<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:28.180> they<00:02:29.080> spend

looking<00:03:42.280> at<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.610> it's<00:03:43.330> got<00:03:43.600> all<00:03:43.870> mad<00:03:44.170> here<00:03:44.620> to

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
looking at it it's got all mad here to

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.340 
looking at it it's got all mad here to
pick<00:03:45.430> out<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.730> crystals<00:03:46.180> up<00:03:46.360> going<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:47.050> one

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
pick out the crystals up going that one

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.200 
pick out the crystals up going that one
oh<00:03:48.180> that's<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:50.440> on<00:03:51.450> pin<00:03:52.450> hooks<00:03:52.780> up<00:03:53.050> to<00:03:53.080> in

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
oh that's that on pin hooks up to in

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.860 
oh that's that on pin hooks up to in
hooks<00:03:55.210> up<00:03:55.420> to<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:56.590> little<00:03:56.950> arm<00:03:57.870> connector

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
hooks up to that little arm connector

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.810 
hooks up to that little arm connector
there<00:03:59.290> so<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.250> comes<00:04:00.880> on<00:04:01.120> ah<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:05.590> I'm<00:04:06.460> done

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
there so that comes on ah so I'm done

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:14.220 
there so that comes on ah so I'm done
with<00:04:07.000> that<00:04:10.200> here's<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.620> uh<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:13.300> flying<00:04:13.810> one

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
with that here's the uh the flying one

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.810 
with that here's the uh the flying one
it's<00:04:14.860> got<00:04:16.350> arms<00:04:18.900> each<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.380> can<00:04:20.530> see<00:04:20.770> not<00:04:21.760> the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
it's got arms each you can see not the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.400 
it's got arms each you can see not the
finger<00:04:22.390> off<00:04:22.600> um

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.820 

so<00:04:32.590> it<00:04:33.590> doesn't<00:04:33.979> have<00:04:34.130> any<00:04:34.370> type<00:04:34.729> of<00:04:34.759> controls

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
so it doesn't have any type of controls

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.640 
so it doesn't have any type of controls
just<00:04:36.830> he<00:04:37.039> sits<00:04:37.340> in<00:04:37.520> there<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:39.320> thing<00:04:39.530> that

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
just he sits in there the thing that

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.950 
just he sits in there the thing that
keeps<00:04:39.889> it<00:04:40.070> up<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:41.410> those<00:04:42.410> turbines<00:04:43.210> and

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.320 

there's<00:04:47.960> a<00:04:48.050> little<00:04:48.289> generator<00:04:48.949> in<00:04:49.250> there<00:04:49.490> it's

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
there's a little generator in there it's

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.159 
there's a little generator in there it's
got<00:04:50.509> a<00:04:50.539> machine<00:04:51.050> gun<00:04:52.030> well<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.479> it's<00:04:53.960> got<00:04:54.139> a

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
got a machine gun well and it's got a

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.460 
got a machine gun well and it's got a
little<00:04:54.350> thing<00:04:54.440> at<00:04:54.680> five<00:04:55.419> it<00:04:56.419> usually<00:04:56.810> fires

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.710 

I'll<00:05:00.470> try<00:05:00.949> it<00:05:00.979> later<00:05:01.220> it's<00:05:01.880> going<00:05:02.150> crystal

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
I'll try it later it's going crystal

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.920 
I'll try it later it's going crystal
that<00:05:03.050> it<00:05:03.169> touches<00:05:03.380> to<00:05:03.889> their<00:05:04.570> so<00:05:05.570> that's

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
that it touches to their so that's

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.890 
that it touches to their so that's
speech<00:05:06.260> with<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:07.060> now<00:05:08.060> into<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.600> little

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
speech with that now into the little

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.909 
speech with that now into the little
buggy<00:05:09.139> I<00:05:09.500> like<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.910> flight<00:05:11.389> I<00:05:11.620> shipping<00:05:12.620> scope

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
buggy I like the flight I shipping scope

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.230 
buggy I like the flight I shipping scope
controls<00:05:14.500> um<00:05:15.500> ska<00:05:16.250> little<00:05:16.520> dumpster<00:05:16.880> at<00:05:17.090> the

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
controls um ska little dumpster at the

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.550 
controls um ska little dumpster at the
back<00:05:17.889> um<00:05:19.570> it's<00:05:20.570> got<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:20.919> walkie-talkie<00:05:21.919> and<00:05:23.560> I'm

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
back um it's got a walkie-talkie and I'm

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:32.550 
back um it's got a walkie-talkie and I'm
a<00:05:25.479> buzz<00:05:26.479> saw<00:05:26.509> uh<00:05:27.639> it's<00:05:28.639> got<00:05:28.820> four<00:05:29.120> wheels<00:05:29.770> and

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
a buzz saw uh it's got four wheels and

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.610 
a buzz saw uh it's got four wheels and
so<00:05:33.560> this<00:05:34.340> is<00:05:34.550> a<00:05:34.580> pretty<00:05:34.820> good<00:05:35.120> step<00:05:35.479> this<00:05:35.780> um<00:05:36.050> I

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
so this is a pretty good step this um I

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.980 
so this is a pretty good step this um I
forget<00:05:37.550> how<00:05:37.669> much<00:05:37.849> it<00:05:38.000> was<00:05:38.120> with<00:05:38.360> us<00:05:38.479> at<00:05:38.660> our

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
forget how much it was with us at our

forget how much it was with us at our
Mabel's<00:05:39.380> very<00:05:39.860> good<00:05:40.130> value<00:05:40.310> for<00:05:41.020> money<00:05:42.400> so

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
Mabel's very good value for money so

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.500 
Mabel's very good value for money so
give<00:05:43.789> this<00:05:43.970> set<00:05:44.440> that<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.680> 9<00:05:45.949> out<00:05:46.190> of<00:05:46.220> 10<00:05:46.639> and<00:05:47.090> i

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
give this set that a 9 out of 10 and i

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.919 
give this set that a 9 out of 10 and i
would<00:05:47.720> recommend<00:05:47.750> buying<00:05:48.560> it
