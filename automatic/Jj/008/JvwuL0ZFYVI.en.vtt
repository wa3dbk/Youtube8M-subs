a freshman in high school I started to
develop<00:00:03.210> my<00:00:03.480> own<00:00:03.510> technique<00:00:04.110> for<00:00:04.319> Chong

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
develop my own technique for Chong

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
obviously they will be detached from

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.960

there at as many veins as you think is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.490 
there at as many veins as you think is
necessary<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:43.049> begin<00:01:43.500> adding<00:01:43.860> your<00:01:44.310> dots

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
necessary then begin adding your dots

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.230 
necessary then begin adding your dots
when<00:01:46.500> drawing<00:01:46.799> your<00:01:47.009> dots<00:01:47.250> though<00:01:47.549> make<00:01:48.210> sure

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
when drawing your dots though make sure

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.450 
when drawing your dots though make sure
you<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:49.049> random<00:01:49.259> shapes<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.070> larger

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you have some random shapes and larger

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.910 
you have some random shapes and larger
dots<00:01:50.670> representing<00:01:51.630> all<00:01:51.899> sorts<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> internal

workings

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.560 

the<00:01:59.070> doubts<00:01:59.310> are<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.640> most<00:01:59.850> important<00:02:00.390> part

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the doubts are the most important part

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.390 
the doubts are the most important part
of<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:00.750> drawing<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.680> ultimately<00:02:02.130> what

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
of the drawing and it's ultimately what

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.850 
of the drawing and it's ultimately what
gives<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.760> picture<00:02:03.120> so<00:02:03.480> much<00:02:03.690> life<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:04.940> death

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
gives the picture so much life or death

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.510 
gives the picture so much life or death
right<00:02:08.840> anyways<00:02:09.840> working<00:02:10.680> down<00:02:10.830> from<00:02:11.100> there<00:02:11.310> we

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
right anyways working down from there we

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.600 
right anyways working down from there we
will<00:02:11.610> begin<00:02:11.820> adding<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.660> arms<00:02:13.310> show<00:02:14.310> at<00:02:14.430> least

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
will begin adding the arms show at least

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.820 
will begin adding the arms show at least
