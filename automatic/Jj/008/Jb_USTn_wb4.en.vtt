gamestop<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.529> picked<00:00:32.130> up<00:00:32.750> dishonored<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.340> I'm

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
gamestop and picked up dishonored so I'm

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.740 
gamestop and picked up dishonored so I'm
gonna<00:00:35.460> go<00:00:35.610> ahead<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.820> open<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.180> even<00:00:36.690> though

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
gonna go ahead and open that even though

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.270 
gonna go ahead and open that even though
it's<00:00:36.930> not<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> collector's<00:00:37.739> edition<00:00:38.100> I

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
it's not like a collector's edition I

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.680 
it's not like a collector's edition I
don't<00:00:38.460> think<00:00:38.489> they<00:00:39.000> even<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
don't think they even have the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.030 
don't think they even have the
collectors<00:00:40.110> edition<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.649> dishonored

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
collectors edition for dishonored

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.130 
collectors edition for dishonored
because<00:00:41.309> when<00:00:41.940> i<00:00:41.969> pre-ordered<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.899> at

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
because when i pre-ordered it at

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.819 
because when i pre-ordered it at
gamestop<00:00:43.350> they<00:00:43.950> usually<00:00:44.910> ask<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.320> want<00:00:46.620> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
gamestop they usually ask if you want a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.440 
gamestop they usually ask if you want a
collector's<00:00:47.460> edition<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.059> they<00:00:48.210> did<00:00:48.420> for

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
collector's edition like they did for

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
collector's edition like they did for
deus<00:00:48.840> ex<00:00:49.170> they<00:00:49.440> asked<00:00:49.770> me<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.100> i<00:00:50.340> wanted<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
deus ex they asked me if i wanted the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.029 
deus ex they asked me if i wanted the
collectors<00:00:51.030> edition<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.629> i<00:00:52.469> don't<00:00:52.800> think

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
collectors edition and so i don't think
