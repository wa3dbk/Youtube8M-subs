but a bit I think that all the group
must<00:00:28.769> be<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.000> financial<00:00:30.449> public<00:00:36.950> as<00:00:37.950> we

strike<00:02:38.940> do<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.390> think<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.750> by<00:02:40.080> bringing<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500

strike do you think that by bringing a
striker<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.190> can<00:02:41.340> be<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.520> difference

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
striker and that can be the difference

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.510 
striker and that can be the difference
between<00:02:42.410> how<00:02:43.410> many<00:02:43.620> trophies<00:02:43.830> you're<00:02:44.160> able<00:02:44.430> to

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
between how many trophies you're able to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.010 
between how many trophies you're able to
win<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.850> season<00:02:45.240> will<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.510> seriously

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
win this season will that seriously

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.290 
win this season will that seriously
strengthen<00:02:46.590> how<00:02:47.040> many<00:02:47.220> what<00:02:47.370> will<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.030> be

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
strengthen how many what will that be

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.270 
strengthen how many what will that be
the<00:02:48.390> difference<00:02:48.810> between<00:02:49.040> whether<00:02:50.040> you're

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
the difference between whether you're

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.070 
the difference between whether you're
able<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.670> win<00:02:50.850> trophies<00:02:51.270> this<00:02:51.450> season<00:02:51.840> or<00:02:51.930> not

do<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.230> think<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> new<00:02:52.830> strike<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.280> can

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
do you think that a new strike you can

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.910 
do you think that a new strike you can
have<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.640> impact<00:02:54.150> no<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.140> think<00:02:55.350> that's<00:02:55.739> very

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
have that impact no I think that's very

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.680 
have that impact no I think that's very
important<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.700> how<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.940> squad<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.510> you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
important to how the squad that you

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.020 
important to how the squad that you
think<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.080> need<00:02:58.230> that's<00:02:58.980> why<00:02:59.190> last<00:02:59.430> year<00:02:59.640> we

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
think you need that's why last year we

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.330 
think you need that's why last year we
have<00:03:00.360> here<00:03:00.810> four<00:03:01.140> strikers<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.860> if<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.130> strike

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
have here four strikers and if I strike

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.310 
have here four strikers and if I strike
a<00:03:02.400> very<00:03:02.730> we're<00:03:03.180> very<00:03:03.540> useful<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.050> win<00:03:04.200> the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
a very we're very useful to win the

a very we're very useful to win the
title<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:05.310> cannot<00:03:05.640> say<00:03:05.850> because<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.360> are

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
title you cannot say because you are

to win but in the first part of the
season<00:03:10.489> it's<00:03:11.489> important<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.180> make<00:03:12.690> an<00:03:12.989> ax<00:03:13.260> and

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
what they've all based a lot of games

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.790 
what they've all based a lot of games
over<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:58.950> last<00:03:59.010> two<00:03:59.310> years<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.640> was<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:00.390> a

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
over the last two years it was that a

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.660 
over the last two years it was that a
significant<00:04:01.800> sort<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.100> influence<00:04:02.459> in<00:04:02.550> the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
significant sort of influence in the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.340 
significant sort of influence in the
decision<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.630> bring<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:03.900> new<00:04:03.990> striker

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
decision to bring in the new striker

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.710 
decision to bring in the new striker
dangerous<00:04:05.280> part<00:04:05.610> of<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.970> city<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.390> course

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
dangerous part of the city of course

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.320 
dangerous part of the city of course
because<00:04:07.320> too<00:04:07.650> many<00:04:07.770> years<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:08.670> normal<00:04:09.150> maybe

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
because too many years is normal maybe

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.390 
because too many years is normal maybe
that<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.780> striker<00:04:10.080> minds<00:04:10.590> are<00:04:10.950> other<00:04:11.100> players

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
that the striker minds are other players

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.600 
that the striker minds are other players
so<00:04:11.700> that's<00:04:12.480> why<00:04:12.690> especially<00:04:13.530> here<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.160> England

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
so that's why especially here in England

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.909 
so that's why especially here in England
when<00:04:14.910> when<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.600> need<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.989> work<00:04:16.260> with<00:04:16.290> strong

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
when when you need to work with strong

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.310 
when when you need to work with strong
footballers<00:04:17.489> physical<00:04:17.910> football<00:04:18.140> that's<00:04:19.140> why

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
footballers physical football that's why

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.440 
footballers physical football that's why
i<00:04:19.350> said<00:04:19.590> last<00:04:20.100> year<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.790> i<00:04:20.880> think<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.299> is

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
i said last year and i think that is

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.659 
i said last year and i think that is
this<00:04:21.630> year<00:04:21.810> also<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.169> we<00:04:22.350> need<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.669> reporter

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
this year also that we need a reporter

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.690 
this year also that we need a reporter
for<00:04:23.820> strike<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.800> course<00:04:25.830> one<00:04:26.220> the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
for strike and of course one the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.090 
for strike and of course one the
injuries<00:04:27.600> one<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.110> things<00:04:28.380> while<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.800> think

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
injuries one of the things while I think

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.010 
injuries one of the things while I think
it's<00:04:29.190> important<00:04:29.550> for<00:04:29.580> he<00:04:29.790> took<00:04:29.940> up<00:04:30.090> we're<00:04:30.930> all

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
it's important for he took up we're all

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.110 
it's important for he took up we're all
seeing<00:04:31.260> increased<00:04:31.980> competition<00:04:32.310> budget<00:04:32.940> and

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
seeing increased competition budget and

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.880 
seeing increased competition budget and
hopefully<00:04:33.570> improve<00:04:34.440> productivity

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
hopefully improve productivity

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.820 
hopefully improve productivity
productivity<00:04:35.850> from<00:04:36.600> them<00:04:36.810> having<00:04:37.650> another
