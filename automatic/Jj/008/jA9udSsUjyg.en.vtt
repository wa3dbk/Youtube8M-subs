00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
everything's acted on the mask the only

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.619 
everything's acted on the mask the only
the<00:00:56.960> only<00:00:56.989> downfall<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:57.890> this<00:00:58.010> mask<00:00:58.280> is

the only downfall to this mask is

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.240 
the only downfall to this mask is
probably<00:00:59.829> the<00:01:02.350> lightness<00:01:03.350> on<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.739> weathering

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.160 
probably the lightness on the weathering
around<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:05.350> cheekbones<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.830> forehead
