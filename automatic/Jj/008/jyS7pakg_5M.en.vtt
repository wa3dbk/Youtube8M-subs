00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
is after I see the icon I step off of it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.869 
is after I see the icon I step off of it
and<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.750> call<00:00:49.079> out<00:00:49.350> whatever<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.100> icon<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:50.579> so

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
and I call out whatever the icon was so

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.750 
and I call out whatever the icon was so
circle<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> dot<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.760> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
circle with a dot for this one and I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.580 
circle with a dot for this one and I
tell<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> people<00:00:55.020> who<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> other

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
tell the people who are on the other

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.709 
tell the people who are on the other
side<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> map<00:00:56.190> okay<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:57.000> find<00:00:57.180> circle<00:00:57.629> at

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
side of the map okay go find circle at

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.049 
side of the map okay go find circle at
the<00:00:57.780> dot<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:58.469> they<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.949> run<00:00:59.789> all

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the dot and then they have to run all

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.290 
the dot and then they have to run all
over<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.829> stones<00:01:02.489> until<00:01:02.760> they<00:01:02.940> find<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
over all the stones until they find the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.450 
over all the stones until they find the
one<00:01:03.420> that's<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.809> circle<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> dot<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.309> once

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
one that's a circle the dot and once

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.310 
one that's a circle the dot and once
they're<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.060> tell<00:01:06.299> me<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.869> step<00:01:07.140> on

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
they're on it they tell me and I step on

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.380 
they're on it they tell me and I step on
it<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.340> when<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.610> match<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.240> they

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it and so when you match the two they

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.070 
it and so when you match the two they
disappear<00:01:10.040> but<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.460> step<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.939> one<00:01:12.240> icon<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
disappear but if I step on one icon and

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.350 
disappear but if I step on one icon and
people<00:01:13.740> step<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.100> different<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:15.150> you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
people step on a different one then you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.230 
people step on a different one then you
get<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.900> resets<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> whole<00:01:17.070> stones<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
get to it resets the whole stones and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
get to it resets the whole stones and
you<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> redo<00:01:18.810> all<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.080> them<00:01:19.320> again<00:01:19.619> so

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you have to redo all of them again so

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
you have to redo all of them again so
that's<00:01:20.340> why<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> step<00:01:21.060> off<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.509> them

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that's why I have to step off of them

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.770 
that's why I have to step off of them
and<00:01:21.810> call<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.250> don't<00:01:23.729> touch<00:01:24.479> two

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and call it out so we don't touch two

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.260 
and call it out so we don't touch two
different<00:01:25.170> stones<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.610> redo<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> all

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
different stones and then redo it all

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.380 
different stones and then redo it all
it's<00:01:28.049> sounds<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.250> complicated<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:30.060> once

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it's sounds really complicated but once

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.420 
it's sounds really complicated but once
you<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:31.350> people<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.770> you're<00:01:31.950> doing<00:01:32.130> with

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
you get people that you're doing with

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.010 
you get people that you're doing with
make<00:01:33.119> sure<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:33.689> they're<00:01:33.990> doing

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
make sure they know what they're doing

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.859 
make sure they know what they're doing
also<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.829> explain<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.189> them<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.659> first

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
also and explain to them and at first

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.719 
also and explain to them and at first
it's<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.259> little<00:01:37.439> bit<00:01:37.530> confusing<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.280> first

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
it's a little bit confusing like first

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.800 
it's a little bit confusing like first
time<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.939> try<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.570> didn't<00:01:39.720> really

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
time I try to do it I didn't really

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.749 
time I try to do it I didn't really
understand<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.710> doing<00:01:41.040> because<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
understand what I was doing because the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.380 
understand what I was doing because the
person<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.270> tried<00:01:42.570> explaining<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.320> me<00:01:43.409> but

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
person is tried explaining it to me but

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.120 
person is tried explaining it to me but
after<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> first<00:01:45.630> time<00:01:45.960> you'll<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
after the first time you'll get it and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.219 
after the first time you'll get it and
it's<00:01:47.729> really<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.149> hard<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:49.079> long

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
it's really not that hard it's as long

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.480 
it's really not that hard it's as long
as<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> people<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.920> you're<00:01:50.009> playing<00:01:50.220> with

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
as the people that you're playing with

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.350 
as the people that you're playing with
no<00:01:50.759> they're<00:01:51.000> doing<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:52.460> yeah<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.180> have

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
no they're doing so yeah you just have

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.840 
no they're doing so yeah you just have
to<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.540> patient<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.860> think<00:01:56.700> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
to be patient and you can like think of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.219 
to be patient and you can like think of
whatever<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.270> want<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> call<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> symbols

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
whatever you want to call the symbols

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.319 
whatever you want to call the symbols
because<00:01:58.740> there's<00:01:59.430> some<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.850> them<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.090> that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
because there's some of them like that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.149 
because there's some of them like that
one<00:02:00.509> right<00:02:00.540> there<00:02:00.960> there's<00:02:01.530> another<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.009> looks

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
one right there there's another it looks

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.639 
one right there there's another it looks
really<00:02:02.369> similar<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.500> it's

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
really similar this one it's so it's

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.170 
really similar this one it's so it's
hard<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.890> describe<00:02:05.189> some<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.640> them<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:05.969> that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
hard to describe some of them like that

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.359 
hard to describe some of them like that
one<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.689> can<00:02:06.960> describe<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.469> as<00:02:07.590> anchors<00:02:08.069> what

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
one you can describe it as anchors what

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.859 
one you can describe it as anchors what
I<00:02:08.459> call<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
I call it and

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.080 
I call it and
there's<00:02:10.739> other<00:02:11.009> one<00:02:11.250> had<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.489> three<00:02:11.819> lines

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
there's other one had the three lines

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.869 
there's other one had the three lines
miss<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.840> then<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.530> there's<00:02:14.370> some<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.760> them

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
miss and then like there's some of them

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.160 
miss and then like there's some of them
that<00:02:15.030> don't<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> specific<00:02:15.629> name<00:02:16.110> like

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
that don't have a specific name like

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.100 
that don't have a specific name like
that's<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:17.159> one's<00:02:17.370> an<00:02:17.519> asteroid<00:02:18.110> asterisk

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
that's that one's an asteroid asterisk

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.030 
that's that one's an asteroid asterisk
or<00:02:19.769> something<00:02:20.069> like<00:02:20.159> that<00:02:20.360> but<00:02:21.709> yeah<00:02:22.709> it's

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
or something like that but yeah it's

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.809 
or something like that but yeah it's
just<00:02:23.459> try<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.150> be<00:02:24.360> specific<00:02:24.569> because<00:02:25.819> I've

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
just try to be specific because I've

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.319 
just try to be specific because I've
gone<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.110> near<00:02:28.500> end<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.159> said<00:02:29.519> like<00:02:29.730> line

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
gone to the near end and said like line

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.330 
gone to the near end and said like line
with<00:02:30.599> three<00:02:30.840> lines<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.500> stuff<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:31.950> and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
with three lines and stuff like that and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.130 
with three lines and stuff like that and
they<00:02:32.610> didn't<00:02:32.849> understand<00:02:33.299> what<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.540> meant<00:02:33.870> they

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
they didn't understand what I meant they

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.360 
they didn't understand what I meant they
thought<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.379> was<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.560> other<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.159> was<00:02:35.220> it

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
thought it was the other one that was it

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.979 
thought it was the other one that was it
like<00:02:35.519> anchors<00:02:36.030> what<00:02:36.180> i<00:02:36.239> called<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.629> but<00:02:37.700> that's

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
like anchors what i called it but that's

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.300 
like anchors what i called it but that's
pretty<00:02:39.989> much<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.290> only<00:02:40.470> way<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.069> mess<00:02:41.280> up

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
pretty much the only way you can mess up

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.309 
pretty much the only way you can mess up
as<00:02:41.730> long<00:02:42.239> as<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.629> know<00:02:42.780> what<00:02:42.930> you're<00:02:43.019> doing

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
as long as you know what you're doing

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.309 
as long as you know what you're doing
and<00:02:43.849> also<00:02:44.849> just<00:02:45.150> by<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.390> way<00:02:45.629> just<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.260> know

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
and also just by the way just you know

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.710 
and also just by the way just you know
you<00:02:47.160> have<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.519> be<00:02:47.609> an<00:02:47.760> eclipse<00:02:48.180> mode<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.569> do

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
you have to be an eclipse mode to do

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.780 
you have to be an eclipse mode to do
this<00:02:48.930> at<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.440> beginning<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:50.459> have<00:02:50.640> to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
this at the beginning you have to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.210 
this at the beginning you have to
re-enter<00:02:51.239> clips<00:02:51.750> mode<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:52.680> do<00:02:52.859> this<00:02:53.040> you

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
re-enter clips mode and then do this you

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.979 
re-enter clips mode and then do this you
have<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:53.640> for<00:02:53.849> all<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.060> steps<00:02:54.569> of<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
have to do that for all the steps of the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.530 
have to do that for all the steps of the
easter<00:02:55.379> egg<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.299> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
easter egg and so this is just the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.380 
easter egg and so this is just the
second<00:02:58.470> step<00:02:58.620> after<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.310> turn<00:02:59.700> equipment<00:03:00.299> on

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
second step after you turn equipment on

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.180 
second step after you turn equipment on
this<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:00.810> first<00:03:01.019> thing<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.290> do<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.769> then

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
this the first thing you do and then

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.250 
this the first thing you do and then
after<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.609> step<00:03:02.819> you'll<00:03:03.030> go<00:03:03.659> back<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
after this step you'll go back to the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.979 
after this step you'll go back to the
four<00:03:04.859> buttons<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.459> turn<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:06.090> clips<00:03:06.659> mode<00:03:06.840> on

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
four buttons and turn the clips mode on

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.410 
four buttons and turn the clips mode on
again<00:03:07.290> but<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:08.280> all<00:03:08.459> for<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:08.790> step<00:03:09.150> guys

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
again but that's all for this step guys

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.479 
again but that's all for this step guys
so<00:03:09.780> thanks<00:03:10.109> for<00:03:10.200> watching<00:03:10.620> stay<00:03:11.099> tuned<00:03:11.310> for
