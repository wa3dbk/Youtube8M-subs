photography in a bar type setting and

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.540 
photography in a bar type setting and
it's<00:03:26.280> really<00:03:26.730> kind<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.030> hard<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.810> instruct

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
it's really kind of hard to instruct

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.130 
it's really kind of hard to instruct
when<00:03:29.550> you're<00:03:29.670> not<00:03:29.820> actually<00:03:30.030> there<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.900> really

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
when you're not actually there it really

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.080 
when you're not actually there it really
does<00:03:31.470> take<00:03:31.800> a<00:03:32.010> certain<00:03:32.489> level<00:03:32.850> of<00:03:32.910> experience

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
does take a certain level of experience

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.860 
does take a certain level of experience
and<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:34.200> certain<00:03:34.500> level<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:35.150> just<00:03:36.150> doing<00:03:36.570> the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
and a certain level of just doing the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.080 
and a certain level of just doing the
damn<00:03:37.020> things<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.770> to<00:03:37.830> speak<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.400> sometimes

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
damn things so to speak and sometimes

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.060 
damn things so to speak and sometimes
even<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.600> don't<00:03:39.660> get<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.110> right<00:03:40.260> sometimes<00:03:40.590> I'll

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
even I don't get it right sometimes I'll

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.070 
even I don't get it right sometimes I'll
take<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> bunch<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.730> pictures<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.239> I'm

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
take a bunch of pictures and I'm

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.900 
take a bunch of pictures and I'm
thinking<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.980> they're<00:03:44.160> gonna<00:03:44.280> be<00:03:44.459> pretty

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
thinking that they're gonna be pretty

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.210 
thinking that they're gonna be pretty
good<00:03:45.090> or<00:03:45.420> at<00:03:45.870> least<00:03:46.080> if<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.380> if<00:03:46.709> I've<00:03:46.920> gotten

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
good or at least if I if I've gotten

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.759 
good or at least if I if I've gotten
them<00:03:47.280> in<00:03:47.430> RAW<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:48.480> they'll<00:03:48.720> turn<00:03:48.870> out<00:03:49.019> ok<00:03:49.290> but

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
them in RAW that they'll turn out ok but

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.350 
them in RAW that they'll turn out ok but
really<00:03:49.950> sometimes<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.790> lighting<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.180> just

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
really sometimes the lighting is just

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.210 
really sometimes the lighting is just
it's<00:03:51.630> not<00:03:51.840> gonna<00:03:52.019> cooperate<00:03:52.560> with<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.920> so

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
it's not gonna cooperate with you so

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.070 
it's not gonna cooperate with you so
overcoming<00:03:53.820> those<00:03:53.910> challenges<00:03:53.970> are<00:03:54.660> always

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
overcoming those challenges are always

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.710 
overcoming those challenges are always
going<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.290> be<00:03:55.470> one<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.160> your<00:03:56.340> biggest

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
going to be one of your biggest

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.449 
going to be one of your biggest
challenges<00:03:57.720> because<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.680> are<00:03:58.890> never<00:03:59.220> going

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
challenges because you are never going

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.550 
challenges because you are never going
to<00:03:59.519> be<00:03:59.640> fully<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.180> control<00:04:00.330> unless<00:04:01.230> you're<00:04:01.470> in

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
to be fully in control unless you're in

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.410 
to be fully in control unless you're in
a<00:04:01.650> studio<00:04:01.830> setting

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.940 

so<00:04:06.420> this<00:04:06.660> week's<00:04:06.870> photo<00:04:07.080> assignment<00:04:07.410> actually

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
it could be a few weeks so I'm actually

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.410

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
business and then that'll be three years

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.900 
business and then that'll be three years
I've<00:04:21.810> had<00:04:21.959> this<00:04:22.109> Mac<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.340> need<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.580> get<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.790> in

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
I've had this Mac so I need to get it in

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.190 
I've had this Mac so I need to get it in
and<00:04:24.180> I've<00:04:24.270> never<00:04:24.419> once<00:04:24.660> had<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.870> take<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.110> in

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
and I've never once had to take it in

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.590 
and I've never once had to take it in
but<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.680> figured<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.280> should<00:04:26.310> at<00:04:26.880> least<00:04:27.060> do<00:04:27.330> this

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
but I figured I should at least do this

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.520 
but I figured I should at least do this
one<00:04:27.960> time<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:29.160> get<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.430> all<00:04:29.580> cleaned<00:04:29.880> up<00:04:30.000> so

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
one time and get it all cleaned up so
