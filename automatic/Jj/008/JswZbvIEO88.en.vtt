00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
too too bad but and I didn't really know

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.360 
too too bad but and I didn't really know
the<00:00:33.630> pace<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.410> kind<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.860> trying<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> do

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the pace and just kind of trying to do

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.709 
the pace and just kind of trying to do
clean<00:00:35.640> laps<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:37.320> then<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:38.040> knew<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> was<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.450> pace

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
clean laps and then I knew I was on pace

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.660 
clean laps and then I knew I was on pace
to<00:00:39.750> do<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.200> extra<00:00:40.469> lap<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.010> worst<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.520> was

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
to do the extra lap so at worst it was

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.369 
to do the extra lap so at worst it was
going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:42.030> Third<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> didn't<00:00:42.899> remember

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
going to be Third but I didn't remember

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.500 
going to be Third but I didn't remember
the<00:00:43.710> time<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.309> high<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.550> Ryan<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.239> set<00:00:45.480> so

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the time that's high and Ryan it set so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.319 
the time that's high and Ryan it set so
the<00:00:45.840> last<00:00:45.989> lap<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.680> tried<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.700> as<00:00:47.940> fast<00:00:48.120> as

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the last lap just tried going as fast as

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.869 
the last lap just tried going as fast as
I<00:00:48.450> could<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.739> really<00:00:49.920> charged<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.670> line

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
I could and like really charged the line

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.299 
I could and like really charged the line
and<00:00:51.239> come<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> find<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:52.500> actually<00:00:52.800> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and come to find out it was actually a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.029 
and come to find out it was actually a
much<00:00:54.120> bigger<00:00:54.390> margin<00:00:54.719> than<00:00:54.960> i<00:00:55.170> expected<00:00:55.559> i

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
much bigger margin than i expected i

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.139 
much bigger margin than i expected i
thought<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> was<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.699> pretty<00:00:56.850> close

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
thought it was going to be pretty close

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.729 
thought it was going to be pretty close
but<00:00:57.480> i<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.840> ended<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.170> almost<00:00:58.350> four

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
but i think it ended up almost four

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
but i think it ended up almost four
seconds<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.239> didn't<00:01:00.510> go<00:01:00.600> into<00:01:00.750> you'll

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
seconds so so you didn't go into you'll

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.319 
seconds so so you didn't go into you'll
qualify<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:02.010> looking<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.460> TQ<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.180> ran

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
qualify you know looking for TQ just ran

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.119 
qualify you know looking for TQ just ran
your<00:01:03.510> pace<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.589> ended<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:04.890> being

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
your pace and they just ended up being

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.850 
your pace and they just ended up being
processed<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.970> mean<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> race<00:01:06.990> being<00:01:07.290> two

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
processed I mean with the race being two

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
processed I mean with the race being two
out<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.040> three<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:09.030> anything<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.810> happen<00:01:10.049> so

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
out of three it's anything can happen so

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
out of three it's anything can happen so
in<00:01:11.880> most<00:01:12.119> races<00:01:12.630> where<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.080> two<00:01:13.439> out<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> four

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
in most races where it's two out of four

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.730 
in most races where it's two out of four
or<00:01:14.369> three<00:01:14.610> out<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.760> five<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.650> go

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
know not only consistent runs but also

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.179 
know not only consistent runs but also
really<00:01:21.750> fast<00:01:22.110> runs<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.500> two<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.860> three<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
really fast runs but two out of three a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.010 
really fast runs but two out of three a
lot<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.610> times<00:01:23.790> people<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.150> problems<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
lot of times people have problems and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
felt really good in a little bit of

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.090 
felt really good in a little bit of
practice<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.840> had<00:01:33.960> yesterday<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.590> track<00:01:34.829> was

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
practice we had yesterday the track was

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.330 
practice we had yesterday the track was
quite<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> bit<00:01:36.210> different<00:01:36.540> today<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:37.340> overall

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
quite a bit different today but overall

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
quite a bit different today but overall
it<00:01:38.520> was<00:01:38.640> good<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.329> felt<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:39.780> though<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.930> was

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it was good and I felt as though I was

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.819 
it was good and I felt as though I was
on<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> pretty<00:01:41.220> solid<00:01:41.490> pace<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.150> didn't<00:01:42.420> know

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
on a pretty solid pace but didn't know

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.749 
on a pretty solid pace but didn't know
you<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.159> would<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.399> something<00:01:44.670> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
you know that I would be something to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.539 
you know that I would be something to
contend<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.329> TQ<00:01:45.780> how're<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.560> finding<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
track the layouts is a challenging was

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.080 
track the layouts is a challenging was
it<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.950> track<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.700> changing

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
it just the track you know it's changing

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.420 
it just the track you know it's changing
all<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.210> time<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:52.049> challenging<00:01:52.799> because<00:01:52.920> of

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
all the time it's challenging because of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.399 
all the time it's challenging because of
all<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> work<00:01:54.149> they<00:01:54.360> had<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
all the work they had to do in like the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.740 
all the work they had to do in like the
little<00:01:55.530> footprints<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.509> dirts

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
little footprints and you know the dirts

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.270 
little footprints and you know the dirts
really<00:01:58.020> sticky<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.829> stick<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.159> their

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
really sticky so it's stick to their

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.590 
really sticky so it's stick to their
feet<00:01:59.460> when<00:01:59.640> they're<00:01:59.759> working<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> track

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
feet when they're working on the track

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.160 
feet when they're working on the track
the<00:02:01.560> overall<00:02:01.890> layout<00:02:02.130> itself<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:03.170> it's

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the overall layout itself is it's

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.560 
the overall layout itself is it's
challenging<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.310> not<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.729> technical<00:02:06.420> as

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
challenging but it's not as technical as

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.729 
challenging but it's not as technical as
it<00:02:07.079> has<00:02:07.290> been<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:08.250> some<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.700> years<00:02:08.940> past<00:02:09.209> but

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
it has been in in some of years past but

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.510 
it has been in in some of years past but
because<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.099> surface

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
because of the surface

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.160 
because of the surface
it<00:02:12.820> really<00:02:13.210> kind<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.510> keeps<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:13.960> your<00:02:13.990> toes

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
it really kind of keeps you on your toes

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.320 
it really kind of keeps you on your toes
I<00:02:14.560> think<00:02:14.710> it's<00:02:14.830> good<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.340> we're<00:02:15.820> able<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.180> run

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
I think it's good that we're able to run

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.660 
I think it's good that we're able to run
truckee<00:02:16.780> first<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.950> kind<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.250> knock<00:02:18.460> the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
truckee first to kind of knock the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.720 
truckee first to kind of knock the
little<00:02:18.910> bumps<00:02:19.210> down<00:02:20.070> because<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:21.310> think<00:02:21.520> buggy

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
little bumps down because I think buggy

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.580 
little bumps down because I think buggy
is<00:02:21.910> going<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.150> be<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.660> little<00:02:23.020> bit<00:02:23.170> more<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.530> a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
is going to be a little bit more of a

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.350 
is going to be a little bit more of a
handful<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.250> having<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.640> narrower<00:02:24.970> stance

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
handful just having the narrower stance

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.110 
handful just having the narrower stance
and<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.530> little<00:02:26.650> ripples<00:02:27.190> because<00:02:27.580> you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
and all the little ripples because you

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.210 
and all the little ripples because you
go<00:02:28.300> through<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.630> turn<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.170> initially<00:02:30.100> it

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
go through the turn and initially it

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.890 
go through the turn and initially it
feels<00:02:30.460> really<00:02:30.670> smooth<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.300> as<00:02:31.450> soon<00:02:31.630> as<00:02:31.780> you

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
feels really smooth and as soon as you

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.780 
feels really smooth and as soon as you
start<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.320> slide<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.800> then<00:02:32.950> kind<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.310> catches

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
start to slide it then kind of catches

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.120 
start to slide it then kind of catches
the<00:02:33.940> little<00:02:34.180> ripples<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:35.560> tomorrow<00:02:35.890> should<00:02:36.070> be

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
the little ripples so tomorrow should be

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.490 
the little ripples so tomorrow should be
interesting<00:02:36.540> talk<00:02:37.540> about<00:02:37.750> tomorrow<00:02:37.960> we're

interesting talk about tomorrow we're

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.650 
interesting talk about tomorrow we're
