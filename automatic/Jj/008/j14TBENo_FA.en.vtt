00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 we will join the front to the part 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.950
 back aligning the seam of the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.890
 crotch and we are joining the rights 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.240
 of the cloth 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.940
 making them coincide until reaching the 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.400
 low for now we make only one of the 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.200
 sides and we start sewing from the 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.840
 center respecting our margin of 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.550
 sewing this piece may cost you 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.850
 a little because there is enough thickness of 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.850
 cloth 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.440
 we see that our sewing has 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.620
 stayed well and well aligned and we do 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.289
 the same with the other side 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.949
 joining the two parties from the 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:50.230
 crotch until the bass we started to 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.570
 sew on putting the stitching about 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.170
 centimeters to the previous seam of the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 another leg 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.370
 we have gone to all the margins and the 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.400
 We ironed towards the front of 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.920
 our pants always iron by 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.350
 the outside of our garment pushing 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.820
 well the stitching up we're going to 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.190
 do the bridge leg press 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.710
 inside but before hammering this 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.780
 because there is a lot of fabric thickness what 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.940
 you cover with a piece of cloth so you do not 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.940
 damage the heavens and give it strong 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.860
 we started at the bottom of one of the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.720
 legs and we're doing all the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.970
 travel to the bottom of the other 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.480
 sewing up our margin of 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.480
 sewing 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.430
 and especially watching this area as 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.090
 of the thickness of cloth can play us 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.090
 some bad 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.220
 and when you have the first one we do what 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.220
 same with the second person 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.390
 once stitched we will close the 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.140
 side seams joining the part 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.040
 back to the front aligning well 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.680
 from the bottom to the waistband and 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.390
 we sew with a single short stitch thread and 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.390
 respecting the seam allowance 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.100
 and we have finished the edges with a zig 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.930
 zag and iron the seam allowance 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.930
 towards the back of the pants 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.280
 hammer in the union with the yoke and the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.260
 end of pocket and we will make a stitching 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.480
 well to the edge until the end of the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.670
 cloth pocket you can notice when 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.160
 touch with the zipper lowered and the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.280
 well open trousers we sew right to 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.080
 watchful edge of sewing only a part 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.319
 it can not be by accident to the other 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.319
 leg 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.760
 you can choose the fabric with your hands 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:12.030
 to make sure that there is nothing 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.030
 below when you reach your brand we attack 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.430
 we can not get to be low then 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.950
 we already have the seam of the legs 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.380
 closed but only with this piece already 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.330
 we reinforce a bit and keep the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.100
 seam margins to the side 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.100
 desired so that they do not move
