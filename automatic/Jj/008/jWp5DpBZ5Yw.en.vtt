00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.609
 dear spectator wants one comes 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.130
 further follow incredible moves with me 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.580
 with the classic way and today 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.929
 I have a slightly different position here 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.089
 we have seen otherwise 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.070
 most of the time the creation has one 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.270
 directly what could win 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.029
 so about and then it did with 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.510
 wonderful trains today is a bit 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.420
 different 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:34.230
 the lot net with the off against 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.670
 Kharkov plays the rust on 1962 and me 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.890
 I will not ask you this one again 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.410
 you want to play here I would 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.050
 He simply sacrifices himself and sacrifices himself 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.840
 the lady so then we attacked and 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.340
 he now hit f6 outside that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 I find here very courageous decision 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.550
 but that too, somewhere 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.359
 Although justified, it only holds two 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.039
 easy figures for the lady but one 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.060
 beautiful runners on the 400 beautiful 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.770
 falls on the fans and black plays 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.810
 her right way still hose 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.680
 jump two chess first would on 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.689
 beat f6 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.159
 this would be the catwalk right here 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.310
 springer the five springer mallets 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.770
 six are coming and the white ones are light 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.360
 Figures are all very well the targets 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.640
 all against the black king and are 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.100
 very dominant and in the game it went 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.479
 continue with springer e2 chess which is good 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.970
 is what the jumpers here again 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.939
 distracts and white tempo loses 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.880
 but nonetheless brings here the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.040
 springer back to d5 and was able to 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.930
 the follow here the partie to also 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.939
 I win if I consider the game 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.259
 maybe again in detail 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.180
 therefore I do not show analyzed 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.509
 there are exactly 17 more trains 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.149
 but this idea is simple 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.159
 to sacrifice the lady for two easy figure 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.820
 just what he usually does not realize 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.310
 is sufficient to say okay me 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.799
 I have very nice figures here and me 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.610
 can pressure and I try that 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.610
 off and 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.370
 This courage has also paid off 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.270
 made in the lot so very 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.590
 interesting idea of necmettin on ok 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.890
 Until next time 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.890
 take care
