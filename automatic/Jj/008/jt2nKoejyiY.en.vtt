00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
tomato plants so we have our tomato

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.350 
tomato plants so we have our tomato
plants<00:00:07.859> growing<00:00:08.069> here<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.610> our<00:00:08.730> Polly<00:00:09.000> total

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
plants growing here in our Polly total

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.900 
plants growing here in our Polly total
and<00:00:09.860> one<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:10.980> first<00:00:11.160> things<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.519> consider

and one of the first things to consider

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.660 
and one of the first things to consider
with<00:00:12.210> an<00:00:12.480> tomatoes<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.049> feeding<00:00:13.469> them<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.549> you

can lead to the tomato splitting or if

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.299 
can lead to the tomato splitting or if
you<00:01:00.480> over<00:01:00.719> water<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.199> meet<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.530> blossom<00:01:02.070> and

rush<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.140> next<00:01:04.290> thing<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:05.040> terms

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
rush now the next thing really in terms

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.370 
rush now the next thing really in terms
of<00:01:05.549> maintaining<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.540> Tomatoes<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
of maintaining your Tomatoes is the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.469 
of maintaining your Tomatoes is the
process<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> pinching<00:01:08.250> ocean<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.760> we'll<00:01:09.240> show

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
process of pinching ocean and we'll show

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.359 
process of pinching ocean and we'll show
you<00:01:09.510> how<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.920> idea<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
you how to do that and the idea of

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.010 
you how to do that and the idea of
pinching<00:01:11.909> out<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.479> reduce<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
pinching out is just to reduce the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.609 
pinching out is just to reduce the
number<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.350> stems<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.390> therefore<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.900> focus

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
number of stems and therefore to focus

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.560 
number of stems and therefore to focus
all<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.009> energy<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> certain<00:01:18.180> number<00:01:18.390> of

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
all the energy on a certain number of

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.690 
all the energy on a certain number of
tomatoes<00:01:19.049> giving<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.530> good<00:01:19.770> right<00:01:20.189> plants

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
tomatoes giving you good right plants

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
tomatoes giving you good right plants
are<00:01:20.939> close<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.170> i<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.350> bring<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.009> here

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
are close so if i just bring you in here

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.070 
are close so if i just bring you in here
to<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> center<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> pads<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.810> see

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
to the center of the pads you can see

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.870 
to the center of the pads you can see
these<00:01:25.259> smaller<00:01:25.619> shoots<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.400> coming<00:01:26.790> out

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
these smaller shoots here coming out

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.920 
these smaller shoots here coming out
from<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.130> center<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.369> two<00:01:29.640> stems<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.750> i'm<00:01:30.869> just

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
from the center of two stems so i'm just

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.010 
from the center of two stems so i'm just
going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.350> simply<00:01:32.070> take<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.630> place

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
going to simply take this one here place

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
going to simply take this one here place
i'm<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.130> using<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.579> finger<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:35.909> your

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
i'm just using your finger on your

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.760 
i'm just using your finger on your
tongue<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.049> squeeze<00:01:37.350> them<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
tongue you can just squeeze them and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.240 
tongue you can just squeeze them and
pull<00:01:37.950> them<00:01:37.979> off<00:01:38.990> ok<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.860> i'll<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.009> continue

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
pull them off ok so i'll just continue

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:51.870 
pull them off ok so i'll just continue
the<00:01:41.610> process<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.299> number<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.049> need<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.060 

I'm<00:01:52.880> even<00:01:53.420> lower<00:01:53.630> branches<00:01:54.170> stems<00:01:54.590> like<00:01:54.830> this

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
I'm even lower branches stems like this

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.490 
I'm even lower branches stems like this
can<00:01:55.460> be<00:01:55.580> removed<00:01:55.850> over<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.720> course<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.140> time<00:01:57.290> you

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
can be removed over a course of time you

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.080 
can be removed over a course of time you
can<00:01:57.620> see<00:01:57.740> this<00:01:57.860> is<00:01:58.010> beginning<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.430> yellow<00:01:58.880> and

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
can see this is beginning to yellow and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.210 
can see this is beginning to yellow and
there's<00:01:59.570> not<00:01:59.720> much<00:01:59.960> a<00:02:00.200> benefit<00:02:00.800> of<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:01.010> leaf

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
there's not much a benefit of a leaf

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.250 
there's not much a benefit of a leaf
like<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:01.730> so<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.330> can<00:02:02.450> really<00:02:02.750> just<00:02:02.960> pinch

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
like this so you can really just pinch

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.560 
like this so you can really just pinch
this<00:02:03.440> one<00:02:03.680> out<00:02:03.860> as<00:02:04.010> well<00:02:04.160> I'll<00:02:05.090> just<00:02:05.270> do<00:02:05.420> that

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
this one out as well I'll just do that

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.920 
this one out as well I'll just do that
here<00:02:05.780> now<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.730> one<00:02:07.910> would<00:02:08.600> have<00:02:08.690> gone<00:02:08.869> a

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
here now and that one would have gone a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.150 
here now and that one would have gone a
lot<00:02:09.080> more<00:02:09.290> yellow<00:02:09.650> and<00:02:09.830> if<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.010> have

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
lot more yellow and if you have

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.770 
lot more yellow and if you have
yellowing<00:02:10.670> leaves<00:02:10.700> under<00:02:11.090> tomato<00:02:11.420> plants

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
yellowing leaves under tomato plants

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.540 
yellowing leaves under tomato plants
tissue<00:02:11.990> removed<00:02:12.500> straight<00:02:12.770> away<00:02:12.950> you're<00:02:13.370> just

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
tissue removed straight away you're just

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.670 
tissue removed straight away you're just
taking<00:02:13.670> energy<00:02:13.970> from<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.420> facts<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:15.350> can<00:02:15.500> see

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
taking energy from the facts you can see

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.800 
taking energy from the facts you can see
up<00:02:15.830> here<00:02:15.860> now<00:02:16.190> we<00:02:16.340> have<00:02:16.460> another<00:02:16.580> sm<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.660> be

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
up here now we have another sm to be

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.740 
up here now we have another sm to be
removed<00:02:18.110> using<00:02:18.470> paint<00:02:19.190> shame<00:02:19.400> out<00:02:19.550> there<00:02:19.820> and

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
removed using paint shame out there and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.870 
removed using paint shame out there and
then<00:02:21.200> here<00:02:21.440> are<00:02:21.530> two<00:02:21.650> base<00:02:21.830> just<00:02:22.400> as<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.640> begin

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
then here are two base just as you begin

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.940 
then here are two base just as you begin
to<00:02:22.940> emerge<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.660> should<00:02:23.840> be<00:02:23.930> tinder<00:02:24.320> pitch

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
to emerge you should be tinder pitch

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.430 
to emerge you should be tinder pitch
down<00:02:25.330> some<00:02:26.330> at<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.480> back<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:28.960> think<00:02:29.960> that's<00:02:30.110> all

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
down some at the back I think that's all

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.610 
down some at the back I think that's all
of<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.830> stems<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.400> be<00:02:31.520> pinched<00:02:31.880> out<00:02:32.560> now<00:02:33.560> the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
of the stems to be pinched out now the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.260 
of the stems to be pinched out now the
next<00:02:33.800> thing<00:02:34.070> then<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.490> consider<00:02:34.820> is<00:02:35.000> how<00:02:35.030> many

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
next thing then to consider is how many

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.150 
next thing then to consider is how many
fruiting<00:02:35.990> trusses<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.800> want<00:02:36.980> on<00:02:37.100> your

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
fruiting trusses that you want on your

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.090 
fruiting trusses that you want on your
plans<00:02:37.460> and<00:02:37.700> ideally<00:02:38.480> for<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.140> your<00:02:39.680> tomatoes

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
plans and ideally for a your tomatoes

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.650 
plans and ideally for a your tomatoes
too<00:02:40.220> ripe<00:02:40.430> enough<00:02:40.610> for<00:02:40.970> them<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.180> get<00:02:41.420> large

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
too ripe enough for them to get large

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.050 
too ripe enough for them to get large
Tomatoes<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.770> want<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.010> reduce<00:02:43.280> your<00:02:43.340> number

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
Tomatoes you want to reduce your number

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.420 
Tomatoes you want to reduce your number
of<00:02:44.150> stems<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.690> four<00:02:44.960> or<00:02:45.140> five<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.160> plant

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
of stems to four or five so this plant

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.520 
of stems to four or five so this plant
has<00:02:46.580> currently<00:02:46.970> about<00:02:47.150> six<00:02:47.450> stems<00:02:47.750> on<00:02:48.020> it<00:02:48.140> so

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
has currently about six stems on it so

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.650 
has currently about six stems on it so
we<00:02:48.650> caught<00:02:48.920> me<00:02:49.070> remove<00:02:49.430> one<00:02:50.030> or<00:02:50.060> two<00:02:50.330> these

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
we caught me remove one or two these

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.110 
we caught me remove one or two these
stems<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:52.300> encourage<00:02:53.650> focus<00:02:54.650> energy<00:02:54.860> on<00:02:55.130> the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
stems to encourage focus energy on the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.930 
stems to encourage focus energy on the
remaining<00:02:56.480> stems<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.890> just<00:02:58.100> removed<00:02:58.400> ones<00:02:58.790> in

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
remaining stems so just removed ones in

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.940 
remaining stems so just removed ones in
here<00:02:58.970> now<00:02:59.270> Jerry<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.959> lower<00:03:00.140> once<00:03:00.440> or<00:03:00.709> didn't

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
here now Jerry the lower once or didn't

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.740 
here now Jerry the lower once or didn't
somebody<00:03:01.160> isn't<00:03:01.459> going<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.820> get<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.660> we

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
somebody isn't going to get to so we

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.250 
somebody isn't going to get to so we
have<00:03:02.870> one<00:03:03.050> two<00:03:03.380> three<00:03:03.489> four<00:03:04.489> five<00:03:04.810> six<00:03:05.810> stems

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
have one two three four five six stems

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.410 
have one two three four five six stems
remaining<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:07.700> would<00:03:07.880> be<00:03:07.910> an<00:03:08.090> okay

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
remaining so that would be an okay

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.640 
remaining so that would be an okay
amount<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.810> keep<00:03:09.020> on<00:03:09.170> your<00:03:09.200> tomato<00:03:09.560> plants
