"My name is Trajen Head and I'm a graduate
student in the research lab of Dr. Sylvia

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.640
Daunert at the University of Miami in the
department of biochemistry and molecular biology.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.710
What I'm working on in the research lab is
very technical but can be looked at in a very

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.210
basic way.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.120
It's widely known that DNA is the basic foundation
for everything we see around us.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.060
All the living organisms, everything we observe
in the living world is based on DNA.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.289
What I am able to do in this research lab
is I'm able to take the DNA of the micro-organisms

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.000
and I'm able to change that DNA in such a
way that those organisms will then do work

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.410
for me.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.129
One project that I'm working on right now
is to take these small molecules to target

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.330
injured and dying cells within living tissues.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.110
So you think a tumor for example, in cancer.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.780
When you want to kill that tumor you specifically
target those tissues and you try to kill them

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.610
because the tumor is something that is actually
bad for you.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.950
With what I do, I can isolate these small
molecules that these microorganisms are producing

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.420
for me, I can add them to the tumor, and they
will generate light if the tumorous tissues

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.780
are dying.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.970
So it's a way for us to actually visualize
that these treatments are either working or

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.930
being ineffective.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.790
And that is huge.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.360
If you're able to actually see, visually see
that treatments are working.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.810
I grew up in a small town in Indiana.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.490
The introduction to science for me really
didn't happen until I got to be about four

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.950
or five and I started to go into work with
my mom who was a librarian at the time.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.090
And I would go into town with her and spend
all of my afternoons in the library.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.500
Learning has always been my major drive.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.810
It's really what's driven me to the point
where I am today and it's made a lot of my

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.129
life decisions very clear for me because I've
known that what I wanted to do is acquire

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.410
as much knowledge as I can and be able to
pass that knowledge on.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:32.409
Because for me, the most important thing you
can do is pass on what you have gained intellectually

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.730
to future generations.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.900
A few years from now, hopefully, with any
luck, I will have earned my PHD and I will

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.490
be looking for teaching positions at the university
level.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.060
I want to become a university professor and
I want to help other students who might be

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.270
interested in teaching, who might be interested
in medicine, who might be interested in law.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.989
I want to help them change the way they look
at things, and the way they do things in their

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.040
future.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.489
For me the greatest thing that I can do is
to make a difference in something.

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.599
If that is a new technology that I helped
create, or a new tool that I help with medical

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.049
diagnostics, or even just a way to change
the way people think about things.

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.810
If I can change something about the way the
world works now, then that's the greatest

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:36.220
accomplishment that I could hope for."
