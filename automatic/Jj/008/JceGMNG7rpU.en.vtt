that<00:01:59.399> will<00:01:59.640> get<00:02:00.119> into<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> egg<00:02:00.719> later

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.290 

so<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:05.930> steer<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:06.770> potato<00:02:07.190> sort<00:02:07.729> of<00:02:07.790> like<00:02:07.970> to

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
so I steer this potato sort of like to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.749 
so I steer this potato sort of like to
three<00:02:08.660> times<00:02:08.990> they<00:02:09.259> are<00:02:09.350> nearly<00:02:09.800> there<00:02:10.280> while

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
three times they are nearly there while

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.900 
three times they are nearly there while
this<00:02:10.940> finishes<00:02:11.180> I'm<00:02:11.660> just<00:02:12.020> going<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.290> break<00:02:13.190> 6

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
this finishes I'm just going to break 6

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.540 
this finishes I'm just going to break 6
X<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.780> may<00:02:15.170> look<00:02:15.410> like<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.650> lot<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:15.950> eggs<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.459> a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
X it may look like a lot of eggs and a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.490 
X it may look like a lot of eggs and a
lot<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.850> potatoes<00:02:17.420> but<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.900> only<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.319> going

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
lot of potatoes but this only is going

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.559 
lot of potatoes but this only is going
to<00:02:18.620> serve<00:02:18.890> four<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.850> six<00:02:20.120> people

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
to serve four to six people

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.220 
to serve four to six people
so<00:02:20.959> this<00:02:21.170> potato<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:22.010> now<00:02:22.790> ready<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:24.200> can

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
so this potato is now ready and you can

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.040 
so this potato is now ready and you can
see<00:02:24.680> just<00:02:24.890> by<00:02:25.010> breaking<00:02:25.580> through<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.300> put<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
see just by breaking through it put the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.229 
see just by breaking through it put the
potato<00:02:27.470> on<00:02:27.590> top<00:02:27.650> drain<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.520> potatoes<00:02:28.670> with

wonderful how caramelized the potatoes

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.320 
wonderful how caramelized the potatoes
nicely<00:02:35.000> fried<00:02:35.239> and<00:02:35.600> now<00:02:36.459> these<00:02:37.459> potatoes<00:02:38.150> are

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
nicely fried and now these potatoes are

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.090

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
the ones which I'm going to season with

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.210 
the ones which I'm going to season with
a<00:02:40.250> bit<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.700> sea<00:02:41.450> salt<00:02:41.480> not<00:02:42.410> whisking<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.100> egg

a bit of sea salt not whisking the egg
give<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.610> little<00:02:43.850> mix<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:45.230> has<00:02:45.830> become

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
give it a little mix this has become

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.640 
give it a little mix this has become
quite<00:02:46.489> warm<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.390> just<00:02:47.690> warned<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.290> potato

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
quite warm and I just warned the potato

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.830 
quite warm and I just warned the potato
to<00:02:48.890> soak<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.160> bit<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.670> eggs<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.150> on<00:02:50.420> linger

to soak a bit of the eggs and on linger

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.680 
to soak a bit of the eggs and on linger
together<00:02:51.230> if<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.709> cook<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.010> too<00:02:52.069> quickly<00:02:52.690> it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
together if you cook it too quickly it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.600 
together if you cook it too quickly it
won't<00:02:54.050> taste<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.500> same<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.190> may<00:02:55.370> look

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
won't taste the same and it may look

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.449 
won't taste the same and it may look
like<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:56.060> quite<00:02:56.450> runny<00:02:56.840> but<00:02:57.260> after<00:02:57.560> 15-20

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
like it's quite runny but after 15-20

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.790 
like it's quite runny but after 15-20
minutes<00:02:58.819> you'll<00:02:59.150> see<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.840> it<00:03:00.019> won't<00:03:00.260> be<00:03:00.410> so

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
minutes you'll see that it won't be so

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.199 
minutes you'll see that it won't be so
I'm<00:03:00.860> just<00:03:01.040> going<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.340> cover<00:03:01.550> it<00:03:01.730> with<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.910> bit<00:03:02.120> of

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
I'm just going to cover it with a bit of

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.150 
I'm just going to cover it with a bit of
aluminium<00:03:02.360> foil<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.140> let<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.650> rest<00:03:03.830> for<00:03:03.950> 15

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
aluminium foil and let it rest for 15

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
aluminium foil and let it rest for 15
minutes<00:03:09.970> okay

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
minutes okay

this torpedo mix have been resting for

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.449 
this torpedo mix have been resting for
about<00:03:13.790> 15-20<00:03:14.480> minutes<00:03:15.170> it's<00:03:15.440> not<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:16.160> runny

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
about 15-20 minutes it's not that runny

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.610 
about 15-20 minutes it's not that runny
anymore<00:03:16.970> take<00:03:17.269> a<00:03:17.329> look<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:18.049> has<00:03:18.260> sort<00:03:18.590> of

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
anymore take a look it has sort of

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.920 
anymore take a look it has sort of
thickened<00:03:19.190> up<00:03:19.340> all<00:03:19.610> those<00:03:20.060> burn<00:03:20.360> bits<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.810> the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
thickened up all those burn bits of the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.620 
thickened up all those burn bits of the
caramelization<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:21.920> onion<00:03:22.250> has<00:03:22.790> dissolve

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
caramelization of the onion has dissolve

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.500 
caramelization of the onion has dissolve
in<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.079> egg<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.829> nonstick<00:03:25.280> pan<00:03:25.579> and<00:03:26.000> all

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
in the egg I have a nonstick pan and all

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.039 
in the egg I have a nonstick pan and all
the<00:03:26.750> tortilla<00:03:27.530> mix<00:03:27.890> goes<00:03:28.430> inside<00:03:28.850> then<00:03:29.810> just

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
the tortilla mix goes inside then just

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.690 
the tortilla mix goes inside then just
we<00:03:30.200> are<00:03:30.320> just<00:03:30.500> going<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.739> leave<00:03:30.860> it<00:03:30.890> on<00:03:31.100> high

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
we are just going to leave it on high

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.810 
we are just going to leave it on high
heat<00:03:31.730> for<00:03:32.299> about<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.049> minute<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.799> then<00:03:33.890> lower

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
heat for about a minute and then lower

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.930 
heat for about a minute and then lower
it<00:03:35.000> down<00:03:35.150> for<00:03:35.750> about<00:03:35.989> two<00:03:36.530> minutes<00:03:36.709> we'll<00:03:37.700> flip

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
it down for about two minutes we'll flip

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.750 
it down for about two minutes we'll flip
it<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.329> do<00:03:38.570> exactly<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.079> same

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.790 

it's<00:03:42.760> been<00:03:42.940> like<00:03:43.030> two<00:03:43.510> three<00:03:43.720> minutes<00:03:43.959> already

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
it's been like two three minutes already

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.110 
it's been like two three minutes already
and<00:03:44.950> I'm<00:03:45.069> just<00:03:45.250> going<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.580> check<00:03:45.819> that<00:03:45.849> it's

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
and I'm just going to check that it's

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.110 
and I'm just going to check that it's
not<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.300> sticking<00:03:46.780> just<00:03:46.930> by<00:03:47.200> taking<00:03:47.769> a<00:03:48.250> spoon

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
not a sticking just by taking a spoon

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.030 
not a sticking just by taking a spoon
through<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.510> sides<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.080> just<00:03:50.200> by<00:03:50.410> giving<00:03:50.860> a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
through the sides and just by giving a

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.589 
through the sides and just by giving a
little<00:03:51.340> shape<00:03:51.580> you<00:03:51.760> see<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.239> edges

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
little shape you see that the edges

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.530 
little shape you see that the edges
separate<00:03:53.349> and<00:03:53.769> all<00:03:53.950> I'm<00:03:54.129> going<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.370> do<00:03:54.670> is<00:03:55.180> just

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
separate and all I'm going to do is just

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.190 
separate and all I'm going to do is just
to<00:03:56.760> put<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.790> bit<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.030> pressure<00:03:58.150> into<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.959> plate

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
to put a bit of pressure into the plate

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.770 
to put a bit of pressure into the plate
