00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 attention this video contains spoilers 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.930
 of the chapter so if you do not want 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.460
 know what happens do not watch the video and jump 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.460
 of him are warned 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.670
 well this chapter could be considered 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.170
 a filler episode because in 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.910
 nothing really happens like that very 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.130
 relevant to the story the plot of 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.710
 gravity balls but there's always always 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.119
 something to highlight something important I do not 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.189
 I consider that the gravity chapters 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.260
 you can not be the stuffing there is always 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.270
 something that is important to the plot by 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.739
 smaller than the plot of the 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.020
 episode revolves around a game of 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.430
 table that is the dipper favorite but 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.620
 nobody wants to play with him or is 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.420
 animated by what chance 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.760
 stanford realizes the board game 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.960
 and coincidentally he is also the favorite of 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.730
 him in those times when he 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.980
 I was in this dimension and therefore 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.950
 they start playing between the two until 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.470
 the uncle is so stable arrives and without fault 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.060
 throw an infinite die that stanford 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.440
 got in the other dimensions what 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.530
 which makes the game characters 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.519
 come alive and move into our dimension 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.100
 thus causing several problems that 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.680
 resolve as the chapter passes 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.570
 something curious that I notice is that because of 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.189
 of blows was that type of falling up 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.560
 where was the portal was not because 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.240
 it was dismantled and without good memory there 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.220
 theories that say that with first you can 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.630
 be vile at every key moment of the 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.310
 history of gravity forums where it happens 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.140
 something important or a turn like that in the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.270
 plot is breaking at any time 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.490
 important any chapter that is of 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.320
 importance there is always with buts and 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.270
 also if they look at your eyes they are like 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.250
 eyes weak only that the other way around I 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.590
 personally I think the goal pers 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.450
 effectively it is about bill that is 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.340
 there always watching through the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.040
 body of a goat I think it's the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.010
 tell us about you 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.930
 something funny is that grifols is parody 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.610
 herself with the series is de facto it 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.590
 activate since it is mentioned that it is a 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.180
 series with mystery and humor that children 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.490
 they do not understand making reference to that 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.560
 uneven graphic and at the end you see that 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.810
 textile duck has a secret twin of 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.430
 that we did not know and it was just like the viti 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.650
 folk as the twin can realize 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.150
 from stanley that stanford plus that 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.160
 these mentions that he already expected it and 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.810
 I knew it it's been like a year what 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.270
 curious is that about a year ago in 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.190
 August 2014 was that they began to 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.630
 formulate theories about the twin 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.480
 stand secret that had some 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.069
 relationship with the portal 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.530
 one of the few things really 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.970
 important aspects of the chapter are important 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.709
 in the sense that they affect the plot 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.510
 general of the series because for the 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.250
 chapter itself individually everything is 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.440
 important but for the plot in general 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.239
 The most important thing is that you keep yourself 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.250
 the stanford portal considers that very 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.049
 dangerous to have it built there because 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.780
 anyone can come and who knows what 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.430
 disasters cause with the machine and in addition 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.470
 he reveals dipper because he got so angry 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.780
 with stanley for winning used the portal 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.549
 to bring it back because when using it 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.829
 there's a lot of danger there's a lot 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.599
 instability so when being and 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.640
 activate the portal what it caused was a 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.739
 small interdimensional rupture that 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.660
 Latin stanford and saved in a sphere 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.000
 of glass and that could cause many 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.560
 disaster if it falls into the wrong hands 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.120
 end of the episode also saves the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.980
 infinite state because it is also 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.629
 very dangerous indeed among the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.549
 symbols that this die has can be 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.930
 see the face of stan and the pine 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.190
 different this I do not think I have 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.340
 any relevance but it's funny 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.750
 highlight it we can also notice that from 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.640
 spring are beginning to 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.440
 distancing mother gets along better with 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.420
 stanley and chasing better than a 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.950
 stanford and in this way you start to 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.450
 fulfill what mabel feared in the 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.239
 previous chapter since seeing 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.980
 fighting a lot he said there because he 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.349
 worried that they would become like 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.330
 them in the future and apparently it is 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.280
 fulfilling I do not know about you but I the 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.110
 I notice each time a little more distant 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.890
 perhaps they will have the same destiny as their 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.960
 uncles 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.220
 the cryptogram of the credits is a 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.600
 reference a phrase that says in the 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.610
 background which says sex whatever 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.680
 in the image of the end you can see the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.110
 given infinite and in its cryptogram says 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.210
 the fun and the games are great 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.340
 distractions but little things can 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.200
 bring chain reactions with this 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.760
 I suppose it refers to the break 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.620
 interdimensional that was left 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.570
 stored in that glass sphere since 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.910
 with that little thing this little object 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.070
 can have great repercussions on the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.420
 future and good this is all I can 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.430
 say of the chapter what called me the 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.870
 Attention or important as I told you is 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.460
 a chapter can be considered of 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.530
 stuffed although it is not because always 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.390
 there are important details so this 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.739
 video was shorter than the others but 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.080
 the chapter decides very good is very 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.610
 entertaining is funny leave the 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.440
 comments what do you think of this chapter 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.970
 that they think will happen then they think that 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.430
 Oedipus and Mabel are distancing each 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.360
 more time like his uncles who believe 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.700
 what happens with that break 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.100
 interdimensional now that the portal is 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.510
 dismantled how to go back to bill maybe it's 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.550
 in our dimension by means of blows 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.100
 or believe that it comes through that 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.870
 small interdimensional rupture is yes 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.880
 the video liked delen like share 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.950
 him with his friends and with those who 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.140
 interest this type of issues so 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.760
 mysteries curiosities we see in the 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.760
 next video until next time
