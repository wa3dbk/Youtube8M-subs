there<00:02:05.740> that's<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:09.450> solar<00:02:10.450> power<00:02:10.750> that<00:02:11.200> tells

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
there that's a solar power that tells

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.920 
there that's a solar power that tells
you<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.830> charge<00:02:12.069> right<00:02:12.430> there<00:02:12.670> how<00:02:13.630> high<00:02:13.870> you

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930
