00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.490
 good guys welcome to another video 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.370
 more this time to the first review in fifa 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.290
 14 review by didier drogba as you see the 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.640
 galatasaray forward that year 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.230
 past was not in the game and 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.960
 this one has been put by a player who 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.520
 Many wanted to try without going over 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.920
 away from the most voted players in 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.809
 for head so you can do the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.699
 idea of ​​your statistics good as you see 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.489
 they represent quite well what is 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.960
 Waiting for him is a portentous player 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.699
 that will not go down to defend too much 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.920
 despite having a work index in 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.890
 high defense this is something that I thought 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.570
 that was going to be more was going to notice more 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.370
 but the truth is that always but 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.710
 found above waiting to receive the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.640
 ball and well I think they have put it 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 To make it look 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.540
 so that he goes down to defend the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.340
 corners and others since he has a header 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.290
 very powerful and good is the player 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.200
 perfect when it comes to keeping the ball 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.330
 to wait for their players to climb 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.600
 that his classmates rise so I 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.030
 you would surround them with those players 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.310
 fast I've tried it one 4 1 2 1 2 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.290
 as you have seen not with players 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.800
 especially fast since it candreva and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.840
 the shaarawy are not quite fast but 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.570
 in a 4-2-3-1 with two ends or a 433 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.390
 clear with two fast ends can be 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.420
 well that may be the end because 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.369
 good as I say if they focus better or 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.259
 whether they focus well better than better and 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.600
 that the headbutt he has of Drogba is 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.399
 brutal question of the day that player 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.810
 is working better on fifa 14 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.880
 ultimate team gum and well I said 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.530
 but playing is working for me 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.510
 well and yilmaz which next to him also 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.330
 talking more about drogba good as soon as 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.090
 look at the door the truth is that it's over 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.250
 when you learn to drive drogba 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.820
 move it around the field so that it 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.119
 can place facing good goal 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.000
 it's a real wonder 85 88 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.069
 mixed power with 85 definition 80 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.540
 in far shot one killer action of 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.800
 area scoring goals with any of 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.600
 Both legs you have already seen and 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.050
 he even dares from outside the area 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.390
 as you already know if you 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.010
 and good the truth is that good is thrown 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.990
 in lack perhaps the four east of 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.410
 dribble although good is not a killer 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.780
 Drogba but hey maybe he's missing 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.820
 some that and the 3 triads of bargaining 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.980
 throw back the time to buy it I 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.420
 I encourage you talk about headbutting a bit 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.600
 truth is that the best thing he has but 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.580
 really in fifa 14 we are giving 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.290
 account that until walcott jumps as 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.940
 ronaldo Christian that the central 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.340
 at the head they put all the balls 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.250
 inside and good hard that goes deserves a 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.930
 note then if not for its 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.330
 slowness when turning if also 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.220
 maybe we would be talking to one 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.930
 we would be talking about one of the three 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.480
 best game forward 45 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.510
 surely I have to programs by 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.820
 Now, but Drogba has enchanted me like that 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.160
 that takes one with two for the vote 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.110
 I propose to the players bernard and 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.880
 ronaldinho can you tell me any other 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.230
 in the comments but well I hope that 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.510
 come out ronaldinho since I have many 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.950
 want to try it and nothing we leave here 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.750
 I hope you liked the review and 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.750
 see you in the next goodbye
