00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.170
 and then it's been a bit late that 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.670
 manage to sell goals 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.610
 we are looking at missing the most dangerous 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.210
 mexico was in the air game of navas 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.210
 which is very good 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.170
 Costa Rica was out about five shots 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.650
 of sting in the first part but 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.650
 none of saved 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.690
 He is very lacking a man who 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.909
 put a good stop of the goalkeeper very 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.769
 good stop double stop is missing a lot 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.299
 the quality that bryan ruiz puts on this 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.699
 team the pause that puts bryan ruiz 

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:48.680
 did not appear and the base had to appear 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.400
 the goalkeeper who was on the rise of 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.600
 Spain 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.250
 armed two balls in a row there is that bullet and 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.010
 after a clown what does the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.170
 goalkeeper because the truth satisfaction of 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.170
 enjoy intervention so good lands 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.140
 but well taken advantage of by the guard 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.210
 attacked nile towers 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.820
 I believe that throughout the game and 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.500
 they immediately took it out after sacred 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.100
 and here it does not end it cost work so 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.630
 that is here now I believe that where 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.180
 costa rica is best shown in the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.670
 match is when he takes the ball because 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.250
 the take in the first time and the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.380
 midfield I think it was the most 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.790
 or less more or less the most when they are 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.500
 clearer from mexico already needed 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.650
 some players from costa rica that 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.390
 They know how to play bolaÃ±os headed by 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.300
 the ball seems incredible to me that Borges 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.740
 do not play that is a strong midfielder 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.780
 high that the auction that left him 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.400
 the bank the goal at the end looking 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.450
 it was a header by me 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.970
 It also seems that the technician for a 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.500
 well or are you asking your last ones for 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.880
 dear of many years when in the 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.880
 costa rica team
