these rows as you can see there we stack
the<00:00:30.269> produce<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.869> top<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.349> then<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.529> layer

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the produce on top and then we layer

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.760 
the produce on top and then we layer
some<00:00:32.790> horse<00:00:33.090> manure<00:00:33.360> over<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.050> that's

red worms sometimes I get overwhelmed

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.799 
red worms sometimes I get overwhelmed
with<00:00:44.010> your<00:00:44.129> amount<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.399> produce<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.360> lot

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
with your amount of produce I get a lot

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.470 
goes to the worms and no shredding
needed<00:00:52.980> because<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.390> try<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.410> feed<00:00:55.530> these<00:00:55.710> rows

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
needed because I try and feed these rows

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.689 
needed because I try and feed these rows
about<00:00:57.480> once<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.870> week

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
about once a week

sometimes once every two weeks depending
on<00:01:02.129> how<00:01:02.489> deep<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.000> produce<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.719> now<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> lot<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
on how deep the produce is now a lot of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.170 
on how deep the produce is now a lot of
it<00:01:04.979> will<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.430> sit<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> summer

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it will just sit there in the summer

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.630 
it will just sit there in the summer
times<00:01:06.450> it'll<00:01:06.750> evaporate<00:01:06.979> which<00:01:07.979> doesn't<00:01:08.549> they

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
times it'll evaporate which doesn't they

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.100 
times it'll evaporate which doesn't they
don't<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.880> any<00:01:09.030> value<00:01:09.299> out<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.659> until<00:01:10.049> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
don't get any value out of it until I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.450 
don't get any value out of it until I
cover<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:12.710> it<00:01:13.710> doesn't<00:01:13.860> break<00:01:14.070> down<00:01:14.280> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
cover it the it doesn't break down that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.359 
cover it the it doesn't break down that
well<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.240> once<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.020> put<00:01:16.049> some<00:01:16.500> bedding<00:01:17.040> over<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
well so once I put some bedding over it

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.520 
well so once I put some bedding over it
the<00:01:18.090> horsemen<00:01:18.570> where<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> get<00:01:18.990> has<00:01:19.259> lots<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the horsemen where I get has lots of

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.179 
the horsemen where I get has lots of
sawdust<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:22.530> creates<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> little<00:01:22.979> bit<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
sawdust and that creates a little bit of

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
sawdust and that creates a little bit of
heat<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:23.909> starts<00:01:24.420> breaking<00:01:24.630> down<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
heat it just starts breaking down and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.660 
heat it just starts breaking down and
the<00:01:25.409> worms<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.950> under<00:01:26.159> there<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.340> going

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the worms are under there just going

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.569 
the worms are under there just going
crazy

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579

horse<00:01:39.609> manure<00:01:39.939> is<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:41.259> produce<00:01:42.929> and<00:01:43.929> there's

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
horse manure is the produce and there's

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.999 
horse manure is the produce and there's
just<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:44.890> bunch<00:01:45.039> of<00:01:45.219> worms<00:01:45.399> in<00:01:45.670> here<00:01:49.679> just<00:01:50.679> going

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
just a bunch of worms in here just going

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.429 
just a bunch of worms in here just going
to<00:01:51.130> work<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:52.719> say<00:01:52.869> once<00:01:53.079> you<00:01:53.170> cover<00:01:53.319> the

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
to work like I say once you cover the

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.309 
to work like I say once you cover the
produce<00:01:53.829> up<00:01:54.039> bacteria<00:01:54.819> and<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.689> fungi<00:01:56.020> just

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
produce up bacteria and the fungi just

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.160 
produce up bacteria and the fungi just
go<00:01:56.469> to<00:01:56.530> town<00:01:56.799> on<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.280> produce<00:01:57.729> and<00:02:01.170> they're

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
go to town on the produce and they're

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.120 
go to town on the produce and they're
just<00:02:02.500> wormed<00:02:02.920> everywhere<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.920> we've<00:02:05.920> got

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
just wormed everywhere and we've got

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.949 
just wormed everywhere and we've got
five<00:02:06.340> rows<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.209> hundred<00:02:07.509> foot<00:02:07.720> long

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
five rows of this a hundred foot long

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.530 
five rows of this a hundred foot long
plus<00:02:08.530> 100<00:02:09.190> foot<00:02:09.310> plus<00:02:09.519> long<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.929> 500<00:02:11.410> feet

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
plus 100 foot plus long so 500 feet

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.339 
plus 100 foot plus long so 500 feet
worms<00:02:13.540> like<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:14.519> that's<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.610> lot<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.790> food

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
worms like that that's a lot of food

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.039 
worms like that that's a lot of food
you're<00:02:17.349> talking<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.709> thousand<00:02:18.430> pounds<00:02:19.390> 100<00:02:19.840> or

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
you're talking a thousand pounds 100 or

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.759 
you're talking a thousand pounds 100 or
a<00:02:20.110> million<00:02:21.069> worms<00:02:21.340> thousand<00:02:22.180> pounds<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.540> worms

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
a million worms thousand pounds of worms

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.509 
a million worms thousand pounds of worms
that's<00:02:23.769> a<00:02:24.010> minimum<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:25.650> 500<00:02:26.650> pounds<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.250> food<00:02:27.370> a

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
that's a minimum of 500 pounds of food a

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:35.360 
that's a minimum of 500 pounds of food a
day<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.680> there's<00:02:32.860> three<00:02:33.190> days<00:02:33.340> worth<00:02:33.549> a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
day and so there's three days worth a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:43.140 
day and so there's three days worth a
lot<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.489> worms

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.209 

you
