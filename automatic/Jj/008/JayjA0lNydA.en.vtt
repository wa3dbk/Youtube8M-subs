00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
I think politics the economics have been

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.290 
I think politics the economics have been
bad<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:16.920> Detroit<00:00:17.279> obviously<00:00:17.760> they<00:00:17.910> had<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> lot

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
bad for Detroit obviously they had a lot

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.210 
bad for Detroit obviously they had a lot
of<00:00:18.330> white<00:00:18.570> flight<00:00:18.930> they<00:00:19.470> had<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> lot<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.980> change

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
of white flight they had a lot of change

of white flight they had a lot of change
in<00:00:20.340> business<00:00:20.490> structures<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> end<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
in business structures but in the end I

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.769 
in business structures but in the end I
think<00:00:22.320> leadership<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.640> lack<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.570> long-term
