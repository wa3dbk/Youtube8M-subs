00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
up because I've done all five of these

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.230 
up because I've done all five of these
back<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.130> back<00:00:17.160> without<00:00:17.430> having<00:00:17.820> anything<00:00:18.000> to

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
back to back without having anything to

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.630 
back to back without having anything to
drink<00:00:18.470> and<00:00:19.470> my<00:00:19.590> fruit<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.010> getting<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.400> little

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
drink and my fruit is getting a little

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.620 
drink and my fruit is getting a little
dry<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.570> first<00:00:21.840> question<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.970> it<00:00:23.970> harder<00:00:24.420> or

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
dry so first question is it harder or

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.660 
dry so first question is it harder or
easier<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.350> lose<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.800> game<00:00:26.130> those<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
easier to lose that game those of you to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.429 
easier to lose that game those of you to

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
difference now that is a good question

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.720 
difference now that is a good question
that<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.540> an<00:00:36.630> in-depth<00:00:37.050> question<00:00:37.530> let<00:00:38.399> me<00:00:38.460> try

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that is an in-depth question let me try

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.819 
that is an in-depth question let me try
to<00:00:38.790> bring<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.750> down<00:00:39.989> into<00:00:40.230> something<00:00:40.620> very

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
to bring this down into something very

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.350 
to bring this down into something very
simple<00:00:43.010> some<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> these<00:00:44.190> female<00:00:44.670> hormones<00:00:45.149> it

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
simple some of these female hormones it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.450 
simple some of these female hormones it
spike<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.050> fluctuate<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.980> actually

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
spike and fluctuate can actually

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.639 
spike and fluctuate can actually
positively<00:00:48.090> affect<00:00:48.570> things<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.840> igf-1<00:00:49.530> in

things like additional igf-1 production
in<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> muscle<00:01:08.760> cell<00:01:09.470> but<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.770> also<00:01:11.369> kind<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
in the muscle cell but I also kind of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.620 
in the muscle cell but I also kind of
the<00:01:12.000> expense<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.390> making<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.869> retain<00:01:13.229> water

going to lose fat faster in other areas

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.999 
going to lose fat faster in other areas
places<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.509> your<00:01:33.659> hips<00:01:33.900> your<00:01:34.020> legs<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.740> if

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
places like your hips your legs on if

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.140 
places like your hips your legs on if
you're<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.310> birth<00:01:35.430> control<00:01:35.490> you're<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
you're on birth control you're going to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.780 
you're on birth control you're going to
have<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.570> hell<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.990> time<00:01:37.229> getting<00:01:38.220> really

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
have one hell of a time getting really

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.160 
have one hell of a time getting really
cut<00:01:38.970> up<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.119> that's<00:01:39.689> what<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:39.960> your<00:01:40.049> goals

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
cut up like that's what are your goals

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.330 
cut up like that's what are your goals
for<00:01:40.320> example<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.829> gonna<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.130> problem

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
for example it's gonna be a problem

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.149 
for example it's gonna be a problem
using<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.880> fat<00:01:42.170> well<00:01:43.170> your<00:01:43.320> butt<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.799> your<00:01:43.829> hips

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
using a fat well your butt on your hips

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.600 
using a fat well your butt on your hips
it<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.549> your<00:01:44.700> gosh<00:01:44.850> he's<00:01:45.810> gotta<00:01:45.990> live<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.259> it

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
it on your gosh he's gotta live with it

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.120 
it on your gosh he's gotta live with it
so<00:01:47.780> that's<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.990> factor<00:01:49.320> there<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:49.860> far<00:01:50.070> as

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
so that's a factor there but as far as

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.710 
so that's a factor there but as far as
the<00:01:50.970> menstrual<00:01:51.420> cycle<00:01:51.810> itself<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:53.720> won't

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the menstrual cycle itself it won't

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.340 
the menstrual cycle itself it won't
affect<00:01:55.170> muscle<00:01:55.920> gains<00:01:56.189> at<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.149> level<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
affect muscle gains at the level of the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.410 
affect muscle gains at the level of the
muscles<00:01:58.770> growing<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.759> what<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.969> will<00:02:00.149> affect

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
muscles growing but what it will affect

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.200 
muscles growing but what it will affect
is<00:02:00.540> your<00:02:00.659> performance

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
is your performance

stimulating Westbrook so it is going to

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.449

fat<00:02:42.940> all<00:02:43.120> four<00:02:43.330> calories<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.019> it's<00:02:44.920> going<00:02:45.160> to
