hi I'm Micah and today I will show you
how<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.799> make<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.910> paper<00:00:09.420> bag<00:00:09.900> that<00:00:10.679> while

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
how to make this paper bag that while

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.270 
how to make this paper bag that while
flying<00:00:11.580> sometimes<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.719> flaps<00:00:13.259> its<00:00:13.530> wings<00:00:13.889> and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
flying sometimes it flaps its wings and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.450 
flying sometimes it flaps its wings and
let's<00:00:14.820> begin<00:00:15.920> first<00:00:17.570> make<00:00:18.570> these<00:00:18.900> edges<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
let's begin first make these edges and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:36.069 
let's begin first make these edges and
corners<00:00:21.230> line<00:00:22.230> up<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.650> b7

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.990 

open<00:00:36.950> it<00:00:37.070> back<00:00:37.100> up<00:00:37.570> and<00:00:38.570> doing<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.620> same<00:00:40.000> eat

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
open it back up and doing the same eat

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:54.970 
open it back up and doing the same eat
other<00:00:41.270> way<00:00:51.129> next<00:00:52.129> open<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:52.970> back<00:00:53.210> up<00:00:53.650> now<00:00:54.650> this

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
other way next open the back up now this

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.939 
other way next open the back up now this
is<00:00:55.040> another<00:00:55.610> difficult<00:00:56.300> part<00:00:56.629> see<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:57.680> X

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
is another difficult part see the X

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.509 
is another difficult part see the X
shape<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:58.760> do<00:00:59.600> the<00:01:00.199> waterbomb<00:01:01.010> base<00:01:02.379> like

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
shape and do the waterbomb base like

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:10.870 
shape and do the waterbomb base like
this<00:01:08.590> you'll<00:01:09.590> have<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.979> do<00:01:10.160> with<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.550> short

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
this you'll have to do with the short

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:19.540 
this you'll have to do with the short
way<00:01:11.920> or<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.070> can't<00:01:13.340> make<00:01:13.610> it<00:01:18.100> make<00:01:19.100> these

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
way or you can't make it make these

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.100 
way or you can't make it make these
corners<00:01:20.530> line<00:01:21.530> up<00:01:21.800> with<00:01:21.979> each<00:01:22.160> other<00:01:23.560> now<00:01:25.090> take

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
corners line up with each other now take

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:43.950 
corners line up with each other now take
the<00:01:27.110> top<00:01:27.470> flap<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.020> fold<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:30.259> over<00:01:31.270> like<00:01:32.270> this

take<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.390> fold<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:47.020> up<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.560> that<00:01:48.159> point

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
take this and fold it up to that point

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:59.100 
take this and fold it up to that point
up<00:01:48.850> there<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:56.340> fold<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.550> back<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:58.509> way<00:01:58.540> it<00:01:58.720> was

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
up there and fold it back the way it was

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.180 
up there and fold it back the way it was
like<00:02:00.009> this<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.380> same<00:02:02.650> with<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.040> other

now<00:02:14.980> take<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.550> front<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:19.030> send<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.239> down<00:02:21.550> like

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
now take the front and send it down like

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.240 
now take the front and send it down like
this<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.090> bottom<00:02:26.330> right<00:02:26.629> here<00:02:27.250> it's

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
this to the bottom right here it's

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.259 
this to the bottom right here it's
starting<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.879> get<00:02:29.060> its<00:02:29.209> bat<00:02:29.660> shape<00:02:30.940> I'll<00:02:31.940> fire

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
starting to get its bat shape I'll fire

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.559 
starting to get its bat shape I'll fire
it<00:02:32.299> up<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:32.810> fold<00:02:33.319> it<00:02:33.950> again<00:02:34.310> down<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.000> this

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
it up and fold it again down to this

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.839 
it up and fold it again down to this
line<00:02:36.019> that<00:02:36.049> you<00:02:36.470> made<00:02:38.860> unfold<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.250> pull<00:02:40.819> it

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
line that you made unfold it and pull it

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.569 
line that you made unfold it and pull it
back<00:02:41.209> down<00:02:41.239> this<00:02:41.840> way<00:02:42.790> now<00:02:43.790> fold<00:02:44.269> this<00:02:44.569> up<00:02:44.900> and

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
back down this way now fold this up and

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:54.750 
back down this way now fold this up and
make<00:02:46.579> this<00:02:46.910> line<00:02:47.829> line<00:02:48.829> up<00:02:49.160> with<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.950> edge

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.410 

now<00:02:55.810> flip<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:56.840> over<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.640> fold<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:59.660> in<00:02:59.840> half

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
now flip it over and fold it in half

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:11.229 
now flip it over and fold it in half
like<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:07.750> this<00:03:08.750> part<00:03:09.110> is<00:03:09.319> hard<00:03:09.709> because<00:03:10.239> it

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
like this this part is hard because it

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.910 
like this this part is hard because it
gets<00:03:11.569> really<00:03:12.019> really<00:03:12.700> thick<00:03:13.700> right<00:03:14.629> here<00:03:14.989> so

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
gets really really thick right here so

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:24.330 
gets really really thick right here so
fold<00:03:16.730> along<00:03:16.970> these<00:03:17.810> lines<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.910> make<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.269> wings

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.690 

flip<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.519> over<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.120> do<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.049> same<00:03:27.319> with<00:03:28.130> the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
flip it over and do the same with the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.420 
flip it over and do the same with the
others<00:03:29.859> now<00:03:30.859> open<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.400> wings<00:03:31.609> up<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.889> if<00:03:33.889> you

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
others now open the wings up and if you

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.569 
others now open the wings up and if you
don't<00:03:34.819> want<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.209> to<00:03:35.420> flap<00:03:35.750> its<00:03:36.019> wings<00:03:36.579> fold

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
don't want it to flap its wings fold

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:59.880 
don't want it to flap its wings fold
these<00:03:38.000> down<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.910> they're<00:03:40.910> parallel<00:03:41.590> with<00:03:42.590> this

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:13.150 

and<00:04:00.330> krump<00:04:01.330> these<00:04:01.690> back

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.920 

but<00:04:13.760> if<00:04:14.030> you<00:04:14.360> do<00:04:14.870> want<00:04:15.170> it<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.470> flop<00:04:16.510> don't<00:04:17.510> do

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
but if you do want it to flop don't do

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.970 
but if you do want it to flop don't do
that<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:20.060> flatten<00:04:20.750> out<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:21.080> wings<00:04:21.260> and<00:04:23.980> it's

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
that and flatten out the wings and it's

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:32.950 
that and flatten out the wings and it's
done<00:04:30.550> when<00:04:31.550> your<00:04:31.700> bet<00:04:31.850> is<00:04:32.030> done<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.660> should

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
done when your bet is done it should

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:42.280 
done when your bet is done it should
look<00:04:33.020> like<00:04:33.200> this<00:04:33.650> let's<00:04:34.130> try<00:04:34.520> it<00:04:34.580> out<00:04:41.290> I'm

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
look like this let's try it out I'm

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.250 
look like this let's try it out I'm
Micah<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:43.010> I'll<00:04:43.130> see<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:43.460> next<00:04:43.790> time
