aren't<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.500> when<00:02:02.160> you<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> youngster

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
aren't and when you have a youngster

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.180 
aren't and when you have a youngster
like<00:02:03.150> this<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.600> has<00:02:03.870> turned<00:02:04.410> out<00:02:04.680> by<00:02:04.830> itself

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
like this that has turned out by itself

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.719 
like this that has turned out by itself
and<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:06.510> other<00:02:06.750> horses<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:08.130> takes<00:02:08.490> them

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and not with other horses it takes them

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.400 
and not with other horses it takes them
a<00:02:08.850> while<00:02:08.880> before<00:02:09.600> they<00:02:09.929> learn<00:02:10.110> how<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
a while before they learn how to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.110 
a while before they learn how to
communicate<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.420> am<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.700> was<00:02:14.700> explaining

not going to bother with them but once
they're<00:02:36.030> weaned<00:02:36.300> everything<00:02:37.080> changes<00:02:37.530> then

they're weaned everything changes then

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.500 
they're weaned everything changes then
that<00:02:37.769> happens<00:02:38.160> practically<00:02:38.760> overnight<00:02:39.060> we're

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
that happens practically overnight we're

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.000 
that happens practically overnight we're
all<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.930> sudden<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.320> other<00:02:40.500> herd<00:02:40.800> members

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
all of a sudden the other herd members

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.520 
all of a sudden the other herd members
now<00:02:41.430> aren't<00:02:41.760> going<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.000> start<00:02:42.320> telling<00:02:43.320> baby

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
now aren't going to start telling baby

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.759 
now aren't going to start telling baby
where<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.250> can<00:02:44.370> be<00:02:44.840> when<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.050> can<00:02:46.170> be<00:02:46.200> how<00:02:46.590> it

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
where it can be when it can be how it

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.590 
where it can be when it can be how it
can<00:02:46.920> be<00:02:47.100> where<00:02:47.430> its<00:02:47.580> paces<00:02:48.239> where<00:02:48.480> its

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
can be where its paces where its

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.020 
can be where its paces where its
boundaries<00:02:48.959> are<00:02:49.260> when<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.040> can<00:02:50.190> eat<00:02:50.459> when<00:02:50.910> it

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
boundaries are when it can eat when it

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.860 
boundaries are when it can eat when it
can<00:02:51.180> drink<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:53.090> what's<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.300> important<00:02:54.840> about

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
can drink and what's so important about

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.229 
can drink and what's so important about
that<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.500> baby<00:02:56.010> then<00:02:56.340> learns<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.880> give

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
that is that baby then learns to give

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.050 
that is that baby then learns to give
over<00:02:57.890> its<00:02:59.060> dominance

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
over its dominance

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.360 
over its dominance
now<00:03:01.569> when<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.959> have<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.200> baby<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.130> situation

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
now when you have a baby in a situation

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.520 
now when you have a baby in a situation
where<00:03:04.150> it's<00:03:04.420> taken<00:03:04.780> away<00:03:04.989> from<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.349> herd

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
where it's taken away from the herd

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.589 
where it's taken away from the herd
setting<00:03:05.980> at<00:03:06.130> weaning<00:03:06.430> which<00:03:06.760> most<00:03:07.090> bred

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
setting at weaning which most bred

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.960 
setting at weaning which most bred
horses<00:03:07.870> are<00:03:08.410> they<00:03:09.250> don't<00:03:09.550> have<00:03:09.819> that

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
horses are they don't have that

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.280 
horses are they don't have that
opportunity<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:12.610> get<00:03:12.819> that<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.510> education

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
opportunity to get that that education

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.620 
opportunity to get that that education
from<00:03:14.560> other<00:03:14.739> horses<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:15.520> now<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.790> human<00:03:16.450> has

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
from other horses so now the human has

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.620 
from other horses so now the human has
to<00:03:16.780> take<00:03:16.989> over<00:03:17.580> which<00:03:18.580> is<00:03:18.760> fine<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.300> it's<00:03:19.450> not

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
to take over which is fine and it's not

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.500 
to take over which is fine and it's not
impossible<00:03:20.019> but<00:03:20.440> what<00:03:20.739> happens<00:03:21.190> is<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:22.120> human

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
impossible but what happens is the human

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.750 
impossible but what happens is the human
has<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.989> be<00:03:23.170> just<00:03:23.739> as<00:03:23.950> persistent<00:03:24.640> and

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
has to be just as persistent and

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.009 
has to be just as persistent and
consistent<00:03:24.819> as<00:03:25.830> another<00:03:26.830> horse<00:03:27.099> would<00:03:27.370> be<00:03:27.550> and

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
consistent as another horse would be and

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.600 
consistent as another horse would be and
that<00:03:29.019> is<00:03:29.349> very<00:03:29.440> difficult<00:03:29.950> for<00:03:30.489> humans

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
that is very difficult for humans

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.259 
that is very difficult for humans
because<00:03:32.160> horses<00:03:33.160> never<00:03:33.519> say<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:33.910> each<00:03:34.120> other

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
because horses never say to each other

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.449 
because horses never say to each other
well<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.840> know<00:03:34.959> I've<00:03:35.560> disciplined<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.250> baby

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
well you know I've disciplined this baby

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.670 
well you know I've disciplined this baby
20<00:03:36.940> times<00:03:37.180> in<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.450> last<00:03:37.600> hour<00:03:37.840> over<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:38.350> same

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
20 times in the last hour over the same

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.620 
20 times in the last hour over the same
thing<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.220> I'm<00:03:39.370> tired<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.209> I'm<00:03:40.330> just

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
thing and I'm tired of it and I'm just

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.690 
thing and I'm tired of it and I'm just
not<00:03:40.750> going<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.989> do<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.200> anymore<00:03:41.489> horses<00:03:42.489> never

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
not going to do it anymore horses never

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.420 
not going to do it anymore horses never
do<00:03:42.850> that<00:03:43.000> where<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.209> human<00:03:43.600> would<00:03:44.280> humans<00:03:45.280> get

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
do that where a human would humans get

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.470 
do that where a human would humans get
to<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.640> point<00:03:45.790> where<00:03:45.970> they<00:03:46.060> just<00:03:46.209> get<00:03:46.330> so

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
to the point where they just get so

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.050 
to the point where they just get so
frustrated<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:47.140> fed<00:03:47.319> up<00:03:47.500> they<00:03:47.680> give<00:03:47.830> up

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
frustrated and fed up they give up

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.660 
frustrated and fed up they give up
horses<00:03:49.060> never<00:03:49.299> give<00:03:49.630> up<00:03:49.780> when<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.080> comes<00:03:50.290> to

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
horses never give up when it comes to

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.539 
horses never give up when it comes to
discipline<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.790> each<00:03:51.940> other<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:53.549> that's

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
discipline to each other so that's

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.920 
discipline to each other so that's
what's<00:03:54.910> very<00:03:55.090> important<00:03:55.750> about<00:03:57.930> teaching

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
what's very important about teaching

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.809 
what's very important about teaching
youngsters<00:03:59.349> is<00:03:59.920> that<00:04:00.130> we<00:04:00.250> have<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.549> be<00:04:00.670> as

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
youngsters is that we have to be as

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.509 
youngsters is that we have to be as
persistent<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:01.720> consistent<00:04:02.099> as<00:04:03.099> another

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
horse so I'm going to just start calling

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.160 
horse so I'm going to just start calling
around<00:04:05.769> with<00:04:06.070> her<00:04:06.329> I've<00:04:07.329> already<00:04:07.630> kind<00:04:08.079> of

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
around with her I've already kind of

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.280 
around with her I've already kind of
rubbed<00:04:08.530> her<00:04:08.680> all<00:04:08.829> over<00:04:09.359> trying<00:04:10.359> to<00:04:10.540> find<00:04:10.870> spots

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
rubbed her all over trying to find spots

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.920 
rubbed her all over trying to find spots
where<00:04:11.680> she<00:04:12.040> might<00:04:12.250> be<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.730> little<00:04:13.239> hesitant<00:04:13.810> to

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
where she might be a little hesitant to

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.449 
where she might be a little hesitant to
have<00:04:14.170> me<00:04:14.320> touch<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.799> honestly<00:04:15.130> I'm<00:04:15.310> not

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
have me touch and honestly I'm not

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.740 
have me touch and honestly I'm not
finding<00:04:15.730> any<00:04:16.030> spots<00:04:16.390> at<00:04:16.570> all<00:04:16.720> she<00:04:17.560> seems<00:04:17.829> very

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
finding any spots at all she seems very

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.990 
finding any spots at all she seems very
relaxed<00:04:19.750> with<00:04:20.320> that<00:04:23.280> from<00:04:24.280> what<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.490> understand

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
relaxed with that from what I understand

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.820 
relaxed with that from what I understand
she<00:04:25.210> was<00:04:25.390> imprinted<00:04:25.900> at<00:04:26.169> birth<00:04:26.410> which<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.800> a

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
she was imprinted at birth which is a

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.040 
she was imprinted at birth which is a
good<00:04:27.070> thing<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.580> probably<00:04:28.360> one<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.870> the

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
good thing and probably one of the

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.650 
good thing and probably one of the
reasons<00:04:29.440> why<00:04:29.650> she's<00:04:29.979> not<00:04:30.240> resistant<00:04:31.240> anywhere

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
reasons why she's not resistant anywhere

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.189 
reasons why she's not resistant anywhere
so<00:04:32.139> that's<00:04:32.350> good

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
so that's good

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.939 
so that's good
and<00:04:35.580> this<00:04:36.580> rope<00:04:36.879> halter<00:04:37.449> like<00:04:38.379> I<00:04:38.500> said<00:04:38.560> has<00:04:38.919> a

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
and this rope halter like I said has a

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.129 
and this rope halter like I said has a
little<00:04:39.220> more<00:04:39.340> pressure<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.789> it<00:04:40.120> so<00:04:40.660> if<00:04:40.900> she's

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
little more pressure to it so if she's

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.600 
little more pressure to it so if she's
doing<00:04:41.319> something<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.889> I<00:04:41.949> don't<00:04:42.039> want<00:04:42.340> her<00:04:42.460> to

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
doing something that I don't want her to

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.749 
doing something that I don't want her to
do<00:04:42.759> I<00:04:43.030> can<00:04:43.569> just<00:04:43.720> correct<00:04:44.080> her<00:04:44.490> then<00:04:45.490> what<00:04:45.669> I'm

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
what I there's many ways of doing this I

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.020 
what I there's many ways of doing this I
could<00:06:01.230> shake<00:06:01.470> the<00:06:01.650> lead<00:06:01.800> line<00:06:02.040> which<00:06:02.850> is

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
could shake the lead line which is

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.240 
could shake the lead line which is
something<00:06:03.300> I<00:06:03.480> just<00:06:03.690> tried<00:06:03.900> now<00:06:05.150> just<00:06:06.150> the

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
something I just tried now just the

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.340 
something I just tried now just the
habit<00:06:08.250> of<00:06:08.310> putting<00:06:08.520> my<00:06:08.730> hand<00:06:09.060> up<00:06:09.240> so<00:06:10.170> that<00:06:10.320> she

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
habit of putting my hand up so that she

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.230 
habit of putting my hand up so that she
sees<00:06:10.800> it<00:06:11.040> kind<00:06:11.280> of<00:06:11.340> like<00:06:11.520> don't<00:06:11.970> go<00:06:12.090> any

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240
