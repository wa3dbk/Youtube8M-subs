it's<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> codes<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.909> don't<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it's one of the codes I don't like to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.469 
it's one of the codes I don't like to
changes<00:01:33.920> as<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> highly

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
