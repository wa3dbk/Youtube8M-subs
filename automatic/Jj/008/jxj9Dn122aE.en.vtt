00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
support I can keep them in one center

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.440 
support I can keep them in one center
space<00:02:17.040> when<00:02:17.550> I'm<00:02:17.670> playing<00:02:17.760> solo<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.210> have<00:02:18.330> to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
space when I'm playing solo I have to

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.300 
space when I'm playing solo I have to
run<00:02:18.600> all<00:02:18.780> over<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.170> map<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.530> find<00:02:19.560> enemies<00:02:20.160> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
shit like that I like it when I'm in a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.810 
shit like that I like it when I'm in a
support<00:02:22.530> party<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.160> way<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.400> can<00:02:23.430> keep<00:02:23.670> them

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
certain times and that really defers the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.170 
certain times and that really defers the
gameplay<00:02:40.500> from<00:02:40.890> rush<00:02:41.160> happy<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.730> just<00:02:41.910> sitting

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
gameplay from rush happy to just sitting

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.520 
gameplay from rush happy to just sitting
back<00:02:42.330> trying<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.720> pick<00:02:42.840> up<00:02:42.930> your<00:02:42.990> streaks<00:02:43.350> and

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
back trying to pick up your streaks and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.890 
back trying to pick up your streaks and
then<00:02:43.860> get<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.130> 200<00:02:44.520> kill<00:02:44.670> gameplay<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:45.300> my

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
then get that 200 kill gameplay in my

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.050 
then get that 200 kill gameplay in my
opinion<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.800> very<00:02:47.040> boring<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.520> watch<00:02:47.550> if

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
opinion that is very boring to watch if

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.630 
opinion that is very boring to watch if
you<00:02:48.180> get<00:02:48.300> 280<00:02:49.050> kills<00:02:49.350> with<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.950> support<00:02:50.310> party

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
you get 280 kills with the support party

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.400 
you get 280 kills with the support party
and<00:02:50.820> then<00:02:51.239> you're<00:02:51.570> just<00:02:51.600> sitting<00:02:52.050> back<00:02:52.200> with

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
and then you're just sitting back with

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.140 
and then you're just sitting back with
an<00:02:52.530> AR<00:02:52.860> killing<00:02:53.280> them<00:02:53.430> off<00:02:53.640> their<00:02:53.880> spine

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
an AR killing them off their spine

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.000 
an AR killing them off their spine
instead<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.900> something<00:02:55.320> like<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:55.620> game<00:02:55.860> play

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
instead of something like this game play

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.710 
instead of something like this game play
right<00:02:56.190> here<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.370> didn't<00:02:56.640> pick<00:02:56.760> up<00:02:56.820> 140<00:02:57.510> kills

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
right here I didn't pick up 140 kills

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.810 
right here I didn't pick up 140 kills
because<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.380> absolutely<00:02:58.860> messed<00:02:59.340> up<00:02:59.550> on<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
because I absolutely messed up on the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.250 
because I absolutely messed up on the
first<00:03:00.030> round<00:03:00.209> but<00:03:00.390> in<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.630> second<00:03:00.959> round<00:03:01.080> I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
first round but in the second round I

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.380 
first round but in the second round I
think<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.709> drop<00:03:01.980> almost<00:03:02.160> about<00:03:02.550> 90<00:03:03.030> kills<00:03:03.209> in

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
think I drop almost about 90 kills in

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.120 
think I drop almost about 90 kills in
this<00:03:03.510> round<00:03:03.720> cuz<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.140> dropped<00:03:04.380> fifty-seven<00:03:04.739> the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
this round cuz I dropped fifty-seven the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.070 
this round cuz I dropped fifty-seven the
first<00:03:05.340> round<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.000> had<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.180> be<00:03:06.330> like<00:03:06.480> 83<00:03:06.959> or

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
first round so I had to be like 83 or

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.360 
first round so I had to be like 83 or
something<00:03:07.410> like<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.560> I'm<00:03:07.800> not<00:03:07.830> adding<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.340> up

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
something like that I'm not adding it up

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.610 
something like that I'm not adding it up
but<00:03:08.850> yeah<00:03:09.000> guys<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.200> second<00:03:10.500> round

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
but yeah guys that I in the second round

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.500 
but yeah guys that I in the second round
I<00:03:10.770> dropped<00:03:10.980> 83<00:03:11.489> kills<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:11.970> that's<00:03:12.209> pretty

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
I dropped 83 kills so that's pretty

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.060 
I dropped 83 kills so that's pretty
insane<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.230> right<00:03:13.320> there<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.500> picked<00:03:13.830> up<00:03:13.920> a

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
insane and right there I picked up a

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.550 
insane and right there I picked up a
quad<00:03:14.520> of<00:03:14.700> load<00:03:14.850> circular<00:03:15.300> but<00:03:15.780> yeah<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.170> then

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
quad of load circular but yeah and then

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.990 
quad of load circular but yeah and then
when<00:03:16.860> I'm<00:03:16.980> playing<00:03:17.130> solo<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:17.610> like<00:03:17.850> playing

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
when I'm playing solo I like playing

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.910 
when I'm playing solo I like playing
solo<00:03:18.390> because<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.959> just<00:03:19.110> go<00:03:19.260> balls<00:03:19.500> deep<00:03:19.620> if

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
solo because I can just go balls deep if

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.560 
solo because I can just go balls deep if
we<00:03:20.130> do<00:03:20.370> get<00:03:20.519> them<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.820> spawn<00:03:21.060> trap<00:03:21.330> when<00:03:21.480> I'm

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
we do get them in a spawn trap when I'm

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.570 
we do get them in a spawn trap when I'm
playing<00:03:21.660> solo<00:03:22.080> like<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.530> Randy's<00:03:23.250> we<00:03:23.459> get

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
playing solo like the Randy's we get

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.949 
playing solo like the Randy's we get
them<00:03:23.670> spawning<00:03:23.970> at<00:03:24.209> eight<00:03:24.390> or<00:03:24.420> something<00:03:24.840> of

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
them spawning at eight or something of

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.479 
them spawning at eight or something of
that<00:03:24.989> nature<00:03:25.140> then<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:25.860> can<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.070> run<00:03:26.340> through

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
that nature then I can just run through

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.820 
that nature then I can just run through
the<00:03:26.640> spawn<00:03:26.880> go<00:03:27.180> AR<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.110> when<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.290> spawns<00:03:28.560> flip

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
the spawn go AR and when the spawns flip

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.960 
the spawn go AR and when the spawns flip
you<00:03:28.950> actually<00:03:29.250> have<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.430> chase<00:03:29.640> down<00:03:29.670> the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
you actually have to chase down the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.460 
you actually have to chase down the
enemies<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.480> find<00:03:30.690> them<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:30.959> when<00:03:31.350> you're

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
enemies and find them and when you're

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.380 
enemies and find them and when you're
playing<00:03:31.650> solo<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.160> takes<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.489> ton<00:03:32.850> more<00:03:33.060> skill

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
playing solo it takes a ton more skill

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.690 
playing solo it takes a ton more skill
because<00:03:33.900> when<00:03:34.410> you're<00:03:34.530> playing<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.890> party<00:03:35.280> you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
because when you're playing a party you

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.830 
because when you're playing a party you
have<00:03:35.850> them<00:03:36.030> all<00:03:36.180> right<00:03:36.360> there<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.750> you're

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
have them all right there and you're

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.740 
have them all right there and you're
just<00:03:36.930> relying<00:03:37.739> on<00:03:37.950> gun<00:03:38.370> skill<00:03:38.750> reflexes

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
just relying on gun skill reflexes

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.930 
just relying on gun skill reflexes
knowing<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.170> spawns<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:41.580> have<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.820> know

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
knowing the spawns and you have to know

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.699 
knowing the spawns and you have to know
your<00:03:41.970> timing<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:42.930> when<00:03:43.079> you're<00:03:43.200> playing<00:03:43.410> solo

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
your timing but when you're playing solo

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.069 
your timing but when you're playing solo
you<00:03:43.920> have<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.160> know<00:03:44.310> map<00:03:44.549> navigation<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.989> have

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
you have to know map navigation you have

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.780 
you have to know map navigation you have
to<00:03:46.230> trust<00:03:46.650> your<00:03:46.829> gun<00:03:47.070> skill<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.519> have<00:03:47.549> to

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
to trust your gun skill you have to

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.729 
to trust your gun skill you have to
think<00:03:48.000> certain<00:03:48.720> places<00:03:49.110> at<00:03:49.230> certain<00:03:49.290> times

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
think certain places at certain times

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.170 
think certain places at certain times
you<00:03:50.190> have<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.430> be<00:03:50.519> in<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.640> right<00:03:50.760> place<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.150> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
right time if not then it's going to be
