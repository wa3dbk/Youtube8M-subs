like the x1 with the looping and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.580 
like the x1 with the looping and
everything<00:01:00.829> really<00:01:01.430> can<00:01:01.579> create<00:01:01.820> like<00:01:02.090> a

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
everything really can create like a

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.190 
everything really can create like a

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
transmit you can transmit to each other

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.590

you<00:01:09.229> can<00:01:09.380> save<00:01:09.530> your<00:01:09.649> ass<00:01:09.770> exactly<00:01:10.460> but<00:01:11.450> you

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
you can save your ass exactly but you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.879 
you can save your ass exactly but you
know<00:01:11.689> that's<00:01:11.869> that's<00:01:12.109> what<00:01:12.469> makes<00:01:12.649> it<00:01:12.770> more

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:12.889 
know that's that's what makes it more

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:14.559 
know that's that's what makes it more
comfortable<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.399> because<00:01:13.819> if<00:01:13.999> you<00:01:14.149> have<00:01:14.389> even

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:14.569 
comfortable to because if you have even

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:17.200 
comfortable to because if you have even
if<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:14.929> have<00:01:15.109> you<00:01:16.069> know<00:01:16.100> we're<00:01:16.939> gonna<00:01:17.090> be

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
if you have you know we're gonna be

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.580 
if you have you know we're gonna be
probably<00:01:17.420> using<00:01:17.719> turntable<00:01:18.109> because<00:01:18.289> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
probably using turntable because the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.020 
probably using turntable because the
thing<00:01:18.979> outside<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.429> a<00:01:19.459> little<00:01:19.700> bit<00:01:19.789> smaller

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
thing outside is a little bit smaller

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.059 
thing outside is a little bit smaller
yeah<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:20.719> we'll<00:01:20.810> have<00:01:20.899> two<00:01:21.049> turntables<00:01:21.289> and<00:01:21.770> we

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
yeah so we'll have two turntables and we

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:23.709 
yeah so we'll have two turntables and we
have<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.369> crow<00:01:22.579> the<00:01:22.789> bulk<00:01:22.999> of<00:01:23.119> our<00:01:23.209> music<00:01:23.539> on<00:01:23.630> our
