00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.130
 the life of crabs 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.709
 Have you ever noticed how much living things 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.680
 we can find in a simple visit 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.830
 the beach 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.480
 in a tropical environment the presence of 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.190
 of the mangrove rivers create habitats 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:32.010
 perfect for an immense diversity 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:37.430
 between seaweed fish and stars 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.430
 of the sea and are they the crabs 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.550
 crabs are invertebrates and 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.760
 part of the animal kingdom being 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.190
 classified as arthropods the same 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.949
 son of spiders 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.180
 we can imagine them as cousins 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:03.280
 distant but there are many differences 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:07.159
 among them what makes of the crabs 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.970
 crustaceans a class that likes water 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.520
 from the sea or the river having some 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:19.039
 few representatives only terrestrial 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.729
 crustaceans are known for their 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.210
 carapace that protects your body from 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.490
 adversity of the environment 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.509
 within this class we will find the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.479
 Cameroon 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:38.030
 the crayfish, and also 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.200
 statute your body is divided into two 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.879
 parts 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.270
 a and spoke chest and abdomen observatory 

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:52.009
 is the union between the head and the thorax 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:55.759
 already the abdomen is the region that is in the 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.629
 underneath the body of the animal possess 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.330
 eyes antenna sensory jaws and 

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:03.970
 jaw 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.490
 the crabs know part of another 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:13.030
 classification are those of the 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:16.230
 have ten articulated members four 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.500
 pairs of legs that aid in displacement 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.320
 and a pair of ducks that help catch 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.280
 of food and also as a tool 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.680
 for the defense speaks in food 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.680
 crabs can be carnivorous 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.660
 books may also feed on 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.390
 decaying material 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.570
 thus fulfilling a key role in 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.080
 places where they live contributing to the 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.240
 balance of fauna and flora 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.240
 crabs are divided between 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.480
 males and the password to make it happen 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.410
 reproduction the male climbs on the female 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.470
 deposits their male gametes after 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.250
 of mating and females carry the 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.850
 hundreds of eggs in your abdomen until 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.140
 to be ready for birth in the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.380
 right moment 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.620
 females go to the edge of the sea and 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.400
 moves to free the stuck games 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.530
 in your carapace such movements that 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:27.760
 do they look like the dance 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:32.500
 of these hundreds of eggs appear the long ones 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.690
 that after undergoing some metamorphoses 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.530
 acquired the appearance of a crab 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.520
 adult because they have a hard shell to 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.190
 grow up 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.640
 the crabs should change their face 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.970
 a new one that bears your 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.520
 more developed body 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:59.690
 passing through a stage of life called 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:02.810
 or what they say the crabs are 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.510
 adored by many humans do not 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.110
 for being adorable creatures with their 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.250
 beautiful eyes with graceful legs but 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.190
 have a tender but tasty meat 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.519
 be careful when buying these beings 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.729
 so important for the biodiversity of 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.270
 our beaches and mangoes in period 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.450
 reproductive system called defense 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.370
 passwords should not be 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.700
 marketed 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.610
 therefore observes in the abdomen of the 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.530
 crabs when they form a drawing 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.110
 more triangular 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.710
 it is a male 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.070
 if round comes to a 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.280
 password that must be returned to your 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.280
 habitat 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:56.639
 next time you find in these 

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:59.909
 little animals out there 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:03.599
 remember if he has a life and a 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:10.589
 history face many challenges to 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:14.059
 fulfill its role in nature life 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:14.059
 two crabs
