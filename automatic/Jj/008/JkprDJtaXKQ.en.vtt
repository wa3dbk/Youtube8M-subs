00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
shortest length on the sides to the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:16.300 
shortest length on the sides to the
second<00:01:03.350> shortest<00:01:03.620> line<00:01:14.619> now<00:01:15.619> I'm<00:01:15.829> at<00:01:16.009> the

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
second shortest line now I'm at the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.480 
second shortest line now I'm at the
third<00:01:16.850> shortest<00:01:17.270> length<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:18.320> that's<00:01:19.159> just

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
third shortest length and that's just

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.489 
third shortest length and that's just
three<00:01:19.820> clicks<00:01:20.210> from<00:01:20.659> what<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.840> game<00:01:21.200> with<00:01:21.409> the

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
three clicks from what a game with the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:52.180 
three clicks from what a game with the
blades<00:01:31.030> that's<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.240> number<00:01:32.539> to<00:01:32.899> go

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.440 

now<00:01:53.190> I'm<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.520> cleaning<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.150> sides

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
now I'm just cleaning up the sides

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:05.090 
now I'm just cleaning up the sides
pretty<00:01:55.320> straight<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.160> got<00:01:56.310> through

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.050 

you

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.310 

back<00:02:08.750> with<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.110> number<00:02:09.200> two<00:02:09.470> guard<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:15.110> bag

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
back with the number two guard the bag

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.210 
back with the number two guard the bag
isn't<00:02:16.010> too<00:02:16.400> difficult<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.240> just<00:02:17.660> need<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.470> get

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
isn't too difficult you just need to get

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.890 
isn't too difficult you just need to get
down<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.550> muscle<00:02:19.730> memory<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.660> just

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
down the muscle memory and that just

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:40.580 
down the muscle memory and that just
comes<00:02:21.080> with<00:02:21.260> practice

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.620 

so<00:02:41.590> now<00:02:41.710> I'll<00:02:41.830> be<00:02:41.950> doing<00:02:42.190> no<00:02:42.430> guard<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.150> that's

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
so now I'll be doing no guard and that's

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.170 
so now I'll be doing no guard and that's
to<00:02:43.960> clean<00:02:44.650> up<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.370> hairline<00:02:45.820> on<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.090> back

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.600 

you

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.230 

you

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.670 

you

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.709 

so<00:03:08.680> here<00:03:08.890> I'm<00:03:09.010> using<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.640> number<00:03:10.180> one<00:03:10.390> guard

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
so here I'm using a number one guard

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.959 
so here I'm using a number one guard
with<00:03:10.959> partial<00:03:11.319> extended<00:03:11.739> blades<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.489> cut<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:12.969 
with partial extended blades and cut the

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.750 
with partial extended blades and cut the
back<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.329> my<00:03:13.450> hair<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.129> same<00:03:15.370> area<00:03:15.700> I

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
back of my hair it's the same area I

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:25.410 
back of my hair it's the same area I
just<00:03:15.819> cut<00:03:16.180> with<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.390> number<00:03:16.599> two

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.700 

here<00:03:26.420> I'm<00:03:26.510> using<00:03:26.540> number<00:03:27.020> three<00:03:27.290> guard<00:03:27.530> to

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
here I'm using number three guard to

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.350 
here I'm using number three guard to
reduce<00:03:27.980> some<00:03:28.190> thicker<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:28.760> fluffier<00:03:29.150> here

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
reduce some thicker and fluffier here

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:38.250 
reduce some thicker and fluffier here
towards<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.810> top<00:03:29.990> back<00:03:30.200> in<00:03:30.350> my<00:03:30.440> head

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.690 

plenty<00:03:39.260> using<00:03:39.530> sitters<00:03:39.830> from<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.040> top<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.640> I'm

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
plenty using sitters from the top so I'm

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.490 
plenty using sitters from the top so I'm
getting<00:03:40.880> my<00:03:41.060> head<00:03:41.210> wet<00:03:41.450> here

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.900 

here<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.650> can<00:03:46.770> see<00:03:46.950> this<00:03:47.100> how<00:03:47.310> my<00:03:47.460> hair<00:03:47.640> grows

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
here you can see this how my hair grows

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.060 
here you can see this how my hair grows
the<00:03:48.660> divide<00:03:48.960> is<00:03:49.170> where<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.560> hair<00:03:49.740> is<00:03:49.890> going

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
the divide is where the hair is going

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.460 
the divide is where the hair is going
straight<00:03:50.400> upwards<00:03:50.760> as<00:03:51.330> opposed<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.750> my<00:03:52.290> heavy

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
straight upwards as opposed to my heavy

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.990 
straight upwards as opposed to my heavy
bangs<00:03:52.770> which<00:03:53.010> lay<00:03:53.190> down<00:03:53.370> on<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.610> way<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.730> you

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
bangs which lay down on the way and you

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.610 
bangs which lay down on the way and you
can<00:03:57.150> see<00:03:57.180> I've<00:03:57.510> cut<00:03:57.720> my<00:03:57.840> bangs<00:03:58.020> a<00:03:58.170> lot<00:03:58.350> since
