that<00:02:01.690> you<00:02:01.869> would<00:02:02.110> make<00:02:02.380> all<00:02:02.740> hit<00:02:03.190> if<00:02:03.490> I<00:02:03.700> pull<00:02:04.090> my

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
that you would make all hit if I pull my

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.330 
that you would make all hit if I pull my
hair<00:02:04.600> straight<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.700> basically<00:02:07.540> my<00:02:07.930> goal<00:02:08.800> that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
hair straight so basically my goal that

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.850 
hair straight so basically my goal that
has<00:02:09.369> been<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.970> tailbone<00:02:10.959> length<00:02:11.290> three<00:02:11.620> years

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
has been a tailbone length three years

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.290 
has been a tailbone length three years
which<00:02:12.430> means<00:02:12.459> hair<00:02:12.880> touching<00:02:13.150> my<00:02:13.360> butt<00:02:15.300> it's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
which means hair touching my butt it's

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.720 
which means hair touching my butt it's
just<00:02:16.630> not<00:02:16.810> going<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.080> happen<00:02:17.220> if<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.550> has<00:02:18.700> not

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
just not going to happen if it has not

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.479 
just not going to happen if it has not
happened<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:19.540> these<00:02:19.930> past<00:02:20.440> six<00:02:20.860> years<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.430> we

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
happened in these past six years and we

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.820 
happened in these past six years and we
tell<00:02:21.700> them<00:02:21.820> everything<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:23.230> promote<00:02:23.590> hair

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
tell them everything to promote hair

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.270 
tell them everything to promote hair
care<00:02:24.100> as<00:02:24.250> far<00:02:24.459> as<00:02:24.670> possible<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:26.440> don't

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
care as far as possible and I don't

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.550 
care as far as possible and I don't
think<00:02:27.459> it's<00:02:27.580> are<00:02:27.700> going<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.060> happen<00:02:28.480> now<00:02:29.110> I

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
think it's are going to happen now I

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.140 
think it's are going to happen now I
have<00:02:30.250> talked<00:02:30.459> about<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.730> before<00:02:30.880> but

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
have talked about this before but

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.030 
have talked about this before but
there's<00:02:31.269> nothing<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.720> can<00:02:31.870> do<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.110> make<00:02:32.620> hair

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
there's nothing you can do to make hair

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.810 
there's nothing you can do to make hair
grow<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:35.019> is<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> natural<00:02:35.500> process<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.580> can

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
grow it is a natural process you can

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.340 
grow it is a natural process you can
only<00:02:36.970> do<00:02:37.390> things<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:38.880> make<00:02:39.880> your<00:02:40.150> hair<00:02:40.360> live<00:02:41.230> up

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
only do things to make your hair live up

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.170 
only do things to make your hair live up
to<00:02:41.470> its<00:02:41.590> full<00:02:41.769> potential<00:02:42.100> if<00:02:42.580> your<00:02:42.970> hair's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
to its full potential if your hair's

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.660 
to its full potential if your hair's
full<00:02:43.420> potential<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.320> waist<00:02:44.709> length<00:02:45.010> than

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
full potential it is waist length than

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.979 
full potential it is waist length than
that<00:02:45.910> you<00:02:46.390> know<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.709> think<00:02:48.780> my<00:02:49.780> art

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
that you know so be it so I think my art

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.310 
that you know so be it so I think my art
is<00:02:50.200> never<00:02:50.530> going<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:51.100> get<00:02:51.630> much<00:02:52.630> longer<00:02:53.079> than

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
is never going to get much longer than

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.699 
is never going to get much longer than
waistline<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:55.120> have<00:02:55.510> officially<00:02:56.200> given<00:02:56.440> up

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
waistline so I have officially given up

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.660 
waistline so I have officially given up
on<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.820> goal<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.329> reaching<00:02:58.810> tailbone<00:02:59.260> length

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
on the goal and reaching tailbone length

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.250 
on the goal and reaching tailbone length
because<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.850> just<00:03:01.120> think<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.660> mother<00:03:02.079> my

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
because I just think it is mother my

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.550 
because I just think it is mother my
genetics<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:02.950> reach<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.880> length<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.450> got<00:03:05.350> my

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
genetics to reach that length I got my

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.310 
genetics to reach that length I got my
hair<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:05.890> little<00:03:06.280> bit<00:03:06.459> of<00:03:06.670> trim<00:03:06.940> date<00:03:07.290> about<00:03:08.290> a

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
hair a little bit of trim date about a

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.130 
hair a little bit of trim date about a
month<00:03:08.680> ago<00:03:08.890> maybe<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.489> little<00:03:09.640> bit<00:03:09.850> more<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.329> it

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
month ago maybe a little bit more and it

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.910 
month ago maybe a little bit more and it
is<00:03:11.260> now<00:03:11.470> approximately<00:03:12.130> at<00:03:12.880> well<00:03:13.690> waste<00:03:14.680> when

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
is now approximately at well waste when

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.030 
is now approximately at well waste when
I<00:03:14.950> pull<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.340> out<00:03:15.489> so<00:03:16.420> here's<00:03:17.170> my<00:03:17.260> ways<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.560> nurse

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
I pull it out so here's my ways to nurse

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.699 
I pull it out so here's my ways to nurse
my<00:03:18.430> hair<00:03:18.640> so<00:03:18.910> yeah<00:03:19.329> this<00:03:20.079> is<00:03:20.290> pretty<00:03:20.500> much

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
my hair so yeah this is pretty much

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.890 
my hair so yeah this is pretty much
length<00:03:21.070> that<00:03:21.310> I've<00:03:21.430> had<00:03:21.820> for<00:03:23.190> forever<00:03:24.900> because

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
length that I've had for forever because

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.650 
length that I've had for forever because
as<00:03:26.019> long<00:03:26.290> as<00:03:26.500> my<00:03:26.680> hair<00:03:26.920> will<00:03:27.880> get<00:03:28.120> with<00:03:28.630> it

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
as long as my hair will get with it

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.840 
as long as my hair will get with it
still<00:03:29.140> looking<00:03:29.440> good<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:30.220> time<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.579> I<00:03:30.609> had

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
still looking good the time that I had

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.120 
still looking good the time that I had
into<00:03:31.150> almost<00:03:31.420> hit<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:32.109> didn't<00:03:32.980> look<00:03:33.070> good

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
into almost hit it didn't look good

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.780 
into almost hit it didn't look good
anymore<00:03:33.489> i<00:03:33.609> already<00:03:34.060> am<00:03:34.329> some<00:03:35.280> weird<00:03:36.280> shape<00:03:36.609> in

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
anymore i already am some weird shape in

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.640 
anymore i already am some weird shape in
the<00:03:36.880> back<00:03:37.060> end<00:03:37.299> just<00:03:37.480> wasn't<00:03:37.720> very<00:03:37.810> pretty<00:03:38.019> so

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
the back end just wasn't very pretty so

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.890 
the back end just wasn't very pretty so
i<00:03:38.680> think<00:03:38.950> i'm<00:03:39.549> going<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.850> maintain<00:03:40.150> my<00:03:40.510> hair<00:03:40.720> at

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
i think i'm going to maintain my hair at

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.090 
i think i'm going to maintain my hair at
this<00:03:41.109> length

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
this length

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.690 
this length
but<00:03:43.650> since<00:03:44.650> it's<00:03:44.890> not<00:03:45.070> going<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.370> get<00:03:45.490> longer

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
but since it's not going to get longer

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.650 
but since it's not going to get longer
there<00:03:46.060> is<00:03:46.180> not<00:03:46.630> really<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:47.080> much<00:03:47.580> of<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:49.390> point

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
there is not really that much of a point

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.710 
there is not really that much of a point
for<00:03:49.960> me<00:03:50.080> to<00:03:50.380> keep<00:03:50.590> being<00:03:51.370> this<00:03:51.640> extreme<00:03:52.360> about

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
for me to keep being this extreme about

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.310 
for me to keep being this extreme about
my<00:03:52.930> hair<00:03:53.170> care<00:03:53.410> because<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.970> idea<00:03:55.840> behind

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
my hair care because the idea behind

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.380 
my hair care because the idea behind
that<00:03:56.740> was<00:03:56.950> that<00:03:56.980> I<00:03:57.400> would<00:03:57.700> grow<00:03:58.180> my<00:03:58.360> hair

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
that was that I would grow my hair

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.810 
that was that I would grow my hair
really<00:03:58.750> long<00:03:59.020> and<00:03:59.320> in<00:03:59.890> order<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.070> do<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.550> I

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
really long and in order to do that I

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.600 
really long and in order to do that I
could<00:04:01.210> do<00:04:01.690> all<00:04:01.900> these<00:04:02.020> things<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.650> my<00:04:02.740> hair<00:04:03.010> but

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
could do all these things to my hair but

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.700 
could do all these things to my hair but
now<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:03.970> know<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.540> it's<00:04:05.170> never<00:04:05.350> going<00:04:05.590> to

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
now that I know that it's never going to

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.640 
now that I know that it's never going to
get<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.010> tailbone<00:04:06.580> I<00:04:06.900> would<00:04:07.900> really<00:04:08.260> like<00:04:08.470> to

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
get to tailbone I would really like to

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
every single day I just think that my

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
past five years it's a little bit

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.940 
past five years it's a little bit
extreme<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.480> I<00:04:58.980> think<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:01.510> if<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:02.260> cooperate

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
extreme and I think that if I cooperate

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.400 
extreme and I think that if I cooperate
a<00:05:03.130> little<00:05:03.160> bit<00:05:03.760> of<00:05:03.850> heat<00:05:04.060> into<00:05:04.390> some<00:05:04.870> special

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
a little bit of heat into some special

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.100 
a little bit of heat into some special
occasions<00:05:06.010> or<00:05:06.250> my<00:05:07.150> hair<00:05:07.390> won't<00:05:07.570> just<00:05:07.870> fall<00:05:08.080> out

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
occasions or my hair won't just fall out

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.760 
occasions or my hair won't just fall out
of<00:05:08.260> my<00:05:08.410> head<00:05:08.680> from<00:05:09.490> that<00:05:09.700> I'm<00:05:10.090> i<00:05:10.600> want<00:05:11.350> to<00:05:11.530> start

of my head from that I'm i want to start

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.320 
of my head from that I'm i want to start
experimenting<00:05:12.220> with<00:05:12.640> that<00:05:12.850> a<00:05:12.880> little<00:05:13.270> bit

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
experimenting with that a little bit

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.060 
experimenting with that a little bit
more<00:05:13.600> because<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:13.990> have<00:05:14.170> never<00:05:14.470> actually

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
again for winter you know get one of

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.270 
again for winter you know get one of
those<00:06:25.760> dies<00:06:26.060> at<00:06:26.480> like<00:06:26.750> fades<00:06:27.050> after<00:06:27.290> a<00:06:27.740> two<00:06:28.250> or

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
those dies at like fades after a two or

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.640 
those dies at like fades after a two or
three<00:06:28.610> months<00:06:28.850> those<00:06:29.420> aren't<00:06:29.870> that<00:06:30.200> bad<00:06:30.410> for

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
three months those aren't that bad for

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.960 
three months those aren't that bad for
hair<00:06:30.830> especially<00:06:30.950> when<00:06:31.310> you're<00:06:31.400> going<00:06:31.550> darker

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
hair especially when you're going darker

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.520 
hair especially when you're going darker
because<00:06:32.120> that<00:06:32.480> just<00:06:32.510> goes<00:06:32.960> your<00:06:33.200> hair<00:06:33.380> and

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
because that just goes your hair and

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.460 
because that just goes your hair and
doesn't<00:06:33.910> change<00:06:34.910> the<00:06:35.090> structure<00:06:35.480> of<00:06:35.510> it<00:06:35.690> like

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
doesn't change the structure of it like

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.760 
doesn't change the structure of it like
bleach<00:06:36.740> would<00:06:37.010> so<00:06:37.820> I<00:06:38.270> may<00:06:39.110> actually<00:06:39.230> do<00:06:39.560> that

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
bleach would so I may actually do that

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.650 
bleach would so I may actually do that
for<00:06:40.010> winter<00:06:40.340> I<00:06:40.400> think<00:06:41.000> I<00:06:41.150> would<00:06:41.270> really<00:06:41.570> enjoy

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660
