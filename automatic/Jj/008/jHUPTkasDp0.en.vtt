00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 not the subject of the operation in san lazaro 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.660
 for the change of powers this next 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.610
 Saturday first of December then it has 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.710
 generated as we already said reactions 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.080
 for and against we have on the line 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.990
 to ricardo anaya sub coordinator of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.490
 deputies of the bread good morning hello very 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.930
 Good morning, Victor Diego gives me a lot 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.470
 pleasure to greet greetings to all 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.500
 audience 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.960
 thank you deputy is necessary or is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.689
 exaggerated this fence this operative in 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.570
 salazar we consider that it should 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.520
 give a timely explanation well is 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.590
 true that he would not be responsible for 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.960
 qualify the measures in advance 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.300
 it is also true that we deserve a 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.579
 explanation for these laws that are 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.230
 absolutely atypical 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.329
 it will correspond to the staff 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.149
 presidential and the transition team 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.210
 of the president- elect explain with 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.360
 absolute for punctuality the reason for 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.890
 these measures that are themselves 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.520
 absolutely atypical and once 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.010
 let's know the reasons we can then 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.439
 qualify if they fit or not to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.150
 current needs for now what 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.370
 we will ask is an explanation 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.460
 both the staff and the team 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.460
 of transition who is the one who can give 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.200
 orders for this type of operation 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.910
 because it was spoken that in the only 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.800
 person who could do it because it was already the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.260
 president of the board of the 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.730
 Chamber of Deputies on the other hand 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.820
 he said no good nothing else can do it 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.680
 within the precincts of San Lazaro is 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.350
 true that the president of the table 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.020
 Board of Directors shall retain the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.910
 security inside the premises in 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.860
 this case the explanation will have to 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.110
 come rather from the staff 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.140
 presidential and the transition team 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.690
 that is to say the team of the elected president 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.910
 it is they who should explain with 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.550
 all punctuality the reason of these 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.190
 measures that are certainly atypical that 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.340
 we did not see in the last protest take 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.950
 in the year 2006 and that to be able to be 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.590
 qualified therefore require of course 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.290
 of a very specific explanation of the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.940
 reasons that motivated the deputies 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.650
 we saw that if there was something similar about 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.790
 everything in the delivery of the report of 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.519
 government of the last government report 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.430
 of the then president vicente fox that 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.159
 if we saw 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.290
 the images even from that year 2006 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.819
 approached a fence similar to what 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.370
 we are seeing today 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.510
 in this case both by the height of the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.709
 berries as per the breadth of the perimeter 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.780
 we are definitely before a 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.030
 circumstance that is extraordinary that 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.700
 It is atypical and why we so 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.040
 responsible without disqualifying beforehand 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.469
 if we demand a timely explanation 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.569
 both the staff and the team 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.790
 of transition so we can know 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.400
 the reasons that motivated him and then 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.019
 be able to qualify the measure and beyond 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.790
 the explanations that the 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.319
 deputy state 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.969
 you would agree with the boss 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.769
 of government that this is something offensive 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.840
 for the city of mexico especially 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.670
 obviously the people who live or 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.680
 work in this area 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.050
 our position is different by 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.940
 Of course we understand the inconvenience 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.010
 causing the neighbors to 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.170
 traders in the area and in that sense 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.540
 Well, of course there is 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.550
 solidarity with the difficulties that 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.140
 they are living during these days 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.720
 but our position is 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.270
 responsibility we want to first have 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.090
 the information in hand to know the 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.910
 reasons and from there it is then yes 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.910
 to be able to make a responsible judgment 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.349
 that reason we ask for an explanation both 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.050
 to the staff as the team of 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.480
 transition the deputy ricardo anaya del 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.220

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.230
