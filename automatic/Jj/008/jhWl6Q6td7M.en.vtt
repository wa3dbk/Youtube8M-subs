00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
blind eye on the cops you're basically

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.639 
blind eye on the cops you're basically
doing<00:01:14.149> this<00:01:14.389> so<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.719> cops<00:01:14.929> don't<00:01:15.200> get

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
doing this so the cops don't get

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.129 
doing this so the cops don't get
attracted<00:01:16.159> to<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:16.399> and<00:01:16.780> from<00:01:17.780> here<00:01:17.929> you<00:01:17.990> can

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:18.139 
attracted to you and from here you can

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:20.739 
attracted to you and from here you can
basically<00:01:18.380> go<00:01:18.709> to<00:01:19.179> destroying<00:01:20.179> the<00:01:20.359> back<00:01:20.509> of

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749 
basically go to destroying the back of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.300 
basically go to destroying the back of
the<00:01:21.020> armored<00:01:21.259> truck<00:01:21.289> and<00:01:21.679> collecting<00:01:22.189> the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
the armored truck and collecting the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.389 
the armored truck and collecting the
money<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.670> getting<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.719> RP<00:01:24.200> in<00:01:24.439> my<00:01:24.950> opinion<00:01:25.189> I

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
money and getting the RP in my opinion I

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.520 
money and getting the RP in my opinion I
think<00:01:25.429> you<00:01:25.759> get<00:01:25.909> more<00:01:26.090> RP<00:01:26.569> than<00:01:26.899> you<00:01:26.990> do<00:01:27.170> money

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
think you get more RP than you do money

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.559 
think you get more RP than you do money
so<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:28.280> is<00:01:28.369> more<00:01:28.609> of<00:01:28.639> like<00:01:28.729> an<00:01:28.939> RP<00:01:29.270> than<00:01:29.539> a

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
so this is more of like an RP than a

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.569 
so this is more of like an RP than a
muddy<00:01:29.840> method<00:01:30.200> but<00:01:30.679> it's<00:01:30.950> still<00:01:31.159> good<00:01:31.399> for

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
muddy method but it's still good for

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.819 
muddy method but it's still good for
money<00:01:31.759> if<00:01:31.999> you<00:01:32.179> are<00:01:32.359> quite<00:01:33.170> poor<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:33.649> don't

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
money if you are quite poor and don't

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.949 
money if you are quite poor and don't
have<00:01:33.979> much<00:01:34.219> money<00:01:34.459> so<00:01:34.729> as<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.689> can<00:01:35.779> see

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
have much money so as you can see

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.440 
have much money so as you can see
literally<00:01:36.649> as<00:01:36.829> you<00:01:37.069> destroy<00:01:37.700> each<00:01:37.969> armored

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
literally as you destroy each armored

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.719 
literally as you destroy each armored
truck<00:01:38.719> they<00:01:39.200> keep<00:01:39.439> spawning<00:01:39.770> seconds<00:01:40.520> later

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
truck they keep spawning seconds later
