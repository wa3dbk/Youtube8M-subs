00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.710
 Gotham! 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.220
 This is your only warning! 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.450
 Leave the city! 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.600
 Or I will release your worst fears! 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.850
 The last wish and testament of the late ... Thomas Wayne. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.140
 In the event of my death, I declare that all my possessions will belong to my son, 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.850
 Bruce Wayne. 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.770
 Bruce, 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.540
 I ask that you honor the legacy of the Wayne family. 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.250
 And commit to the advance of Gotham City. 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.050
 Its institutions, and its citizens. 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.570
 Please be strong. 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.740
 You are young, but destined for great things. 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.400
 Make the most of your opportunities. 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.820
 Use them to repay the city that has given us much, 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.340
 to change the lives of millions of people. 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.880
 Do not be futile with this fortune. 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.970
 Please do not spend everything on fast cars, 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.200
 in extravagant clothes, 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.540
 and the pursuit of a destructive lifestyle. 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.370
 Invest in Gotham. 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.710
 Treat people as family. 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.680
 Watch them, and use this money to save them from forces beyond their control. 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.200
 My greatest regret, 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.480
 is that I will not see him grow and become the good man I know he will be. 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.540
 And finally my son, 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.710
 I ask that you never leave this city in the hands of destiny. 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.110
 We have lived for dark days. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.080
 And without doubt more will come. 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.940
 But he is the good and great man who will rise through Gotham when others give up and run. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.420
 Namorte, I will love you forever. 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.050
 Your father, Thomas.
