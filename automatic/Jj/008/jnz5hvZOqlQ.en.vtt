00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.929
 hello you love yeah you certainly have 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.070
 seen a new rival peking but too 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.830
 my defense 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.260
 I have to say I actually only have 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.840
 ordered because I order series 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.570
 So I just wanted to dvd so I see 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.250
 we watch here with my dvd player 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.010
 Can I prefer that to me? 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.939
 on the internet I assume the quality 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.769
 to look 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.650
 So there are quite a few good ones 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.630
 series now on chrome instant video 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.340
 which I like to use for you 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.760
 i can fast with my ipad 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.649
 open was done 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.600
 I have a couple more now 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.340
 I ordered others here as well 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.450
 have and can look again and again 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.910
 and so but a book is in the basket 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.620
 I just did not have to land up 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.780
 I then saw that as me 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.760
 paid and again the prices 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.410
 wanted to see that the holding book stood 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.239
 and then I was so hot hey I got 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.090
 but not looked at books and stuff 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.589
 So apparently that was still in there 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.000
 when I just saw it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.900
 that it was available 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.510
 but no matter I grab it out now that is 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.850
 So the piece is not that special 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.580
 big did not find all things again 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.409
 But this time you have edged something 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.850
 not much that I still have 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.340
 I wanted to say have now the way 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.229
 also an instagram account so for 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.790
 the the one among my last videos 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.540
 I have not seen yet, he writes 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.460
 always so my contacts and so pure if 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.500
 they probably can not find it that way 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.060
 and now I have also in ensheim 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.759
 account for youtube if I do not 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.759
 I also did not think so 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:58.049
 yes, this time I like it very much 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.509
 has packed air cushion polls 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:12.370
 bubble wrap are milk 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:15.610
 bubble wrap noticed a dvds me 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.400
 give a little more effort that I know 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.970
 not and was seasick the book is too 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.680
 I did not know a hardcover 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.030
 the condition is so well i think so 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.129
 I do not have that much money for it now 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.390
 Anyway, it's from jay 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:34.510
 asher's dead girl does not lie that 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.160
 cover I do not think so now 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.629
 great but I have a lot 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.440
 You've heard good about it, too 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.140
 reingeschaut 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.730
 when i was in hugendubel in wÃ¼rzburg 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.829
 and I liked that a lot 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.780
 and yes, I was actually well now 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.709
 So a cart was lying without that 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:56.650
 I knew that when I actually 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:59.260
 cool now and now comes only 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.090
 dvds so for those who are now 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.829
 You can not be that interested 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.359
 switch off but it would be nice of course 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:12.849
 if you continue anyway 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:15.930
 I got the pretty little liars from me 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.930
 second season ordered 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.090
 that looks really good 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:30.590
 yes, I'm right, that has me 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.939
 first on dvd me again bought 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.180
 presentation and yes I love preachers 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.739
 it is one of my favorite series and 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.540
 yes I am already was already 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.879
 at season 4 I have sometime 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.239
 stopped or stopped 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.769
 I have to go now 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.900
 and yes I have now completely 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:57.439
 I like the cover really cool 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.720
 and yes, in general they are always everybody 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:04.480
 dressed as cool as in the season 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.480
 or just in the series is fully in common 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:15.349
 that is that then I have a lot of me 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:18.910
 We order vampire diaries ordered 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:23.479
 the first season is like that 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.740
 cool slip I still remember I have 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:29.210
 at the time when paris was extremely slavered and 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.979
 yes now I had to me anyway 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.949
 I think the cover is really cool 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:40.400
 here with that I have the 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:47.479
 second echelon of course I find so 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:51.919
 very class that's hardly anything and 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.699
 the third season and I think so 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.130
 cool too 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:58.789
 you can do that which has something cool different 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.500
 I had the first ones 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.900
 two seen and the fourth is now 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.820
 also relatively cheap to buy new if 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:10.880
 I 'm sure I 'll grow too 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:12.919
 but yes I think they did not give up 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.620
 like why I like it now 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:20.000
 has bought do not buy so rum 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.370
 and then I wanted to go one more time 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.280
 a bit further to other series 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.830
 look around and I'm on true blood 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.730
 what happened just how easy it is 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.750
 can recognize 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.890
 has to do with vampires and yes I am 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.530
 just curious 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.850
 do you know the season the series pleases 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.640
 they you more about what you can 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.400
 really say very interested 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.420
 I think the cover is incredibly great 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:55.240
 so on, I think it's been really cool 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:59.090
 and yes there's kind of hire cover what 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:04.640
 It should not be against the 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:06.140
 since that will work out if that's me 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.360
 Of course I will continue to do that 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:12.410
 I follow and I in the early human 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.990
 pushed 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.150
 I do not even know it is like that 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.690
 but in addition also totally interesting 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:24.350
 belongs and thus intrigues and stuff 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.330
 I like it full and now I have to 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.230
 I also want to have a look 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:35.150
 i have also been on amazon instant 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:37.430
 video seen and that's why it is quite 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.040
 many cool other series still exist 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.350
 I will then all searched for now 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.750
 the reason why I have so many series 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.120
 My friend is off 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:50.240
 next week on wednesday as on march 25th 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.320
 He is in China for six months 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.620
 do a traineeship 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.090
 originally that had done or 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.050
 he is when I go away too 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.550
 been pretty much the same time with him 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.590
 It would be easier for us then 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.230
 been because we both are relatively much too 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.930
 did have et cetera but it is with me 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.640
 nothing came of it 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.400
 he was taken with him everything works 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.020
 and yes I have to try it 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.960
 somehow come alone and clear 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.910
 that's why the whole series but I am 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.140
 Relatively confident that we will 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.210
 we are already done 

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:27.030
 relatively long together and 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.130
 yes we both want that works and 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.840
 if both so a bit 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.849
 have motivation and so I think so 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.770
 that works but I am 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:39.300
 I also sure that I often times 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:41.280
 I'm alone in the evening and a bit 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.599
 have boredom or ask me what 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.740
 I could do it now and then 

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:48.960
 are there such series quite cool 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.759
 yes I'm also curious I 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.699
 so far only one movie was as ordered 

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:55.680
 and he has worked well so far 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.250
 now that will be so but I am here 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.880
 actually also relatively confident 

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:04.740
 and yes it was now already so 

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:09.030
 I'm not proud of that anymore 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:10.590
 books or so ordered and yes then 

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.430
 Let's see you again at the next video 

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.430
 take care
