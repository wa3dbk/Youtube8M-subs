00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.030
 in a phenomenon when scrolling, welcome to the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.179
 previous government that I am more use to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.279
 her and today we have three more 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.380
 salad if you got that video is 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.230
 Why did you most likely watch? 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.090
 our other video with the three salads 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.279
 in the pot 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.109
 If it was not this is just you click 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.929
 some place on a card that will appear 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.000
 here exactly and you will arrive and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.829
 will watch this video if you already 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.050
 watched this video so you arrived at 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.480
 place to learn how to do 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.399
 the sauces of these salads that people 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.090
 suggested for you to use a pot 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.399
 measures and all quantities and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.260
 proportions and everything else you find in 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.340
 Our description of the video then 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.770
 need to worry 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.390
 But I'm going to make half an eye out for you here. 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.360
 see how easy it is simple fast and 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.640
 practical and mainly that you have 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.049
 having fun does not keep stuck 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.640
 if 101 ml or 98 ml and this is because 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.680
 in the salt area there is no problem 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.189
 If it were confectioners, it was dose and everything. 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.100
 more 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.750
 then you would have to follow the same 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.409
 In this case, here we have a certain 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.119
 poetic gastronomic freedom cause 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.689
 completely unnecessary and illegal 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.790
 so we'll start with a little bit 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.640
 the oil may be sunflower oil Oil 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.470
 canola a little olive oil 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.680
 the best quality you have 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.540
 I 'm already going to put a clove of garlic 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.420
 well minced it will be more 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.259
 complicated I will still add two 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.649
 anchovy fillets here comes more 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.350
 come here look at this credit for anchovy I 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.170
 I will not lie to you 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.970
 The smell of it is not the best but it is not. 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.740
 will keep that smell will not stay 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.869
 with anchovy fillet taste will stay 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.729
 Just salty if you do not tell 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.290
 nobody and you even forget that you have 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.490
 This rain building you will not even 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.290
 feel if you will not even know 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.510
 because this is a fish that if you 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.700
 put in your mouth before 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.860
 the salting lawyer because it is very 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.720
 salty and he's good for some 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.880
 dishes to salt and not to give the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.690
 I like the anchovy fillet I 'll give 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.180
 a micro hit it here and why that 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.830
 I said micro beat because if you 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.300
 hit too hard this thing starts to turn 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.430
 a mayonnaise because the base of mayonnaise 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.940
 is here practically now I'm going to put 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.060
 two generous spoons are two 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.640
 tablespoons mayonnaise 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.460
 the staff likes to put the cheese 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.750
 parmesan in another place after already 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.150
 It's ready, I like putting a 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.090
 little to mix in this expensive wall 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.930
 our wonderful is ready 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.990
 Spectacular delicious and classic sauce 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.880
 of cisa salati only thing I 'm going to do 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:03.800
 here to further enhance the taste is 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.800
 oh the little drops of lemon 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.400
 Well, let's go to our next one. 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.440
 delicious sauce and this I chose by finger 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.390
 Because music I like a lot and it's 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.190
 very light if you are on a diet if you 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.780
 Do you have a food restriction? 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.360
 Do you want something a bit lighter? 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.519
 but which is also tasty tasty 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.319
 help give a lot more flavor in your 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.900
 whether it be salad on the bridge or 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.379
 normal only you do this one that is the 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.420
 our yogurt sauce with mustard and 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.060
 Honey, this is too much trouble here. 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:47.340

 Mustard and Honey Do not Part Half Yes I 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.349
 I just want a little bit, I do not want to sweeten it. 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.599
 too much 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.940
 I just want to get that acid out of 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.150
 mustard is a state is very strong stands 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:09.910
 a very very present flavor one 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:14.349
 pinch salt a little pepper 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:22.630
 An hour and a half 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:26.080
 olive oil and some lemon drops to 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:30.960
 people balance the sweet taste acidity 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.960
 tasty texture and everything 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.470

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.460
 gastronomic in your face mouth because in 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:50.360
