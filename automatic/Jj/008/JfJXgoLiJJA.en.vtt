and again if we take a funky little
mirror<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.020> do<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.259> bits<00:01:09.680> just<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
mirror and we do the bits just on the

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.800 
mirror and we do the bits just on the
log<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.399> one<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.940> obviously<00:01:12.330> need<00:01:12.509> a

you<00:01:40.940> get<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.450> work<00:01:42.260> out<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.530> coordinates

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
you get to the work out the coordinates

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.680 
you get to the work out the coordinates
and<00:01:43.160> you<00:01:43.250> should<00:01:43.430> get<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.760> a<00:01:43.790> little<00:01:44.060> box<00:01:44.270> it's

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
and you should get to a little box it's

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.600 
and you should get to a little box it's
still<00:01:44.900> up<00:01:45.230> in<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.380> tree<00:01:45.650> nothing<00:01:46.070> interesting

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
still up in a tree nothing interesting

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.980 
still up in a tree nothing interesting
to<00:01:46.640> show<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:46.850> about<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.300> but<00:01:47.510> I<00:01:47.540> figured<00:01:47.900> I'd

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
just explain what happens at the end and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:02:17.920

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
then see which are long focused in in

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:40.010 
then see which are long focused in in
from<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> bottom<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.670> following<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.780> final

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
from the bottom and following the final

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.510 
from the bottom and following the final
coordinates<00:02:40.440> I'll<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.130> show<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:43.340> get<00:02:44.340> it
