stable than free fluorescent dyes in the
first<00:02:30.900> step<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:31.260> synthesize<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.920> fluorescent

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
first step we synthesize the fluorescent

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.780 
first step we synthesize the fluorescent
core<00:02:32.610> particle<00:02:33.709> next<00:02:34.709> we<00:02:34.830> grow<00:02:35.010> thin<00:02:35.310> silica

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
core particle next we grow thin silica

then<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.110> will<00:02:40.410> develop<00:02:40.650> chemistry<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.489> attach

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
then I will develop chemistry to attach

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.750 
then I will develop chemistry to attach
a<00:02:41.910> DNA<00:02:42.239> probe<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> nanoparticle<00:02:43.500> surface

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
using this brighter probe we could study

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140 
using this brighter probe we could study
genetic<00:02:52.590> mutations<00:02:53.070> in<00:02:53.190> single<00:02:53.520> molecules<00:02:53.970> of
