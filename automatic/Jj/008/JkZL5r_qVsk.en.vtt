00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
good to give it a good visual check over

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.990 
good to give it a good visual check over
first<00:01:20.590> so<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.830> just<00:01:22.070> cut<00:01:22.190> me<00:01:22.310> open<00:01:22.370> it<00:01:22.610> up<00:01:22.760> and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
first so I just cut me open it up and

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.150 
first so I just cut me open it up and
there<00:01:23.960> is<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.260> one<00:01:24.350> hundred<00:01:24.560> percent<00:01:24.590> hit<00:01:25.040> that

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
there is a one hundred percent hit that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.800 
there is a one hundred percent hit that
button<00:01:25.400> it'll<00:01:25.610> go<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.330> fit<00:01:26.630> with<00:01:26.750> the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
button it'll go and fit with the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.420 
button it'll go and fit with the
viewport<00:01:27.290> now<00:01:27.440> if<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:27.650> hit<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.950> plus<00:01:28.220> and

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
viewport now if you hit the plus and

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.270

right hand side your keyboard you can

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.760 
right hand side your keyboard you can
change<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.780> exposure<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:33.380> doesn't<00:01:33.650> actually

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
change the exposure it doesn't actually

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.470 
change the exposure it doesn't actually
affect<00:01:34.070> them<00:01:34.400> up<00:01:34.520> itself<00:01:34.850> it<00:01:35.060> just<00:01:35.180> means<00:01:35.330> you

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
affect them up itself it just means you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.149 
affect them up itself it just means you
can<00:01:35.630> view<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:35.900> a<00:01:35.930> bit<00:01:36.080> better<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.010> what<00:01:37.100> I

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
can view it a bit better so what I

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.190 
can view it a bit better so what I
normally<00:01:37.310> do<00:01:37.610> is<00:01:37.820> just<00:01:38.120> mess<00:01:38.480> around<00:01:38.510> and<00:01:38.930> try

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
normally do is just mess around and try

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
a tremendous amount of detail that's not

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.490 
a tremendous amount of detail that's not
capturing<00:04:23.260> there<00:04:24.130> are<00:04:24.250> some<00:04:24.370> other<00:04:24.520> settings

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
capturing there are some other settings

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.420 
capturing there are some other settings
so<00:04:26.500> we<00:04:26.590> can<00:04:26.710> change<00:04:26.890> it<00:04:27.070> to<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.220> length

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
so we can change it to the length

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.630 
so we can change it to the length
distance<00:04:27.970> angle<00:04:29.220> change<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.310> maximum

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
distance angle change the maximum

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.490 
distance angle change the maximum
subdivisions<00:04:31.120> 26<00:04:31.480> you<00:04:31.960> may<00:04:32.110> need<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.290> up<00:04:32.470> that

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
subdivisions 26 you may need to up that

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.040 
subdivisions 26 you may need to up that
depends<00:04:33.040> on<00:04:33.100> how<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.250> deal<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.550> this<00:04:33.780> length<00:04:34.780> to

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
depends on how to deal to this length to

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.610 
depends on how to deal to this length to
0.3<00:04:36.630> distance<00:04:37.630> to<00:04:37.750> 0.1<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:40.090> angle<00:04:40.450> 45<00:04:41.230> and

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
0.3 distance to 0.1 the angle 45 and

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.930 
0.3 distance to 0.1 the angle 45 and
check<00:04:42.580> view<00:04:43.000> dependent<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:44.560> so<00:04:44.800> do<00:04:44.860> we<00:04:44.980> now

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
check view dependent and so do we now

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.470 
check view dependent and so do we now
this<00:04:46.060> will<00:04:46.180> take<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.420> little<00:04:46.660> bit<00:04:46.810> longer<00:04:48.480> just

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
this will take a little bit longer just

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.450 
this will take a little bit longer just
find<00:04:49.690> where<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.110> phone<00:04:50.710> gators<00:04:51.070> and<00:04:51.280> just

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
find where the phone gators and just

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.280 
find where the phone gators and just
folks<00:04:51.790> in<00:04:51.970> it<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.510> little<00:04:52.600> longer<00:04:52.750> because<00:04:52.960> this

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
folks in it a little longer because this

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.170 
folks in it a little longer because this
is<00:04:53.440> really<00:04:53.830> fine<00:04:54.220> setting<00:04:54.640> these<00:04:54.880> settings

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
is really fine setting these settings

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.410 
is really fine setting these settings
are<00:04:55.270> actually<00:04:55.540> drefan<00:04:55.990> TF<00:04:56.260> card<00:04:56.440> low<00:04:57.420> enough

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
are actually drefan TF card low enough

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.210 
are actually drefan TF card low enough
testing<00:04:58.780> them<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.050> they<00:04:59.260> do<00:04:59.380> works<00:04:59.680> really

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
testing them and they do works really

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.510 
testing them and they do works really
tremendously<00:05:00.820> fine<00:05:01.090> detail<00:05:03.480> what's<00:05:04.480> in<00:05:05.520> them

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
tremendously fine detail what's in them

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.320 
tremendously fine detail what's in them
Hagel<00:05:07.210> said<00:05:07.540> away<00:05:07.690> arunda<00:05:08.880> now<00:05:09.880> pause<00:05:10.120> that

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
Hagel said away arunda now pause that

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.480 
Hagel said away arunda now pause that
obviously<00:05:10.600> it<00:05:10.960> took<00:05:11.140> three<00:05:11.560> minutes<00:05:11.800> 44<00:05:12.340> which

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
obviously it took three minutes 44 which

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.620 
obviously it took three minutes 44 which
is<00:05:12.580> not<00:05:12.670> a<00:05:12.700> minute<00:05:12.970> longer<00:05:13.120> than<00:05:13.270> last<00:05:13.510> time

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
is not a minute longer than last time

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.240 
is not a minute longer than last time
but<00:05:14.230> it<00:05:14.350> really<00:05:14.530> has<00:05:14.680> captured<00:05:14.950> some

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
but it really has captured some

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.680 
but it really has captured some
tremendous<00:05:15.820> detail<00:05:16.060> in<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:17.700> so<00:05:18.700> there's<00:05:19.420> both

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
tremendous detail in it so there's both

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.690 
tremendous detail in it so there's both
methods<00:05:19.930> of<00:05:20.170> doing<00:05:20.290> it<00:05:20.500> now<00:05:20.980> this<00:05:21.190> all<00:05:21.400> saw
