redemption<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.920> monikers<00:01:35.640> silver<00:01:36.630> card<00:01:37.500> 152

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.680 

monikers<00:01:43.610> silver

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.820 

hmm

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.830 

I'm<00:01:53.400> guessing<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.540> off<00:01:54.690> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
I'm guessing it's going to be off the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840 
I'm guessing it's going to be off the
standard<00:01:55.260> cards<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.040> has<00:01:56.190> a<00:01:56.220> material

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
standard cards it has a material

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.420 
standard cards it has a material
monikers<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.510> it<00:01:57.600> doesn't<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:57.930> up<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.170> high

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
monikers but it doesn't go up that high

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.560 
monikers but it doesn't go up that high
so<00:01:59.430> I'm<00:01:59.490> guessing<00:01:59.760> it's<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
so I'm guessing it's going to be in the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.900 
so I'm guessing it's going to be in the
Phenom<00:02:00.930> 152<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.310> anthony<00:02:02.940> Dixon<00:02:04.910> yes
