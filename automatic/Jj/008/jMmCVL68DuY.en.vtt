00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
think it's a very let me just put it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.420 
think it's a very let me just put it
down<00:01:24.200> um<00:01:26.150> alright<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.750> anyways<00:01:28.530> about<00:01:28.979> pin

rolling<00:01:29.909> jeans<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.259> kind<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.560> guy<00:01:31.650> who

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
rolling jeans I'm not a kind of guy who

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.350 
rolling jeans I'm not a kind of guy who
actually<00:01:31.920> would<00:01:32.220> pin<00:01:32.460> roll<00:01:32.640> their<00:01:32.820> jeans<00:01:33.060> I

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
think really that kind of style is for

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.899 
think really that kind of style is for
the<00:01:36.630> people<00:01:37.110> who<00:01:37.380> are<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:38.070> classy<00:01:38.700> with
