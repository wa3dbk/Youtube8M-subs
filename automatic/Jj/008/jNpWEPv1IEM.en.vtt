so<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.260> stage<00:00:01.589> /<00:00:02.280> dqo<00:00:02.760> tank<00:00:03.110> configuration<00:00:04.110> is

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.640 
so the stage / dqo tank configuration is

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.730 
so the stage / dqo tank configuration is
consistent<00:00:05.640> with<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.720> back<00:00:07.020> mount<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
consistent with the back mount and the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.709 
consistent with the back mount and the
fact<00:00:08.010> that<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.220> game<00:00:08.490> we<00:00:08.670> really<00:00:08.700> like<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.480> use

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
fact that a game we really like to use

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.259 
fact that a game we really like to use
aluminum<00:00:10.290> cylinders<00:00:10.769> because<00:00:11.309> aluminum<00:00:12.030> is

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
aluminum cylinders because aluminum is

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.200 
aluminum cylinders because aluminum is
again<00:00:13.110> not<00:00:13.830> negative<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.639> therefore<00:00:15.000> when

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
again not negative and therefore when

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.790 
again not negative and therefore when
you<00:00:15.240> remove<00:00:15.809> them<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.230> push<00:00:16.379> them<00:00:16.529> out<00:00:16.650> in

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
you remove them and push them out in

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.650 
you remove them and push them out in
front<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.279> what<00:00:17.460> poisons<00:00:18.060> when<00:00:18.539> you

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
front of you what poisons when you

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.810 
front of you what poisons when you
pushing<00:00:19.140> through<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.470> rec<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.400> cylinder

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
pushing through is rec the cylinder

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.029 
pushing through is rec the cylinder
doesn't<00:00:21.029> make<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.779> do<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> head<00:00:22.320> dive<00:00:22.740> or

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
doesn't make you do a head dive or

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.890 
doesn't make you do a head dive or
something<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.580> right<00:00:24.029> cylinders

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
something like that right cylinders

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
something like that right cylinders
should<00:00:25.170> be<00:00:25.289> neutral<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.949> should<00:00:26.519> be

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
should be neutral and you should be

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.279 
should be neutral and you should be
independently<00:00:27.539> weighted

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
independently weighted

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.050

you are always neutral and your

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.060 
you are always neutral and your

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
Southerners should be removable that's

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.690 
Southerners should be removable that's
the<00:00:32.309> key<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.960> z<00:00:33.960> side<00:00:34.590> mount<00:00:34.860> diving<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.460> Luna

cylinders<00:00:36.210> work<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> best<00:00:36.719> again<00:00:37.140> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
cylinders work the best again and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.680 
cylinders work the best again and
remember<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.520> when<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:39.000> when<00:00:39.270> they<00:00:39.390> fool

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
remember that when they when they fool

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.810 
remember that when they when they fool
they<00:00:40.020> generally<00:00:40.559> will<00:00:40.710> sink<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.670> will

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
they generally will sink and they will

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.760 
they generally will sink and they will
start<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.239> float<00:00:42.510> at<00:00:42.660> some<00:00:42.960> point<00:00:43.290> as<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.559> use

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
start to float at some point as you use

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.799 
start to float at some point as you use
the<00:00:43.950> gas<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.030> means<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.390> want<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the gas so that means we want to have a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.080 
the gas so that means we want to have a
bolt<00:00:46.079> snap<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> bottom<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.399> plus<00:00:47.850> or

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
bolt snap on the bottom that's plus or

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.630 
bolt snap on the bottom that's plus or
minus<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.079> distance<00:00:49.559> from<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.039> ball<00:00:50.280> snap

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
minus the distance from that ball snap

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000 
minus the distance from that ball snap
to<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> top<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> cylinder<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.800> right

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
to the top of the cylinder all right

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.400 
to the top of the cylinder all right
should<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.640> where<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.750> when<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.020> attached

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
should be where you when it's attached

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.160 
should be where you when it's attached
to<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.340> cylinder<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.090> under<00:00:57.750> your<00:00:57.960> arm

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
to you that cylinder is under your arm

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.260 
to you that cylinder is under your arm
just<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.949> right<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.579> found<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
just like that right so I found that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.680 
just like that right so I found that
that<00:01:00.600> distance<00:01:01.309> from<00:01:02.309> there<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.030> should

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that distance from there to there should

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.740 
that distance from there to there should
be<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:04.140> 16<00:01:04.860> inches<00:01:05.040> give<00:01:05.760> or<00:01:05.880> take<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
be about 16 inches give or take and the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.390 
be about 16 inches give or take and the
idea<00:01:07.080> being<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.470> again<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.010> attached

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
idea being is again when it's attached

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.730 
idea being is again when it's attached
the<00:01:08.939> cylinder<00:01:09.510> sits<00:01:09.930> under<00:01:10.229> your<00:01:10.350> arm

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the cylinder sits under your arm

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.120 
the cylinder sits under your arm
freeing<00:01:11.670> your<00:01:11.880> arm<00:01:12.090> completely<00:01:12.630> look<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.170> could

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
freeing your arm completely look I could

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.749 
freeing your arm completely look I could
do<00:01:14.250> anything<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.670> want<00:01:14.909> right<00:01:15.420> I'm<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
do anything I want right I'm not in the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
do anything I want right I'm not in the
traditional<00:01:17.909> back<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.720> way<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.320> where

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
traditional back my way like this where

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.260 
traditional back my way like this where
the<00:01:19.770> cylinders<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.490> way<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.850> can't<00:01:21.119> move

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the cylinders in my way and I can't move

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.630 
the cylinders in my way and I can't move
my<00:01:21.450> arm<00:01:21.659> especially<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.710> got<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.130> that's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
my arm especially if I got to that's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
my arm especially if I got to that's
gonna<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.970> incoming<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.780> want<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.200> make<00:01:25.350> sure

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
gonna be incoming so I want to make sure

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.429 
gonna be incoming so I want to make sure
that<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> cylinder<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.759> under<00:01:27.720> my<00:01:27.900> armpit

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that the cylinder is under my armpit

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.859 
that the cylinder is under my armpit
protected<00:01:29.040> by<00:01:29.189> my<00:01:29.340> shoulder<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.600> far

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
protected by my shoulder so it's far

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.950 
protected by my shoulder so it's far
less<00:01:30.930> drag<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:32.400> always<00:01:33.150> parallel<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.840> my

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
less drag it's always parallel to my

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.370 
less drag it's always parallel to my
body

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
body

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.560 
body
it<00:01:34.470> should<00:01:34.890> never<00:01:35.130> float<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it should never float but up and it

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.649 
it should never float but up and it
should<00:01:36.750> never<00:01:37.140> sink<00:01:37.970> both<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.210> those<00:01:39.360> will

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
should never sink both of those will

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899 
should never sink both of those will
cause<00:01:39.869> more<00:01:40.320> drag<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.460> want<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> be

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
cause more drag you want it to be

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.090 
cause more drag you want it to be
streamlined<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.170> remember<00:01:43.560> when<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.770> start

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
streamlined so remember when you start

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.490 
streamlined so remember when you start
the<00:01:44.250> dive<00:01:44.460> you're<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> clip<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the dive you're going to clip it to the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.160 
the dive you're going to clip it to the
back<00:01:46.829> Deering<00:01:47.460> alright<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.720> cylinder

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
back Deering alright and the cylinder

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.100 
back Deering alright and the cylinder
will<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.770> sink<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.659> where

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
will actually sink so you can see where

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.990 
will actually sink so you can see where
you<00:01:52.229> position<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> back<00:01:53.070> Deering<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you position the back Deering the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.789 
you position the back Deering the
cylinder<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.810> cylinder<00:01:55.170> starts<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> sink

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
cylinder as the cylinder starts to sink

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.950 
cylinder as the cylinder starts to sink
it<00:01:55.920> pulls<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> harness<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> stays

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it pulls on the harness and so it stays

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.179 
it pulls on the harness and so it stays
parallel<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.009> body<00:01:59.219> as<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.590> both

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
parallel to your body as the the both

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.980 
parallel to your body as the the both
bottle<00:02:02.700> starts<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.149> float<00:02:03.479> you're<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
bottle starts to float you're going to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.080 
bottle starts to float you're going to
move<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.619> front<00:02:04.770> Deering<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.729> bottom

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
move it to the front Deering the bottom

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.540 
move it to the front Deering the bottom
will<00:02:06.210> float<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.259> cylinder<00:02:07.860> will<00:02:08.069> stay

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
will float up and the cylinder will stay

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.910 
will float up and the cylinder will stay
a<00:02:08.970> little<00:02:09.720> bit<00:02:09.869> floaty<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> side<00:02:10.800> of

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
a little bit floaty but on the side of

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.040 
a little bit floaty but on the side of
your<00:02:10.979> body<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.819> really<00:02:12.300> what<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.540> cylinder

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
your body so really what the cylinder

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.530 
your body so really what the cylinder
doing<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.530> its<00:02:13.980> floating<00:02:14.280> or<00:02:14.700> sinking<00:02:15.150> between

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
doing is its floating or sinking between

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.270 
doing is its floating or sinking between
the<00:02:15.750> two<00:02:15.930> d-rings<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.830> it's<00:02:16.950> sitting<00:02:17.250> right

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
the two d-rings so it's sitting right

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.810 
the two d-rings so it's sitting right
along<00:02:17.730> your<00:02:17.910> side<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:19.110> what<00:02:19.290> you're<00:02:19.440> after

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
along your side that's what you're after

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.260 
the qc6 so that doesn't flop around if
we<00:03:25.320> didn't<00:03:25.560> have<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.709> under<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.160> bungee<00:03:26.520> where

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
we didn't have it under the bungee where

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.420 
we didn't have it under the bungee where
the<00:03:27.360> qc6<00:03:27.959> would<00:03:28.200> hang<00:03:28.470> down<00:03:28.770> when<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.130> plugged

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
the qc6 would hang down when I plugged

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.640 
the qc6 would hang down when I plugged
it<00:03:29.580> in<00:03:29.700> like<00:03:29.910> this<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.480> would<00:03:30.660> hang<00:03:30.870> down<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:31.620> I

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
it in like this it would hang down so I

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.920 
it in like this it would hang down so I
actually<00:03:31.980> use<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.760> bungee<00:03:33.120> on<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.360> cylinder

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
actually use the bungee on the cylinder

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.400 
actually use the bungee on the cylinder
to<00:03:34.290> tidy<00:03:34.770> up<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.330> input<00:03:36.750> gas<00:03:36.989> I'm<00:03:37.200> gonna

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410

functionality<00:04:22.200> if<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.320> have<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.650> too<00:04:22.770> short

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
functionality if you have it too short

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.020 
functionality if you have it too short
it's<00:04:23.729> too<00:04:23.970> much<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.300> pain<00:04:24.510> in<00:04:24.660> the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
it's too much of pain in the

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.090 
it's too much of pain in the
the<00:04:25.150> reality<00:04:25.570> ever<00:04:25.690> too<00:04:25.930> long<00:04:26.230> it<00:04:26.590> flops

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
the reality ever too long it flops

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.190 
the reality ever too long it flops
around<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:27.730> 24<00:04:28.210> inches<00:04:28.389> in<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.570> optimal

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
around so 24 inches in the optimal

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.260 
around so 24 inches in the optimal
length<00:04:29.380> then<00:04:29.889> you<00:04:29.920> want<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.250> six<00:04:30.730> inch<00:04:30.970> high

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270

installed<00:05:01.540> it<00:05:01.810> so<00:05:02.320> with<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:03.010> in<00:05:03.190> mind<00:05:03.400> now

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
installed it so with that in mind now

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.010 
installed it so with that in mind now
you're<00:05:03.970> gonna<00:05:04.090> go<00:05:04.360> ahead<00:05:04.480> and<00:05:04.660> you're<00:05:04.870> going

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
you're gonna go ahead and you're going

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.659 
you're gonna go ahead and you're going
to<00:05:05.080> be<00:05:05.200> able<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.500> connect<00:05:06.010> it<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.490> way<00:05:06.640> I

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
to be able to connect it the way I

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.180 
to be able to connect it the way I
connected<00:05:07.300> always<00:05:07.540> is<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.380> first<00:05:08.710> connect<00:05:09.070> the

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
connected always is I first connect the

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.860 
connected always is I first connect the
bottom<00:05:09.490> of<00:05:09.790> the<00:05:09.910> cylinder<00:05:10.090> that's<00:05:10.600> just<00:05:10.780> the

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
bottom of the cylinder that's just the

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.870 
bottom of the cylinder that's just the
way<00:05:11.020> I<00:05:11.050> do<00:05:11.200> it<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:11.830> I<00:05:11.860> build<00:05:12.130> my<00:05:12.280> habit<00:05:12.580> I<00:05:12.640> come

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
way I do it so I build my habit I come

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.640 
way I do it so I build my habit I come
in<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:13.210> connect<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.840> bottom<00:05:14.169> of<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.470> cylinder

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
in I connect the bottom of the cylinder

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.820 
in I connect the bottom of the cylinder
I<00:05:15.360> then<00:05:16.360> grab<00:05:16.690> my<00:05:16.960> qc6

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
I then grab my qc6

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.850 
I then grab my qc6
right<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:18.669> I<00:05:18.880> plugged<00:05:19.240> my<00:05:19.419> qc6<00:05:20.050> in<00:05:20.260> just<00:05:20.710> like

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
right and I plugged my qc6 in just like

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.700 
right and I plugged my qc6 in just like
this<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:22.150> my<00:05:22.419> system<00:05:23.080> is<00:05:23.200> powered

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
this so my system is powered

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.890 
this so my system is powered
I<00:05:23.740> check<00:05:24.310> that's<00:05:24.820> properly<00:05:25.240> plugged<00:05:25.479> in<00:05:25.720> but

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
I check that's properly plugged in but

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.140 
I check that's properly plugged in but
not<00:05:26.229> being<00:05:26.610> making<00:05:27.610> sure<00:05:27.760> that<00:05:27.850> I<00:05:27.910> can't

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
not being making sure that I can't

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.750 
not being making sure that I can't
disconnect<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.930> I<00:05:29.110> then<00:05:29.620> run<00:05:29.890> my<00:05:30.130> thumb<00:05:30.160> under

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
disconnect it I then run my thumb under

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.120 
disconnect it I then run my thumb under
my<00:05:30.880> bungee<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:31.450> I<00:05:31.870> pull<00:05:32.200> and<00:05:32.440> push<00:05:32.710> this<00:05:32.890> hose

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
my bungee and I pull and push this hose

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.810 
my bungee and I pull and push this hose
all<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:33.880> way<00:05:33.940> back<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:34.270> it's<00:05:34.570> nice<00:05:34.870> and<00:05:34.900> clean

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
all the way back so it's nice and clean

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.219 
all the way back so it's nice and clean
really<00:05:36.820> important<00:05:37.330> nice<00:05:37.540> and<00:05:37.780> clean<00:05:37.990> yeah

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
really important nice and clean yeah

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.890 
really important nice and clean yeah
then<00:05:39.220> I<00:05:39.250> go<00:05:39.520> ahead<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:39.790> grab<00:05:40.120> my<00:05:40.150> bungee<00:05:40.600> like

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
then I go ahead I grab my bungee like

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.710 
then I go ahead I grab my bungee like
this<00:05:41.080> and<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.560> pull<00:05:41.830> my<00:05:42.010> bungee<00:05:42.220> out<00:05:42.720> come

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
this and I pull my bungee out come

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.380 
this and I pull my bungee out come
around<00:05:43.990> my<00:05:44.200> 10<00:05:44.440> 12<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:44.979> I<00:05:45.580> pop<00:05:45.880> it<00:05:46.030> around<00:05:46.270> that

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
around my 10 12 and I pop it around that

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.540 
around my 10 12 and I pop it around that
little<00:05:46.660> stem<00:05:46.960> on<00:05:47.140> the<00:05:47.169> tank<00:05:47.440> valve<00:05:47.620> so<00:05:48.310> it<00:05:48.340> pops

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
little stem on the tank valve so it pops

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.510 
little stem on the tank valve so it pops
into<00:05:48.820> place<00:05:48.970> and<00:05:49.960> now<00:05:49.990> my<00:05:50.350> tank<00:05:50.650> is<00:05:51.039> basically

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
into place and now my tank is basically

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.060 
into place and now my tank is basically
ready<00:05:51.789> to<00:05:51.880> go<00:05:52.060> so<00:05:52.630> now<00:05:52.810> when<00:05:53.110> I'm<00:05:53.289> when<00:05:53.950> I'm

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
ready to go so now when I'm when I'm

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.029 
ready to go so now when I'm when I'm
when<00:05:54.610> I'm<00:05:54.760> in<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.300> water<00:05:55.510> in<00:05:56.260> the<00:05:56.380> side<00:05:56.740> mount

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
when I'm in the water in the side mount

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.430 
when I'm in the water in the side mount
configuration<00:05:57.789> just<00:05:57.820> like<00:05:58.330> this<00:05:58.570> right

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
configuration just like this right

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.980 
configuration just like this right
perfectly<00:06:00.130> on<00:06:00.250> my<00:06:00.400> side<00:06:00.700> right<00:06:01.450> when<00:06:01.720> I'm<00:06:01.810> in

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
perfectly on my side right when I'm in

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.440 
perfectly on my side right when I'm in
the<00:06:02.140> water<00:06:02.430> remember<00:06:03.430> that<00:06:03.789> I<00:06:03.820> wouldn't<00:06:04.180> use

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
the water remember that I wouldn't use

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.390 
the water remember that I wouldn't use
this<00:06:04.690> bungee<00:06:04.960> from<00:06:05.350> walking<00:06:05.740> on<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:06.010> beach<00:06:06.190> if

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
this bungee from walking on the beach if

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.120 
this bungee from walking on the beach if
I'm<00:06:06.520> doing<00:06:06.700> a<00:06:06.760> beach<00:06:06.970> entry<00:06:07.330> entry<00:06:07.810> and<00:06:08.080> I<00:06:08.500> need

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
I'm doing a beach entry entry and I need

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.950 
I'm doing a beach entry entry and I need
more<00:06:09.370> support<00:06:09.880> the<00:06:10.030> tanks<00:06:10.360> too<00:06:10.510> heavy<00:06:10.720> I<00:06:10.840> don't

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
more support the tanks too heavy I don't

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.820 
more support the tanks too heavy I don't
want<00:06:11.080> to<00:06:11.140> put<00:06:11.260> all<00:06:11.320> that<00:06:11.350> pressure<00:06:11.530> on<00:06:11.770> the

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
want to put all that pressure on the

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.880 
want to put all that pressure on the
bungee<00:06:12.010> I<00:06:12.280> can<00:06:12.880> use<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:13.180> top<00:06:13.419> bolts<00:06:13.630> now<00:06:13.890> just

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
bungee I can use the top bolts now just

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.219 
bungee I can use the top bolts now just
clip<00:06:15.100> it<00:06:15.130> to<00:06:15.310> my<00:06:15.430> harness<00:06:15.610> like<00:06:15.940> this<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:17.080> now

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
clip it to my harness like this so now

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:18.390 
clip it to my harness like this so now
when<00:06:17.410> I'm<00:06:17.500> doing<00:06:17.680> beach<00:06:17.860> entry<00:06:18.220> and<00:06:18.340> I'm

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
when I'm doing beach entry and I'm

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.920 
when I'm doing beach entry and I'm
walking<00:06:18.760> in<00:06:18.880> the<00:06:18.910> tank<00:06:19.210> is<00:06:19.390> being<00:06:19.570> supported

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
walking in the tank is being supported

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.290 
walking in the tank is being supported
by<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.289> bolts<00:06:20.860> now<00:06:21.070> not<00:06:21.370> by<00:06:21.520> the<00:06:21.580> bungee<00:06:21.940> and

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
by the bolts now not by the bungee and

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.050 
by the bolts now not by the bungee and
then<00:06:23.169> once<00:06:23.440> I<00:06:23.590> hit<00:06:23.800> the<00:06:23.860> water<00:06:24.010> and<00:06:24.490> once<00:06:24.910> I

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
then once I hit the water and once I

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.730 
then once I hit the water and once I
actually<00:06:25.210> start<00:06:25.690> to<00:06:25.840> go<00:06:25.990> down<00:06:26.229> the<00:06:26.440> waters

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
actually start to go down the waters

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.560 
actually start to go down the waters
being<00:06:26.919> so<00:06:27.100> she's<00:06:27.310> now<00:06:27.460> supporting<00:06:28.090> the

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
being so she's now supporting the

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.020 
being so she's now supporting the
cylinder<00:06:29.050> I<00:06:29.260> can<00:06:29.590> actually<00:06:29.740> unhook<00:06:30.280> this<00:06:30.460> and

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
cylinder I can actually unhook this and

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.850 
cylinder I can actually unhook this and
it'll<00:06:31.270> move<00:06:31.510> into<00:06:31.810> the<00:06:31.990> side<00:06:32.289> mount<00:06:32.620> position

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
it'll move into the side mount position

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.070 
it'll move into the side mount position
which<00:06:33.280> is<00:06:33.400> actually<00:06:33.880> on<00:06:34.060> this<00:06:34.240> side<00:06:34.300> this<00:06:35.020> is

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
which is actually on this side this is

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.050 
which is actually on this side this is
obviously<00:06:35.500> lose<00:06:35.710> a<00:06:35.950> little<00:06:36.490> exaggerated

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
obviously lose a little exaggerated

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.770 
obviously lose a little exaggerated
because<00:06:37.270> of<00:06:37.710> gravity

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
because of gravity

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.900 
because of gravity
