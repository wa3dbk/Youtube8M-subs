okay<00:00:10.869> so<00:00:10.929> in<00:00:11.169> this<00:00:11.289> video<00:00:11.530> we're<00:00:11.860> going<00:00:11.980> to<00:00:12.039> be

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:12.249 
okay so in this video we're going to be

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.089 
okay so in this video we're going to be
adding<00:00:12.699> a<00:00:13.179> blow-off<00:00:13.659> valve<00:00:14.019> to<00:00:14.230> the<00:00:14.259> mark<00:00:14.379> for

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
adding a blow-off valve to the mark for

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.140 
adding a blow-off valve to the mark for
golf<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.570> here's<00:00:16.840> how<00:00:16.990> blow-off<00:00:17.650> valve

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
golf so here's how blow-off valve

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.880 
golf so here's how blow-off valve
imported<00:00:19.150> directly<00:00:19.420> from<00:00:19.750> China<00:00:20.170> and<00:00:20.500> this

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
imported directly from China and this

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.040 
imported directly from China and this
one<00:00:21.040> cost<00:00:21.280> me<00:00:21.460> about<00:00:21.700> 15<00:00:22.180> pounds<00:00:22.450> delivered

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
one cost me about 15 pounds delivered

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.400 
one cost me about 15 pounds delivered
and<00:00:23.200> took<00:00:23.980> about<00:00:24.100> eight<00:00:24.400> months<00:00:24.580> so<00:00:25.510> if<00:00:26.260> you

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
and took about eight months so if you

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.950 
and took about eight months so if you
want<00:00:26.560> one<00:00:26.680> quicker<00:00:27.100> buy<00:00:27.520> one<00:00:27.760> more<00:00:27.970> local<00:00:28.480> now

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
want one quicker buy one more local now

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.420 
want one quicker buy one more local now
this<00:00:29.140> is<00:00:29.200> an<00:00:29.260> adjustable<00:00:29.680> one<00:00:29.890> as<00:00:30.100> you<00:00:30.250> can<00:00:30.280> see

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
this is an adjustable one as you can see

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.429 
this is an adjustable one as you can see
it's<00:00:30.880> a<00:00:31.030> plumb<00:00:31.360> back<00:00:31.570> harder<00:00:32.020> plumb<00:00:32.259> back

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
it's a plumb back harder plumb back

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.110 
it's a plumb back harder plumb back
softer<00:00:32.980> you<00:00:33.850> can<00:00:33.879> adjust<00:00:34.390> it<00:00:34.539> by<00:00:34.659> twisting<00:00:35.379> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
softer you can adjust it by twisting the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.720 
softer you can adjust it by twisting the
top<00:00:37.120> part<00:00:37.480> there<00:00:37.780> because<00:00:38.649> inside<00:00:39.339> is<00:00:39.609> an

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
top part there because inside is an

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.790 
top part there because inside is an
adjustable<00:00:40.329> spring<00:00:40.899> and<00:00:41.199> as<00:00:41.289> you<00:00:41.379> know<00:00:41.559> it's<00:00:41.710> a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
adjustable spring and as you know it's a

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.610 
adjustable spring and as you know it's a
piston<00:00:42.339> so<00:00:42.640> as<00:00:42.850> a<00:00:43.329> pressure<00:00:43.690> builds<00:00:44.079> up<00:00:44.230> or<00:00:44.469> as

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
piston so as a pressure builds up or as

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.009 
piston so as a pressure builds up or as
the<00:00:44.829> suction<00:00:45.309> pulls<00:00:46.179> on<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.420> top<00:00:46.600> of<00:00:46.749> it<00:00:46.870> it

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
the suction pulls on the top of it it

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.439 
the suction pulls on the top of it it
pulls<00:00:47.289> up<00:00:47.530> that<00:00:47.760> piston<00:00:48.760> allows<00:00:49.210> it<00:00:49.420> to

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
pulls up that piston allows it to

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.660 
pulls up that piston allows it to
breathe<00:00:49.749> out<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.890> like<00:00:51.039> I<00:00:51.190> said<00:00:51.339> this<00:00:51.489> one's

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
breathe out and like I said this one's

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.610 
breathe out and like I said this one's
an<00:00:51.789> atmospheric<00:00:52.479> one<00:00:52.749> which<00:00:52.989> means<00:00:53.260> it<00:00:53.409> blows

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
an atmospheric one which means it blows

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.040 
an atmospheric one which means it blows
out<00:00:53.769> all<00:00:54.039> the<00:00:54.219> extra<00:00:54.670> pressure<00:00:55.019> into<00:00:56.019> the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
out all the extra pressure into the

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.139 
out all the extra pressure into the
atmosphere<00:00:56.769> and<00:00:57.039> it's<00:00:57.219> easily<00:00:57.460> adjusted<00:00:58.120> just

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
atmosphere and it's easily adjusted just

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.899 
atmosphere and it's easily adjusted just
by<00:00:58.479> twisting<00:00:59.019> it<00:00:59.139> up<00:00:59.289> or<00:00:59.559> twisting<00:00:59.920> it<00:01:00.010> down<00:01:00.219> so

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
by twisting it up or twisting it down so

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.360 
by twisting it up or twisting it down so
the<00:01:01.539> pressure<00:01:02.079> will<00:01:02.229> come<00:01:02.440> out<00:01:02.620> earlier<00:01:03.100> or

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
the pressure will come out earlier or

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.740 
the pressure will come out earlier or
later<00:01:03.429> depending<00:01:05.220> okay<00:01:06.220> so<00:01:06.730> now<00:01:06.850> inside<00:01:07.480> like

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
later depending okay so now inside like

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.130 
later depending okay so now inside like
I<00:01:07.870> stated<00:01:08.050> before<00:01:08.230> is<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.740> spring<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.930> show

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
I stated before is a spring I will show

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.350 
I stated before is a spring I will show
you<00:01:11.200> they're<00:01:11.500> really<00:01:12.490> really<00:01:13.030> simple

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
you they're really really simple

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.510 
you they're really really simple
technology<00:01:13.960> that<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.320> really<00:01:14.860> literally<00:01:15.340> all

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
technology that is really literally all

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.760 
technology that is really literally all
it<00:01:15.550> is<00:01:15.820> there's<00:01:16.510> just<00:01:16.600> a<00:01:16.810> spring<00:01:17.230> in<00:01:17.350> there<00:01:17.560> and

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
it is there's just a spring in there and

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.810 
it is there's just a spring in there and
it's<00:01:17.950> just<00:01:18.010> a<00:01:18.250> sealed<00:01:18.580> piston<00:01:19.180> unit<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:20.820> it's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
it's just a sealed piston unit so it's

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.040 
it's just a sealed piston unit so it's
it's<00:01:22.180> ultra<00:01:22.870> basic<00:01:23.440> there's<00:01:24.430> no<00:01:25.050> amazing

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
it's ultra basic there's no amazing

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.710 
it's ultra basic there's no amazing
advancements<00:01:26.500> in<00:01:26.800> this<00:01:26.920> technology

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
advancements in this technology

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.510 
advancements in this technology
okay<00:01:28.720> so<00:01:28.780> installation<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.620> mark<00:01:29.830> 4<00:01:30.070> is<00:01:30.160> pretty

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
okay so installation of mark 4 is pretty

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.950 
okay so installation of mark 4 is pretty
easy<00:01:30.910> because<00:01:31.300> it<00:01:31.510> comes<00:01:31.780> with<00:01:31.870> a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
easy because it comes with a

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.900 
easy because it comes with a
recirculation<00:01:32.560> valve<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:33.130> mean<00:01:33.370> most<00:01:33.610> turbo

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
recirculation valve I mean most turbo

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.520 
recirculation valve I mean most turbo
cars<00:01:34.210> come<00:01:34.390> from<00:01:34.540> recirculation<00:01:34.990> valve<00:01:35.170> but

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
cars come from recirculation valve but

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.520 
cars come from recirculation valve but
are<00:01:35.770> one<00:01:35.980> is<00:01:36.160> on<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.120> top<00:01:37.420> nice<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:37.780> simple

easy stuff and you got access virtually
to<00:01:50.290> it<00:01:50.380> now<00:01:50.980> just<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.400> top<00:01:51.730> middle<00:01:52.450> part<00:01:52.900> of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
to it now just in the top middle part of

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.380 
to it now just in the top middle part of
it<00:01:53.200> is<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.770> diverter<00:01:54.310> valve<00:01:54.610> itself<00:01:54.910> there

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
it is the diverter valve itself there

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.780 
it is the diverter valve itself there
you<00:01:55.510> go<00:01:55.660> a<00:01:55.690> little<00:01:55.810> zoom<00:01:56.200> in<00:01:56.350> it's<00:01:56.980> just<00:01:57.070> behind

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
you go a little zoom in it's just behind

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.960 
you go a little zoom in it's just behind
the<00:01:58.360> air<00:01:58.600> mass<00:01:58.870> sensor<00:01:59.350> in<00:01:59.560> this<00:02:00.370> little<00:02:00.700> jump

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
the air mass sensor in this little jump

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.670 
the air mass sensor in this little jump
looks<00:02:01.240> like<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.420> mushroom<00:02:01.750> shape<00:02:02.050> sort<00:02:02.620> of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
looks like a mushroom shape sort of

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.530 
looks like a mushroom shape sort of
thing<00:02:02.860> but<00:02:03.430> this<00:02:03.610> is<00:02:03.730> the<00:02:03.850> recirculation

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
thing but this is the recirculation

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.930 
thing but this is the recirculation
valve<00:02:04.690> this<00:02:05.070> recirculates<00:02:06.070> all<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.430> extra

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
valve this recirculates all the extra
