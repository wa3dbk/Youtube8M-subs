00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
really recommend this to build it on

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.540 
really recommend this to build it on
survival<00:00:28.660> if<00:00:29.290> you<00:00:29.470> already<00:00:29.680> have<00:00:30.070> a<00:00:30.190> lot<00:00:30.370> of

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
survival if you already have a lot of

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.210 
survival if you already have a lot of
chords<00:00:30.910> then<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:31.720> can<00:00:31.930> build<00:00:32.440> it<00:00:32.680> of<00:00:32.950> course

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
chords then you can build it of course

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.270 
chords then you can build it of course
so<00:00:33.850> you<00:00:34.059> will<00:00:34.300> need<00:00:34.629> some<00:00:34.930> quartz<00:00:35.320> slabs<00:00:35.620> some

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
so you will need some quartz slabs some

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.210 
so you will need some quartz slabs some
stone<00:00:36.610> slabs<00:00:36.970> some<00:00:37.510> quartz<00:00:37.930> tears<00:00:38.290> some

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
stone slabs some quartz tears some

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.170 
stone slabs some quartz tears some
quartz<00:00:39.610> blocks<00:00:39.910> some<00:00:40.660> cool<00:00:41.170> blocks<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:42.180> some

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
quartz blocks some cool blocks and some

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.280 
quartz blocks some cool blocks and some
and<00:00:43.420> wheels<00:00:43.900> and<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:45.460> that's<00:00:45.940> it<00:00:46.600> for<00:00:47.019> now

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
and wheels and that's that's it for now

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.689 
and wheels and that's that's it for now
I<00:00:47.470> think<00:00:48.070> where's<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.730> Sun<00:00:51.239> okay<00:00:52.239> okay<00:00:53.699> now

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
next to each other just like this then

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.330 
next to each other just like this then
here<00:01:02.050> put<00:01:02.890> court<00:01:03.309> stairs<00:01:03.670> like<00:01:04.239> this<00:01:04.299> and<00:01:05.340> here

other<00:02:58.580> block<00:02:58.880> like<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.299> don't<00:02:59.360> know<00:02:59.630> stone<00:03:00.290> or

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
other block like I don't know stone or

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.039 
other block like I don't know stone or
something<00:03:01.940> else<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.299> if<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.510> are<00:03:02.630> pinning

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
ladder here in the middle so this will

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.500 
ladder here in the middle so this will
be<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.690> grill<00:04:38.110> of<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.380> car<00:04:39.120> like<00:04:40.120> this<00:04:40.270> and

be the grill of the car like this and

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.930 
be the grill of the car like this and

I think it would look better if the
front<00:04:51.639> lamps<00:04:52.059> would<00:04:52.360> be<00:04:53.099> here<00:04:54.099> actually<00:04:54.400> like
