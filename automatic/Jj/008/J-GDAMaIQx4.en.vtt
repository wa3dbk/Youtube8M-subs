00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.400
 Hello everyone has been requested 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.090
 actresses with puff pastry then 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.830
 here is a very simple one for ours 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.789
 bundles need some 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.900
 spoon of nutella or almost exact that 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:29.000
 a bit of icing sugar was spreadable 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.350
 and obviously a roll of puff pastry 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.239
 first we spread the nutella on 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.559
 all the puff pastry will suffice two o 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.329
 three spoons 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.280
 if you want you can also dissolve the ANP 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.739
 in the Latin blunder at this point 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.729
 helping us with parchment paper 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.999
 let's roll up our pasta 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:52.999
 puff pastry 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.260
 it's very simple you just have to do 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.200
 very carefully because the pasta 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.640
 puff and very very delicate so there 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.640
 he really wants so much delicacy 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.720
 and here at this point with a 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:39.290
 we go to get our own 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:42.020
 packets if you don't have a wheel 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.050
 used a knife but try to give 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.050
 a beautiful cut, clean and sharp 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:55.850
 we put on baking paper and inform 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.619
 in a preheated oven at 175 degrees for 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.900
 about 10 minutes 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.430
 then of course the cooking time 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.430
 it depends on your forlÃ¬ 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.599
 and here they are already beautiful and ready then 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.270
 as you can see they are quite young 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.160
 but inside there are several layers of 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.130
 puff pastry then more kept 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.200
 so as a fairly complete dessert 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.140
 obviously you can also prepare them the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.910
 evening before let them cool a little 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.069
 room temperature and then put on 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.640
 fridge that I assure you are cold too 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.590
 delicious and of course you can 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.920
 add also in icing sugar 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.130
 I advise the fact and I hope nothing 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.540
 this recipe is really simple either 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.540
 was to your liking 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.850
