confusion<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:48.620> never<00:00:49.620> know<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.219> might

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
confusion I never know but if we might

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.510 
confusion I never know but if we might
even<00:00:50.579> kill<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.000> thing

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
critical here that would be nice if it

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.900 
critical here that would be nice if it
was<00:01:01.850> ever<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.120> time<00:01:02.180> this<00:01:02.810> would<00:01:02.960> be<00:01:03.110> it<00:01:03.790> but<00:01:04.790> no

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
was ever a time this would be it but no

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.760 
was ever a time this would be it but no
that's<00:01:05.059> not<00:01:05.239> gonna<00:01:05.390> happen<00:01:05.630> I<00:01:05.990> guess<00:01:09.190> no<00:01:10.190> I<00:01:10.220> um

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
that's not gonna happen I guess no I um

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.930 
that's not gonna happen I guess no I um
what<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.920> heck<00:01:13.010> it's<00:01:13.370> probably<00:01:13.670> not<00:01:13.790> gonna

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
what the heck it's probably not gonna

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.880 
what the heck it's probably not gonna
survive<00:01:14.120> especially<00:01:14.630> since<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.200> scrubs<00:01:15.650> will

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
survive especially since the scrubs will

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.640 
survive especially since the scrubs will
most<00:01:16.250> likely<00:01:16.490> use<00:01:16.790> Ember<00:01:17.180> I'm<00:01:18.080> gonna<00:01:18.229> go<00:01:18.500> ahead
