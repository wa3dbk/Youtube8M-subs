00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
making this video but most importantly i

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.660 
making this video but most importantly i

think<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.239> important<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.680> give

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
think it's more important that we give

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.880 
think it's more important that we give
