00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.649
 hello kids what's going on here bread goes 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.740
 commenting I bring you a fashion with that of 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.270
 36 gold out it's like to not 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.520
 I usually get out too much but here it is 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.890
 what happens a day or two days ago 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 I think I'm going to report a little bit of good 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.660
 I'm going to give a little bit of everything because 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.240
 as I always do the truth is that the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.880
 custom already and good first the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.770
 exams we then process normal 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.210
 we got the shawn thing from bachelor and there's 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.420
 another the endings and they gave me the notes 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.520
 this morning and approved everything so I think 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.560
 record with a 7 with 25 on average so 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.300
 It's not bad, the others were there 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.280
 a bit like that but in the end I approve 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.590
 the teacher who is very low to edit well 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.149
 that everything is fine and now I have the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.649
 selectivity that is the exam for the 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.620
 entrance to the university 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.890
 the access test on 6 7 8 and 9 I think 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.050
 out there in assertiveness is to be 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.870
 studying these days and have classes 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.399
 review and that in the institute but 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.899
 I also do not have classes normally 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.910
 then it compensates a little and also 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.290
 can play a lot even though I still have 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.560
 exams and even put you have to be a 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.740
 little there with seriousness and such 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.450
 and good in arms, I'm going to report 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.510
 a little bit because I've already got some 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.900
 how many more in gold yesterday get the 86 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.970
 in gold the light machine gun and this 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.260
 tomorrow get the 12 in gold the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.780
 shotgun so now I have all the 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.800
 assault rifles all rifles 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.320
 all shotguns the m 60 the law 86 the 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.790
 m 76 and I have only two left to keep 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.890
 the light ones and all the francs so 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.780
 about seven weapons so we 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.370
 we are approaching little by little I want 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.140
 try to get as you know all the 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.270
 I swim and its respective maps 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.100
 pay from June 20 that will be 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.229
 something complicated but good will be tried 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.430
 and the truth is that they are playing 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.260
 pretty good those days that I have 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.140
 pretty lucky to start with the 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.020
 last four days I'm talking three 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.640
 or four more per day in inter chains with 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.650
 has gotten the light will be placed or 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.420
 they take me out many, obviously not 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.850
 must go up because I do not know that he can not 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.550
 see that gentlemen cons though they are 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.570
 very effective porridges of 60 70 and 25 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.740
 weights like that with the with the pick up and with the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.600
 86 and weapons that are not used much but 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.100
 it's also a spontaneous change that 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.410
 I guess you do not want to see so no 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.450
 I will not upload it also went up today as 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.580
 you saw the clip this one of the 130 that 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.560
 I suppose its pretty enough or it seems 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.030
 be the flip to 2 because that's here the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.040
 I really have that bazÃ¡n and accent 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.550
 digital is also knocked down many 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.220
 others 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.350
 other things about the enemies that 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.920
 it's a shame not to have a solo assembly 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.080
 explosives in plan rpg 4 centex all 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.690
 that shit in making a montage we're going to 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.790
 do an uncle that found out there and 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.530
 Well, I hope you can take them out then 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.080
 brief yes that you like it enough I do not know 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.090
 It depends on how it ends as it has 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.160
 edited uncle because I do not know how to edit 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.540
 it's not a beginner we arrived so 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.180
 if it goes well and everything will go up and 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.810
 I hope you see it and that you like it and 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.450
 good also that to arrive a little of the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.310
 the game itself has already reached the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.920
 10,000 casualties with arriving two days ago or 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.810
 so and right now it's 102,000 empty 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.440
 and that is during well and I got to the top 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.440
 2000 of 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.930
 the domain of the marker the domain then 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.540
 all 2000 that's pretty cool the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.720
 true and I wanted to give a little bit also of 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.430
 this weapon of the 76 of what do you do what 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.690
 accessories this sighting of that as 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.000
 you always know a spiral list so 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.400
 it's specialist I'm using muffler 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.290
 with large chargers will have bullets 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.510
 and mainly in land warfare that 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.310
 alien takes a lot of 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.810
 bullets and as you will see now if you know that 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.240
 was left without bullets because I have meat not 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.750
 I have normal advantage carmelo 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.780
 what about the bonus specialist 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.130
 but good is a weapon that then the bad 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.020
 of this weapon is that it goes a little to 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.450
 up as you shoot if you do not have 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.770
 recoil or anything like that that is the only 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.460
 putada but otherwise it is quite 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.920
 well and now I only have a good and 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.710
 also says fashion with native 95 euros 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.810
 in I got it today a few ago a villa or 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.820
 yes so I already have the whole jump ritual 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.250
 in gold I will upload it because we are tomorrow 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.230
 or after I do not know past I do not know a day of 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.000
 these and I also have my mouth with 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.160
 house is that in euro the hat also like that 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.690
 It's a pity that you see a lot of jauja 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.170
 but well so I'll wait a little longer 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.660
 to go up 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.810
 to raise that is the gameplay because no 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.549
 wants to saturate either as ben harfa and 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.130
 the truth is that I've been when haha 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.540
 of these days and when I play I try not to 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.370
 get me moved by a gold formation 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.720
 to not have another game but to go up 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.130
 out there because it's that if it's not a 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.900
 putada have always there are games of 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.470
 swarms that added very easy we have 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.270
 and if we do not go favorite the mono phase 3 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.220
 but good if you liked the video 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.570
 well, to comment that I love them in 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.130
 comments take them to come from 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.450
 really very much and here like it too 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.450
 it helps a lot there are dictators
