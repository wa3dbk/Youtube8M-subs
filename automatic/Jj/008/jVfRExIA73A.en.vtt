pole there so there's a lot going for

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.250 
pole there so there's a lot going for
the<00:00:57.629> scene<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.940> unfortunately<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.660> lighting

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the scene but unfortunately the lighting

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.959 
the scene but unfortunately the lighting
today<00:01:01.440> isn't<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> things<00:01:02.699> that's

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
today isn't one of the things that's

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.210 
today isn't one of the things that's
going<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> scene<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.290> very<00:01:04.619> overcast

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
going for the scene it's very overcast

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.469 
going for the scene it's very overcast
and<00:01:06.049> for<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> structural<00:01:08.060> subject<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.270> this

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and for a structural subject like this

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.440 
and for a structural subject like this
it's<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:09.990> giving<00:01:10.320> us<00:01:10.470> nice<00:01:11.369> strong<00:01:11.850> shadows

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
it's not giving us nice strong shadows

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.530 
it's not giving us nice strong shadows
or<00:01:12.750> cast<00:01:13.049> shadows<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.270> thought<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.509> I

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
or cast shadows so I thought what I

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.280 
or cast shadows so I thought what I
would<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.960> instead<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.439> trying<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:18.180> push<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
would do instead of trying to push the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.499 
would do instead of trying to push the
color<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.950> invent<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> car<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> normally

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
color and invent the car like a normally

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.700 
color and invent the car like a normally
would<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.799> keep<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.670> simple<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.710> stick

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
would just to keep it simple and stick

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.350 
would just to keep it simple and stick
with<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> black-and-white<00:01:26.220> painting<00:01:27.090> today

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.750 
the very end of the painting because
it's<00:02:19.640> really<00:02:20.640> easy<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:21.300> overdo<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.890> dark<00:02:23.520> and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
it's really easy to overdo the dark and

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.440 
it's really easy to overdo the dark and
light<00:02:23.910> accents<00:02:25.490> what<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.520> really<00:02:26.910> try<00:02:27.090> hard<00:02:27.120> to

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
light accents what I really try hard to

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.210 
light accents what I really try hard to
do<00:02:27.569> when<00:02:27.750> I'm<00:02:27.840> painting<00:02:28.050> these<00:02:28.380> value<00:02:28.830> studies

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
do when I'm painting these value studies

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.770 
do when I'm painting these value studies
is<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.540> keep<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.230> values<00:02:31.940> separate<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.690> you

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
is to keep the values separate so you

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.740 
is to keep the values separate so you
know<00:02:33.989> not<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.290> mix<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.280> in-between<00:02:35.910> values<00:02:36.480> on

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
know not to mix the in-between values on

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.340 
know not to mix the in-between values on
the<00:02:37.170> painting<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.209> think<00:02:39.510> what<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.080> does<00:02:40.290> is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
the painting and I think what it does is

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.940 
the painting and I think what it does is
ends<00:02:40.920> up<00:02:41.069> with<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> much<00:02:41.670> stronger<00:02:42.950> painting

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
ends up with a much stronger painting

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.630 
ends up with a much stronger painting
and<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.610> much<00:02:44.790> more<00:02:45.180> simplified<00:02:46.640> value

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
and a much more simplified value

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.360 
and a much more simplified value
structure<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:49.320> stronger<00:02:49.650> statement<00:02:50.040> of

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
structure and a stronger statement of

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.550 
structure and a stronger statement of
what<00:02:50.640> you're<00:02:50.760> looking<00:02:51.030> at<00:02:51.180> what<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.110> also<00:02:52.230> does

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
what you're looking at what it also does

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.060 
what you're looking at what it also does
is<00:02:52.890> unifies<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.880> elements<00:02:54.300> in<00:02:54.420> your<00:02:54.540> painting

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
is unifies the elements in your painting

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.180 
is unifies the elements in your painting
so<00:02:56.070> for<00:02:56.370> instance<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.540> grass<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.680> sunlit

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
so for instance the grass and the sunlit

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.650 
so for instance the grass and the sunlit
side<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.880> shed<00:03:00.150> there

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
side of the shed there

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.740 
side of the shed there
I<00:03:00.890> thought<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.160> grass<00:03:02.400> looked<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> tiny<00:03:03.420> bit

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
I thought the grass looked at a tiny bit

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.610 
I thought the grass looked at a tiny bit
darker<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.290> value<00:03:04.739> but<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:06.420> simplify<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.319> I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
darker and value but to simplify it I

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.740 
darker and value but to simplify it I
made<00:03:08.280> them<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.580> same<00:03:08.790> value<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.540> same

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
made them the same value and the same

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.380 
made them the same value and the same
with<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.530> light<00:03:10.950> color<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.850> dark<00:03:12.030> tree

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
with the light color and the dark tree

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.430 
with the light color and the dark tree
in<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.600> background<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:15.060> dark<00:03:15.930> side<00:03:16.410> of

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
in the background and the dark side of

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.319 
in the background and the dark side of
the<00:03:16.709> shed<00:03:17.010> they<00:03:17.790> were<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.970> little<00:03:18.150> bit

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
the shed they were a little bit

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.600 
the shed they were a little bit
different<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:19.440> because<00:03:19.650> they're<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.250> close

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
different but because they're so close

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.330 
different but because they're so close
and<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.870> wanted<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.170> simplify<00:03:22.500> my<00:03:22.890> value<00:03:23.310> system

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
and I wanted to simplify my value system

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.780 
and I wanted to simplify my value system
I<00:03:23.940> value<00:03:24.360> scheme<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.459> made<00:03:26.459> them<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> same

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
I value scheme I made them the same

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.860 
I value scheme I made them the same
value<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.890> basically<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.670> painting<00:03:30.180> process

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
value so basically the painting process

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.160 
value so basically the painting process
for<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.350> was<00:03:32.310> same<00:03:33.030> as<00:03:33.060> usual<00:03:33.360> just<00:03:33.780> moving

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
for this was same as usual just moving

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.350 
for this was same as usual just moving
from<00:03:34.440> your<00:03:35.010> darks<00:03:35.459> through<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.030> your<00:03:36.180> mid

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
from your darks through to your mid

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.650 
from your darks through to your mid
values<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.079> then<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.560> lights<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.660> saving

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
values and then to the lights and saving

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.030 
values and then to the lights and saving
the<00:03:40.100> black<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.519> white<00:03:41.700> for<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:43.170> dark

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
the black and the white for the the dark

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.860 
the black and the white for the the dark
and<00:03:44.280> light<00:03:44.400> accents<00:03:45.090> right<00:03:45.390> at<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> end<00:03:45.780> of

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
and light accents right at the end of

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.960 
and light accents right at the end of
the<00:03:45.959> painting<00:03:46.380> but<00:03:47.040> what<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.250> was<00:03:47.400> also<00:03:47.700> trying

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
the painting but what I was also trying

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.860 
the painting but what I was also trying
to<00:03:48.090> do<00:03:48.269> was<00:03:49.140> group<00:03:49.680> my<00:03:49.890> values<00:03:50.340> together<00:03:50.880> so

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
to do was group my values together so

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.349 
to do was group my values together so
that<00:03:52.410> would<00:03:52.560> be<00:03:52.739> saying<00:03:53.070> okay<00:03:53.519> if<00:03:53.670> I'm<00:03:53.850> using<00:03:54.090> a

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
that would be saying okay if I'm using a

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.500 
that would be saying okay if I'm using a
mid<00:03:54.600> value<00:03:54.810> here<00:03:55.590> like<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:57.000> shadows

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
mid value here like in the shadows

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.060 
mid value here like in the shadows
shadow<00:03:58.410> side<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.010> shed<00:03:59.900> where<00:04:00.900> else<00:04:01.260> close

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
shadow side of the shed where else close

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.569 
shadow side of the shed where else close
to<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.459> can<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.820> use<00:04:03.120> that<00:04:03.150> same<00:04:03.660> value<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:05.280> in

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
to that can I use that same value and in

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.569 
to that can I use that same value and in
that<00:04:05.760> instance<00:04:06.239> it's<00:04:06.540> in<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.100> shadow<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
that instance it's in the shadow of the

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.880 
that instance it's in the shadow of the
wall<00:04:08.880> in<00:04:09.239> front<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.230> shed<00:04:10.440> there<00:04:10.680> on<00:04:10.799> the

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
wall in front of the shed there on the

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.300 
wall in front of the shed there on the
right<00:04:11.040> hand<00:04:11.280> side<00:04:11.930> so<00:04:12.930> as<00:04:13.079> I<00:04:13.200> said<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:13.650> think

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
right hand side so as I said I think

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.360 
right hand side so as I said I think
that<00:04:14.489> helps<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:15.090> unify<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.690> painting<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.440> it

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
that helps to unify the painting and it

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.370 
that helps to unify the painting and it
also<00:04:17.549> makes<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.209> painting<00:04:18.600> process<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.200> lot

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
also makes the painting process a lot

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.880 
also makes the painting process a lot
faster<00:04:20.090> because<00:04:21.090> you're<00:04:21.269> using<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.890> same

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
faster because you're using the same

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.219 
faster because you're using the same
value<00:04:23.760> that<00:04:24.000> you've<00:04:24.180> got<00:04:24.390> on<00:04:24.510> your<00:04:24.539> brush<00:04:24.930> and

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
value that you've got on your brush and

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.240 
value that you've got on your brush and
all<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:25.979> areas<00:04:26.340> that<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.640> can<00:04:26.849> and

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
all the areas that you can and

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.450 
all the areas that you can and
moving<00:04:27.640> on<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.000> next<00:04:28.150> value<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:29.130> think<00:04:30.130> the

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
moving on to the next value I think the

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.460 
moving on to the next value I think the
most<00:04:30.640> fun<00:04:30.790> part<00:04:31.000> of<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.720> whole<00:04:31.750> painting<00:04:32.290> for

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
most fun part of the whole painting for

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.640 
most fun part of the whole painting for
me<00:04:32.620> was<00:04:33.210> right<00:04:34.210> at<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:34.480> end<00:04:34.690> or<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.140> had<00:04:35.530> even

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
me was right at the end or I had even

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.150 
me was right at the end or I had even
signed<00:04:36.520> it<00:04:36.730> and<00:04:36.940> finished<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.740> but<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.800> just

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
signed it and finished it but I just

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.100 
signed it and finished it but I just
felt<00:04:39.640> like<00:04:39.700> it<00:04:39.910> needed<00:04:40.120> something<00:04:40.420> else<00:04:40.690> so<00:04:41.080> I

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
felt like it needed something else so I

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.720 
felt like it needed something else so I
just<00:04:41.380> threw<00:04:41.650> those<00:04:41.800> chickens<00:04:42.250> in<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.490> front

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
just threw those chickens in the front

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.550 
just threw those chickens in the front
here<00:04:42.910> there<00:04:43.450> weren't<00:04:43.630> any<00:04:43.840> actual<00:04:44.140> chickens

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
here there weren't any actual chickens

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.190 
here there weren't any actual chickens
here<00:04:44.830> but<00:04:45.420> through<00:04:46.420> the<00:04:46.540> men<00:04:46.690> with<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.870> couple

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
here but through the men with a couple

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.450 
here but through the men with a couple
of<00:04:47.230> little<00:04:47.410> brush<00:04:47.710> strokes<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.160> they<00:04:48.250> seemed

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
of little brush strokes and they seemed

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.750 
of little brush strokes and they seemed
to<00:04:48.550> work<00:04:48.730> really<00:04:48.790> well<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:50.340> yeah<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.520> just

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
to work really well and yeah it just

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.700 
to work really well and yeah it just
finished<00:04:52.210> off<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.510> painting<00:04:52.900> so<00:04:53.290> it's<00:04:53.500> quite

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
finished off the painting so it's quite

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.360 
finished off the painting so it's quite
a<00:04:53.740> bit<00:04:53.920> with<00:04:54.040> that

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
a bit with that

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.600 
a bit with that
so<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.570> idea<00:04:55.900> now<00:04:56.140> would<00:04:56.440> be<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.980> return<00:04:57.220> to

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
so the idea now would be to return to

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.940 
so the idea now would be to return to
the<00:04:57.760> scene<00:04:58.060> maybe<00:04:58.480> tomorrow<00:04:58.900> night<00:04:58.960> if<00:04:59.380> the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
the scene maybe tomorrow night if the

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.540 
the scene maybe tomorrow night if the
lighting<00:05:00.340> is<00:05:00.580> better<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:02.100> now<00:05:03.100> that<00:05:03.280> I've<00:05:03.370> got

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
lighting is better and now that I've got

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.130 
lighting is better and now that I've got
a<00:05:03.580> feeling<00:05:04.090> good<00:05:04.180> understanding<00:05:04.750> of<00:05:04.810> what<00:05:05.020> I'd

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
a feeling good understanding of what I'd

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.110 
a feeling good understanding of what I'd
like<00:05:05.290> to<00:05:05.350> see<00:05:05.710> happen<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.310> this<00:05:06.700> scene

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
like to see happen and this scene

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.250 
like to see happen and this scene
value-wise<00:05:08.110> I<00:05:08.740> can<00:05:09.370> then<00:05:09.610> say<00:05:10.300> okay<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:11.050> know

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
value-wise I can then say okay I know

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.409 
value-wise I can then say okay I know
what's<00:05:11.650> happening<00:05:11.980> there<00:05:12.160> now<00:05:12.640> I<00:05:12.669> can<00:05:12.940> move<00:05:13.150> on

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
what's happening there now I can move on

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.810 
what's happening there now I can move on
and<00:05:13.570> pay<00:05:13.900> more<00:05:14.560> attention<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.310> color<00:05:15.580> and

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
and pay more attention to the color and

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.430 
and pay more attention to the color and
look<00:05:16.540> at<00:05:16.660> this<00:05:16.810> afresh<00:05:17.380> in<00:05:17.880> terms<00:05:18.880> of<00:05:19.150> color<00:05:19.450> so

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
look at this afresh in terms of color so

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.960 
look at this afresh in terms of color so
it'll<00:05:20.560> be<00:05:20.680> interesting<00:05:20.919> to<00:05:21.190> see<00:05:21.430> what<00:05:21.640> happens

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
it'll be interesting to see what happens

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.360 
it'll be interesting to see what happens
in<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.390> next<00:05:22.510> painting<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:23.260> see<00:05:24.010> if<00:05:24.130> this

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
in the next painting and see if this

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.320 
in the next painting and see if this
value<00:05:24.700> study<00:05:25.150> has<00:05:25.450> really<00:05:25.870> helped<00:05:26.200> to<00:05:26.380> clarify

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
value study has really helped to clarify

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.140 
value study has really helped to clarify
the<00:05:28.330> colors<00:05:28.690> in<00:05:28.870> the<00:05:28.990> painting<00:05:29.350> I<00:05:29.820> do<00:05:30.820> feel

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
the colors in the painting I do feel

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.240 
the colors in the painting I do feel
like<00:05:31.300> I've<00:05:31.540> learnt<00:05:31.780> a<00:05:31.900> lot<00:05:32.080> more<00:05:32.470> by<00:05:33.220> just

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
like I've learnt a lot more by just

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.210 
like I've learnt a lot more by just
doing<00:05:33.729> this<00:05:34.090> value<00:05:34.510> study<00:05:34.840> than<00:05:35.710> if<00:05:35.890> I<00:05:36.070> had

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
doing this value study than if I had

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.370 
doing this value study than if I had
been<00:05:36.280> a<00:05:36.850> little<00:05:37.150> bit<00:05:37.360> more<00:05:37.390> confused<00:05:38.110> by

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
been a little bit more confused by

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.290 
been a little bit more confused by
throwing<00:05:38.800> color<00:05:39.100> into<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.550> equation<00:05:39.940> as<00:05:40.090> well

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
throwing color into the equation as well

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
throwing color into the equation as well
so<00:05:40.810> I<00:05:40.840> really<00:05:41.110> recommend<00:05:41.590> you<00:05:41.710> doing<00:05:42.100> this<00:05:42.370> in
