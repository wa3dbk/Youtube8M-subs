properties<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:47.240> explanation<00:01:47.869> is<00:01:47.990> beyond<00:01:48.350> me

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
properties the explanation is beyond me

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.309 
properties the explanation is beyond me
but<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.459> do<00:01:49.579> know<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.299> hydrogen<00:01:50.539> turns<00:01:51.110> into

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
but I do know that hydrogen turns into

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.499 
but I do know that hydrogen turns into
liquid<00:01:51.740> metal<00:01:52.039> with<00:01:52.700> enough<00:01:53.119> pressure

something<00:01:54.140> else<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.500> I<00:01:54.530> can't<00:01:54.829> quite

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
something else that I can't quite

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.270 
something else that I can't quite
explain<00:01:55.189> is<00:01:55.880> spin<00:01:56.450> ice<00:01:56.899> which<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.560> ice<00:01:57.829> that

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
explain is spin ice which is ice that

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.600 
explain is spin ice which is ice that
can<00:01:58.520> act<00:01:58.819> like<00:01:59.360> a<00:01:59.600> magnet<00:02:00.189> well<00:02:01.189> that's<00:02:01.429> it<00:02:01.520> for

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
can act like a magnet well that's it for
