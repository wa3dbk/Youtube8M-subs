hi and today I'd like to talk to you
about<00:00:03.460> probably<00:00:04.270> my<00:00:04.420> favorite<00:00:05.020> lens<00:00:05.200> it's<00:00:05.860> a

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:05.980 
about probably my favorite lens it's a

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.900 
about probably my favorite lens it's a
Tamron<00:00:06.520> 70<00:00:07.180> to<00:00:07.300> 200<00:00:07.620> 2.8<00:00:08.620> this<00:00:09.430> is<00:00:09.610> a<00:00:09.640> great

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
Tamron 70 to 200 2.8 this is a great

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.770 
Tamron 70 to 200 2.8 this is a great
piece<00:00:10.240> of<00:00:10.269> glass<00:00:10.630> it's<00:00:11.470> fairly<00:00:11.860> compact<00:00:12.780> its

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
piece of glass it's fairly compact its

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.210 
piece of glass it's fairly compact its
internal<00:00:14.380> zoom<00:00:14.590> in<00:00:14.830> focus<00:00:15.219> so<00:00:15.880> I<00:00:16.269> assume<00:00:16.749> I

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
internal zoom in focus so I assume I

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.239 
internal zoom in focus so I assume I
focus<00:00:18.329> nothing<00:00:19.329> moves<00:00:19.599> forward<00:00:20.249> autofocus

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:21.249 
focus nothing moves forward autofocus

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.729 
focus nothing moves forward autofocus
engages<00:00:21.789> is<00:00:21.939> an<00:00:22.089> interesting<00:00:22.929> way<00:00:23.109> it

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:23.739 
engages is an interesting way it

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.429 
engages is an interesting way it
actually<00:00:24.249> uses<00:00:24.999> the<00:00:25.269> focus<00:00:25.659> collar<00:00:25.929> to<00:00:26.169> slide

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
actually uses the focus collar to slide

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.919 
actually uses the focus collar to slide
back<00:00:26.739> so<00:00:27.159> if<00:00:27.249> you<00:00:27.369> see<00:00:27.579> the<00:00:27.729> blue<00:00:27.880> exposed<00:00:28.569> here

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:28.929 
back so if you see the blue exposed here

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.349 
back so if you see the blue exposed here
that<00:00:29.619> means<00:00:29.800> that<00:00:30.009> we're<00:00:30.220> actually<00:00:30.489> focusing

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
that means that we're actually focusing

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.710 
that means that we're actually focusing
it<00:00:31.599> is<00:00:31.779> a<00:00:31.809> lens<00:00:32.140> made<00:00:32.640> mostly<00:00:33.640> of<00:00:33.760> plastic<00:00:34.510> but

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
this thing is great I have any focus

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.379 
this thing is great I have any focus

works<00:01:19.840> great<00:01:20.200> with<00:01:20.319> the<00:01:20.409> follow<00:01:20.619> focus<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
works great with the follow focus the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.819 
works great with the follow focus the
zoom<00:01:22.299> direction<00:01:22.810> is<00:01:22.899> probably<00:01:23.259> backwards

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
zoom direction is probably backwards

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.559 
zoom direction is probably backwards
from<00:01:24.009> some<00:01:24.219> lenses<00:01:24.670> but<00:01:24.909> to<00:01:25.119> me<00:01:25.270> that's<00:01:25.450> just

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
from some lenses but to me that's just

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.169 
from some lenses but to me that's just
absolutely<00:01:26.380> positively<00:01:27.039> a<00:01:27.219> non-issue<00:01:27.729> I

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
absolutely positively a non-issue I

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.809 
absolutely positively a non-issue I
think<00:01:29.049> the<00:01:29.139> real<00:01:29.289> sweet<00:01:29.679> spot<00:01:30.009> here<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
think the real sweet spot here is the

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.449 
think the real sweet spot here is the
price<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.420> Suns<00:01:31.719> it's<00:01:32.350> about<00:01:32.770> one<00:01:33.189> third

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:33.459 
price of the Suns it's about one third

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.069 
price of the Suns it's about one third
of<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.639> price<00:01:33.819> of<00:01:34.090> going<00:01:34.329> out<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:34.659> buying<00:01:34.810> the

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
of the price of going out and buying the

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.289 
of the price of going out and buying the
Canon<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:36.039> that<00:01:36.219> lets<00:01:36.429> you<00:01:36.549> save<00:01:36.819> some<00:01:37.090> money

on<00:01:59.079> a<00:01:59.109> tripod<00:01:59.619> or<00:01:59.920> Steadicam<00:02:00.639> or<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.909> chip<00:02:01.209> or

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
on a tripod or Steadicam or a chip or

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.139 
on a tripod or Steadicam or a chip or
something<00:02:01.679> that<00:02:02.679> gave<00:02:02.920> me<00:02:03.130> adequate<00:02:03.639> support

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
something that gave me adequate support

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.529 
something that gave me adequate support
because<00:02:04.539> it's<00:02:04.719> that<00:02:05.380> long<00:02:05.619> a<00:02:05.649> focal<00:02:06.189> length

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
because it's that long a focal length

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.270 
because it's that long a focal length
the<00:02:07.539> lens<00:02:07.779> is<00:02:07.959> just<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.380> whole<00:02:08.590> setup<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.070> just

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
the lens is just the whole setup is just

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.090 
the lens is just the whole setup is just
so<00:02:09.490> incredibly<00:02:10.090> sensitive<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:11.020> shake<00:02:11.860> and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
so incredibly sensitive to shake and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.270 
so incredibly sensitive to shake and
vibration

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
vibration

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.480 
vibration
so<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.690> need<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.960> think<00:02:15.170> about<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:16.040> know<00:02:16.160> what

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
so you need to think about you know what

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.100 
so you need to think about you know what
you're<00:02:16.640> doing<00:02:16.880> with<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.150> lens<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.570> determine

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
you're doing with this lens to determine

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.810 
you're doing with this lens to determine
whether<00:02:18.320> paying<00:02:18.680> almost<00:02:18.920> three<00:02:19.340> times<00:02:19.580> the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
whether paying almost three times the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.760 
whether paying almost three times the
price<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.450> worth<00:02:21.050> having<00:02:21.350> image

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
price is worth having image

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.410 
price is worth having image
stabilization<00:02:22.250> or<00:02:22.760> not<00:02:22.940> but<00:02:23.240> if<00:02:23.300> you're

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
stabilization or not but if you're

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.390 
stabilization or not but if you're
trying<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.780> shoot<00:02:23.930> handheld<00:02:24.320> long<00:02:24.860> ones<00:02:25.190> like

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
trying to shoot handheld long ones like

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.910 
trying to shoot handheld long ones like
this<00:02:25.610> then<00:02:25.880> image<00:02:26.780> stabilization<00:02:27.260> may<00:02:27.860> be

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
this then image stabilization may be

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.740 
this then image stabilization may be
critical<00:02:28.430> for<00:02:28.670> your<00:02:28.730> work<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.270> may<00:02:29.450> really

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
critical for your work you may really

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.590 
critical for your work you may really
need<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.320> paying<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.310> price<00:02:31.520> may<00:02:31.790> be<00:02:31.820> okay

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
need it and paying the price may be okay

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.500 
need it and paying the price may be okay
they<00:02:33.020> also<00:02:33.170> include<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.860> really<00:02:34.160> nice<00:02:34.510> tulip

I<00:02:37.850> can<00:02:38.060> do<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:38.330> correctly<00:02:39.190> there<00:02:40.190> we<00:02:40.280> go

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
I can do this correctly there we go

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.680 
I can do this correctly there we go
it<00:02:41.570> works<00:02:41.780> great<00:02:42.170> looks<00:02:42.500> cool<00:02:42.860> lightweight

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
it works great looks cool lightweight

this lens also works great with a 1.4 2
X<00:02:48.440> extender<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.280> basically<00:02:50.090> certainly<00:02:50.989> when

X extender I basically certainly when
shooting<00:02:51.380> video<00:02:51.709> cannot<00:02:52.670> tell<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.150> the

extender is in use and for shooting
stills<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.450> think<00:02:56.810> you'd<00:02:56.989> really<00:02:57.200> be

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
stills I think you'd really be

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.110 
stills I think you'd really be
hard-pressed<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.220> find<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.700> difference

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
hard-pressed to find the difference

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.180 
hard-pressed to find the difference
maybe<00:02:59.810> somewhere<00:03:00.350> along<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.739> line<00:03:00.920> if<00:03:01.100> you

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
maybe somewhere along the line if you

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.800 
maybe somewhere along the line if you
really<00:03:01.459> wanted<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.790> do<00:03:01.940> some<00:03:02.150> serious<00:03:02.360> hard

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
really wanted to do some serious hard

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.420 
really wanted to do some serious hard
a/b<00:03:03.110> comparison<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.920> know<00:03:03.980> there's<00:03:04.190> got<00:03:04.310> to

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
a/b comparison you know there's got to

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.520 
a/b comparison you know there's got to
be<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.550> little<00:03:04.910> bit<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.180> softness<00:03:05.720> induced<00:03:06.140> but

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
be a little bit of softness induced but

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.370 
be a little bit of softness induced but
it's<00:03:07.100> not<00:03:07.580> enough<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.150> worry<00:03:08.330> about<00:03:08.450> not

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
it's not enough to worry about not

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.350 
it's not enough to worry about not
unless<00:03:09.650> you're<00:03:09.950> shooting<00:03:10.489> national<00:03:11.000> work<00:03:11.180> as

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
unless you're shooting national work as

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.330 
unless you're shooting national work as
a<00:03:11.390> photographer<00:03:11.709> competing<00:03:12.709> with<00:03:12.830> 20<00:03:13.190> other

a photographer competing with 20 other

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.360 
a photographer competing with 20 other
people<00:03:13.550> for<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.390> same<00:03:14.630> shot<00:03:14.989> ok<00:03:15.680> maybe

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
people for the same shot ok maybe

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.850 
people for the same shot ok maybe
there's<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.760> difference<00:03:17.150> but<00:03:17.930> for<00:03:18.680> normal

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
there's a difference but for normal

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.860 
there's a difference but for normal
purposes<00:03:19.610> I<00:03:19.820> don't<00:03:20.180> think<00:03:20.360> you're<00:03:20.480> gonna<00:03:20.570> see

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
purposes I don't think you're gonna see

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.350 
purposes I don't think you're gonna see
it<00:03:21.019> so<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:21.799> lens<00:03:22.010> it's<00:03:22.220> two<00:03:22.400> thumbs<00:03:22.640> up<00:03:22.850> it's

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
it so this lens it's two thumbs up it's

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.570 
it so this lens it's two thumbs up it's
got<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.840> really<00:03:24.200> great<00:03:24.530> price<00:03:24.860> it's<00:03:25.340> got

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
got a really great price it's got

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.090 
got a really great price it's got
exceptional<00:03:26.239> optical<00:03:26.720> performance<00:03:27.100> doesn't

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
exceptional optical performance doesn't

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.039 
exceptional optical performance doesn't
have<00:03:28.370> image<00:03:28.610> stabilization<00:03:29.120> but<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.810> course

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
have image stabilization but of course

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.650 
have image stabilization but of course
that's<00:03:30.440> why<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.830> is<00:03:30.980> cheaper<00:03:31.489> if<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:32.239> really

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
that's why it is cheaper if you really

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.810 
that's why it is cheaper if you really
need<00:03:32.840> image<00:03:33.080> stabilization<00:03:33.530> go<00:03:34.070> by<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.280> Canon

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
need image stabilization go by the Canon

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.449 
need image stabilization go by the Canon
or<00:03:35.000> maybe<00:03:35.900> another<00:03:36.200> lens<00:03:36.709> out<00:03:36.920> there<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:37.310> has

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
or maybe another lens out there that has

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.640 
or maybe another lens out there that has
it<00:03:37.760> but<00:03:38.209> if<00:03:38.330> you<00:03:38.450> don't<00:03:38.630> care<00:03:38.900> about<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.500> I

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
it but if you don't care about it and I

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.270 
it but if you don't care about it and I
don't<00:03:40.120> this<00:03:41.120> lens<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.600> really<00:03:42.110> an<00:03:42.500> exceptional

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
don't this lens is really an exceptional

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.459 
don't this lens is really an exceptional
value
