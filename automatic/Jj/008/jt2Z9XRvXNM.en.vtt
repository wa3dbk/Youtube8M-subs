 long time I had not done a look

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.750
 to make you look glamorous look 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.780

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.479
 a look dorothy dandridge mario look 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.070
 bros and of course with the famous 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.600
 red lipstick 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.460
 so I let you look at the pictures 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.880
 yes ask me questions under the bar 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.229
 info 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.360
 in any case I let you look 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.619
 play big kisses and I tell you lease 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.070
 so for starters i'll take my 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.290
 team 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.140
 fred farrugia so it's my little on 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.509
 wire and I'm going to be enough my eyebrows 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.850
 so for this look I advise you to 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.490
 trace our sources there up you 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.130
 did you see that's a kind of comma to 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.340
 upside down like the night without 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.170
 exaggerate of course because in the 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.520
 50's it was really fashionable 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.930
 eyebrows 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.120
 that's who she is like that up 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.690
 and who goes up high as a species 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.240
 wave 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.180
 Then you pray to Mongel eyebrows 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.920
 at tiko and I'll brush my eyebrows 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.900
 so that's a step that I 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.090
 advise people who have big 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.350
 eyebrows like me if you do not have any 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.170
 big eyebrows it's not worth the 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.080
 do it because I have a bit of hair 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.660
 rebel so I brush them up so that they 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.660
 have the same direction and whether it's 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.430
 really more natural then as 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.620
 I usually take my anti-dark circles 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.440
 deep ware and I'm going to clean my 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.060
 eyebrows all around the least because 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.349
 I did not brush my eyebrows 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.940
 for six months now 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.230
 by choice and because I do not really 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.750
 had time to do it and that I like 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.349
 well the big ones sure if you do not know so 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.769
 I hide the regrowth with my anti 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.870
 dark circles 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.170
 now i'm going to take my are at 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.549
 prefer my dyed foundation laura sims do not 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.900
 stays out a lot moreover and I 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.400
 will apply that even ended blender 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.200
 everywhere on my face 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.209
 so it's true that sometimes I start 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.549
 by the eyes so here we will say that I 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.900
 start some of the thyme and I attack 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.560
 place thereafter 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.269
 here is well shielded with successful blender 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.370
 it's very very very very important 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:11.109
 then I take my new palette to 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.959
 special jump from smic and I touched 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:17.349
 the color beige we will say that does not erase 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.840
 beige with shoots on brown and I 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.629
 applied on the eyelid 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.400
 as you see I add as you go 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.340
 every time for really 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.519
 bring out the color with my 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.129
 brush bar mineral is a brush 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.540
 applicator let's say one then I 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.180
 take the brown just to 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.010
 side so it's a cold brown I say 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.739
 nothing is not funny too dark but 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.450
 it's under cold enough and I 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.109
 apply them on the immobile eyelid 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.879
 with a brush fades hours like 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.340
 these are an extremely simple look 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.069
 really two colors what then I 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.150
 took my black pencil l'oreal and I 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.639
 drawn a line of eyeliner flush 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.500
 eyelashes really will have 10 he's with 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:06.000
 I take my eyeliner from home 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.730
 Sephora and I'll lengthened 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.710
 liner by doing a little spike then 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.350
 not necessarily a point that goes up towards 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.579
 the top but really rather pretty 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:20.190
 right I would say without pulling too much without 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.690
 exaggerate I took my pencil khroma 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.250
 diagram chart so a pencil 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.700
 belgian is put on the mucous membrane 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.010
 then I took the orange pruners 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.470
 to hide everything that is h 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.080
 bruay under the eyes and I armored them and 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.850
 there I take my anti- dark circles 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.740
 concealer I think from make up for 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.440
 ever and I apply a little bit 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.510
 as usual in highlight under 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.050
 eyes on the edge of the niehs on the forehead 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.090
 the chin etc and I blaine blend blend 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.669
 I mix very important mixture 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.380
 always with the beauty blender sanou 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.360
 very very very simple we do not know 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.860
 all complicated and then I took my 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.390
 little puff and I took my powder 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.460
 translucent from mac 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.140
 it was a transparent white powder 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.690
 and I was applying on all of my 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.730
 face 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:10.140
 after I took my bluff blush slick 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.110
 sahara so it's an orange with some 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.300
 under your chestnut that will do very well 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.700
 do it and I applied it then I took 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.590
 my powder benaiteau not and I have 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.020
 applied a little bit on my 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.030
 brush to fix the concealer is 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.010
 not have to put a lot that's 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.080
 really success story is to have 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.479
 a little light under the eyes like 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.430
 these we attack the lips with a 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.970
 cherished pencil at McDonalds is a 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.700
 red matte pencil and I apply it on my 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.169
 bottom lip because my lip dubai 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.640
 more pink and than the one from above 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.140
 I add and lipstick line klein 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.500
 red velvet which is a lipstick 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.840
 dull red on all of my lips 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.580
 and when he dried the red premiums to 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.509
 yves saint laurent lips 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.939
 I think it's lipstick 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.129
 danger then it's a lipstick 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.550
 shining brought shine on 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.069
 lips 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.379
 and if you put it alone it is not 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:06.270
 pigmented if you add them a red 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.129
 lipstick we play a red pencil 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.889
 he will enhance the lipstick 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:12.889
 like this for a glamorous effect 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.740
 So here you are 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.979
 then I will make the famous grain of 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.599
 beauty is my eyeliner from sephora 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.280
 you put you really want between 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.689
 the nose and the mouth and I like 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.610
 to add on the corner of the eye 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.099

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:44.580
 in the year 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.580
 all have an opinion
