00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
indirect interactive work

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.839 
indirect interactive work
a<00:04:26.620> little<00:04:27.620> bit<00:04:27.740> differently<00:04:28.099> so<00:04:28.340> people<00:04:28.639> call

room two people sitting on one of these

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.770 
room two people sitting on one of these
edges<00:04:40.729> which<00:04:41.150> is<00:04:41.270> made<00:04:41.449> out<00:04:41.479> of<00:04:41.599> recycled

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
edges which is made out of recycled

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.439 
edges which is made out of recycled
plastic<00:04:42.680> which<00:04:43.250> was<00:04:43.520> on<00:04:43.729> you<00:04:44.000> know<00:04:44.090> from<00:04:44.330> the

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
plastic which was on you know from the

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.839 
plastic which was on you know from the
video<00:04:44.689> and<00:04:45.469> now<00:04:45.680> did<00:04:45.889> you<00:04:46.009> guys<00:04:46.189> design<00:04:46.669> the

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
video and now did you guys design the

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.029 
video and now did you guys design the
benches<00:04:47.270> or<00:04:47.419> at<00:04:47.539> least<00:04:47.860> prefabricated<00:04:48.860> or

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
benches or at least prefabricated or

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.879 
benches or at least prefabricated or
design<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.580> benches<00:04:49.969> and<00:04:50.629> actually<00:04:51.560> kind<00:04:51.800> of

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
design the benches and actually kind of

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.119 
design the benches and actually kind of
flat<00:04:52.460> back<00:04:52.699> into<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.090> smaller<00:04:53.560> so<00:04:54.560> each<00:04:54.800> one<00:04:54.830> of

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
flat back into a smaller so each one of

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.670 
flat back into a smaller so each one of
these<00:04:55.340> panels<00:04:55.969> uh-huh<00:04:56.509> is<00:04:56.719> the<00:04:56.780> same<00:04:57.259> so<00:04:57.590> it

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
these panels uh-huh is the same so it

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.709 
these panels uh-huh is the same so it
can<00:04:57.800> go<00:04:57.830> in<00:04:58.039> this<00:04:58.159> fisherman<00:04:58.879> position<00:04:59.330> and

00:04:59.709 --> 00:04:59.719 
can go in this fisherman position and

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.179 
can go in this fisherman position and
you<00:04:59.900> can<00:05:00.050> just<00:05:00.229> sort<00:05:00.409> of<00:05:00.529> bolt<00:05:00.830> them<00:05:01.039> together

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
you can just sort of bolt them together

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.309 
you can just sort of bolt them together
around<00:05:01.669> to<00:05:01.849> infinity<00:05:02.389> kind<00:05:02.750> of<00:05:02.870> like<00:05:03.080> the

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
around to infinity kind of like the

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.200 
around to infinity kind of like the
brand<00:05:03.680> koozies<00:05:04.159> endless<00:05:04.520> column<00:05:05.000> thing

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
brand koozies endless column thing

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.679 
brand koozies endless column thing
exactly<00:05:06.050> okay<00:05:06.620> right<00:05:06.860> here<00:05:07.300> they're<00:05:08.300> kind<00:05:08.599> of

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 
exactly okay right here they're kind of

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:10.959 
exactly okay right here they're kind of
staggered<00:05:09.169> so<00:05:09.349> this<00:05:09.529> one<00:05:09.710> is<00:05:09.830> more<00:05:10.039> gaming

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:10.969 
staggered so this one is more gaming

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:12.610 
staggered so this one is more gaming
this<00:05:11.180> one<00:05:11.360> forward<00:05:11.629> to<00:05:11.689> me<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.139> outside

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
this one forward to me to the outside
