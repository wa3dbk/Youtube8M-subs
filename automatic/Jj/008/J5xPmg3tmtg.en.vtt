the skin to keep snow from sticking out

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.859 
the skin to keep snow from sticking out
when<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.440> temperature<00:00:19.859> changes<00:00:20.570> but<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
when the temperature changes but the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.409 
when the temperature changes but the
most<00:00:21.990> effective<00:00:22.199> way<00:00:22.650> by<00:00:23.009> far<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:24.029> actually

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
most effective way by far is to actually

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.570 
most effective way by far is to actually
melt<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.349> wax<00:00:25.499> into<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> surface<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
melt the wax into the surface of the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.519 
melt the wax into the surface of the
skin<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.509> need<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> couple<00:00:27.990> things<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.380> need

skin you need a couple things you need

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.159 
skin you need a couple things you need
to<00:00:28.560> fix<00:00:29.519> your<00:00:29.669> skins<00:00:30.269> onto<00:00:30.720> your<00:00:30.839> back<00:00:30.960> country

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
to fix your skins onto your back country

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.350 
to fix your skins onto your back country
skis<00:00:31.619> put<00:00:31.919> them<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.220> vise<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.759> then

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
skis put them in the vise and then

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.880 
skis put them in the vise and then
choose<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.810> wax<00:00:33.989> that's<00:00:34.290> appropriate<00:00:34.829> for

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
choose the wax that's appropriate for

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.720 
choose the wax that's appropriate for
the<00:00:35.070> day<00:00:35.310> today<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.000> using<00:00:36.090> Coco<00:00:36.630> yellow<00:00:36.990> s3

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
the day today I'm using Coco yellow s3

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.540 
the day today I'm using Coco yellow s3
you<00:00:38.730> do<00:00:39.030> not<00:00:39.240> want<00:00:39.630> to<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.620> iron<00:00:40.800> too<00:00:41.280> hot

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
you do not want to have the iron too hot

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.180 
you do not want to have the iron too hot
so<00:00:42.180> test<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.690> by<00:00:42.900> melting<00:00:43.320> some<00:00:43.560> of<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.710> wax<00:00:43.890> on

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so test it by melting some of the wax on

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.220 
so test it by melting some of the wax on
here<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.880> doesn't<00:00:44.910> smoke<00:00:45.540> if<00:00:45.960> it's

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
here so that it doesn't smoke if it's

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.020 
here so that it doesn't smoke if it's
too<00:00:46.470> hot<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.890> could<00:00:47.070> burn<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.310> surface<00:00:47.790> of<00:00:47.970> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
too hot it could burn the surface of the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.980 
too hot it could burn the surface of the
skin<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:49.230> first<00:00:49.470> thing<00:00:50.180> apply<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.240> wax<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
skin so first thing apply the wax to the

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:59.660 
skin so first thing apply the wax to the
skin<00:00:53.090> melt<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.260> iron<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.520> also

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
skin melt it on the iron you can also

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.970 
skin melt it on the iron you can also
rub<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.150> in<00:01:00.390> dry<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:00.900> it<00:01:00.990> does<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.350> go<00:01:01.650> in<00:01:01.830> as

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
rub this in dry but it does not go in as

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.039 
rub this in dry but it does not go in as
effectively<00:01:07.100> you'll<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> whitish<00:01:08.759> layer

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
effectively you'll see a whitish layer

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.539 
effectively you'll see a whitish layer
build<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> skin<00:01:10.859> cover<00:01:11.219> all<00:01:11.429> the

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.550 

in<00:01:23.520> low<00:01:23.880> temperature<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.780> enough<00:01:25.109> to<00:01:25.380> melt

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
in low temperature just enough to melt

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.030 
in low temperature just enough to melt
the<00:01:25.740> wax

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.110 

now<00:01:31.580> if<00:01:31.700> you're<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.850> Rondon<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.360> racer<00:01:33.940> you<00:01:34.940> can
