00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.049
 b Tholl the silicone Shea butter 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.360
 it ensures hydration and shine 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.330
 I'm not wearing it today in my hair. 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.840
 most of the time I use it 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.770

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.310
 people have to understand the following 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.189
 his proposal is hydration and shine 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.930
 is not definition of curls but it leaves 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.299
 my hair like that for those who like that 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.030
 more natural looking hair 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.369
 loose is a good indication that cream 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.500
 here I need a dense cream the 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.290
 premium with more consistency with more 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.900
 fixing so I can keep my curls 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.299
 so a more active place I usually 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.269
 use much he is 5 so when I 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.340

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.740
 the more end will give more shot will give 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.540
 with 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.510
 It was cool because I always cut 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.130
 so he accepts well but platform 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.050
 when the time comes that my hair already 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.330
 It's more like it's that one more time 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.780
 resected by the absence of chemistry 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.150
 Then I already use other creams to comb 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.430

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.950

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.770
 average price it today 20-30 and real 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.390
 see it as well as a liter 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.160
 I do not know if it's worth investing too 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.190
 in the other lines of it is shampoo 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.410
 moisturizing mask conditioner I know 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.450
 that the leave-in is worth it and it's a shame 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.540
 that he does not stay 100% with my hair 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.640
