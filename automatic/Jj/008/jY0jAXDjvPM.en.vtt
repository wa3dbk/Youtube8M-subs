00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.270 
looks the reason I only put it on two
nails<00:04:41.510> was<00:04:41.930> because<00:04:42.320> it<00:04:42.500> is<00:04:42.650> textured

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
nails was because it is textured

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.180 
nails was because it is textured
textured<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:46.730> kind<00:04:47.030> of<00:04:48.070> it's<00:04:49.070> not

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
textured and it is kind of it's not
sharp<00:04:49.610> but<00:04:50.830> basically<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:52.100> can<00:04:52.310> kind<00:04:52.790> of<00:04:52.910> pluck

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
sharp but basically it can kind of pluck

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.210 
sharp but basically it can kind of pluck
things<00:04:53.540> or<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.470> know<00:04:54.560> can<00:04:54.800> get<00:04:54.950> caught<00:04:55.190> on

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
everything so if you did want to do it

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.390 
everything so if you did want to do it
like<00:06:15.170> I<00:06:15.350> did<00:06:15.410> it<00:06:15.650> and<00:06:15.740> paint<00:06:15.950> it<00:06:16.070> with<00:06:16.160> another

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
like I did it and paint it with another

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.460 
like I did it and paint it with another
color<00:06:16.640> I<00:06:16.940> literally<00:06:17.630> think<00:06:17.900> you<00:06:18.080> could<00:06:18.260> wear

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
it with any color also I did think

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.510 
it with any color also I did think
because<00:06:21.380> I<00:06:21.410> painted<00:06:21.920> these<00:06:22.040> nails<00:06:22.370> this

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
because I painted these nails this

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.100 
because I painted these nails this
morning<00:06:22.580> I<00:06:22.910> did<00:06:23.060> these<00:06:23.240> ones<00:06:23.450> last<00:06:23.660> night<00:06:23.930> and

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
morning I did these ones last night and

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.270 
morning I did these ones last night and
then<00:06:24.200> I<00:06:24.290> painted<00:06:24.710> these<00:06:24.860> ones<00:06:25.100> this<00:06:25.220> morning

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
then I painted these ones this morning

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.760 
then I painted these ones this morning
and<00:06:25.850> I<00:06:26.150> sort<00:06:26.360> of<00:06:26.450> thought<00:06:26.630> that<00:06:26.690> maybe<00:06:27.140> as<00:06:27.530> your

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
and I sort of thought that maybe as your

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.700 
and I sort of thought that maybe as your
first<00:06:28.070> coat<00:06:28.610> you<00:06:28.910> could<00:06:29.120> put<00:06:29.270> a<00:06:29.330> color<00:06:29.630> so<00:06:30.320> like

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
first coat you could put a color so like

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.320 
first coat you could put a color so like
I<00:06:30.830> could<00:06:31.010> have<00:06:31.100> put<00:06:31.340> black<00:06:31.580> cherry<00:06:31.880> chutney

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
I could have put black cherry chutney

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.850 
I could have put black cherry chutney
first<00:06:32.890> then<00:06:33.890> put<00:06:34.370> the<00:06:34.840> clear<00:06:35.840> nail<00:06:36.350> varnish<00:06:36.830> to

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
first then put the clear nail varnish to

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.640 
first then put the clear nail varnish to
press<00:06:37.280> the<00:06:37.700> get<00:06:37.910> it<00:06:38.060> into<00:06:38.240> so<00:06:39.140> that's<00:06:39.410> always

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650
