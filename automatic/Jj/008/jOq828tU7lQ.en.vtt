vandalism alteration and even guideline

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.789 
vandalism alteration and even guideline
changes<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> end<00:01:18.119> result<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:18.900> making<00:01:19.740> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
changes so the end result was making it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.160 
changes so the end result was making it
increasingly<00:01:20.130> difficult<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:21.270> us<00:01:21.780> local

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
increasingly difficult for us local

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.999 
increasingly difficult for us local
divers<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:23.280> guide<00:01:23.670> teach<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.840> navigate<00:01:25.770> our

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
divers to guide teach and navigate our

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.950 
divers to guide teach and navigate our
own<00:01:26.130> exits<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> cave<00:01:27.829> so<00:01:29.360> what<00:01:30.360> we<00:01:30.509> did<00:01:30.720> was

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
own exits to the cave so what we did was

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.270 
own exits to the cave so what we did was
we<00:01:31.140> developed<00:01:31.560> something<00:01:31.799> called<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
we developed something called a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.429 
we developed something called a
referencing<00:01:32.820> exit<00:01:33.119> marker<00:01:33.570> which<00:01:33.990> has<00:01:34.170> also

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
referencing exit marker which has also

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.249 
referencing exit marker which has also
been<00:01:34.650> called<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.400> smart<00:01:35.939> cookie<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
been called a smart cookie because it

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.520 
been called a smart cookie because it
has<00:01:37.409> an<00:01:37.590> ability<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.400> indicate<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> direction

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
has an ability to indicate a direction

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.149 
has an ability to indicate a direction
unlike<00:01:40.530> any<00:01:40.829> other<00:01:41.130> non<00:01:41.520> directional<00:01:41.880> markers

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
unlike any other non directional markers

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.280 
unlike any other non directional markers
okay<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.880> look<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.329> one<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.630> these<00:01:45.750> markers

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
okay if we look at one of these markers

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.710 
okay if we look at one of these markers
we<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.329> it<00:01:48.329> has<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:50.299> rectangular<00:01:51.299> shape

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
we see that it has a rectangular shape

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.270 
we see that it has a rectangular shape
with<00:01:52.640> cutouts<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.790> are<00:01:54.000> consistent<00:01:54.750> with

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
with cutouts that are consistent with

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.100 
with cutouts that are consistent with
normal<00:01:56.280> line<00:01:56.850> arrows<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:58.020> be

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
normal line arrows so they can be

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.780 
normal line arrows so they can be
married<00:01:58.350> together<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.100> carried<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
married together and carried on a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.459 
married together and carried on a
carrying<00:02:00.299> device<00:02:00.479> which<00:02:00.899> I'm<00:02:01.079> showing<00:02:01.439> you

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
carrying device which I'm showing you

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.950 
carrying device which I'm showing you
here<00:02:01.860> we'll<00:02:02.729> talk<00:02:02.939> about<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.479> moment

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
here we'll talk about in a moment

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.790 
here we'll talk about in a moment
okay<00:02:05.240> okay<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.480> we<00:02:06.720> see<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> close-up<00:02:07.500> view<00:02:07.530> of

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
okay okay so we see a close-up view of

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.430 
okay okay so we see a close-up view of
the<00:02:08.220> RAM<00:02:08.640> itself<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.229> there's

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
the RAM itself and we see that there's

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.760 
the RAM itself and we see that there's
an<00:02:10.560> identifier<00:02:11.190> side<00:02:11.900> both<00:02:12.900> tactile<00:02:13.530> and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
an identifier side both tactile and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.770 
an identifier side both tactile and
visual<00:02:13.800> which<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.730> built<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.360> combination

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
visual which is built on the combination

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.130 
visual which is built on the combination
of<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.710> color<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.700> shape<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.480> sticker<00:02:18.810> as

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
of the color the shape of the sticker as

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.050 
of the color the shape of the sticker as
well<00:02:20.100> as<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.610> embossment<00:02:21.000> or<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.720> tactile

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
well as the embossment or the tactile

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.360 
well as the embossment or the tactile
engraving<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.200> case<00:02:25.500> they<00:02:26.070> can<00:02:26.250> be

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
engraving in this case they can be

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.970 
engraving in this case they can be
numbered<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.690> course<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.530> user's<00:02:28.950> name

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
numbered and of course the user's name

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.550 
numbered and of course the user's name
should<00:02:29.580> be<00:02:29.610> written<00:02:29.760> as<00:02:30.180> well<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:31.140> there's<00:02:31.470> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
should be written as well so there's a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.580 
should be written as well so there's a
positive<00:02:31.800> identification<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.959> edge<00:02:34.140> we

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
positive identification on the edge we

proper attention on the guide line and

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.670 
proper attention on the guide line and
over<00:03:29.490> to<00:03:29.640> assertive<00:03:30.150> okay<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:31.350> aside<00:03:31.620> from

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
over to assertive okay but aside from

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.800 
over to assertive okay but aside from
that<00:03:31.890> it's<00:03:32.220> very<00:03:32.400> similar<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.090> that's

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
that it's very similar and that's

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.300 
that it's very similar and that's
essentially<00:03:34.380> how<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.620> works<00:03:35.900> okay<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.220> when<00:03:38.220> we

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
essentially how it works okay so when we

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.090 
essentially how it works okay so when we

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
look at the navigation kit which is this

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.560 
look at the navigation kit which is this

ties no string nothing to fail and we

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.560 
ties no string nothing to fail and we

so the main features that we're seeing

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.129 
so the main features that we're seeing
here<00:06:24.190> that<00:06:24.430> are<00:06:24.699> unique<00:06:25.060> to<00:06:25.090> this<00:06:25.419> device<00:06:25.810> is

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
here that are unique to this device is

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.159 
here that are unique to this device is
the<00:06:26.830> positive<00:06:27.070> identification<00:06:27.729> and<00:06:28.509> the

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
the positive identification and the

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.350 
the positive identification and the
ability<00:06:29.650> to<00:06:29.800> be<00:06:29.979> used<00:06:30.280> in<00:06:30.610> a<00:06:30.849> much<00:06:31.090> more

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360
