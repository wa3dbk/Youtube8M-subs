is that

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.020 
is that
it<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:20.980> be<00:02:21.130> connected<00:02:21.400> over<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.820> network

it can be connected over a network

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.420 
it can be connected over a network
through<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.050> router<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.680> can<00:02:23.860> connect<00:02:24.160> up<00:02:24.250> to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
through a router you can connect up to

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.660 
through a router you can connect up to
four<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.760> them<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.080> by<00:02:26.080> doing<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:27.490> can

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
four of them and by doing that you can

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.500
