00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
of a sudden a whole bunch of other

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.190 
of a sudden a whole bunch of other
grooves<00:01:27.130> pop<00:01:27.429> up<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.299> way<00:01:28.420> they<00:01:28.569> did<00:01:29.020> that

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
grooves pop up and the way they did that

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.840 
grooves pop up and the way they did that
because<00:01:29.350> uh<00:01:29.619> you<00:01:30.130> know<00:01:30.249> we<00:01:30.429> need<00:01:30.579> some

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
because uh you know we need some

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.139 
because uh you know we need some
flexibility<00:01:31.539> because<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.369> still<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.579> cup

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
flexibility because it is still a cup

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.999 
flexibility because it is still a cup
soul<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:34.689> still<00:01:34.960> you<00:01:35.259> know<00:01:35.380> thicker<00:01:35.770> than

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
soul and still you know thicker than

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.340 
soul and still you know thicker than
your<00:01:36.189> average<00:01:36.310> book<00:01:36.759> we<00:01:37.719> wanted<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.020> kind<00:01:38.259> of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
your average book we wanted to kind of

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.039 
your average book we wanted to kind of
counteract<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:39.039> bulky<00:01:39.819> feeling<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:40.810> kind

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
counteract that bulky feeling and kind

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.749 
counteract that bulky feeling and kind
of<00:01:41.079> give<00:01:41.259> you<00:01:41.380> as<00:01:41.499> much<00:01:41.679> flexibility<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.609> much

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
of give you as much flexibility and much

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.330 
of give you as much flexibility and much
mobility<00:01:43.119> as<00:01:43.389> possible<00:01:44.049> I<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:47.409> extremely

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
mobility as possible I have extremely

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.980 
mobility as possible I have extremely
sweaty<00:01:48.639> feet<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:49.179> I<00:01:49.240> would<00:01:49.359> always<00:01:49.509> sweat

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
sweaty feet and I would always sweat

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.719 
sweaty feet and I would always sweat
through<00:01:50.139> all<00:01:50.289> my<00:01:50.469> shoes<00:01:50.679> so<00:01:50.950> we<00:01:51.340> put<00:01:51.549> a<00:01:51.579> little

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
through all my shoes so we put a little

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.309 
through all my shoes so we put a little
extra<00:01:52.030> ventilation<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.840> kind<00:01:53.049> of<00:01:53.139> help

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
extra ventilation to kind of help

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.429 
extra ventilation to kind of help
counteract<00:01:54.219> that<00:01:54.459> I<00:01:55.049> hear<00:01:56.049> on<00:01:56.109> the<00:01:56.200> tongue

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
counteract that I hear on the tongue

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.100 
counteract that I hear on the tongue
here

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.740 

I<00:02:02.620> like<00:02:03.620> to<00:02:03.650> think<00:02:04.190> of<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.430> shoes<00:02:04.700> these<00:02:05.690> are

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
I like to think of the shoes these are
