and it just looks like a two or car okay
I<00:02:19.040> mean<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.580> can<00:02:19.760> probably<00:02:19.940> tell<00:02:20.090> what<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.510> is

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
I mean you can probably tell what it is

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.350 
I mean you can probably tell what it is
when<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.900> find<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.790> especially<00:02:22.790> by<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.150> back

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
when you find it especially by the back

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.580 
when you find it especially by the back
end<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.790> if<00:02:26.120> you're<00:02:26.840> starting<00:02:27.170> out<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.380> game

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
end so if you're starting out the game

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.050 
end so if you're starting out the game
and<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.250> know<00:02:28.340> you're<00:02:28.460> doing<00:02:28.580> things<00:02:28.940> you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
for you just personally because it's a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.300
