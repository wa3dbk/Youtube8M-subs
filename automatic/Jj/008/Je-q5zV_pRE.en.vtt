00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.680
 with wolfcraft step by step to a perfect result 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.839
 Deprived wooden terraces 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.059
 a dreary terrace is a poet in the summer months 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.459
 mood loaded 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.659
 Craftsmen for a redesign are often very expensive 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.310
 So why not do it yourself? 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.489
 even if they have never done it before 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.639
 they will succeed with the new terracotta assortment of 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:33.469
 the hood of the screws extends the life of the terrace and ensures 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.469
 for a uniform, beautiful look without disturbing radiation 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.360
 the special edition fur for the substructure of the terrace will be 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.600
 evenly placed between the foundation and the chancellor's budget they create 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.760
 prevent a distance between the mills and substructure reason 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.760
 Waterlogging water can drain away 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.990
 the throw power deck connectors allow for concealed bolting 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.870
 The terraces here become the targets with the help of the connectors on the back 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.600
 bolted 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.110
 The templates ensure precise positioning of the connectors 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.090
 then bolted easily 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
 with handhelds on a harbinger makes sense 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.170
 Now the practical mounting clamp and the spacers are used 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.659
 after creating the respective dealer to the previous, the more accurate 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.250
 Align to the spacers are simply between the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.770
 Heater put 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.970
 Diezinger are best suited to align and just do not pull off 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.360
 the 11th guess 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.770
 so you get a clean and even awarded after chosen 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.280
 aligning the l with one hand Zwingel becomes the prominent of the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.050
 Connector connected to the substructure 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.230
 with the special connection and for the last Briton becomes the last floorboard of the 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.940
 Terrace front side I screwed to the substructure so 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.770
 The result is a clean finish whether the light is on the terrace 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.630
