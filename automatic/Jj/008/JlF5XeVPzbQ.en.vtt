we<00:00:01.350> started<00:00:01.680> last<00:00:01.890> July<00:00:02.220> July<00:00:03.030> 17th<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:04.230> 2011

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
we started last July July 17th of 2011

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.750 
we started last July July 17th of 2011
so<00:00:05.250> just<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.029> little<00:00:06.240> under<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> year<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:07.760> the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
so just a little under a year and the

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.850 
so just a little under a year and the
adjustments<00:00:09.300> work<00:00:09.420> really<00:00:10.080> well<00:00:10.320> we've<00:00:10.710> had

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
adjustments work really well we've had

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.060 
adjustments work really well we've had
very<00:00:11.849> few<00:00:12.059> issues<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.440> cows<00:00:13.650> just

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
very few issues and the cows just

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.379 
very few issues and the cows just
adapted<00:00:14.639> very<00:00:14.790> quickly

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
adapted very quickly

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.849 
adapted very quickly
I<00:00:15.420> believe<00:00:15.900> we're<00:00:16.109> around<00:00:16.379> 110<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:17.550> 12<00:00:17.789> cows<00:00:18.060> I

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
I believe we're around 110 or 12 cows I

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.320 
I believe we're around 110 or 12 cows I
think<00:00:19.859> that's<00:00:20.130> about<00:00:20.279> where<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.730> started<00:00:21.180> at

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
think that's about where we started at

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.210 
think that's about where we started at
and<00:00:21.600> we've<00:00:21.990> been<00:00:22.260> up<00:00:22.410> at<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.769> hundred<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
and we've been up at the hundred and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.400 
and we've been up at the hundred and
twenty<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.789> now<00:00:24.480> our<00:00:24.630> production<00:00:25.080> has<00:00:25.199> risen

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
twenty and now our production has risen

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.620 
twenty and now our production has risen
to<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> point<00:00:25.890> where<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:27.180> should<00:00:27.390> actually

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
to the point where we should actually

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.330 
to the point where we should actually
try<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.199> down<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.590> about<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> hundred<00:00:28.980> cows

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
try to get down to about a hundred cows

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.889 
try to get down to about a hundred cows
we're<00:00:30.330> currently<00:00:30.619> about<00:00:31.619> 38<00:00:32.250> litres<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.899> in

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
we're currently about 38 litres and in

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.260 
we're currently about 38 litres and in
our<00:00:34.110> previous<00:00:34.559> barn<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.370> were<00:00:35.489> around<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.940> 30

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
our previous barn we were around that 30

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.240 
our previous barn we were around that 30
to<00:00:36.980> 33<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> we've<00:00:39.690> seen<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> very<00:00:40.500> good<00:00:40.770> response

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
to 33 so we've seen a very good response

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.119 
to 33 so we've seen a very good response
coming<00:00:41.969> into<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.300> barn<00:00:42.649> so<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.770> were<00:00:43.920> two

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
coming into this barn so we were two

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.150 
coming into this barn so we were two
times<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.579> day<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:45.390> our<00:00:45.600> other<00:00:45.780> burn<00:00:46.100> now<00:00:47.100> we

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
times a day in our other burn now we

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.650 
times a day in our other burn now we
average<00:00:47.730> 2.8<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> think<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.090> helps<00:00:51.300> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
average 2.8 so I think that that helps a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.380 
average 2.8 so I think that that helps a
great<00:00:52.079> deal<00:00:52.340> some<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.460> our<00:00:53.579> highest<00:00:53.730> producers

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
great deal some of our highest producers

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.630 
great deal some of our highest producers
they<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.989> go<00:00:55.110> through<00:00:55.320> every<00:00:55.890> four<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.340> five

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
they can go through every four and five

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.790 
they can go through every four and five
hours<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.449> they<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.440> keeps

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
hours and and they do and it just keeps

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.250 
hours and and they do and it just keeps
them<00:00:58.980> empty<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.489> I<00:01:00.449> think<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:00.989> really

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
them empty and I think it's really

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.390 
them empty and I think it's really
helped<00:01:01.530> them<00:01:02.359> really<00:01:03.359> really<00:01:03.539> hit<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
helped them really really hit the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.219 
helped them really really hit the
expectations<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:07.049> chose

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
expectations we have for them we chose

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.300 
expectations we have for them we chose
