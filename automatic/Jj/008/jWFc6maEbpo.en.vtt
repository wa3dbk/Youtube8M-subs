we're<00:00:02.790> with<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.030> alpha<00:00:03.240> braking<00:00:03.540> systems<00:00:03.870> and

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
we're with the alpha braking systems and

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.320 
we're with the alpha braking systems and
today<00:00:04.350> we're<00:00:04.560> going<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.740> go<00:00:05.520> over<00:00:05.549> how<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.000> do<00:00:06.299> a

our standard two line setup we do
eliminate<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.049> left<00:01:22.259> line<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.680> also

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
eliminate that the left line is also

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.260

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
off the reservoir and all the fluid is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.310 
off the reservoir and all the fluid is
drained<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.270> now<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.689> ready<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> install

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
drained and now we are ready to install

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.260 
drained and now we are ready to install
the<00:01:40.470> new<00:01:40.650> galfer<00:01:41.009> brake<00:01:41.189> line<00:01:41.369> system<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.119> make

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the new galfer brake line system to make

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.060 
the new galfer brake line system to make
this<00:01:42.420> easier<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> install<00:01:43.409> process<00:01:43.439> we're

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
this easier on the install process we're

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.350 
this easier on the install process we're
going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> take<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> master<00:01:44.820> cylinder<00:01:45.060> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
going to take the master cylinder and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.760 
going to take the master cylinder and
we're<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> we're<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> tilt<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.649> up

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
we're going to we're going to tilt it up

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.800 
we're going to we're going to tilt it up
so<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.369> easier<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.850> access<00:01:48.000> you're

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so it's just easier to access you're

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420

two line kit to from the master cylinder

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.430 
two line kit to from the master cylinder
downs<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.260> each<00:02:22.380> caliper<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:28.350> like

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
downs to each caliper and so just like

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.580 
downs to each caliper and so just like
the<00:02:28.530> master<00:02:28.950> cylinder<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.490> want<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:29.910> a

crush washer between the the bolt and
the<00:02:34.020> banjo<00:02:34.410> fitting<00:02:34.740> so<00:02:35.070> you've<00:02:35.670> got<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.880> crush

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the banjo fitting so you've got a crush

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.550 
the banjo fitting so you've got a crush
washer<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.450> both<00:02:36.630> sides<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.080> fitting<00:02:37.380> and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
washer on both sides of the fitting and

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.530 
washer on both sides of the fitting and
then<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.400> can<00:02:38.490> thread<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.880> directly<00:02:39.180> into<00:02:39.450> the
