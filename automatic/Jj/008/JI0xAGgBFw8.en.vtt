00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.939
 I agree I do not need your tricks 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.430
 demon hello and welcome again today 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.759
 I present a new trick that I have 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.160
 discovered here in transit mode for 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.700
 that a zombie stays still in the 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.290
 bus completely quiet and good what 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.899
 first thing we need is to do the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.969
 trick of the turbine we will need 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.160
 create it once we created it the 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.610
 we take over we plant it the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.610
 we collect 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.260
 and good this trick will have it up 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.670
 if someone does not know how to do it and nothing 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.690
 what we have to do is drop the 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.690
 turbine as you see letting it destroy it 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.520
 with the trick of this one in mortal 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.650
 so that it is not destroyed when passing the 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.199
 bus that is what interests us that 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.290
 be in the middle for the bus to 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.330
 run over 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.580
 and good what we need now will be 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.860
 put the zombie inside of just the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.860
 coach to do this trick 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.880
 once we have the zombie inside 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.520
 We'll have to wait for the bus 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.290
 they leave us we go away and we will have 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.330
 to leave the zombie more or less where 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.480
 is the turbine to start 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.790
 attack 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.340
 It's worth as you see the beginning to attack there 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.220
 in the air and how are you seeing if 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.170
 correctly the quiet tourist does not 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.600
 attacks does not do anything to us and we can 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.330
 climb even on him as you are 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.850
 seeing the truth is that it is a trick 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.440
 pretty funny that I found if 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.270
 you want this you can use it for 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.490
 let the last zombie live whatever it is or 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.800
 to laugh for a while to upload them over 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.710
 he already took some pictures or what 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.720
 you want and nothing 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.420
 I hope you liked it
