00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.219
 if you are here it is because you have chosen the pink i 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.080
 cloud is a very simple nail art from 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.660
 not too many are needed 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.520
 tools and then let's see how together 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.380
 first thing I go to apply the white 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:30.640
 also on the other two nails always two 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:32.800
 pass wait a little bit that the enamel 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.870
 started drying after which I take 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.190
 the lasting yellow and number 86 that 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.350
 it is a beautiful bright pink and opaque clean 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.110
 the tip with the bristles from the excess of 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.470
 enamel and I'm going to draw 3 undines 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.020
 it would be a cloud then those 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.579
 obviously the size of this one 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.290
 speech bubble vary depending on the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.970
 length of your nails however one 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.530
 nail art easily adaptable even to 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.530
 who has the nails shorter than mine 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.470
 I apply the drops dries enamel for 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.060
 speed up drying times e 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.670
 I do the same thing with white 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:23.060
 obviously they are a little bit smaller 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:26.350
 with the cloud then as I told you is 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.350
 really easy to make 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:36.020
 those well with white to go to 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.180
 cover in pink and continue like this 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.119
 when I want then I continue with the 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:48.430
 pink and alternate them and then again the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.430
 white and I decided to stop here 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.979
 I take the pink and put it on some 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.800
 oven paper and daughter from the number kit 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.180
 one of puca and I'm going to draw these 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.100
 dots 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.170
 obviously the points you can too 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.600
 decide not to make wine myself 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.670
 I wanted to see how they were with i 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.630
 dots and so I did I have to say 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.630
 I like it both ways 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.180
 I apply the drops it dries enamel waits 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.800
 about a minute and at the time of the top 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.780
 coat obviously performs gel 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.450
 I really hope that this nail art is there 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.800
 both liked it gave you inspiration 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.959
 but if you want to see also how it is 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.060
 realizes the other nail art or the 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.420
 circles of melbourne you just need to 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.459
 wait a few seconds 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.950
