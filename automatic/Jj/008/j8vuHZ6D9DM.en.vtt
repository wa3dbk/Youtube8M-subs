00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
move into a little bit more challenging

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.760 
move into a little bit more challenging
position<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.690> where<00:01:52.170> she's<00:01:52.350> gonna<00:01:52.500> bring

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
position here where she's gonna bring

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.680 
position here where she's gonna bring
both<00:01:53.040> feet<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.730> to<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.600> balance<00:01:55.050> cushion

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
both feet on to one balance cushion

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.180 
both feet on to one balance cushion
alright<00:01:57.690> I'll<00:01:58.080> just<00:01:58.140> point<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.010> is

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
alright I'll just point out that this is

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.280 
alright I'll just point out that this is
much<00:01:59.460> more<00:01:59.760> difficult<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.510> you<00:02:00.810> might<00:02:01.110> ask

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
much more difficult and you might ask

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.020 
much more difficult and you might ask
why<00:02:01.470> well<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.460> her<00:02:02.610> feet<00:02:02.880> are

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
why well it's because her feet are

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.140 
why well it's because her feet are
closer<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.690> she<00:02:03.750> has<00:02:04.080> less<00:02:04.500> width<00:02:05.370> for<00:02:05.760> balance

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
closer so she has less width for balance

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.910 
closer so she has less width for balance
so<00:02:06.450> she's<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:06.930> having<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.440> little<00:02:07.650> bit<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.830> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
so she's really having a little bit of a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.979 
so she's really having a little bit of a
wiggle<00:02:08.069> time<00:02:08.429> here<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.879> okay<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.810> all

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
wiggle time here it's okay this is all

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.599 
wiggle time here it's okay this is all
really<00:02:10.289> good<00:02:10.500> really<00:02:11.009> helps<00:02:11.370> her<00:02:11.489> to

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:11.609 
really good really helps her to

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.039 
really good really helps her to
stabilize<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.269> work<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.629> her<00:02:12.749> core

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
stabilize and work in her core

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.860 
stabilize and work in her core
musculature<00:02:13.590> here<00:02:14.280> from<00:02:14.969> here<00:02:15.329> we<00:02:15.629> could<00:02:15.780> also

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
musculature here from here we could also

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.390 
musculature here from here we could also
do<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.319> with<00:02:16.379> one<00:02:16.680> foot<00:02:16.889> on<00:02:16.980> each

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400
