bit like a 49 50 question test 99% of
the<00:00:42.550> court<00:00:42.790> of<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.409> questions<00:00:44.409> they<00:00:44.500> asked

you online are on the actual test and I

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.060 
you online are on the actual test and I
believe<00:00:50.019> my<00:00:50.350> score<00:00:50.920> was<00:00:51.100> about<00:00:51.250> nine<00:00:52.589> about<00:00:53.589> 99

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
believe my score was about nine about 99

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.560 
believe my score was about nine about 99
percent<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.710> if<00:00:57.220> you<00:00:57.729> better<00:00:57.940> go<00:00:58.149> take<00:00:58.390> your

percent so if you better go take your
test

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
next day back back back I see and then I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.940 
next day back back back I see and then I
I<00:01:18.960> swam<00:01:19.680> through<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:21.140> swam<00:01:22.140> through<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.680> test

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
I swam through I swam through that test

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.330 
I swam through I swam through that test
it<00:01:23.160> was<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.520> easy

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.620 

and<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:28.490> not<00:01:28.640> cheating<00:01:28.909> cuz<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.240> give<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.510> to

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
and it's not cheating cuz I give it to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.630 
and it's not cheating cuz I give it to
you<00:01:30.159> just<00:01:31.159> nobody<00:01:31.520> told<00:01:31.729> me

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.580

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
so that's it

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.419 
so that's it
pretty<00:01:39.159> simple<00:01:39.399> but<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.710> must<00:01:42.039> warn<00:01:42.130> you
