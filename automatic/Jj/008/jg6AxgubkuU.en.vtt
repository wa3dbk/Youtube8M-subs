is called a thermal Lance and is useful

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.379 
is called a thermal Lance and is useful
for<00:04:58.870> killing<00:04:59.199> artillery<00:05:03.180> backing<00:05:04.180> up<00:05:04.240> on<00:05:04.330> a

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
cliff like this for artillery it's often

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.250 
cliff like this for artillery it's often
useful<00:05:06.370> for<00:05:06.880> guaranteeing<00:05:07.630> a<00:05:07.720> hit<00:05:07.960> on<00:05:08.110> your

useful for guaranteeing a hit on your
target<00:05:08.440> we<00:05:08.620> do<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:08.919> I'll<00:05:08.979> give<00:05:09.070> on<00:05:09.190> like<00:05:09.340> this

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
target we do so I'll give on like this

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.180 
target we do so I'll give on like this
if<00:05:10.150> I<00:05:10.300> met<00:05:10.479> the<00:05:10.630> closer<00:05:11.260> engineer<00:05:11.560> circle<00:05:11.919> is

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
if I met the closer engineer circle is

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.939 
if I met the closer engineer circle is
most<00:05:12.639> effective<00:05:12.849> and<00:05:13.680> opposite<00:05:14.680> if<00:05:14.770> you're<00:05:14.919> a

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
most effective and opposite if you're a
