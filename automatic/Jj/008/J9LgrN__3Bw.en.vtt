00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:03.470
 in this chapter we will make the 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.680
 fashion here 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.229
 we will install ufmt 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:09.809
 the peripherals 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.069
 Firstly 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:15.459
 We'll put it on the motherboard. 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.080
 available for connecting peripherals 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.079
 we will attach this plate to the cabinet 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.159
 so here 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.159
 the holes will be open 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.589
 lifting fashion board to close it algarve mind 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.020
 all clubs will be in place in positions of holes 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.840
 from java 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.690
 which was attached to the cabinet 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.480
 then 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.739
 for fux years 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:45.720
 believed 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.720
 to the cabinet to fix the green fashion 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.650
 so here 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.010
 all positions will be available for use reinstalling the 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.050
 peripherals 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.000
 and loved and good defense of the plate and thought 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.200
 that date is the cabinet 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.420
 we have been completed the gestation of fashion change 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.820
 to the cabinet 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.480
 the next step will be the installation 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.670
 the peripherals and the first one 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.280
 it's a hard drive 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.680
 it is placed 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.270
 in one of the smaller bays where it fits perfectly and today I made and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.130
 fixing screw must be compatible with the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.130
 with the working holes 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.500
 the floppy disk is placed on the front of the enclosure by removing 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.110
 one of the plastic plaques that existed seriously 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.000
 placing yourself 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.360
 the floppy drive 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.010
 outside inside 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.250
 and in the same way as Manchester 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.770
 matching the fixing holes with the holes of the bay ' 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.440
 the skate unit will be weighed with a screw 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.000
 it is important to note that the screw must be placed on both sides of the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.310
 cabinet 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.410
 the orifices of the bay 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.360
 of the unit being designed are compatible on both sides 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.290
 the floppy drive, the next step will be 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.879
 Fixing the unit said daniel 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.319
 first I had one of the big plastic 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.249
 cabinet 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.420
 we put the health unit and not in the same way as the disposal or 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.089
 From the outside in 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:29.769
 and fiction bush 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.799
 in the cabinet and matching the bar hole with the entrance hole 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.209
 of the federal unit screw 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.659
 on both sides of the cabinet 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.980
 having been attached to the cabinet 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.980
 the three peripherals the next step is 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.529
 put the g7 immunization club 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:54.359
 which as we talked about earlier is a differentiated club offered 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.359
 beautifulfont of the cabinet 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.569
 the proler energy 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.329
 of the 27 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.779
 and I tasted of energy 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:04.139
 everything went wrong 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.849
 these produce energy has rounded corners 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:08.989
 in a dignified way 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.049
 you can not put it upside down 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.079
 as this would cause irreparable damage to the peripheral 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.789
 then we will connect with the data charges 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:23.489
 the candidates have a 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.529
 red 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:26.009
 in Peru 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:27.749
 which is usually 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.229
 dubbed 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:30.829
 January 1 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.609
 this is not suddenly a pattern 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.179
 but generally these positions have this specification 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:42.859
 the red ribbon of the data cable 'should be on the side 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.309
 of the indexer 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.009
 in the case of the floppy disk 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:48.879
 just easy to check 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.369
 the position in which the die car will be switched on 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.489
 in the case of the 20s he is 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.300
 on the fun side and this way the red stripe 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.419
 should always be on the side of 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.039
 of the imagination club 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:09.199
 as well as in the cd rom unit it will also be placed on the side 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.629
 of the director 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.189
 having been switched on 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.150
 all power cords 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.359
 in all data fields 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.469
 we gave our best completed 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:21.889
 practically mounted
