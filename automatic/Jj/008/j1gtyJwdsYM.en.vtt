00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
filter so to do this you will need to

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.900 
filter so to do this you will need to
have<00:00:09.440> an<00:00:09.590> aftermarket<00:00:10.010> grille<00:00:10.400> which<00:00:10.700> I'll

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
have an aftermarket grille which I'll

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.780 
have an aftermarket grille which I'll
show<00:00:11.090> you<00:00:11.150> why<00:00:11.390> in<00:00:11.660> a<00:00:11.720> little<00:00:11.810> bit<00:00:12.490> so<00:00:13.490> stock

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
show you why in a little bit so stock

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.240 
show you why in a little bit so stock
air<00:00:14.060> intake<00:00:14.660> for<00:00:15.140> the<00:00:15.290> Genesis<00:00:15.770> obviously

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
air intake for the Genesis obviously

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.640 
air intake for the Genesis obviously
connected<00:00:16.610> to<00:00:16.700> the<00:00:16.820> turbo<00:00:17.210> and<00:00:17.420> then<00:00:17.870> right

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
connected to the turbo and then right

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.529 
connected to the turbo and then right
here<00:00:18.890> is<00:00:18.980> where<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.190> factory<00:00:19.580> air<00:00:19.730> box<00:00:19.760> is<00:00:20.240> and

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
here is where the factory air box is and

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.000 
here is where the factory air box is and
then<00:00:20.660> that<00:00:20.810> connects<00:00:21.260> directly<00:00:21.440> to<00:00:21.860> the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
then that connects directly to the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.359 
then that connects directly to the
factory<00:00:22.400> snorkel<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:23.830> so<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:24.890> actual<00:00:25.070> stock

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
factory snorkel and so the actual stock

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.880 
factory snorkel and so the actual stock
intake<00:00:25.730> is<00:00:25.940> actually<00:00:26.180> sucking<00:00:26.449> all<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.690> air

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
intake is actually sucking all the air

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.080 
intake is actually sucking all the air
right<00:00:27.890> out<00:00:28.010> of<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.160> front<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:28.699> it's<00:00:28.850> a<00:00:28.880> true

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
right out of the front so it's a true

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.870 
right out of the front so it's a true
cold<00:00:29.330> air<00:00:29.420> intake<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:30.369> for<00:00:31.369> some<00:00:31.520> people<00:00:31.760> who

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
cold air intake and for some people who

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.669 
cold air intake and for some people who
have<00:00:31.910> any<00:00:32.390> type<00:00:32.539> of<00:00:32.689> short<00:00:32.989> ram<00:00:33.140> air<00:00:33.350> intake

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:33.679 
have any type of short ram air intake

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.529 
have any type of short ram air intake
where<00:00:33.920> you<00:00:33.980> now<00:00:34.069> have<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.399> filter<00:00:34.699> just

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
where you now have the filter just

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.270 
where you now have the filter just
sitting<00:00:35.839> there<00:00:35.870> not<00:00:36.499> in<00:00:36.649> this<00:00:36.769> sealed<00:00:37.039> box

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
sitting there not in this sealed box

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.899 
sitting there not in this sealed box
anymore

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:37.909 
anymore

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.750 
anymore
this<00:00:38.690> will<00:00:39.319> help<00:00:39.499> get<00:00:39.979> some<00:00:40.159> more<00:00:40.339> fresh<00:00:40.579> air

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
this will help get some more fresh air

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.059 
this will help get some more fresh air
into<00:00:40.999> the<00:00:41.089> filter<00:00:41.420> so<00:00:42.319> with<00:00:42.440> my<00:00:42.589> I<00:00:42.620> have<00:00:42.949> the

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:43.069 
into the filter so with my I have the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:45.129 
into the filter so with my I have the
K&amp;N<00:00:43.249> air<00:00:43.609> intake<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.510> seat<00:00:44.719> shield<00:00:44.929> does<00:00:45.079> a

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:45.139 
K&amp;N air intake so the seat shield does a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:46.779 
K&amp;N air intake so the seat shield does a
pretty<00:00:45.319> good<00:00:45.409> job<00:00:45.530> separating<00:00:46.159> the<00:00:46.339> heat<00:00:46.550> from

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
pretty good job separating the heat from

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.869 
pretty good job separating the heat from
the<00:00:46.969> not<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:47.989> hot<00:00:48.199> area<00:00:48.649> and<00:00:49.249> it<00:00:49.399> is<00:00:49.519> connected

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
the not so hot area and it is connected

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.840 
the not so hot area and it is connected
to<00:00:50.120> this<00:00:50.479> factory<00:00:50.899> snorkel<00:00:51.489> you'll<00:00:52.489> see<00:00:52.670> down

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
to this factory snorkel you'll see down

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.779 
to this factory snorkel you'll see down
there<00:00:53.469> so<00:00:54.469> basically<00:00:54.589> what<00:00:55.039> my<00:00:55.190> theory<00:00:55.549> is

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
there so basically what my theory is

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.360 
there so basically what my theory is
with<00:00:56.359> this<00:00:56.449> new<00:00:56.749> grill<00:00:57.049> it<00:00:57.499> has<00:00:57.679> a<00:00:57.710> flat<00:00:58.339> bottom

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
with this new grill it has a flat bottom

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.229 
with this new grill it has a flat bottom
on<00:00:58.909> it<00:00:59.170> whereas<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.199> stock<00:01:00.829> grill<00:01:01.190> I<00:01:01.429> mean

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
on it whereas the stock grill I mean

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.240 
on it whereas the stock grill I mean
it's<00:01:02.780> not<00:01:02.899> closed<00:01:03.139> all<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.379> way<00:01:03.499> but<00:01:03.769> the

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
it's not closed all the way but the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.620 
it's not closed all the way but the
stock<00:01:04.460> grill<00:01:04.699> actually<00:01:05.030> follows<00:01:05.329> this<00:01:05.420> whole

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
stock grill actually follows this whole

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.690 
stock grill actually follows this whole
line<00:01:05.810> of<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.079> hood<00:01:06.259> and<00:01:06.469> is<00:01:06.590> flush<00:01:06.860> whereas

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
line of the hood and is flush whereas

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.940 
line of the hood and is flush whereas
with<00:01:07.880> this<00:01:08.170> aftermarket<00:01:09.170> grill<00:01:09.350> there's<00:01:09.710> a

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
with this aftermarket grill there's a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.649 
with this aftermarket grill there's a
gap<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:12.670> there's<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:13.850> gap

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.599 

all<00:01:18.380> right<00:01:18.469> and<00:01:18.679> so<00:01:18.890> now<00:01:18.920> I'll<00:01:19.249> show<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:19.490> what

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
all right and so now I'll show you what

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.080 
all right and so now I'll show you what
I'm<00:01:19.850> talking<00:01:20.179> about<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.740> on<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.130> hood<00:01:22.429> on<00:01:22.939> the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
I'm talking about so on the hood on the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.480 
I'm talking about so on the hood on the
lower<00:01:23.270> side<00:01:23.539> here<00:01:23.899> you<00:01:24.499> see<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:24.770> rubber<00:01:25.159> seal

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
lower side here you see this rubber seal

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.120 
lower side here you see this rubber seal
it<00:01:25.789> goes<00:01:26.000> across<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.740> when<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.829> hood<00:01:28.009> is

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
it goes across and when the hood is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.550 
it goes across and when the hood is
closed<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:29.090> rubber<00:01:29.390> seal<00:01:29.780> goes<00:01:30.229> right<00:01:30.439> along

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
closed that rubber seal goes right along

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.669 
closed that rubber seal goes right along
here<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:32.270> any<00:01:32.569> air<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:33.140> would<00:01:33.380> be<00:01:33.530> going

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
here so any air that would be going

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.199 
here so any air that would be going
through<00:01:33.829> this<00:01:34.159> gap<00:01:34.429> between<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.909> hood<00:01:35.090> and

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
through this gap between the hood and

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.510 
through this gap between the hood and
the<00:01:35.299> grill<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:36.560> doesn't<00:01:37.009> really<00:01:37.130> go<00:01:37.369> there

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
the grill it doesn't really go there

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.740 
the grill it doesn't really go there
because<00:01:37.729> there's<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:37.939> rubber<00:01:38.090> seal<00:01:38.359> that's

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
because there's a rubber seal that's

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.990 
because there's a rubber seal that's
obviously<00:01:39.500> blocking<00:01:39.859> it<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.159> my<00:01:40.670> thought<00:01:40.969> is

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
obviously blocking it so my thought is

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.240 
obviously blocking it so my thought is
with<00:01:41.390> this<00:01:41.509> grill<00:01:41.840> having<00:01:42.469> that<00:01:42.590> gap<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.130> if<00:01:43.189> I

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
with this grill having that gap and if I

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.760 
with this grill having that gap and if I
take<00:01:43.459> that<00:01:43.609> rubber<00:01:43.849> seal<00:01:44.209> off<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.750> lot<00:01:45.469> of<00:01:45.590> air

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
take that rubber seal off a lot of air

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.459 
take that rubber seal off a lot of air
will<00:01:45.950> be<00:01:46.039> able<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.280> go<00:01:46.399> right<00:01:46.670> through<00:01:46.939> here<00:01:47.469> go

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
will be able to go right through here go

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.370 
get it under it get a firm grip and just
kind<00:03:49.320> of<00:03:49.350> twist<00:03:49.760> there<00:03:50.760> we<00:03:50.850> go<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:52.140> this<00:03:52.230> is

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
kind of twist there we go so this is

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.809 
kind of twist there we go so this is
what<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.620> looks<00:03:52.770> like

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
what it looks like

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.640 
what it looks like
so<00:03:55.360> they're<00:03:55.510> all<00:03:55.629> off<00:03:55.810> now<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.080> can<00:03:56.349> see<00:03:56.530> it

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
so they're all off now you can see it

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.550 
so they're all off now you can see it
just<00:03:56.799> looks<00:03:57.760> like<00:03:57.819> normal<00:03:58.180> mouth<00:03:58.330> and<00:03:59.319> I'm

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
just looks like normal mouth and I'm

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.479 
just looks like normal mouth and I'm
gonna<00:03:59.709> do<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.890> same<00:04:00.069> test<00:04:01.890> so<00:04:02.890> now<00:04:03.099> hopefully

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
gonna do the same test so now hopefully

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.729 
gonna do the same test so now hopefully
that<00:04:03.840> opening<00:04:04.840> without<00:04:04.900> that<00:04:05.140> seal<00:04:05.379> is<00:04:05.530> about

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
that opening without that seal is about

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.229 
that opening without that seal is about
twice<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.040> size<00:04:06.159> so<00:04:06.549> maybe<00:04:06.760> we'll<00:04:06.909> get<00:04:07.000> twice

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
twice the size so maybe we'll get twice

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.780 
twice the size so maybe we'll get twice
as<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.750> amount<00:04:07.930> of<00:04:07.959> air<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:09.459> then<00:04:09.579> we'll<00:04:09.700> do

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
as the amount of air and then we'll do

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:27.330 
as the amount of air and then we'll do
the<00:04:09.909> texting<00:04:10.299> test

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.100 

all<00:04:28.340> right<00:04:28.520> so<00:04:28.759> that's<00:04:28.879> a<00:04:29.090> quick<00:04:29.449> easy<00:04:29.720> and

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:34.159 
between those two videos of the tissue

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:36.189 
between those two videos of the tissue
the<00:04:34.729> first<00:04:35.030> one<00:04:35.210> with<00:04:35.389> that<00:04:35.509> rubber<00:04:35.659> seal<00:04:35.960> that

you know a lightweight tissue or as a

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.129 
you know a lightweight tissue or as a

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
second one the tissue is moving around

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.589 
second one the tissue is moving around
much<00:04:42.349> more<00:04:42.560> violently<00:04:43.009> so<00:04:43.330> definitely<00:04:44.330> more

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
that'll really translate into much more

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.860
