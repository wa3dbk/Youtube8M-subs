00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
and this works in 1.5 it doesn't ever go

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.120 
and this works in 1.5 it doesn't ever go
away<00:00:09.269> for<00:00:09.719> some<00:00:09.870> reason<00:00:10.170> they<00:00:10.710> have<00:00:10.740> never

now<00:00:24.439> since<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:25.680> not<00:00:25.859> implemented<00:00:26.460> there's

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
now since it's not implemented there's

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.169 
now since it's not implemented there's
like<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> few<00:00:27.599> things<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.199> should<00:00:28.230> know

so<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.300> should<00:02:25.720> open<00:02:26.230> my<00:02:26.500> demo<00:02:29.670> open<00:02:30.670> entities

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
so I should open my demo open entities

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.150 
so I should open my demo open entities
open<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.870> mat<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.900> then<00:02:35.020> just<00:02:35.530> rename<00:02:36.010> it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
open this mat and then just rename it

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:45.030 
open this mat and then just rename it
giant<00:02:40.170> save<00:02:42.120> delete<00:02:43.120> your<00:02:43.270> old<00:02:43.330> entity<00:02:44.050> import

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
giant save delete your old entity import

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it you can't see and import control save

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:07.680 
it you can't see and import control save
and<00:02:59.940> then<00:03:00.940> enjoy<00:03:01.710> it<00:03:02.710> work<00:03:04.890> again<00:03:06.570> don't<00:03:07.570> go

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
and then enjoy it work again don't go

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:30.570 
and then enjoy it work again don't go
this<00:03:07.810> way<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:29.200> they<00:03:29.350> can't<00:03:29.620> fall<00:03:29.920> down<00:03:29.950> one

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
this way so so they can't fall down one

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.880 
this way so so they can't fall down one
by<00:03:30.760> one<00:03:30.790> holes<00:03:31.300> obviously<00:03:32.080> I'll<00:03:32.530> be<00:03:32.710> really

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
by one holes obviously I'll be really

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.770 
by one holes obviously I'll be really
stupid<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:35.490> she<00:03:36.490> needs<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.700> be<00:03:36.760> mad<00:03:37.120> at<00:03:37.360> me<00:03:37.510> for

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.630 
I suggest if you're gonna use it in a
Mac<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.750> suggest<00:03:50.380> putting<00:03:51.070> a<00:03:51.280> little<00:03:51.460> more

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
Mac I suggest putting a little more

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.540 
Mac I suggest putting a little more
resistance<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.540> him<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.680> little<00:03:53.920> more<00:03:54.160> jump

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
resistance on him and a little more jump

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.680 
resistance on him and a little more jump
boosts<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.330> stuff<00:03:56.370> cuz<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:57.910> won't<00:03:58.120> look<00:03:58.210> so

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
boosts and stuff cuz so it won't look so

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.420 
boosts and stuff cuz so it won't look so
weak<00:03:59.050> and<00:03:59.560> fat<00:03:59.970> so<00:04:01.770> not<00:04:02.770> strong<00:04:03.100> you're<00:04:03.280> just

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
weak and fat so not strong you're just

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.290 
weak and fat so not strong you're just
fat<00:04:04.230> anyway<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:06.400> that's<00:04:06.520> how<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:06.790> do<00:04:07.060> it

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
fat anyway so that's how you do it

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.830 
fat anyway so that's how you do it
it's<00:04:08.460> still<00:04:09.460> possible<00:04:09.730> probably<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:10.750> will

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
it's still possible probably it will

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.700 
it's still possible probably it will
always<00:04:11.200> be<00:04:11.350> possible<00:04:11.950> oh<00:04:12.210> I'm<00:04:13.210> not<00:04:13.560> kidding<00:04:14.560> me

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
always be possible oh I'm not kidding me

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.780 
always be possible oh I'm not kidding me
