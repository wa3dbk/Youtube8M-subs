00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
movie goon and that movie is probably

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.580 
movie goon and that movie is probably
the<00:00:41.579> best<00:00:41.760> hockey<00:00:42.270> movie<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.930> there<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the best hockey movie out there at the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.130 
the best hockey movie out there at the
time<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.370> now<00:00:44.430> other<00:00:45.329> than<00:00:45.450> miracle<00:00:46.020> and

time right now other than miracle and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.799 
time right now other than miracle and
whatnot<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:47.340> right<00:00:47.789> now<00:00:47.969> that's<00:00:48.480> probably

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
whatnot but right now that's probably

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.260 
whatnot but right now that's probably
