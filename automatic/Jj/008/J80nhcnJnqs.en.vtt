it shouldn't sound any different it's

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.640 
it shouldn't sound any different it's
going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.720> you're<00:01:36.990> you're<00:01:37.320> playing

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
going to because you're you're playing

the drums and that's going to make

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.639 
the drums and that's going to make
different<00:01:42.570> sounds<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:44.810> keep<00:01:45.810> practicing<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
different sounds so keep practicing the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.679

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
fast once again pull it back and slow

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.749 
fast once again pull it back and slow
down<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.600> we've<00:01:51.869> started<00:01:52.520> basically<00:01:53.520> playing

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
down but we've started basically playing

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.460 
down but we've started basically playing
a<00:01:53.970> role<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.630> we're<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:54.899> going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> get<00:01:55.229> into

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
a role now we're just going to get into

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
a role now we're just going to get into
some<00:01:55.619> more<00:01:55.710> mechanical<00:01:56.340> things<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.850> how<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
some more mechanical things and how to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.819 
some more mechanical things and how to
do<00:01:57.689> different<00:01:57.990> things<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.290> make<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.530> sound

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
do different things and make it sound

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.200 
do different things and make it sound
like<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.280> role<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.759> want<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> play<00:02:00.149> so
