computer as you were one of the easiest
things<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.460> upgrade<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.910> RAM<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.240> your

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
things to do is upgrade the RAM in your

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.900 
things to do is upgrade the RAM in your
computer<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.890> if<00:00:16.890> you've<00:00:17.369> been<00:00:17.490> using<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.880> for

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
computer and if you've been using it for

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.730 
computer and if you've been using it for
a<00:00:18.060> while<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.449> an<00:00:18.779> older<00:00:19.050> computer<00:00:19.260> you'll

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
a while it's an older computer you'll

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.439 
a while it's an older computer you'll
start<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.100> notice<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.550> either<00:00:20.850> slow<00:00:21.180> down

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
start to notice it either slow down

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.929 
start to notice it either slow down
because<00:00:22.109> applications<00:00:22.890> are<00:00:23.039> becoming<00:00:23.460> more

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
because applications are becoming more

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.640 
because applications are becoming more
RAM<00:00:24.210> intensive<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.050> you're<00:00:25.170> going<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.320> want<00:00:25.529> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
RAM intensive so you're going to want to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.800 
RAM intensive so you're going to want to
you<00:00:26.099> know<00:00:26.189> upgrade<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:26.880> RAM<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.570> much<00:00:27.750> as

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
you know upgrade your RAM to as much as

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.700 
you know upgrade your RAM to as much as
you<00:00:28.050> can<00:00:28.170> possibly<00:00:28.369> fit<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.560> thing<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
you can possibly fit it the thing is

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.440 
you can possibly fit it the thing is
with<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.160> you've<00:00:32.279> got<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> find<00:00:32.489> out<00:00:32.820> who

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
with that is you've got to find out who

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.840 
with that is you've got to find out who
made<00:00:33.690> your<00:00:34.020> motherboard<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:35.130> support<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
made your motherboard to support the the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.260 
made your motherboard to support the the
RAM<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.100> built<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.520> computer<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
RAM so if you built your computer you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.520 
RAM so if you built your computer you
would<00:00:39.390> go<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.079> motherboard

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
would go to the motherboard

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.590 
would go to the motherboard

it<00:01:47.220> should<00:01:47.399> tell<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:47.850> much<00:01:48.000> RAM<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.600> with

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it should tell you how much RAM so with

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.870 
it should tell you how much RAM so with
my<00:01:49.259> computer<00:01:49.560> showing<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.130> 2<00:01:50.340> gigs<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.700> RAM

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
my computer showing I have 2 gigs of RAM

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.389 
my computer showing I have 2 gigs of RAM
and<00:01:51.180> my<00:01:51.840> motherboard<00:01:52.350> specs<00:01:52.500> say<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.920> could<00:01:53.220> fit

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and my motherboard specs say I could fit

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.730 
and my motherboard specs say I could fit
3<00:01:53.790> gigs<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.210> ram<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.990> still<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.500> an<00:01:55.649> extra

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
3 gigs of ram so I still have an extra

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.149 
3 gigs of ram so I still have an extra
slot<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:56.729> available<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:58.649> also<00:01:58.770> open

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
slot there available and I can also open

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.090 
slot there available and I can also open
up<00:01:59.250> my<00:01:59.399> computer<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.939> look<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.299> myself<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
up my computer and look for myself and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.530 
up my computer and look for myself and
since<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.250> built<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.969> there's<00:02:03.299> an

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
since I built it I know that there's an

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.600 
since I built it I know that there's an
extra<00:02:04.049> slot<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.500> there<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.310> might<00:02:05.430> be

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
extra slot in there and that might be

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.459 
extra slot in there and that might be
something<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.969> want<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.360> also<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.140> open

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
something you want to do also is to open

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.410 
something you want to do also is to open
up<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:07.680> computer<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.310> look<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.030> see<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.300> you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
up your computer and look to see if you

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510 
up your computer and look to see if you
have<00:02:09.569> an<00:02:09.660> available<00:02:10.110> slot<00:02:10.410> because<00:02:10.770> some

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
have an available slot because some

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.640 
have an available slot because some
sometimes<00:02:12.390> four

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
sometimes four

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.710 
sometimes four
manufacturers<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.549> make<00:02:14.579> it<00:02:14.790> cheaper<00:02:15.180> they'll

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
manufacturers to make it cheaper they'll

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.110 
manufacturers to make it cheaper they'll
use<00:02:15.959> smaller<00:02:16.769> RAM<00:02:17.129> modules<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.819> give<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.090> a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
use smaller RAM modules to give you a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.789 
use smaller RAM modules to give you a
bigger<00:02:18.360> RAM<00:02:18.629> number<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.140> they<00:02:19.260> might<00:02:19.439> use<00:02:19.590> all

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
bigger RAM number so they might use all

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.740 
bigger RAM number so they might use all
your<00:02:19.920> slots<00:02:20.250> up<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:21.209> might<00:02:21.390> not<00:02:21.540> be<00:02:21.689> able

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
your slots up and you might not be able

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.020 
your slots up and you might not be able
to<00:02:21.900> upgrade<00:02:22.049> anymore<00:02:22.680> without<00:02:23.030> sacrificing

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
to upgrade anymore without sacrificing

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.729 
to upgrade anymore without sacrificing
some<00:02:24.269> of<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.659> you<00:02:24.750> might<00:02:24.900> lose<00:02:25.170> RAM<00:02:25.470> in

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
some of that so you might lose RAM in

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.580 
some of that so you might lose RAM in
the<00:02:26.670> process<00:02:27.090> as<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.360> upgrade<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.260> that's<00:02:28.439> all

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
the process as you upgrade so that's all

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.220 
the process as you upgrade so that's all
good<00:02:28.769> stuff<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.129> know<00:02:29.159> and<00:02:29.780> that's<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.019> for

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
good stuff to know and that's it for

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.619 
good stuff to know and that's it for
finding<00:02:31.739> out<00:02:31.859> the<00:02:32.010> maximum<00:02:32.159> capacity<00:02:32.609> RAM<00:02:33.329> for

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
finding out the maximum capacity RAM for

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.989 
finding out the maximum capacity RAM for
your<00:02:33.750> computer
