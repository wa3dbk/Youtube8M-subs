00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.670

 active life 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.200
 the fact of not having to pay for the mass is said to the participants 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.660
 allow you to write defends during the crusade period of the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.520
 jihad to the development of economic vote 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.880
 indeed it went from triggering a crusade 5 participated rates 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.810
 let the other participating factions and factions attack 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.850
 weaken in heresy we do not hear from me their ability to defend their 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.070

 so you've gone from sneak attacking the sparrow parts again 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.120
 enjoy the destruction at the top on the job wise to acquire at bay 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.330
 territories of other factions Talmi than enemies 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.700
 in conclusion though the declaration - crusade participation related to the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.450
 jihad know exciting prior options 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.840

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.460
 unless a few of the three alone if they mentioned 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.980
 previously apply stay away from any involvement at these sites 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.310
