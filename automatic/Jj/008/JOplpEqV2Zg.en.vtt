00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
Henry a little bit again so we can get a

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.590 
Henry a little bit again so we can get a
little<00:00:22.949> bit<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.250> break<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.330> just

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
little bit of a break but it's just

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.000 
little bit of a break but it's just
horrible<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.230> feel<00:00:25.439> awful<00:00:25.619> there's

horrible and I feel awful there's
nothing<00:00:26.430> worse<00:00:26.640> than<00:00:26.880> when<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.210> literally

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
nothing worse than when you literally

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.259 
nothing worse than when you literally
can't<00:00:27.900> move<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.439> he's<00:00:29.279> definitely<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.880> warrior

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
can't move so he's definitely a warrior
