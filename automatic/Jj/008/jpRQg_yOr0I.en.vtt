00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 and if in launching an online game 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.790
 you got stuck inside the game and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.880
 some entity that is the creator of the game 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.410
 I said that if you die you 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.330
 simply and really dies 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.279
 How are you and to deal with this? 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.949
 situation 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.439
 then comes the online chance that is unb 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.740
 based on light 9 of the same name and such 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.579
 that is created by ric kauara who also 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.309
 is the creator of excel word which is a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.340
 light 9 that also had its know to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.680
 anime adaptation I also think 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.110
 It takes place in the same universe only that even 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.510
 that quite in the future if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.000
 and the story follows our character 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.660
 principal who is the expert 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.789
 he is a player who has had experience 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.090
 within the game whether he has already participated 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.750
 beta and such but only at launch 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.640
 of this game that you are already online 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.750
 an entity that is actually the creator 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.590
 about the game 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.400
 I mean, I told you, you have to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.310
 complete the 100 floors of my game if 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.100
 no you'll never get out of here, but if 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:23.130
 You die here dear you die in the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.869
 real life also then die as you 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.840
 that the story progresses you see a 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.450
 little of the impact of events knows 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.400
 in people as people lose their 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.560
 Hope people are killing you 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.880
 thinking that they will just wake up 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.570
 this kind of thing 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.729
 in the light 9 the guy I can say that by 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.950
 example the first chapter talks about the day 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.700
 In the second chapter, 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.280
 day 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:53.610
 I do not know bro jumps 70 days in 2050 then 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.500
 next chapter comes back and you know 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.729
 It's kind of confusing if you really do not 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.969
 pay attention 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.820
 one and a half that leaves things in order 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.520
 but I still think I should have 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.459
 queues understands between these episodes 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.440
 cause it still gets pretty confusing 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.319
 many episodes do not have much relationship 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.120
 with others they understand 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.700
 there in the front it really looks good 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.620
 right and the episodes know will go 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.799
 following an order you really give 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.359
 to understand the sweetheart in the middle too 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.670
 of this he goes to know others 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.439
 characters only what does the episode say 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.750
 not very related to each other 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:32.389
 only really fit for the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.620
 character development of the expert 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:39.109
 so a lot of people say that instead of uti 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.900
 double second story arc them 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:44.750
 should simply have known how to fill the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.260
 sweat art online is the first arc of the 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.049
 story with queue understood to give a 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.939
 very good progress and also a lot of 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.199
 people prefer a lord already online 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:03:00.139
 that the second the arc that in question of the 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:02.959
 romance onemi portrays well what happens 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:06.260
 in the light is not small is not the romance 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.239
 since it passes between the expert and triggers 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.639
 who is a person who knows in the beginning 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.010
 Only what's going on at the charts are they 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.810
 are getting closer and closer and such 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.639
 It's a very interesting stop. 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.019
 people do not like it because they think it's boring and everything 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:24.049
 more only this novel does know a 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.299
 very large development in credit 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.159
 and also in the scene you will see the 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.959
 As the story progresses and 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:34.430
 which really has a meaning in 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:36.500
 pomegranates that the action scenes to 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.720
 anime animation soundtrack of the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.370
 battle animal is a very 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.650
 fuck that really gives a knows a boom in the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.569
 year and such but that this part of 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.150
 romance is also important a lot of people 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.400
 really does not like and I think is cool 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.759
 Did you like the first part? 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.840
 from Mr. Jackson there understand I indicated 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:00.139
 enough 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.419
 the manga comes the chance on line progress 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:06.259
 which tells the story from the perspective of 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:08.750
 acina only that it can be said that it is a 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:11.539
 logical remake that he will not mess with us 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.530
 main events of the first part of the 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:17.659
 Anime is going to keep going only he 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.449
 tries to explore a little more of that 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:22.520
 world understands the art sweat online gives 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.580
 a little more emphasis on that because 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.060
 many fans really liked it was more 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.150
 hence 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.120
 she leaves what in the anime not at least 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.080
 in my opinion did not receive the attention 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.030
 that I should have received well I did not 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.910
 I want to give lots of pole but I must say 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.590
 that the anime is good only that it logically 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.790
 makes its mistakes mainly in 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.010
 second part understands him I hope 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.669
 enough of the second season that kind 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.370
 hogan online game that is more or less me 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.860
 I find a more or less certain bow that has 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.250
 the part of the mystery and everything else that is 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.030
 It's really interesting, it just does not matter. 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.700
 so much the part after it that is the 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.570
 andré world understands that it's another stop 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.300
 which is really coming back for a bit more 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.340
 the roots of online art Sør then 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.100
 I rather expect this than the 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.740
 own online game knows I do not want 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.830
 give many can about how it comes in 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.080
 Then let's leave it like that, right? 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.580
 So that's what folks are going to do. 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.530
 did you like 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.390
 I do not know if you like this format 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.220
 did not seem the same thing to be 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:39.020
 different because this time I tried 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.479
 to use know they have written and such not all 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.280
 it really only gave me a basis of 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.270
 script here to be much more 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.890
 organized and such and give my thoughts 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.360
 no ball or anything 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.400
 I took the comments if you liked 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.700
 this way if you liked it more beautiful 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.490
 that way the boot there liked the video and 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.970
 this attitude as a favorite spreads through 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.240
 Malicious social media understands pa 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:12.820
 spread the videos and leave the channel 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:12.820
 known then as I always was
