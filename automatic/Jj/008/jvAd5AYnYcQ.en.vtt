laughs no here to bring you the review

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.140 
laughs no here to bring you the review
of<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.300> msi<00:00:03.689> gtx<00:00:04.080> 670<00:00:04.589> power<00:00:04.799> edition<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.910> is

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
of the msi gtx 670 power edition this is

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.480 
of the msi gtx 670 power edition this is
the<00:00:06.330> cryostasis<00:00:06.710> benchmark<00:00:07.710> run<00:00:07.919> Dino<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.280> lot

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
the cryostasis benchmark run Dino a lot

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.610 
the cryostasis benchmark run Dino a lot
of<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.730> say<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.780> an<00:00:10.110> nvidia

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
of you say that this is an nvidia

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.190 
of you say that this is an nvidia
specific<00:00:11.190> kind<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.150> thing<00:00:12.330> what<00:00:12.599> kinda<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:12.960> cuz

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
specific kind of thing what kinda is cuz

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.289 
specific kind of thing what kinda is cuz
dis<00:00:13.500> yeah<00:00:13.769> you're<00:00:14.429> right<00:00:14.580> yeah<00:00:14.790> you're<00:00:15.120> right

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
dis yeah you're right yeah you're right

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.170 
dis yeah you're right yeah you're right
but<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.960> an<00:00:16.139> nvidia<00:00:16.470> card<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.190> God<00:00:17.880> still

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
but this is an nvidia card so God still

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.210 
but this is an nvidia card so God still
use<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.690> compare<00:00:19.050> video<00:00:19.470> card<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.949> any

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
use it to compare video card is any

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.800 
use it to compare video card is any
Carson<00:00:20.670> video<00:00:20.880> cards<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.300> can<00:00:21.420> compare<00:00:21.660> an

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
Carson video cards we can compare an

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.660 
Carson video cards we can compare an
apple<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.170> another<00:00:22.380> Apple<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.189> we're<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.580> to

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
apple to another Apple so we're going to

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.849 
apple to another Apple so we're going to
do<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.970> as<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.050> see<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.590> it

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
do that as you can see here we have it

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.620 
do that as you can see here we have it
all<00:00:25.920> set<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.279> ultra<00:00:26.640> high<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.210> highest<00:00:27.510> i<00:00:27.599> can

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
all set on ultra high the highest i can

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.439 
all set on ultra high the highest i can
go<00:00:27.750> using<00:00:28.199> hardware<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.070> master<00:00:29.789> HDX<00:00:30.210> 10

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
go using hardware and you master HDX 10

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.530 
go using hardware and you master HDX 10
and<00:00:31.219> now<00:00:32.219> over<00:00:32.520> here<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.820> our<00:00:32.969> easy<00:00:33.270> peasy

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
and now over here we have our easy peasy

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.620 
and now over here we have our easy peasy
with<00:00:33.870> 4.7<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.860> never<00:00:35.040> changes<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.480> also

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
with 4.7 that never changes and we also

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.889 
with 4.7 that never changes and we also
have<00:00:37.309> GPZ<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.730> showing<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.540> six<00:00:39.719> MP

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
have GPZ up in showing the six MP

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.319 
have GPZ up in showing the six MP
running<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.290> three<00:00:40.530> point<00:00:40.680> out<00:00:41.149> let's<00:00:42.149> go

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
running in three point out let's go

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.180 
running in three point out let's go
ahead<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.230> driver<00:00:43.469> version<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
ahead and the driver version and the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.709 
ahead and the driver version and the
driver<00:00:44.399> version<00:00:44.760> yeah<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.120> see<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
driver version yeah you can see that and

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.330 
driver version yeah you can see that and
then<00:00:46.379> we<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.469> em<00:00:46.620> aside<00:00:46.829> at<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> bottom<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
then we have em aside at the bottom to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
then we have em aside at the bottom to
look<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.610> GPU<00:00:48.000> usage<00:00:48.210> after<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.170> event

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
look at GPU usage after the event

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.750 
look at GPU usage after the event
Orchestra<00:00:51.410> have<00:00:52.410> cryo<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.640> my

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
Orchestra have cryo is one of my

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.170 
Orchestra have cryo is one of my
favorite<00:00:54.539> benchmarks<00:00:55.199> yes<00:00:55.829> sir<00:00:56.129> ree<00:00:56.430> cuz<00:00:57.030> it's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
favorite benchmarks yes sir ree cuz it's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.080 
favorite benchmarks yes sir ree cuz it's
actually<00:00:57.629> more<00:00:57.840> efficient<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:59.370> you<00:01:00.000> have

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
actually more efficient to if you have

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.650 
actually more efficient to if you have
44<00:01:00.690> 80s<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.260> disable<00:01:01.859> one<00:01:02.520> run<00:01:02.940> three<00:01:03.270> way<00:01:03.420> then

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
44 80s to disable one run three way then

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.740 
44 80s to disable one run three way then
have<00:01:03.809> one<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.229> 80<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.559> physics<00:01:05.450> well<00:01:06.450> get

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
have one for 80 for physics well get

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260 
have one for 80 for physics well get
past<00:01:07.020> your<00:01:07.200> scores<00:01:07.610> doesn't<00:01:08.610> mafia<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
past your scores doesn't mafia to that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.840 
past your scores doesn't mafia to that
way<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.510> well<00:01:09.540> yes<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.950> far<00:01:11.580> away<00:01:11.700> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
way as well yes it is so far away is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.789 
way as well yes it is so far away is
less<00:01:12.060> efficient<00:01:12.540> physics<00:01:13.080> yeah<00:01:13.290> well<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.619> way

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
less efficient physics yeah well for way

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.340 
less efficient physics yeah well for way
only<00:01:13.950> really<00:01:14.700> gives<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.509> twenty<00:01:16.140> five

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
only really gives you like twenty five

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.580 
only really gives you like twenty five
percent<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.009> last<00:01:17.340> card<00:01:17.880> i<00:01:18.439> think<00:01:19.439> that's

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
percent of that last card i think that's

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.580 
percent of that last card i think that's
a<00:01:19.680> 480<00:01:20.159> problem<00:01:20.549> because<00:01:21.020> uh<00:01:22.020> well<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.500> don't

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
a 480 problem because uh well I don't

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.060 
a 480 problem because uh well I don't
have<00:01:22.710> 5<00:01:23.009> 80<00:01:23.250> s<00:01:23.400> yet<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:25.080> can't<00:01:25.470> think<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.979> his

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
have 5 80 s yet so I can't think of his

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.429 
have 5 80 s yet so I can't think of his
name<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.850> guy<00:01:27.000> from<00:01:27.420> Emma<00:01:27.570> thur<00:01:27.869> from

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
name but the guy from Emma thur from

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289 
name but the guy from Emma thur from
Asus<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.040> does<00:01:29.189> all<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> YouTube<00:01:30.030> stuff

video on YouTube where they have a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.319 
video on YouTube where they have a
rampage<00:01:35.840> 3<00:01:36.840> formula<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.950> an<00:01:38.250> expander<00:01:38.909> with<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
rampage 3 formula and an expander with a

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.350 
rampage 3 formula and an expander with a
980x<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:40.920> keep<00:01:41.130> putting<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.670> 5<00:01:41.939> 80's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
980x and they keep putting in 5 80's

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.289 
980x and they keep putting in 5 80's
till<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.829> four<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> them<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
till they get four of them and on the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.990 
till they get four of them and on the
fifth<00:01:45.479> one<00:01:45.750> they<00:01:46.290> got<00:01:46.439> 90<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.189> six<00:01:47.520> percent

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
fifth one they got 90 like six percent

scaling<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.540> was<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.750> 95<00:02:25.230> or<00:02:25.500> 96<00:02:25.739> person<00:02:26.190> I'd

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
scaling it was like 95 or 96 person I'd

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.290 
scaling it was like 95 or 96 person I'd
like<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.519> see<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.849> on<00:02:27.000> 3d<00:02:27.269> mark<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:29.760> might<00:02:30.060> be

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
like to see that on 3d mark it might be

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.850 
like to see that on 3d mark it might be
well<00:02:30.540> here's<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> thing<00:02:31.019> about<00:02:31.049> 3d<00:02:31.470> mark<00:02:31.680> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
well here's the thing about 3d mark is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.740 
well here's the thing about 3d mark is
you're<00:02:32.760> gonna<00:02:32.819> have<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.090> look<00:02:33.209> at<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.360> GPU

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
you're gonna have to look at the GPU

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.840 
you're gonna have to look at the GPU
score<00:02:34.049> not<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.319> cpu<00:02:34.739> score<00:02:35.010> here<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.489> total

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
score not the cpu score here the total

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.480 
score not the cpu score here the total
score<00:02:36.180> I'd<00:02:36.390> still<00:02:36.720> like<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.900> see<00:02:37.170> it

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.660 

why<00:02:42.090> would<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.300> do<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:42.690> teas<00:02:43.520> yeah<00:02:44.520> we'll

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
why would you do it for teas yeah we'll

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.970 
why would you do it for teas yeah we'll
do<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.970> c<00:02:45.330> 00<00:02:45.360> l<00:02:45.540> 14<00:02:45.960> scale<00:02:46.290> because<00:02:46.530> for

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
do that c 00 l 14 scale because for

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.680 
do that c 00 l 14 scale because for
these<00:02:47.160> are<00:02:47.280> still<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:47.490> very<00:02:47.730> viable<00:02:48.090> option

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
these are still a very viable option

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.930 
these are still a very viable option
especially<00:02:49.410> since<00:02:49.830> four<00:02:50.280> ways<00:02:50.430> kind<00:02:50.850> of

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
especially since four ways kind of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.170 
especially since four ways kind of

I'm so happy alright so we got a total

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.120 
I'm so happy alright so we got a total
time<00:02:59.940> one<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.270> eight<00:03:00.750> point<00:03:01.350> eight<00:03:01.590> seven<00:03:01.980> six

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
time one of eight point eight seven six

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.250 
time one of eight point eight seven six
which<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.370> actually<00:03:02.700> quite<00:03:03.090> good<00:03:03.210> for<00:03:03.930> this

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
which is actually quite good for this

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.920 
which is actually quite good for this

to<00:03:16.200> fit<00:03:16.350> down<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.590> 54<00:03:17.040> in<00:03:17.130> our<00:03:17.250> Maxima<00:03:17.670> 259<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:19.290> I

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
to fit down to 54 in our Maxima 259 so I

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.430 
to fit down to 54 in our Maxima 259 so I
mean<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:20.670> definitely<00:03:20.820> plays<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.360> game<00:03:21.510> on<00:03:21.720> max

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
mean it definitely plays the game on max

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.930 
mean it definitely plays the game on max
no<00:03:22.770> problem<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.570> here<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.020> see<00:03:25.490> that<00:03:26.490> it

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
no problem and here you can see that it

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.870 
no problem and here you can see that it
did<00:03:27.060> dip<00:03:27.240> down<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.930> eighty<00:03:28.670> eighty<00:03:29.670> percent

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
did dip down to eighty eighty percent

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.650 
did dip down to eighty eighty percent
usage<00:03:30.270> but<00:03:30.840> I'm<00:03:31.020> gonna<00:03:31.140> pin<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:31.710> physics

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
usage but I'm gonna pin that on physics

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.720 
usage but I'm gonna pin that on physics
and<00:03:33.660> we<00:03:33.750> got<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> maximum<00:03:34.410> core<00:03:34.650> clock<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:35.070> 12<00:03:35.340> 15
