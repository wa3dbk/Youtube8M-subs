00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.990
 asking questions 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.630
 how do you look back on your first performance 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:25.490

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.689
 Saba leads me to really have such a minute 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.669
 or so before I had to go and buy one 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.940
 super solid rest I've never seen before 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.720

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.840

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.620
 yes it is really digging to do 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.870

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.000

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.659
