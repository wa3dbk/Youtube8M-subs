00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.090
 here our pokÃ©mon and the pokemon of 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.970
 adam and good not this couple of 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.170
 opponents are may and octavio as 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.019
 you are watching so well we are going to 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.629
 start the fight here you are watching 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:37.090
 octavio ya main that they challenge me 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.030
 I take out devil and good adal takes out that 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.879
 silvio on lap saw there I take the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.370
 true that when I saw it told anda 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.100
 Well, they take us out to Silvio and it affects and 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.440
 so good here I guess it's going to 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.629
 do mega that is clear although good 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.430
 we have to give him has taken 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.949
 silvio because so kind as is 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.629
 dragon does not beat will not be able to do much 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.600
 although good me here because I'm 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.190
 tried to weaken it with a power 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.979
 hidden ice not so good we have 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.659
 been lucky has fallen weakened and 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.180
 let's see what he had as we are going to 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.310
 draw our opponents here then to 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.020
 give you use then that light screen for 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.340
 well increase the special defense of 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.150
 our team that was quite 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.910
 cool 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.900
 and good here because the other team uses 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:25.240
 the other silvio then for peace of mind as 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.440
 you are seeing so well that's how it increases 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.240
 your statistics 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.590
 and all this good take out ninja greg 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.410
 well here a big mistake because I have 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.790
 here there is the pawn not though he might well 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.910
 have been a little faster than 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.670
 us as a girl but good so no 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.590
 could have been another little less than the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.710
 truth is that the combat was going to be 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.860
 quite interesting is not left to a 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.630
 just pokemon the other rival so good 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.960
 let's see what we're going to do here because 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.660
 you know silvio is quite defensive 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.060
 and he's always using peace 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.910
 mental so good we'll try 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.580
 weaken not to see if we can see if 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.290
 He served as adal because he has toxic 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.060
 and they can venerate him and all this good 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.070
 pulls out his last pokemon that is dragon 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.550
 knight so good me here because it 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.230
 he used hidden power to do it then 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.659
 pretty hurt 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.640
 a dragon knight has resisted and good 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.620
 over with the attack that we have 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.680
 done then your attack has risen 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.019
 special and its attack so good to see 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.049
 well earthquake well here I suppose 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.780
 that will weaken my uncle will not be 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:38.270
 quite powerful could have used 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.130
 Leviton who had the habit but good 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.100
 here's the shadow of me the thing about the armchair 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.730
 to give a here then in another silvio 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.709
 use desire as you are seeing here 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.590
 so in order to recover its energy, 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.900
 good bench he served naught it is 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.550
 recovering those fish as you are 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.069
 seeing with remains that the truth is that 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.780
 remains is an object then that is quite 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.209
 used not especially in the pokemon that 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.330
 They are so pretty defensive sack me here 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.550
 me to hero date I wanted to try it and 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.160
 do it mega that a long time ago 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.540
 that did not prove to the mega hero that and the 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.489
 it's true that it's the first time I've 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.400
 used not like that in combats and I wanted to 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.170
 try it with you and well then let's go 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.800
 Let's see what kind of piglet comes and good 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.330
 extreme speed if it was for silvio 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.300
 because he has not resisted because silvio 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.700
 a pity so good let's see 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.739
 here, I use that head 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.050
 iron to weaken and the other served 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.050
 if you have noticed both served 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.880
 scope of weakening from both to the 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.090
 time as here and now takes 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.850
 s tale it may be that mega is what 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.340
 safer and if it does mega then the 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.200
 truth is that against type attacks 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.030
 ethical of julion then I will go super 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.390
 well because he will not be able to use and the 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.740
 pawn electric attacks not against me 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.180
 air date so the truth is that 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.470
 it's pretty cool, good speed 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.750
 Animals 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.670
 this attack because for time and have to s 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.930
 resisted made me has stayed with 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.580
 little health 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.200
 well here he used that avalanche 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.490
 for dragon there could not have 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.670
 used earthquake but I would have 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.299
 harmed that guy not also so 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.430
 well a little less and it is there the 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.760
 uncle in team drove dragons much more 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.680
 speed the truth how cool and good and the 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.500
 pawn is weakened as you are seeing 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.370
 and well the light screen is over 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.070
 and it takes me out to see which halo pum and what 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.410
 cool I think it's last pokemon already and what 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.060
 is going to do mega that I was sure but 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.160
 the truth is that I would like to try the 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.710
 megalopolis that I have not tried much in 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.900
 you fight the truth to see then that here 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.100
 used I thought I would use surprise 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.110
 or something like that 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.290
 and well we are faster than us 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.850
 the lupus and well we have won a 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.230
 combat more here in the fighting 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.210
 multiple that the truth is that I 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.070
 love to do combats with you 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.440
 because it 's very funny as always 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.570
 I say and the truth is that it is also a 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.280
 new strategy not because you do not know what 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.640
 attack is going to use or what pokemon is going to 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.260
 use your partner and well then that 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.290
 it's all I hope you liked it a lot
