game so far on the platform the trouble
is<00:00:28.360> it<00:00:28.630> is<00:00:29.279> incredibly<00:00:30.279> difficult<00:00:30.579> I<00:00:31.169> love

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
is it is incredibly difficult I love

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.680 
is it is incredibly difficult I love
races<00:00:32.559> I've<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:33.850> enjoyed<00:00:33.880> many<00:00:34.450> of<00:00:34.630> the

races I've really enjoyed many of the

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.080 
races I've really enjoyed many of the
races<00:00:35.050> on<00:00:35.200> most<00:00:35.530> games<00:00:35.830> consoles<00:00:36.400> over<00:00:37.030> the

races on most games consoles over the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
last few years and this is certainly one

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.590 
last few years and this is certainly one
the<00:00:38.950> most<00:00:39.070> difficult<00:00:39.610> if<00:00:40.240> you<00:00:40.360> want<00:00:40.510> to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
the most difficult if you want to

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.990 
the most difficult if you want to
challenge<00:00:40.840> this<00:00:41.740> is<00:00:41.920> it<00:00:42.130> if<00:00:42.280> you<00:00:42.730> want<00:00:42.910> to

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
challenge this is it if you want to

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.640 
challenge this is it if you want to
experience<00:00:43.060> some<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.900> best<00:00:44.200> graphics

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
experience some the best graphics

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.910 
experience some the best graphics
available<00:00:45.130> on<00:00:45.220> any<00:00:45.280> phone<00:00:45.640> this<00:00:46.450> is<00:00:46.630> it<00:00:46.920> now

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
available on any phone this is it now

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.890 
available on any phone this is it now
for<00:00:48.070> three<00:00:48.160> pound<00:00:48.460> 49<00:00:48.910> that's<00:00:49.270> not<00:00:49.510> too<00:00:49.660> bad<00:00:49.690> I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
for three pound 49 that's not too bad I

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.890 
for three pound 49 that's not too bad I
don't<00:00:50.140> think<00:00:51.000> anyway<00:00:52.000> let<00:00:52.270> it<00:00:52.360> run<00:00:52.510> for<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.780> bit

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
don't think anyway let it run for a bit

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.210 
don't think anyway let it run for a bit
now<00:00:52.960> so<00:00:53.290> you<00:00:53.380> can<00:00:53.470> get<00:00:53.530> a<00:00:53.590> sense<00:00:53.920> for<00:00:54.100> the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
now so you can get a sense for the

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:04.020 
now so you can get a sense for the
visual<00:00:54.520> style<00:01:02.640> apparently<00:01:03.640> would<00:01:03.760> seem<00:01:04.000> that

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
visual style apparently would seem that

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.420 
visual style apparently would seem that
the<00:01:04.239> key<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.570> success<00:01:05.409> in<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:05.860> game<00:01:05.920> is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
the key to success in this game is

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.740 
the key to success in this game is
learning<00:01:06.939> how<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.180> powerslide<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:10.360> seems<00:01:10.600> that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
learning how to powerslide it seems that

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.100 
learning how to powerslide it seems that
the<00:01:10.870> timing<00:01:11.320> is<00:01:11.770> essential<00:01:12.659> turning<00:01:13.659> into<00:01:14.020> the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
the timing is essential turning into the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.660 
the timing is essential turning into the
corner<00:01:14.530> sooner<00:01:15.220> than<00:01:15.340> you<00:01:15.490> would<00:01:15.640> normally

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
corner sooner than you would normally

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.960 
corner sooner than you would normally
expect<00:01:16.120> to<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:17.190> flooring<00:01:18.190> it<00:01:18.340> basically<00:01:18.700> puts

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
expect to and flooring it basically puts

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.120 
expect to and flooring it basically puts
you<00:01:19.120> into<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.360> power<00:01:19.659> slide<00:01:19.990> but<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.620> found<00:01:20.950> that

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
you into a power slide but I found that

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.649 
you into a power slide but I found that
trouble<00:01:21.549> is<00:01:21.640> getting<00:01:21.940> out<00:01:22.150> with<00:01:22.330> a<00:01:22.360> power

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
trouble is getting out with a power

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.240 
trouble is getting out with a power
slide<00:01:22.960> like<00:01:23.140> getting<00:01:23.409> into<00:01:23.620> the<00:01:23.710> power<00:01:23.920> slide

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
slide like getting into the power slide

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.910 
slide like getting into the power slide
but<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.120> guess<00:01:25.390> practice<00:01:25.720> makes<00:01:26.170> perfect<00:01:26.440> so

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
but I guess practice makes perfect so

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.580 
but I guess practice makes perfect so
I'll<00:01:27.220> keep<00:01:27.490> at<00:01:27.729> it<00:01:27.760> because<00:01:28.150> it<00:01:28.720> just<00:01:28.900> looks<00:01:29.260> so

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
I'll keep at it because it just looks so

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.210 
I'll keep at it because it just looks so
great<00:01:31.320> well<00:01:32.320> it's<00:01:32.440> a<00:01:32.470> lot<00:01:32.619> more<00:01:32.650> fun<00:01:33.010> actually

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
the corners don't seem to be quite so

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.910 
the corners don't seem to be quite so
harsh<00:02:07.729> at<00:02:07.939> least<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.270> my<00:02:08.420> mind<00:02:08.450> anyway<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.289> is

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
harsh at least to my mind anyway it is

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.890 
harsh at least to my mind anyway it is
actually<00:02:10.130> quite<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.520> lot<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.759> fun<00:02:10.970> in<00:02:11.540> fact<00:02:11.720> more

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
actually quite a lot of fun in fact more

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.509 
actually quite a lot of fun in fact more
fun<00:02:12.110> than<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.319> racing<00:02:12.739> half<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.040> time<00:02:13.280> and

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
fun than the racing half the time and

instant this really is a graphical tour
de<00:03:53.940> force<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:55.320> fun<00:03:55.530> game<00:03:55.740> although<00:03:56.250> quite

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
de force and a fun game although quite

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.950 
de force and a fun game although quite
frustrating

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.250 

there's<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.740> in-car<00:04:03.220> mode<00:04:03.550> which<00:04:03.940> is

there's the in-car mode which is

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.660 
there's the in-car mode which is
actually<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.530> little<00:04:05.710> bit<00:04:05.920> easier<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.310> play<00:04:06.550> at

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
actually a little bit easier to play at

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.040 
actually a little bit easier to play at
time<00:04:06.910> so<00:04:07.210> if<00:04:07.270> you're<00:04:07.560> struggling<00:04:08.560> with<00:04:08.770> the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
time so if you're struggling with the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.320 
time so if you're struggling with the
third<00:04:11.050> person<00:04:11.320> perspective<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:13.030> might<00:04:13.180> want

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
third person perspective you might want

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:35.879 
third person perspective you might want
to<00:04:13.390> try<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.630> bonnet<00:04:14.080> cam<00:04:14.350> see<00:04:15.220> if<00:04:15.310> that<00:04:15.490> helps

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.420 

so<00:04:36.550> there<00:04:36.699> it<00:04:36.819> is<00:04:36.879> fast<00:04:37.840> lane<00:04:38.080> street<00:04:39.009> racing

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
so there it is fast lane street racing

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.569 
so there it is fast lane street racing
