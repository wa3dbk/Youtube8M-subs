that one of the things he's gonna need
to<00:01:33.060> go<00:01:33.180> back<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.570> when<00:01:34.140> he<00:01:34.229> gets<00:01:34.320> home<00:01:34.560> he's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
to go back is when he gets home he's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.890 
to go back is when he gets home he's
just<00:01:34.950> start<00:01:35.729> talking<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.119> his<00:01:36.299> coach<00:01:36.540> about

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
just start talking to his coach about

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.950 
just start talking to his coach about
you<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.790> why<00:01:38.790> he<00:01:39.150> can't<00:01:39.390> use<00:01:39.659> his<00:01:39.810> experience

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you know why he can't use his experience

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.050 
you know why he can't use his experience
to<00:01:40.500> help<00:01:40.710> him<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:40.979> get<00:01:41.340> through<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> rounds

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
to help him get get through the rounds

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.760 
to help him get get through the rounds
yeah<00:01:42.570> disappointing<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> say<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.619> least

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
yeah disappointing to say the least

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
yeah disappointing to say the least
let's<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.430> little<00:01:44.640> look<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:45.030> Usain<00:01:45.479> Bolt

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
let's have a little look at Usain Bolt

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.850 
let's have a little look at Usain Bolt
and<00:01:46.020> we've<00:01:46.140> got<00:01:46.290> an<00:01:46.380> angle<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.740> you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and we've got an angle that you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.260 
and we've got an angle that you
particularly<00:01:47.100> want<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> look<00:01:47.549> at<00:01:47.700> which<00:01:48.149> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
particularly want to look at which is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.210 
particularly want to look at which is
him<00:01:48.450> head-on<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.530> did<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.710> learn<00:01:49.829> from<00:01:50.040> this

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
him head-on what did you learn from this

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.330 
him head-on what did you learn from this
yeah<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.090> take<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.360> look<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.340> Usain

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
yeah so if you take a look here at Usain

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
yeah so if you take a look here at Usain
Bolt<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.630> race<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.439> something

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
Bolt in this race and this is something

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.289 
Bolt in this race and this is something
that<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.189> often<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.790> him<00:01:56.939> he<00:01:57.119> doesn't

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that we see often with him he doesn't

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.899 
that we see often with him he doesn't
have<00:01:57.540> lateral<00:01:58.229> stability<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.399> see<00:01:59.700> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
have lateral stability so you will see a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.899 
have lateral stability so you will see a
lot<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.509> rocking<00:02:01.110> back<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.409> forth<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.250> take

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
lot of rocking back and forth and take

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.209 
lot of rocking back and forth and take
pay<00:02:03.299> particular<00:02:04.079> attention<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
pay particular attention here to the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.789 
pay particular attention here to the
shoulders<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.060> there's<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> lot<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.049> wasted

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
shoulders and there's a lot of wasted

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.430 
shoulders and there's a lot of wasted
motion<00:02:08.039> all<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.910> energy<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.899> should<00:02:10.229> be

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
motion all of that energy that should be

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.320 
motion all of that energy that should be
going<00:02:10.739> into<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.069> track<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.459> spilling<00:02:11.849> out<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
going into the track is spilling out and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.550 
going into the track is spilling out and
so<00:02:12.900> now<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.140> know

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so now we know

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.110 
so now we know
that<00:02:13.739> he<00:02:13.950> does<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.550> learned<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.910> when<00:02:15.090> I

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
that he does have I learned this when I

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.690 
that he does have I learned this when I
visited<00:02:15.989> him<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.260> Jamaica<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.680> did<00:02:17.489> a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
visited him in Jamaica and did a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.240 
visited him in Jamaica and did a
documentary<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.690> him<00:02:18.870> 52<00:02:19.319> years<00:02:19.500> ago<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:19.950> he

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
documentary on him 52 years ago that he

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.190 
documentary on him 52 years ago that he
has<00:02:20.340> slight<00:02:20.580> scoliosis<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.360> his<00:02:21.450> back<00:02:21.630> but

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
has slight scoliosis in his back but

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.070 
has slight scoliosis in his back but
it's<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.590> real<00:02:22.950> issue<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:23.730> him<00:02:23.940> with<00:02:24.540> all<00:02:24.810> of

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
it's a real issue for him with all of

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.020 
it's a real issue for him with all of
that<00:02:25.200> energy<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.770> side<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.370> side<00:02:26.550> where<00:02:26.940> if

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
that energy going side to side where if

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.850 
that energy going side to side where if
you<00:02:27.180> take<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> look<00:02:27.630> at<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> comparison<00:02:28.500> over

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
you take a look at the comparison over

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.680 
you take a look at the comparison over
here<00:02:29.580> with<00:02:29.760> Justin<00:02:30.180> Gatlin

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
here with Justin Gatlin

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.259 
here with Justin Gatlin
on<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.620> left<00:02:31.860> side<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.220> your<00:02:32.310> screen<00:02:32.819> very

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
on the left side of your screen very

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.930 
on the left side of your screen very
solid<00:02:33.690> lateral<00:02:34.530> stability<00:02:34.940> shoulders

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
solid lateral stability shoulders

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.420 
solid lateral stability shoulders
straight<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.569> all<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.319> energy<00:02:37.709> then<00:02:38.220> is

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
straight and all of that energy then is

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.430 
straight and all of that energy then is
going<00:02:38.730> into<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.360> track<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:39.840> putting<00:02:40.140> him<00:02:40.290> in

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
going into the track and putting him in

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.809 
going into the track and putting him in
the<00:02:40.530> right<00:02:40.680> direction<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.250> allowing<00:02:41.610> him<00:02:41.790> to

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
the right direction and allowing him to

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.970 
the right direction and allowing him to
take<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.209> power<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.660> he<00:02:42.810> has<00:02:43.019> put<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.709> into

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
take the power that he has put that into

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.830 
take the power that he has put that into
the<00:02:44.250> track<00:02:44.489> with<00:02:44.940> every<00:02:45.330> step

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the track with every step

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.470 
the track with every step
whereas<00:02:46.319> with<00:02:46.620> both<00:02:47.280> he's<00:02:47.640> collapsing<00:02:48.360> on

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
whereas with both he's collapsing on

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.020 
whereas with both he's collapsing on
each<00:02:48.660> side<00:02:49.160> swaying<00:02:50.160> back<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.430> forth<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.000> a

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
each side swaying back and forth so a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.030 
each side swaying back and forth so a
lot<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.540> energy<00:02:51.720> then<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.470> actually

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
lot of that energy then is actually

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.039 
lot of that energy then is actually
spilling<00:02:53.549> out<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:54.030> we<00:02:54.209> say<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.630> therefore

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
spilling out as we say and therefore

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.530 
spilling out as we say and therefore
it's<00:02:55.380> not<00:02:55.410> going<00:02:55.860> into<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.790> performance<00:02:57.390> and

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
it's not going into the performance and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.089 
it's not going into the performance and
he's<00:02:57.660> not<00:02:57.810> able<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.049> get<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.440> out<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.890> out

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
he's not able to get that out of the out

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.009 
he's not able to get that out of the out
out<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.549> him<00:02:59.700> out<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.090> his<00:03:00.150> body<00:03:00.330> yeah<00:03:00.870> that

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
out of him out of his body yeah that

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.449 
out of him out of his body yeah that
illustrates<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.590> inefficiency<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.370> his

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
illustrates the inefficiency of his

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.039 
illustrates the inefficiency of his
upper<00:03:02.670> body<00:03:02.790> brilliantly<00:03:03.330> but<00:03:03.599> also<00:03:03.780> if<00:03:03.989> we

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
upper body brilliantly but also if we

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.039 
upper body brilliantly but also if we
look<00:03:04.110> further<00:03:04.560> down<00:03:04.739> as<00:03:05.400> well

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
look further down as well

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.630 
look further down as well
uncharacteristic<00:03:07.049> footwork<00:03:07.519> absolutely<00:03:08.519> and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
uncharacteristic footwork absolutely and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.890 
uncharacteristic footwork absolutely and
this<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.790> something<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.299> I<00:03:09.330> talked<00:03:09.630> about

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
this is something that I talked about

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.289 
this is something that I talked about
earlier<00:03:10.799> today<00:03:11.040> when<00:03:11.370> some<00:03:11.700> people<00:03:11.819> kind<00:03:12.269> of

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
earlier today when some people kind of

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.940 
earlier today when some people kind of
didn't<00:03:12.540> understand<00:03:12.930> my<00:03:13.080> American<00:03:13.590> jargon

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
didn't understand my American jargon

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.589 
didn't understand my American jargon
when<00:03:14.099> I<00:03:14.160> said<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.459> he<00:03:14.670> looks<00:03:14.849> very<00:03:14.940> clunky

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
when I said that he looks very clunky

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.810 
when I said that he looks very clunky
and<00:03:16.049> he<00:03:16.590> does<00:03:16.860> at<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.190> start<00:03:17.220> if<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.640> just

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
and he does at the start if you just

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.060 
and he does at the start if you just
look<00:03:18.090> at<00:03:18.269> what's<00:03:18.810> happening<00:03:19.380> he<00:03:19.590> doesn't<00:03:19.980> look

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
look at what's happening he doesn't look

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.160 
look at what's happening he doesn't look
smooth<00:03:20.430> things<00:03:21.150> are<00:03:21.299> going<00:03:21.510> all<00:03:21.690> over<00:03:21.750> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
smooth things are going all over the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.110 
smooth things are going all over the
place<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.590> just<00:03:22.620> doesn't<00:03:23.130> look<00:03:23.160> smooth<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.790> he

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
place it just doesn't look smooth and he

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.000 
place it just doesn't look smooth and he
says<00:03:24.359> forget<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.079> I'm<00:03:25.200> gonna<00:03:25.350> abandon<00:03:25.620> that

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
says forget it I'm gonna abandon that

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.259 
says forget it I'm gonna abandon that
and<00:03:26.190> comes<00:03:26.400> out<00:03:26.579> of<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:26.880> that's<00:03:27.060> when<00:03:27.180> he

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
and comes out of it and that's when he

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.759 
and comes out of it and that's when he
starts<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.600> take<00:03:27.780> over<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.140> actually<00:03:28.410> win<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
starts to take over and actually win the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.530 
starts to take over and actually win the
race<00:03:28.920> when<00:03:29.370> he<00:03:29.430> gets<00:03:29.609> out<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:30.030> drive<00:03:30.269> phase

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
race when he gets out of the drive phase

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.620 
race when he gets out of the drive phase
so<00:03:30.810> if<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:30.989> look<00:03:31.200> here<00:03:31.230> what<00:03:31.890> we<00:03:32.040> see<00:03:32.280> is

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
so if you look here what we see is

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.150 
so if you look here what we see is
clunky<00:03:33.630> means<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:34.079> then<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.530> foot<00:03:34.859> is<00:03:35.010> very

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
clunky means that then this foot is very

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.220 
clunky means that then this foot is very
close<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.120> ground<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.450> heel<00:03:36.780> should<00:03:37.049> be

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
close to the ground the heel should be

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.770 
close to the ground the heel should be
up<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.769> two<00:03:38.069> inches<00:03:38.430> or<00:03:38.609> so<00:03:38.760> above<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.180> but

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
up of two inches or so above that but

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.330 
up of two inches or so above that but
it's<00:03:39.930> already<00:03:40.230> flat<00:03:40.590> which<00:03:40.739> means<00:03:40.980> he<00:03:41.100> came

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
it's already flat which means he came

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.640 
it's already flat which means he came
out<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.819> blocks<00:03:42.060> flat<00:03:42.480> footed<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.049> so

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
out of the blocks flat footed and so

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.319 
out of the blocks flat footed and so
then<00:03:43.889> that<00:03:44.100> means<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.400> instead<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.150> him

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
then that means that instead of him

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.479 
then that means that instead of him
being<00:03:45.510> able<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.930> tap<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.560> track<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.040> push<00:03:47.250> off

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
being able to tap the track and push off

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.120 
being able to tap the track and push off
each<00:03:47.910> time<00:03:48.389> with<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.139> lot<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.440> rigid<00:03:50.010> and

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
each time with a lot of rigid and

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.640 
each time with a lot of rigid and
stability<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.329> lot<00:03:51.510> of<00:03:51.660> state<00:03:52.350> stability

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
stability and a lot of state stability

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.920 
stability and a lot of state stability
to<00:03:53.100> get<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.430> power<00:03:53.700> he<00:03:54.120> doesn't<00:03:54.420> get<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.569> he

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
to get that power he doesn't get that he

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.720 
to get that power he doesn't get that he
collapses<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:55.620> I'm<00:03:56.069> sure<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.430> that's

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
collapses so I'm sure that that's

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.309 
collapses so I'm sure that that's
something<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.180> he'll<00:03:57.359> be<00:03:57.569> aware<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.870> he'll

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
something that he'll be aware of he'll

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.390 
something that he'll be aware of he'll
see<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.680> he'll<00:03:58.799> be<00:03:58.920> able<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.100> make<00:03:59.280> the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
see and he'll be able to make the

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.289 
see and he'll be able to make the
adjustment<00:03:59.880> tomorrow

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
adjustment tomorrow

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.509

his<00:04:00.630> contact<00:04:01.380> time<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> lot<00:04:02.010> longer<00:04:02.160> than<00:04:02.340> he

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
his contact time a lot longer than he

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.520 
his contact time a lot longer than he
would<00:04:02.639> hope<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.000> be<00:04:03.030> unlike<00:04:03.600> this<00:04:04.230> man

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530

you<00:04:28.320> look<00:04:28.500> his<00:04:28.860> feet<00:04:29.250> don't<00:04:29.460> go<00:04:29.700> outside<00:04:30.300> of

you look his feet don't go outside of

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
front of him that means that he's going

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.230 
front of him that means that he's going
in<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.350> straight<00:04:34.680> line<00:04:34.710> with<00:04:35.220> every<00:04:35.670> step<00:04:35.970> and

in a straight line with every step and
this<00:04:36.540> is<00:04:36.720> just<00:04:36.900> amazing<00:04:37.560> technique<00:04:38.010> for<00:04:38.310> a

sprinting<00:04:48.990> because<00:04:49.560> of<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:49.920> technique<00:04:50.490> so

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
sprinting because of this technique so

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.820 
sprinting because of this technique so
there's<00:04:51.150> nothing<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.900> could<00:04:52.200> point<00:04:52.590> out

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
there's nothing that I could point out

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.960 
there's nothing that I could point out
and<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:53.100> don't<00:04:53.250> think<00:04:53.400> there's<00:04:53.550> anything<00:04:53.790> that

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
and I don't think there's anything that

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.000 
and I don't think there's anything that
is<00:04:54.120> coach<00:04:54.420> Michael<00:04:54.810> Ford<00:04:55.050> could<00:04:55.530> possibly

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
is coach Michael Ford could possibly

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.440 
is coach Michael Ford could possibly
improve<00:04:56.400> on<00:04:56.610> in<00:04:56.760> part<00:04:56.970> as<00:04:57.090> far<00:04:57.270> as<00:04:57.360> the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
improve on in part as far as the

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.210 
improve on in part as far as the
technique<00:04:57.840> his<00:04:58.380> improvement<00:04:58.890> is<00:04:58.980> going<00:04:59.040> to

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
technique his improvement is going to

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.980 
technique his improvement is going to
come<00:04:59.400> in<00:04:59.580> better<00:05:00.060> speed<00:05:00.360> endurance<00:05:00.810> and

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
come in better speed endurance and

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.600 
come in better speed endurance and
better<00:05:01.170> foot<00:05:01.440> speed<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:02.100> he's<00:05:02.220> five<00:05:02.430> foot

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
better foot speed and he's five foot

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.830 
better foot speed and he's five foot
eight<00:05:02.730> so<00:05:02.940> he<00:05:03.030> gives<00:05:03.180> hope<00:05:03.390> to<00:05:03.510> everyone<00:05:03.660> who

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
eight so he gives hope to everyone who

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.150 
eight so he gives hope to everyone who
thought<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.140> future<00:05:04.290> was<00:05:04.650> six<00:05:04.950> foot<00:05:05.130> three

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
thought the future was six foot three

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.520 
thought the future was six foot three

this<00:05:10.590> race<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.160> still<00:05:11.400> can't<00:05:11.610> call<00:05:11.820> because

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
this race I still can't call because

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.550 
this race I still can't call because
even<00:05:12.420> though<00:05:12.540> people<00:05:12.570> are<00:05:12.990> starting<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:13.410> get<00:05:13.500> a

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
even though people are starting to get a

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.140 
even though people are starting to get a
little<00:05:13.800> bit<00:05:13.920> down<00:05:14.130> on<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:14.670> starting<00:05:14.940> to<00:05:15.000> lose

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
little bit down on and starting to lose

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.000 
little bit down on and starting to lose
their<00:05:15.360> hope<00:05:15.600> that<00:05:15.840> Usain<00:05:16.530> Bolt<00:05:16.740> is<00:05:16.830> going<00:05:16.950> to

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
their hope that Usain Bolt is going to

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.620 
their hope that Usain Bolt is going to
be<00:05:17.070> able<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.220> pull<00:05:17.460> this<00:05:17.610> out<00:05:17.790> I<00:05:18.030> don't<00:05:18.390> believe

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
be able to pull this out I don't believe

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.570 
be able to pull this out I don't believe
that's<00:05:18.870> accurate<00:05:19.170> I<00:05:19.530> think<00:05:19.830> that<00:05:19.980> he<00:05:20.220> is<00:05:20.250> going

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
that's accurate I think that he is going

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.730 
that's accurate I think that he is going
to<00:05:20.640> know<00:05:20.820> exactly<00:05:21.300> what<00:05:21.690> he<00:05:21.840> did<00:05:22.110> you<00:05:22.320> can<00:05:22.470> fix

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
to know exactly what he did you can fix

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.500 
to know exactly what he did you can fix
that<00:05:22.890> overnight<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:23.610> that's<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.300> good<00:05:24.450> thing

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
that overnight and that's the good thing

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.420 
that overnight and that's the good thing
for<00:05:24.870> both<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.230> that<00:05:25.350> bodes<00:05:25.560> well<00:05:25.710> for<00:05:25.860> him<00:05:26.220> so

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
for both and that bodes well for him so

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.220 
for both and that bodes well for him so
I<00:05:26.460> think<00:05:26.700> that<00:05:27.030> tomorrow<00:05:27.390> we<00:05:27.570> still<00:05:27.840> have<00:05:28.050> an

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
I think that tomorrow we still have an

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.230 
I think that tomorrow we still have an
amazing<00:05:29.130> matchup<00:05:29.580> and<00:05:29.730> it<00:05:29.820> could<00:05:29.970> go<00:05:30.060> either

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
amazing matchup and it could go either

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.390 
amazing matchup and it could go either
way
