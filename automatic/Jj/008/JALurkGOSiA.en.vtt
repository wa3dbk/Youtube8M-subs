three-dimensional<00:00:58.620> shape<00:01:00.379> now<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
three-dimensional shape now what you

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.350 
three-dimensional shape now what you
want<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.840> pick<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.080> side<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
triangle and put even more magnets like

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:18.499 
triangle and put even more magnets like
that<00:01:16.340> grab<00:01:17.340> another<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:18.000> these<00:01:18.240> rednecks

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
that grab another of these rednecks

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.179 
that grab another of these rednecks
