obviously<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.930> think<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.230> could<00:00:25.380> say<00:00:25.560> I'm

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
obviously I think you could say I'm

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.290 
obviously I think you could say I'm
something<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.099> an<00:00:26.220> expert<00:00:26.310> when<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.880> comes<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
something of an expert when it comes to

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.390 
something of an expert when it comes to
art<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:27.720> even<00:00:28.080> experts<00:00:28.470> like<00:00:28.650> myself<00:00:28.890> have

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
art but even experts like myself have

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.310 
art but even experts like myself have
questions<00:00:29.939> Ben<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.510> I've<00:00:30.660> been<00:00:30.840> wondering

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
questions Ben and so I've been wondering

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
questions Ben and so I've been wondering
how<00:00:31.710> does<00:00:31.769> an<00:00:32.009> artist<00:00:32.279> decide<00:00:33.000> when<00:00:33.420> something

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
how does an artist decide when something

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.389 
how does an artist decide when something
is<00:00:33.899> done<00:00:34.320> because<00:00:34.649> when<00:00:34.920> you're<00:00:35.040> taking<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
is done because when you're taking the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
is done because when you're taking the
time<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.790> actually<00:00:35.880> create<00:00:36.149> something<00:00:36.809> you're

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
time to actually create something you're

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.410 
time to actually create something you're
probably<00:00:37.410> spending<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.100> lot<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.489> time<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.239> if

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
probably spending a lot of time on it if

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
probably spending a lot of time on it if
it's<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.840> functional<00:00:40.379> item<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> chair

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it's just a functional item like a chair

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.860 
it's just a functional item like a chair
or<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> desk<00:00:41.730> or<00:00:41.940> something<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.360> imagine<00:00:42.719> there's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
or a desk or something I imagine there's

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.930 
or a desk or something I imagine there's
a<00:00:42.930> very<00:00:43.170> clear<00:00:43.500> stopping<00:00:44.070> point<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.520> mean<00:00:44.820> not

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
a very clear stopping point I mean not

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.490 
a very clear stopping point I mean not
that<00:00:44.969> there<00:00:45.210> aren't<00:00:45.420> very<00:00:45.690> artistically<00:00:46.230> done

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that there aren't very artistically done

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.650 
that there aren't very artistically done
chairs<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.340> desks<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.180> what<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.390> mean

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
chairs and desks but you see what I mean

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.930 
chairs and desks but you see what I mean
as<00:00:48.870> soon<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.829> becomes<00:00:50.280> functional

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
as soon as it like becomes functional

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.850 
as soon as it like becomes functional
it's<00:00:51.180> essentially<00:00:51.809> done<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.530> something

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
it's essentially done it's something

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
it's essentially done it's something
artistic<00:00:53.219> though<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> painting<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
artistic though like a painting or a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.410 
artistic though like a painting or a
sculpture<00:00:55.050> or<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> song<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> book<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> movie

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
sculpture or a song or a book or a movie

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.020 
sculpture or a song or a book or a movie
or<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.870> YouTube<00:00:58.649> video<00:00:58.800> art<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.789> little

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
or a YouTube video art it's a little

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.599 
or a YouTube video art it's a little
trickier<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:00.960> don't<00:01:01.170> necessarily

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
trickier because they don't necessarily

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.130 
trickier because they don't necessarily
serve<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> purpose<00:01:03.120> okay<00:01:03.750> well<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.049> not

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
serve a purpose okay well that's not

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.479 
serve a purpose okay well that's not
true<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.530> all<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.680> mean<00:01:04.739> art<00:01:05.070> serves<00:01:05.309> an

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
true at all I mean art serves an

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
true at all I mean art serves an
enormous<00:01:05.909> function<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.810> our<00:01:06.930> world<00:01:07.290> through

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
enormous function in our world through

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.980 
enormous function in our world through
whatever<00:01:08.220> medium<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.880> choose<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.450> view<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.810> in

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
whatever medium you choose to view it in

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.109 
whatever medium you choose to view it in
terms<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.560> cognitive<00:01:11.010> growth<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.000> how

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
terms of like cognitive growth and how

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.120 
terms of like cognitive growth and how
you<00:01:12.180> perceive<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.930> world<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.500> think<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
you perceive the world and I think in a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.160 
you perceive the world and I think in a
lot<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> ways<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.170> interpret

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
lot of ways just how you interpret

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.219 
lot of ways just how you interpret
everything<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> world<00:01:17.610> around<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.990> but

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
everything in the world around you but

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.240 
everything in the world around you but
those<00:01:19.350> things<00:01:19.470> are<00:01:19.650> often<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.950> lot<00:01:20.040> less

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
those things are often a lot less

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.950 
those things are often a lot less
tangible<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.000> think<00:01:21.210> makes<00:01:21.390> them<00:01:21.570> harder

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
tangible which I think makes them harder

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.870 
tangible which I think makes them harder
to<00:01:21.990> grasp<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.799> lot<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.100> people<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:23.759> is

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
to grasp for a lot of people so what is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.330 
to grasp for a lot of people so what is
it<00:01:24.030> done<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:24.930> do<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.259> put<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> brush<00:01:25.979> down

at<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> canvas<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.939> bam<00:01:39.240> no<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:39.990> done<00:01:40.229> sign

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
at the canvas and bam no it's done sign

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.469 
at the canvas and bam no it's done sign
her<00:01:40.860> name<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> bottom<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.670> walk<00:01:41.939> away<00:01:42.150> but

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
her name to the bottom and walk away but

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.030 
her name to the bottom and walk away but
then<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> week<00:01:43.079> later<00:01:43.350> when<00:01:43.530> she<00:01:43.680> looks<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
then a week later when she looks at it

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.950 
then a week later when she looks at it
she's<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.460> wish<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.119> changed<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.780> wish

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
she's like I wish I changed this I wish

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.810 
she's like I wish I changed this I wish
I<00:01:46.049> changed<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.040> she<00:01:47.159> doesn't<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:47.610> any

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
I changed that but she doesn't make any

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.520 
I changed that but she doesn't make any
of<00:01:47.970> those<00:01:48.060> changes<00:01:48.479> because<00:01:48.600> she<00:01:48.960> knows<00:01:49.200> that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
of those changes because she knows that

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.469 
of those changes because she knows that
at<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.860> one<00:01:50.189> moment<00:01:50.670> she<00:01:50.850> knew<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.149> was<00:01:51.270> done

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
at that one moment she knew it was done

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.120 
at that one moment she knew it was done
and<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:52.229> done<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:52.890> there's<00:01:53.040> our

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and so it's done and then there's our

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.010 
and so it's done and then there's our

due to the nature of the project we have

often<00:02:16.700> leads<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:17.030> me<00:02:17.150> making<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.510> lot<00:02:17.630> of

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
often leads to me making a lot of

often leads to me making a lot of
gametime<00:02:18.050> decisions<00:02:18.800> on<00:02:18.950> what<00:02:19.280> content<00:02:19.760> I

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
gametime decisions on what content I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.370 
gametime decisions on what content I
think<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.240> good<00:02:20.480> enough<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.720> make<00:02:20.960> it<00:02:21.080> into<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
think is good enough to make it into the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.110 
think is good enough to make it into the
final<00:02:21.710> product<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.370> don't<00:02:22.430> always<00:02:22.730> know<00:02:23.000> if

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
final product and I don't always know if

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.730 
final product and I don't always know if
I'm<00:02:23.210> making<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.510> right<00:02:23.630> choice<00:02:24.020> but<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.260> am<00:02:24.500> on

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
I'm making the right choice but I am on

I'm making the right choice but I am on
a<00:02:24.770> deadline<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.430> do<00:02:25.490> have<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.060> upload<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
a deadline and I do have to upload the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.330 
a deadline and I do have to upload the
video<00:02:26.900> sometimes<00:02:27.410> I'll<00:02:27.590> even<00:02:27.620> have<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.920> joke<00:02:28.160> in

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
video sometimes I'll even have a joke in

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.590 
video sometimes I'll even have a joke in
my<00:02:28.430> head<00:02:28.610> all<00:02:28.790> day<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.240> it<00:02:29.300> would<00:02:29.390> be<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.570> only

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
my head all day and it would be the only

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.090 
my head all day and it would be the only
reason<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:30.170> want<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.380> make<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> video<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:30.980> could

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
reason I want to make a video so I could

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.860 
reason I want to make a video so I could
say<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.370> one<00:02:31.640> line<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.209> then<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.420> won't<00:02:32.660> even

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
say that one line and then I won't even

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.300 
say that one line and then I won't even
include<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.320> in<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.590> end<00:02:33.740> because<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.100> didn't

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
include it in the end because I didn't

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.650 
include it in the end because I didn't
think<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.520> was<00:02:34.640> good<00:02:34.790> enough<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.270> being<00:02:35.450> said

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
think it was good enough that being said

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.510 
think it was good enough that being said
whenever<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.080> upload<00:02:36.170> I'm<00:02:36.740> generally<00:02:37.190> pretty

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
whenever I upload I'm generally pretty

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.250 
whenever I upload I'm generally pretty
happy<00:02:37.940> with<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.180> final<00:02:38.360> product<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:39.020> have

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
happy with the final product I have

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.690 
happy with the final product I have
although<00:02:39.530> when<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:39.890> watch<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.190> back<00:02:40.430> like<00:02:40.640> a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
although when I watch it back like a

tiny<00:02:42.770> little<00:02:43.010> things<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.489> wish<00:02:43.730> I'd

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
tiny little things that I wish I'd

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.699 
tiny little things that I wish I'd
changed<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:44.690> as<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.020> creator<00:02:45.290> do<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.500> think
