already see from here
she's<00:00:44.670> got<00:00:44.789> rust<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.590> these<00:00:46.590> parts<00:00:46.950> down<00:00:47.100> here

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230

you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.350> tell

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.160 

so<00:00:52.910> I<00:00:52.940> think<00:00:53.030> what<00:00:53.270> I'm<00:00:53.360> gonna<00:00:53.450> do<00:00:53.660> is<00:00:53.840> kind<00:00:54.020> of

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
so I think what I'm gonna do is kind of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.290 
so I think what I'm gonna do is kind of
like<00:00:54.700> cut<00:00:55.700> the<00:00:55.730> rust<00:00:56.330> you<00:00:56.780> know<00:00:56.900> just<00:00:57.320> like

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
like cut the rust you know just like

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.140 
like cut the rust you know just like
maybe<00:00:59.300> within<00:00:59.900> half<00:01:00.200> an<00:01:00.380> inch<00:01:00.530> or<00:01:00.739> 3/4<00:01:01.340> you

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
maybe within half an inch or 3/4 you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.049 
maybe within half an inch or 3/4 you
know<00:01:02.239> leave<00:01:02.630> hang<00:01:03.050> in<00:01:03.260> for<00:01:03.559> you<00:01:03.890> know<00:01:04.059> staple

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059
