00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
see yourself there's no actually paint

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.550 
see yourself there's no actually paint
down<00:05:49.280> here<00:05:49.520> this<00:05:50.060> is<00:05:50.330> something<00:05:50.900> that<00:05:50.930> I<00:05:51.350> guess

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
down here this is something that I guess

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.280 
down here this is something that I guess
they<00:05:51.919> don't<00:05:52.100> want<00:05:52.190> to<00:05:52.340> do<00:05:52.460> because<00:05:53.200> there<00:05:54.200> are

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
they don't want to do because there are

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.530 
they don't want to do because there are
proper<00:05:54.560> now<00:05:54.830> children<00:05:55.520> audience<00:05:55.910> in<00:05:56.419> the

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
this off easily because it's not glued

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.270 
this off easily because it's not glued
on<00:06:00.710> like<00:06:01.280> the<00:06:01.430> finished<00:06:01.760> products<00:06:02.180> and<00:06:03.280> yeah

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.320 
can pick this off actually take this out
quite<00:06:12.320> easily<00:06:12.730> but<00:06:13.730> I'm<00:06:13.910> not<00:06:14.030> going<00:06:14.180> to<00:06:14.210> do

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
quite easily but I'm not going to do

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.909 
quite easily but I'm not going to do
that<00:06:14.480> here<00:06:14.690> take<00:06:14.930> some<00:06:14.960> a<00:06:15.350> little<00:06:15.740> effort

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
that here take some a little effort

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.040 
that here take some a little effort
because<00:06:16.370> the<00:06:16.400> ass<00:06:16.820> is<00:06:17.120> pretty<00:06:17.330> big<00:06:17.510> the<00:06:17.870> butt

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
because the ass is pretty big the butt

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.470 
because the ass is pretty big the butt
and<00:06:18.370> because<00:06:19.370> of<00:06:19.400> the<00:06:19.640> sticky<00:06:19.910> materials<00:06:20.419> of

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
and because of the sticky materials of

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.690 
and because of the sticky materials of
the<00:06:20.570> PVC<00:06:21.020> it's<00:06:21.260> a<00:06:21.380> lot<00:06:21.770> of<00:06:21.890> friction<00:06:22.310> in

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
the PVC it's a lot of friction in

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.150 
the PVC it's a lot of friction in
between<00:06:22.940> the<00:06:23.120> two<00:06:23.300> and<00:06:23.590> so<00:06:24.590> let's<00:06:24.770> just<00:06:24.980> put

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160
