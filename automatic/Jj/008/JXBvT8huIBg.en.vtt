00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 the thorns of transformers fast and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.089
 furious 8 and star trek 3 welcome to the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.089
 TV 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.160
 transformers one seems that it will be the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.980
 first spin off they prepare from 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.710
 transformers and what it will be about is 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.500
 that will be a movie of the whole saga and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.880
 will be located on the planet cybertron or what 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.029
 that we can see in the civil war 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.710
 that there was earlier between the autobots and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.970
 the decepticons also the most 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.500
 interesting that could bring this 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.960
 movie is that they could get back out 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.120
 the autobots that have killed you in the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.500
 latest films of transformers since 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.300
 as it is a prequel they could appear 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.190
 there fighting in that epic battle and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.590
 we could see how in the end they end 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.080
 fleeing to the earth but this spin-off 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.670
 it looks pretty good, not like for example 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.250
 the other one that is also being talked about 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.660
 that would be the bumblebee spin-off like 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 one as the protagonist of the saga that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 would go apart in his own movie the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.630
 idea would also be that for this 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.220
 movie should live the actor would have 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.690
 that has been full live that we have been able 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.579
 watch the first three films of 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.150
 transformers and so man 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:10.130
 they would dilate the whole saga 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.410
 I do not believe that the actor accepts 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.360
 back but it would be interesting if 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.700
 I still did not care much 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.050
 a separate bumblebee movie in all 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.900
 case the movie that I would be interested to see 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.030
 apart is that of optimus prime more than 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.280
 nothing for how the last movie ended 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 the vibes of being tech3 is giving a lot 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.510
 to talk about since you can jj abrams 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.340
 It's been a bit of a mess to get 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.110
 this movie well the director now 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.670
 will be the justin lin and the good is 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.920
 final has been if it is neither more nor less 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.600
 that simon pegg and more than once has 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.700
 commented that they have forced a bit 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.440
 that the film is very for all 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.050
 world that does not know the universe of star 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.149
 trek and now justin lin says no 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.369
 we can see it to the stress-tests more 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.170
 known from the saga as the Klingons or 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.020
 the formula tells us it's about a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.970
 extremely rich and new rich universe 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.220
 so I want to explore new things 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.110
 for the film to risk us and be able to go 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.850
 beyond what would be expected jj 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.890
 abrams called me and asked me if I 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.050
 I liked star trek and I could not 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.459
 believe was always a great follower of 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.769
 everything related to star trek 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.269
 I enjoyed the original plot very much 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.500
 so the project is truly 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.940
 good for me 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.580
 we hope that they have got 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.519
 take the saga forward and we cried 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.340
 although I do not have many famous things about 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.870
 the star trek saga will be so entertaining 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.640
 like the last two movies 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.680
 the dark tower movie that 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.570
 It was on standby because it was a 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.239
 very expensive production and from which 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.030
 they ended up trusting at all it seems that 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.610
 Now he is renewing his production 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.160
 because now they have elected as director 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.650
 more or less than nicolÃ¡s plot that has 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.049
 been director of a real issue the island 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.700
 of the lost souls and screenwriter of the 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.560
 first part of the millenium saga 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.239
 It seems that at the moment the idea would be 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.950
 the main one that had formerly of 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.079
 make a trilogy and between the trilogy 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.540
 make a mini series to complete 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.920
 the plot holes though as 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.329
 now this director of the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.340
 first movie maybe that maybe 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.079
 things change 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.670
 like for example that javier bardem be 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.130
 protagonist of the movie is something else 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.510
 that we still can not be clear with the 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.489
 Stephen Timms movies never know 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.560
 recently made the it's that 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.480
 looked like he was going forward has 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.070
 Nothing we expect the collector 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.100
 dark does not happen the same and that from 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.200
 now it does go somewhere 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.850
 fast and furious 7 had already said from 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.410
 the principle that would be the principle of 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.930
 a new trilogy in no time 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.520
 they said the opposite and apparently this 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.100
 they will carry it out with an octave 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.570
 part that I am already preparing 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.220
 truth is that for me the seventh was the 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.350
 last of the saga since that was the one 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.960
 they gathered all the cast and it was a bit 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.990
 as in a tribute to paul walker and not 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.400
 I would be interested to see an eighth part already 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.660
 although such action is often not more 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.240
 the movie and about having a good 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.130
 cast may end up falling the ipea 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.480
 also the eighth it seems that the 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.310
 character of bryant or with him 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.740
 interpreted by walker could go back to 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.320
 appear in the eighth part in fact 26 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.010
 this is what the 7 was saying for 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.240
 one the 8 is part payment in fact 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.160
 ccoo is the same as the brother he 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.450
 played in the previous movie for 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.760
 that then the motion capture 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.440
 put that on your face over back already 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.940
 it is confirmed that he will return in this 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.850
 movie for that to make Paul 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.260
 walker to make brian o'connor and 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.730
 they start talking about those who are 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.709
 confirmed for the distribution of this 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.600
 eighth part as for example of aid and 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.090
 johnson what they say is that you 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.139
 they asked if they were phil 8 and 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.879
 he answered of course 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.889
 continue without jobs also you 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.469
 they asked about a rumored spin-off 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.449
 that could star in the character of 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:37.419
 cox part of the saga in fast and 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.009
 furious and what he said was all we are 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.189
 interested I had a conversation 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:44.080
 with the studio so we'll see I 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.389
 that we have created a gap for him in the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.430
 seventh installment and that the indicator will be 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.409
 what the public wants this is my 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.599
 opinion but more people have to be 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.120
 involved so even further away from 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.800
 finish the saga we will not only have two 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.289
 part plus 8 and 9 but that 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.029
 we could even have a spin-off 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.949
 starred by the rock is also 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:04.719
 confirmed that returns evades that 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.199
 we can only see it in the second part 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:10.210
 and at the end of the fifth tyrese 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.830
 gibson we have been able to see it in the last 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.569
 fights will also appear in this octave 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.069
 part as far as she is a stand man 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.169
 that we have been able to see as a villain 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.789
 in the seventh part his return in the 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.680
 film is something that is not yet the 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.710
 all clear because what the actor says 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.960
 is there false do you want to make other this 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.060
 It depends on what and when I want 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.219
 make it universal and vin diesel in its 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.240
 they will have already uploaded a logo of the 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.039
 eighth movie that we can see in the background 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.289
 greater than the new one will be a place where 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.449
 if this movie is located, it seems that 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.310
 they will not be that far to travel or maybe 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:41.870
 here it's only at the end of the movie or 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.790
 maybe it's just at the beginning and then 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.160
 go changing you never know 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.810
 for more movie videos subscribe 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.810
 to the channel and rejoice the day
