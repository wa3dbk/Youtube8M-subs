00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.440
 hey you tube and i welcome you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.900
 my first day tutorial 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.000
 Today I want to show you how you are 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.150
 a collective operates and what the word 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.380
 So, first of all a sum brings you 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.650
 50% more wood, that is 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:36.390
 if you have a good spot here now 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.100
 you get out there instead of 46 as well 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:48.300
 if I pack one more here now 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:49.440
 or so would have to be afraid of that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.239
 So come sawdust 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.800
 which can be used sawdust barren 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.379
 and I think they can do that too 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.079
 burn well 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.609
 kate is somehow nothing 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.109
 Maybe now you have to go here 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.640
 the configuration so a bit around 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.949
 I do not know how to play this game 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.460
 but today I want to tell you only used 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.210
 show what you do with it as you do 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.549
 that builds 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.540
 That's the way it looks and I'll be you 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.860
 that there is another piece by piece 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.549
 So now we need to write 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:27.420
 first a source of energy and only knows 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.659
 a low voltage solar panel that connects 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.659
 we 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:43.700
 to an energy store like a mf like 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.700
 for example, and from it, I'll have a short day 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:57.729
 it must be the first so that they 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.659
 regulations the electrics duck the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.729
 drives him on 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.020
 so they do not go up we have to 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.869
 Convert that first into low voltage 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:14.019
 I wanted to wash out so medium 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:16.510
 voltage such a low voltage has 12345 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.030
 from longer and only one entrance with 1 3 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.099
 in the standard six pack that means we 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.019
 have to go out of here now so here he goes 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.079
 in there and we can now here 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:30.430
 go up that was wrong 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:39.390
 so now I need this back here 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:41.739
 somewhere on and on it there so 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.329
 the hunt is not a stream because of that 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.879
 we have to connect now 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:49.629
 I put a cable here and there 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.620
 already it starts 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.319
 You immediately see it doing so and here 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.819
 we get electricity 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.319
 mj wait now definitely stores 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:05.519
 he here the stream from the we for it 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:09.430
 need information lures long ago 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:14.650
 reprocessing very useful for making the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.599
 so watch your hands so much 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.630
 good to use everything from one 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:25.660
 tree rauszuholen tutorials red storm 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:28.450
 control 2006 last that is if we 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.639
 now grows signal have it 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.519
 must be a 720 x and a vivaz 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.349
 he does not cut it as a pure box 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.349
 if we are here for example at the 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:41.410
 private branch 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.540
 if we put it that way now , too 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.150
 also as far as I know because he yes 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.599
 what gets too and that's how it is 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.599
 not really matter 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:59.769
 that means here we see you 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:01.180
 get out now for 1 6 out the whole 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.260
 You can also use several engines 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:12.489
 operate for example if I am now 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:13.689
 here again just then runs the 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.799
 now even then it 's faster 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:22.900
 follow and we can do that too 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:23.949
 behind a turn then it works 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.349
 much faster you could now too 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.539
 almost take and so and so high so it 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:34.630
 actually goes with all i believe 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:35.500
 also with the black box and yes so far 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.780
 worry 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.500
 then i would say im in the 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.500
 next story
