 Today we will transfer the reception of the reception from 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.270
 my subscriber eugenia abramova somewhere 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.910
 a year or two ago he sent me a recipe 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.609
 Cool Mushroom Julien Chicken Recipe 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.289

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.210
 decided to share with you at all on my 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.760
 the channel already has a recipe for julien well there 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.920

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.449
 cool julien but today's julien 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.089
 would be more correct because for 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.760
 pouring mushrooms and chicken we use 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.159
 cream and this is a delicate texture which 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.960
 won't beat the taste of mushrooms and chicken 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.220
 let me tell you what we need 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.589
 for this rogue 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.750
 I have about 400 grams of mushrooms and chicken 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.000
 hotel well let's take it so on 300 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.369
 grams of mushrooms need 1 chicken filleshechka 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.379
 one onion what tasty cheese am i 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.850
 I use Dutch cheese to me more 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.610
 we like everything else we need a canteen 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.770
 spoon flour in cream of allspice 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.130
 a little bit to boil the chicken salt and 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.130
 pepper 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.320
 first you have to boil the chicken fillet 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.280
 we will cook on medium heat about 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.280
 20 minutes 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.909
 when we are half the time has passed 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.050
 we throw fragrant in our saucepan 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.760
 pepper it will be cool first you need 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.950
 prepare the mushrooms for this they need 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.080
 wash the desirability of peeling off the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.550
 top coat with a hat cut them on 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.550
 big enough pieces 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:08.800
 onions will also be cleaned and cut into small ones 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:18.310
 onion cubes need to fry on vegetable 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:22.260
 oil until soft two or three minutes after 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.260
 what to throw onion mushrooms 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.160
 if we have of mushrooms and deal with a lot 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.710
 moisture must wait until this moisture 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.740
 evaporate and give a little mushroom 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:43.410
 dry so the mushrooms are fried fast well 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.090
 minutes 10 15 mushrooms must be salted in the very 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.130
 the end is not necessary in the middle because 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.210
 then excessive moisture stand out from 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.210
 mushrooms and they will become dry 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.650
 about the same time with us 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.900
 cooked mushrooms and chicken just 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.220
 it was said now we need to disassemble the chicken 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.650
 on fibers it is desirable to do this 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.850
 my fork by hand they cut with a knife 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.850
 because it tastes so good 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.540
 when the mushrooms are so slightly behind us 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.710
 gilded sprinkle them with flour 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:32.390
 mix everything and fry somewhere 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:34.760
 minutes and a half pour into the pan 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:44.780
 cream we continue to stew our mushrooms 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:49.030
 stirring it over medium heat 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.030
 until the cream starts to thicken 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.739
 add chicken mushrooms mix and 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.739
 julien can be laid out by cocotte 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.530
 as 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:18.120
 almost to the top we lay the julien in 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.120
 sprinkle coconuts with grated cheese 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.279
 and put in the oven warmed to 200 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.590
 degrees desirable with grill function 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:43.610
 so that we have a cheese 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.319
 golden crust is not important here 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.300
 completely cooking process we 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.900
 put in the oven solely to 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.059
 signature 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.889
 cheese so how much will you bake i 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:54.339
 I do not know it all depends on the raw 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:05:03.589
 your oven watch the state 

00:04:54.339 --> 00:05:05.870
 visually determine readiness here and 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:07.639
 all friends julien with chicken and mushrooms with 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.370
