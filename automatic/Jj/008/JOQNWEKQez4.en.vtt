 very good you are all guys in your 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.760
 map that bet I remove this map is called 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.860
 always parkour and I think that besides 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.779
 well always has nothing but good 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.520
 you know that he applied a small filter 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.950
 to know if the maps are good and are 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.240
 playable and paints well paints well and good 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.230
 babies with him or give in because this guy 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.190
 he asked me is that when I've 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.570
 changed before packages of 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.789
 tools that I was recording you've 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.960
 has exploited me to in class itself so 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.059
 let's read the rules to see what we 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.860
 they count rules of the map first Juan in 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.449
 peaceful second shine dark sight 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.520
 towards minimum render do not leave the map 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.780
 which with the father textures or yields that 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.460
 have opposed you can play with the same 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.560
 from one to return holy where it is 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.880
 if you perfectly like what we have 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.520
 what to do is going to be with the brightness in 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.280
 dark then this one I have to cut off from 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.899
 change it because this is fabric would be 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.640
 definitive mods your site but it's that 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.010
 without you more more complicated we do not see well 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.750
 what happens and press the pulsar because 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.350
 we welcome 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.030
 Welcome to parkour is something simple 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.190
 but surely you will like it has several 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.720
 phases such as normal ferrÃ¡n and 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.610
 the one you like the most so impossible 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.350
 normal is in a missing of more is 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.470
 Enjoy greetings here my account 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.820
 youtube twitter if you want to spend 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.740
 lautaro 6 and 7 on youtube ok and the steal 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.350
 ferreira it seems that our map is a 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.450
 girl who is going laura has been made of 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.230
 night of each creative game mode 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.840
 but scarce if you see 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.820
 he has given a touch that looks very good 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.260
 do the pair for s is like with lights there 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.150
 it's nice everything's going 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.470
 with the delivery it is but you do not leave very 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.480
 desperate it costs me little that we can 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.750
 many stairs that this one what more 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.750
 hate 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.510
 so at first glance it's coming out 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.920
 pretty good but then sure when 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.750
 come the dear impossible jumps 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.880
 I'm going to end up doing some kind of 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.220
 furniture what always comes right in 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.290
 you searched for these contrasts 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.530
 it is not impossible if you take one is 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.100
 impossible to pass with the game or one ok 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.440
 buzz 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.869
 has already given me entity could throw at 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.330
 second and the auto direct this stps 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.990
 Express yourself above me woman searches 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.990
 this fund 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.850
 if I do not feel so stressful I hope 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.989
 is that you see that my space is 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.390
 is going to the hell that all of 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.980
 buy the keyboard and microphone too 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.209
 because the keyboard that I have has already 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.860
 you are in if I believe that space both 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.110
 for ends is going to hell 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.650
 next perfect parkour I put before 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.659
 start 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.610

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.829
 just with a few touches away 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.519
 of realization and cutting and things like that and already 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.019
 as a very good touch 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.790
 I like what I think so much 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.200
 It looks like the perfect parking lot where you 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.629
 it's good if you do not stress the one 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.730
 You can see the whole landscape without 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.989
 desire to kill someone nothing is 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.519

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.950
 I already tell you to bet if you want to see 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.200
 have been angry more impossible does not have 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.120
 to be jobs have been looking 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.470
 the tickles to jump high look 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.470
 down and when you jump up 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.810
 it is not a matter of little use 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.970
 tried to make a change that besides that 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.280
 I have sensitivity very very very 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.170
 slow in a time almost to lift the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.650
 mouse 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.960
 have no uncle we started and we started 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.920
 with it is impossible the champagne yes look 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.069
 arrived 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.609
 all are impossible 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.280
 so if with someone he goes to 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.109
 adjust that you fell here and well then 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.090
 you're sure you won if I get to 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.219
 bet something and also that puts anyone 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.870
 back with the thousand treatment and tricks and 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.370
 you go up by teams is the final jumping 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.370
 from up here to the emeralds 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.609
 but I had not realized that 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.770
 seriously because herbal 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.900
 It has been a very big word , I do not know 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.560
 take one off this is like taking off 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.950
 over 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.470
 I have removed one another silvers 2 followed 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.270
 the leaders in these jumps and without pulse 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.830
 they close there butt once more I take 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.030
 enabling removing and more now that 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.460
 I come a little sad because they have just 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.870
 kill my wife in the in the series of 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.030
 definitive heroes because I left a 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.470
 little the open door come to kill the 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.470
 surely you said verses 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.740
 removes audits tail dragon 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.600
 to see if you try to jump these you can 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.220
 this because they are 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.510
 is that the jump is perfect is not 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.420
 it goes well to at least it happens to me from another 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.370
 parkour with impossible jumps touching the 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.750
 buttons came out is impossible now how about 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.980
 a little more enjoy ok it gets a little 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.980
 longer 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:10.140
 we have put a lot of pasta very well 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.400
 well if that one is no longer me 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.700
 it happens to another payment so you get 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.990
 Challenges Challenges Challenge in the necessities enter that 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.670
 we're going to hell a little 9 how about 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.200
 the hell you look good with this 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:26.290
 injury pretext and it seems hell and nothing 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.290
 still here you do not have to put so 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.970
 for not seeing well and I fall here a 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.260
 impossible does not take or impossible that more 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.240
 would make it impossible if you go with figures 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.770
 animals rather easier though to 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.750
 it becomes perfect no less 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.919

 I hope you liked the map 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.740
 truth is that impossible jumps do not 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.940
 It has ended in despair as much as a 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.370
 map that you have surely seen that it was 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.199
 of stairs that was horrible horrible 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.729
 horrible and in addition it lasted like 15 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.409
 minutes and come stairs 20 staircase 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.940
