don't<00:01:42.590> think<00:01:43.219> that<00:01:43.429> they're<00:01:43.640> supposed<00:01:44.539> to<00:01:44.630> be

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
don't think that they're supposed to be

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.910 
don't think that they're supposed to be
in<00:01:44.810> conjunction<00:01:45.140> with<00:01:45.350> each<00:01:45.530> other<00:01:45.710> I<00:01:45.799> think

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.570 
I don't know and then when they have
these<00:02:53.850> brushes<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:55.080> find<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.620> product<00:02:56.070> stays

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580

in<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.940> brush<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.150> have<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.480> squeeze<00:02:57.810> and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
in the brush you have to squeeze and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.840 
in the brush you have to squeeze and
then<00:02:58.560> by<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.800> time<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.220> actually<00:02:59.610> see

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
then by the time you actually see

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.449 
then by the time you actually see
products<00:03:00.390> coming<00:03:00.660> out<00:03:00.959> you've<00:03:01.860> got<00:03:02.010> too<00:03:02.280> much

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
products coming out you've got too much

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.130 
products coming out you've got too much
in<00:03:02.730> your<00:03:02.850> brush<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.360> can't<00:03:03.570> use<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.780> and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
in your brush and you can't use it and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.660 
in your brush and you can't use it and
then<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.410> find<00:03:04.650> there's<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.890> lot<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.160> wastage

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
anything like that if I had to say it's

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.860 
anything like that if I had to say it's
probably<00:04:05.100> I<00:04:05.640> would<00:04:06.090> probably<00:04:06.239> say<00:04:06.510> it's<00:04:06.600> more

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
probably I would probably say it's more

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.650 
probably I would probably say it's more
neutral<00:04:07.470> than<00:04:07.530> anything<00:04:08.070> but<00:04:08.250> neutral<00:04:08.760> airing

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
neutral than anything but neutral airing

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.270 
neutral than anything but neutral airing
on<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.959> side<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.200> yellow<00:04:10.590> if<00:04:10.799> that<00:04:10.950> makes<00:04:11.160> any

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
on the side of yellow if that makes any

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.490 
on the side of yellow if that makes any
sense<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.820> wish<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.930> they'd<00:04:13.080> made<00:04:13.290> their

foundation<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.610> this<00:04:15.180> color<00:04:15.510> because<00:04:15.989> it's

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
foundation in this color because it's

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.940

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
really weird undertones to them so I

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.790 
really weird undertones to them so I
tried<00:04:38.390> I<00:04:38.600> think<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.960> tried<00:04:39.170> the<00:04:39.290> perfect<00:04:39.650> match

little bit of a brightening effect then

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.010 
little bit of a brightening effect then
I<00:05:27.680> would<00:05:27.890> definitely<00:05:28.160> try<00:05:29.000> this<00:05:29.060> out<00:05:29.390> if

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020
