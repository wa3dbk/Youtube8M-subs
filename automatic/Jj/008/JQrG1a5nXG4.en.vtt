00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.790 
and there's a second mode for deed for
the<00:00:21.240> reverb<00:00:21.630> there's<00:00:21.900> two<00:00:22.109> modes<00:00:22.289> there's<00:00:22.710> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the reverb there's two modes there's a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.700 
the reverb there's two modes there's a
little<00:00:23.279> switch<00:00:23.519> inside<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.330> turn<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
little switch inside it can turn to the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.490 
little switch inside it can turn to the
left<00:00:25.920> or<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.789> will<00:00:27.029> change<00:00:27.500> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
left or to the right it will change the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.429 
left or to the right it will change the
effect<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.390> was<00:00:30.390> debating<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.900> put<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
effect I was debating and put it on the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.610 
effect I was debating and put it on the
front<00:00:31.679> maybe<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.239> later<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.590> but<00:00:34.590> I

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
front maybe I would do it later on but I

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.970 
front maybe I would do it later on but I
think<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.670> looks<00:00:36.239> cleaner<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:37.920> I'm

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
think just this looks cleaner so I'm

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.490 
think just this looks cleaner so I'm
gonna<00:00:38.100> play<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> little<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.850> more<00:00:39.350> through<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
gonna play a little bit more through the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.590 
gonna play a little bit more through the
other<00:00:41.989> two<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> other<00:00:43.290> mode<00:00:44.059> so<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.360> show

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
other two the other mode so I can show

00:00:45.600 --> 00:02:46.940 
other two the other mode so I can show
you

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.810 

I'm<00:02:47.950> gonna<00:02:48.160> change<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.820> mode<00:02:49.060> turn<00:02:49.990> it<00:02:50.110> off

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
I'm gonna change the mode turn it off

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.720 
I'm gonna change the mode turn it off
stinkies<00:02:52.320> turn<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:53.440> down<00:02:53.560> there's<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.520> little

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
stinkies turn it down there's a little

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.080 
stinkies turn it down there's a little
switch<00:02:55.030> inside<00:02:55.390> like<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:55.720> said<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:56.200> just<00:02:57.060> flip<00:02:58.060> it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
switch inside like I said I just flip it

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.250 
switch inside like I said I just flip it
I<00:02:59.250> have<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:01.060> much<00:03:01.780> deeper<00:03:03.360> type<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.540> reverb<00:03:05.020> and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
I have a much deeper type of reverb and

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:37.280 
I have a much deeper type of reverb and
I'm<00:03:05.320> gonna<00:03:05.440> feel<00:03:05.739> it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.510 

feels<00:03:38.290> like<00:03:38.440> I'm<00:03:38.560> training<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.920> church<00:03:39.280> or

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
feels like I'm training the church or

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.390 
feels like I'm training the church or
something<00:03:39.730> that's<00:03:39.970> pretty<00:03:40.180> cool
