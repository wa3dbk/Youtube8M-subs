00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.880 

well<00:00:27.640> I<00:00:27.970> said<00:00:28.869> this<00:00:29.439> opponent<00:00:29.890> in<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.559> draw

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
well I said this opponent in was a draw

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.119 
well I said this opponent in was a draw
today<00:00:33.460> and<00:00:34.059> he<00:00:34.720> was<00:00:34.960> like<00:00:35.170> shuffling<00:00:35.680> my<00:00:35.829> deck

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
today and he was like shuffling my deck

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.970 
today and he was like shuffling my deck
and<00:00:36.430> you<00:00:36.699> really<00:00:37.110> pulled<00:00:38.110> up<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.530> corners

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
and you really pulled up the corners

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.280 
and you really pulled up the corners
really<00:00:39.309> high<00:00:39.489> and<00:00:40.120> then<00:00:40.239> riffle<00:00:40.719> shuffle<00:00:40.750> did

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
really high and then riffle shuffle did

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.549 
really high and then riffle shuffle did
and<00:00:41.680> I<00:00:42.309> was<00:00:42.340> thinking<00:00:42.489> like<00:00:43.350> why<00:00:44.350> is<00:00:44.409> he

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
and I was thinking like why is he

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.369 
and I was thinking like why is he
looking<00:00:44.739> at<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:45.489> why<00:00:46.420> how<00:00:46.780> high<00:00:47.019> can<00:00:47.050> you

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
looking at it and why how high can you

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.160 
looking at it and why how high can you
get<00:00:47.940> peripheral<00:00:48.940> shuffling<00:00:49.329> so<00:00:49.510> I<00:00:49.540> thought<00:00:49.989> it

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
get peripheral shuffling so I thought it

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.969 
get peripheral shuffling so I thought it
was<00:00:50.379> really<00:00:50.620> suspicious<00:00:51.129> I<00:00:52.290> let<00:00:53.290> it<00:00:53.440> be<00:00:53.710> like

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
was really suspicious I let it be like

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.819 
was really suspicious I let it be like
that<00:00:54.040> I<00:00:54.610> shuffle<00:00:55.390> my<00:00:55.570> deck<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:56.050> same<00:00:56.350> way<00:00:56.559> like

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
that I shuffle my deck the same way like

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.479 
that I shuffle my deck the same way like
he<00:00:57.070> did<00:00:57.309> in<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:58.629> second<00:00:59.050> game<00:00:59.199> and<00:00:59.440> I<00:00:59.829> saw<00:01:00.190> like

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
he did in the second game and I saw like

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.790 
he did in the second game and I saw like
all<00:01:00.760> my<00:01:00.940> parts<00:01:01.420> passing<00:01:02.350> by<00:01:02.500> so<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:02.769> thought

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
all my parts passing by so I thought

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.490 
all my parts passing by so I thought
like<00:01:03.190> yeah<00:01:03.609> I<00:01:03.640> must<00:01:03.940> have<00:01:04.089> seen<00:01:04.420> like<00:01:05.229> my<00:01:05.259> day

like yeah I must have seen like my day

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.650 
like yeah I must have seen like my day

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
and I told the judge after we started in

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.700 
and I told the judge after we started in
game<00:01:10.810> 2<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.820> judges<00:01:13.090> must<00:01:13.450> have<00:01:13.720> looked

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
game 2 and the judges must have looked

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.630 
game 2 and the judges must have looked
at<00:01:14.979> it<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.539> well<00:01:16.539> decided<00:01:17.080> he<00:01:17.259> did<00:01:17.590> like<00:01:18.310> look

thought the judges were doing nothing

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.360 
thought the judges were doing nothing
about<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.960> because<00:01:53.320> I<00:01:53.350> didn't<00:01:53.710> see<00:01:53.830> any<00:01:54.040> judge

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
about it because I didn't see any judge

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.130 
about it because I didn't see any judge
in<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.700> neighborhood<00:01:55.150> of<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.570> game<00:01:55.750> towards

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
in the neighborhood of the game towards

in the neighborhood of the game towards
me<00:01:56.350> it's<00:01:56.979> really<00:01:57.130> weird<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.790> thought<00:01:58.300> I<00:01:58.360> type

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
me it's really weird I thought I type

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.400 
me it's really weird I thought I type
they<00:01:59.380> take<00:01:59.619> just<00:01:59.890> like<00:02:00.540> nuts<00:02:01.540> take<00:02:02.260> it

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410
