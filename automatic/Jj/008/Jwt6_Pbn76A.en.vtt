00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 i have i have recently i know and yes 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.040
 had a good time with the police 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.809
 annoying in the end boxes 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.550
 to ended with a yes with a 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.009
 fine a fine 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.100
 i would say i got it without light 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.160
 through the city ​​and also not proud of it 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.630
 it was dark that is probably too 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.510
 the reason that I am the ticket 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.279
 but you know I always have 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.510
 people who know me say hey you have 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.609
 there is always light on your bike that 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.340
 less role model for us and try that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.420
 I also really have to be 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.710
 my yes now in this case you know it was 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.300
 I looked once before I would 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.739
 honestly say what I come to the end 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.110
 something like that above that he's not secret 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.000
 I had something like that once and also 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.140
 without light by the city was 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.180
 in Maastricht 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.010
 and then the hiss is over 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.590
 also justice too 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.449
 i would tell you that i went no i 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.670
 row in maastricht it's dark and you 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.649
 youthful recklessness or something you know about the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.960
 sint servaasbrug that is that bridge over the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.000
 maas in maastricht and I am just driving that 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.339
 bridge and see you on the other side 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.439
 I have a police van 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.180
 and at that moment i think shit it is 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.860
 dark i have no light on the bike and 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.210
 there is one in that lantern 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.080
 police van 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.080
 you're driving a fucking 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.490
 and I yes what can you do you know you 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.770
 ca n't go you can say hard 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.450
 no I had an appointment with the mesh and 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.970
 stand and watch the water and dance 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.440
 runaway dust and I thought for a while 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.570
 of i did turn under get whole 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.950
 fast but I think no 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.240
 of course they haunt me that whole 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.010
 it suspected you without light on the 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.910
 police come and then suddenly hit hard 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.040
 drives 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.220
 moreover I had all of 6 newspapers 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.050
 hurt so I was really completely 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.870
 no that's not true 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.580
 but so it felt like yes maybe one 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.729
 Free Netherlands with me then may already long 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:54.440
 again so I 'm getting closer to that 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.910
 Police stop and start like mad 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.229
 you know how to think of something 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.640
 then I normally have such 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.810
 story what i always say take i am 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.820
 on my way to my sister 10 lies in it 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.590
 hospital gave birth to that 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.030
 people yes then his agent can also be alone 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.899
 but say well have one i hope so 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.899
 baby is kind 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.510
 problem only now 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.330
 people in maastricht already know it 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.459
 the hospital is right there with you 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.870
 that way so you know that says 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.120
 on the way to the hospital while 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.220
 you are there the hospital could also 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.720
 not that moment there but realize that 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.880
 stands practically for the van and the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.630
 First still getting nothing in my 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.830
 head and I start less and less 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.140
 basically sets bikes on a no with 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.830
 just stop in front of the police van 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.890
 hoping that something happens and I fall 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.030
 look for support at the sidewalk and look in the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.900
 eyes of that agent and those agents 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.400
 the window opens what is there sir 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.400
 I say I have no light on my bike 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.499
 so she said those steps with a sizzler 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.180
 but I had learned my lesson 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.950
 until I am indeed recently in 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.629
 Amsterdam it went so terrible 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.920
 fast i indeed had no light on my 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.859
 bike it had appeared was suddenly 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.069
 dark and before I could think of anything 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.689
 I stand still with a cop next to me and me 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.909
 do leave now but honest 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:21.310
 so I take the hand of that agent now say 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.669
 thank you Mr. Agent for the fact 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.989
 that you saved my life 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.519
 Thank you for having this 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.780
 dead man's ride 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.780
 has been able to draw a conclusion 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.290
 because because without your firm intervention 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.240
 I would not have stood here now 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.500
 well I give you a no then you only 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.210
 back when I was allowed one more thing 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.890
 say thanks also on behalf of that 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.120
 truck driver who drives it away 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.710
 because he had not seen me 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.910
 probably 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.800
 and who might not have been at fault either 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.410
 but who also live very well from the 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.330
 images that saw it in front of one 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.930
 moment my bike to its feeder 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.140
 appears 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.459
 disappeared thank you so much at that moment 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.040
 just give your agent a ticket 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:04.150
 writing that to myself I am I 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.000
 then not been clear so just that 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.250
 start writing it and I see 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.709
 known then enter the amount what he 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.230
 gotta go pay and not me 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.720
 say before you will now enter a penalty 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.989
 I know you do n't have a reward 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.700
 high enough of gratitude too 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.340
 show that I am full for being the 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.550
 air still like a spring did your domain 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.230
 lands and that man just fills 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.340
 an amount in shoots but forgive me 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.200
 that fine and I am perplexed and the coming 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.090
 something from my work with me 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.740
 so ashamed with apparently also in me 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.210
 I'm literally against the cop 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.210
 said to catch the crooks 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.200
 minute yes well yes i was so nice 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.490
 been and 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.800
 and i think later i also sit 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.990
 Ideas of knowing I know HC there 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.820
 is not one I can put here for that 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.530
 there a criminal cannot imagine 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.230
 was fully arrested and that 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.610
 hollow leather said to catch some crooks 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:08.270
 is going to get people out there without it 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:10.690
 light through the city is sometimes no 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.690
 life 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.589
 which
