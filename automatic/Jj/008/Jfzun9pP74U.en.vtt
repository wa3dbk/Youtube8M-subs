you<00:00:08.580> can<00:00:08.849> take<00:00:09.570> some<00:00:09.809> robots<00:00:10.200> take<00:00:10.769> some<00:00:11.010> smart

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
you can take some robots take some smart

people<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.820> engineers<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.630> make<00:00:13.259> something

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
people and engineers and make something

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.499 
people and engineers and make something
really<00:00:14.190> nice<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.940> work<00:00:15.059> quickly<00:00:15.269> and

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
really nice and work quickly and

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.560 
really nice and work quickly and
efficiently<00:00:17.090> especially<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> multi

efficiently especially in the multi
robot<00:00:18.869> space<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:20.160> problem<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.939> doesn't

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
robot space the problem is that doesn't

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.070 
robot space the problem is that doesn't
generalize<00:00:22.230> well<00:00:22.789> so<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:23.939> suppose<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.779> got

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
generalize well so if suppose you got

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140 
generalize well so if suppose you got
two<00:00:25.320> robots<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.949> coordinate<00:00:26.369> very<00:00:26.580> well<00:00:26.849> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
two robots that coordinate very well and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.960 
two robots that coordinate very well and
do<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.420> whole<00:00:27.480> thing<00:00:27.660> very<00:00:28.230> nicely<00:00:28.970> maybe

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
do this whole thing very nicely maybe

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.150 
do this whole thing very nicely maybe
add<00:00:30.179> another<00:00:30.420> robot<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.560> whole<00:00:31.710> plan<00:00:31.980> will

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
add another robot the whole plan will

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.389 
add another robot the whole plan will
break<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.270> work<00:00:33.570> tries<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.440> pose<00:00:35.190> the

break and this work tries to pose the
problem<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.180> more<00:00:36.329> general<00:00:36.570> framework<00:00:36.989> that

problem in a more general framework that
given<00:00:38.610> what<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.180> call<00:00:39.360> macro<00:00:39.660> actions<00:00:40.290> you

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
given what we call macro actions you

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.729 
given what we call macro actions you
could<00:00:41.129> use<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.820> planner<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.559> go

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
could use the planner that we have to go

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.310 
could use the planner that we have to go
out<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:43.920> solve<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.340> problem<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.780> an

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
out and solve a problem so this was an

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.380 
out and solve a problem so this was an
instance<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.280> multi<00:00:47.610> agent<00:00:47.940> planning

and<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.079> also<00:00:52.230> had<00:00:52.559> two<00:00:52.770> turtle<00:00:53.280> BOTS<00:00:53.489> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and then we also had two turtle BOTS and

you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:12.030> try<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.560> reduce<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.920> problem<00:01:14.369> is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you can try to reduce the problem is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.749 
you can try to reduce the problem is
using<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.210> are<00:01:15.240> called<00:01:15.330> macro<00:01:15.869> actions<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
using what are called macro actions and

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.820 
using what are called macro actions and
the<00:01:17.759> macro<00:01:18.180> actions<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.380> described

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the macro actions they can be described

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.280 
the macro actions they can be described
in<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.220> general<00:01:21.119> way<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:22.080> their

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
in a general way of just like what their

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.399 
in a general way of just like what their
effects<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.119> when<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
effects are and so when you do that you

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.010 
effects are and so when you do that you
can<00:01:25.590> cover<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.670> lot<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.000> details<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.780> trying

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
can cover up a lot of details and trying

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140 
can cover up a lot of details and trying
to<00:01:28.320> coordinate<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.070> behavior<00:01:29.640> between<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
to coordinate the behavior between the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.149 
to coordinate the behavior between the
robots<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.780> would<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.590> say<00:01:31.650> okay

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
robots you would like to just say okay

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.580 
robots you would like to just say okay
that<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> everyone<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.470> get

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
that one go to everyone and that one get

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.590 
that one go to everyone and that one get
a<00:01:34.619> drink<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.189> don't<00:01:35.970> want<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> actually<00:01:36.360> be

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
a drink you don't want to actually be

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.569 
a drink you don't want to actually be
thinking<00:01:36.810> about<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.409> navigation<00:01:38.040> problems

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
thinking about the navigation problems

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.910 
thinking about the navigation problems
the<00:01:39.150> turtle<00:01:39.810> BOTS<00:01:40.079> started<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.829> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the turtle BOTS started out in a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.190 
the turtle BOTS started out in a
location<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:42.270> immediately<00:01:42.540> looked<00:01:42.960> at

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
location and they immediately looked at

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200 
location and they immediately looked at
what<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.070> should<00:01:44.250> do<00:01:44.399> from<00:01:44.759> there<00:01:44.970> like

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
what they should do from there like

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.359 
what they should do from there like
what's<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> macro<00:01:45.930> action<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:47.040> would<00:01:47.159> go

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
what's the macro action so it would go

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219 
what's the macro action so it would go
inside<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.700> room<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.149> ask<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> want

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
inside a room and ask like do you want

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.880 
inside a room and ask like do you want
to<00:01:49.350> order<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.590> drink

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
to order a drink

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.149 
to order a drink
the<00:01:52.890> student<00:01:53.430> had<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:54.060> say<00:01:54.450> yes<00:01:54.689> by<00:01:55.159> toggling

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the student had to say yes by toggling

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.560 
the student had to say yes by toggling
the<00:01:56.490> button

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the button

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.960 
the button
if<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.200> didn't<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:59.040> turtlebot<00:01:59.550> assumed

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
if they didn't the turtlebot assumed

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.880 
if they didn't the turtlebot assumed
they<00:02:00.360> did<00:02:00.510> not<00:02:00.600> want<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.900> drink<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.650> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
they did not want to drink so the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.650 
they did not want to drink so the
observation<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.700> would<00:02:02.790> get<00:02:02.940> inside<00:02:03.330> of<00:02:03.480> room

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
would be I'm in this room and there's a

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.530 
would be I'm in this room and there's a
drink<00:02:07.800> order<00:02:08.010> or<00:02:08.369> there's<00:02:08.640> not<00:02:08.790> a<00:02:08.850> drink<00:02:09.090> order

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.800 
drink order or there's not a drink order
if<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.470> turtlebot<00:02:11.130> went<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:11.940> pr2<00:02:12.210> and<00:02:12.690> got

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
if the turtlebot went to the pr2 and got

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.170 
if the turtlebot went to the pr2 and got
a<00:02:12.840> drink<00:02:13.320> it's<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:14.040> new<00:02:14.160> observation<00:02:14.520> would<00:02:15.030> be

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
a drink it's a new observation would be

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.630 
a drink it's a new observation would be
that<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.540> holding<00:02:15.750> good<00:02:16.170> drink<00:02:16.410> if<00:02:17.160> both<00:02:17.610> of

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
that it's holding good drink if both of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.000 
that it's holding good drink if both of
the<00:02:17.970> robots<00:02:18.390> were<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.990> bar<00:02:19.200> that's<00:02:19.710> when

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the robots were in the bar that's when

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.100 
the robots were in the bar that's when
they<00:02:20.220> had<00:02:20.460> that<00:02:20.790> limited<00:02:21.270> communication

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
they had that limited communication

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.770 
they had that limited communication
where<00:02:22.380> they<00:02:22.560> could<00:02:22.860> detect<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.760> one<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
where they could detect if one of the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.350 
where they could detect if one of the
turtle<00:02:25.470> BOTS<00:02:25.650> was<00:02:26.010> being<00:02:26.310> served<00:02:26.670> by<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:26.970> pr2

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
turtle BOTS was being served by the pr2

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.810 
turtle BOTS was being served by the pr2
and<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.530> was<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.740> case<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.610> would

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
and so if that was the case they would

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.810 
and so if that was the case they would
go<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.360> do<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.630> different<00:02:31.080> macro<00:02:31.410> action

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
go and do a different macro action

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.030 
go and do a different macro action
there's<00:02:32.820> two<00:02:33.240> phases<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.200> process<00:02:34.740> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
there's two phases in this process the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.440 
there's two phases in this process the
first<00:02:35.250> part<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.700> offline

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
first part is offline

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.050 
first part is offline
and<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.620> offline<00:02:38.040> process<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.880> are

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and in the offline process you are

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.800 
and in the offline process you are
thinking<00:02:39.480> about<00:02:39.980> all<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.040> these<00:02:41.510> problems<00:02:42.510> of

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
thinking about all of these problems of

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.110 
thinking about all of these problems of
how<00:02:43.170> are<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.380> going<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.920> get<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.490> robots<00:02:44.820> to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
how are you going to get the robots to

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.780 
how are you going to get the robots to
coordinate<00:02:45.750> their<00:02:46.170> actions<00:02:46.530> given<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.490> you

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
coordinate their actions given that you

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
coordinate their actions given that you
know<00:02:47.940> they<00:02:48.120> won't<00:02:48.300> be<00:02:48.420> able<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.630> communicate

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
know they won't be able to communicate

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.710 
know they won't be able to communicate
all<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.530> time<00:02:50.030> given<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.300> know<00:02:51.330> they

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
all the time given that you know they

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.830 
all the time given that you know they
won't<00:02:52.020> have<00:02:53.240> knowledge<00:02:54.240> about<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.660> whole

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
won't have knowledge about the whole

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.020 
won't have knowledge about the whole
world<00:02:55.140> where<00:02:55.530> other<00:02:55.710> robots<00:02:56.220> are<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.670> when

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
world where other robots are so when

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.090 
world where other robots are so when
you're<00:02:57.210> creating<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:58.050> plan<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.560> each<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:58.770> the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
you're creating a plan for each of the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.760 
you're creating a plan for each of the
robots<00:02:59.460> to<00:02:59.580> be<00:02:59.610> running<00:03:00.090> individually<00:03:00.930> that's

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
robots to be running individually that's

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.230 
robots to be running individually that's
when<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.130> reason<00:03:02.520> about<00:03:02.700> all<00:03:02.850> these<00:03:03.000> things

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
when you reason about all these things

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.170 
when you reason about all these things
and<00:03:03.600> then<00:03:04.200> when<00:03:04.740> you're<00:03:04.860> actually<00:03:05.180> executing

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
and then when you're actually executing

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.420 
and then when you're actually executing
these<00:03:06.630> controllers<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.890> don't<00:03:08.070> think<00:03:08.250> about

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
these controllers you don't think about

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.620 
these controllers you don't think about
any<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.790> those<00:03:09.030> sort<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.600> things

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
any of those sort of things

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.010 
any of those sort of things
you

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020
