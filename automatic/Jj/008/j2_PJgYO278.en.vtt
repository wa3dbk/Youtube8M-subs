00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:09.110
 the girls do not cheer up again here 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.429
 as they see me I'm with my hairstyle with the 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.309
 braids that is the style of the hairstyle 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.380
 recently washed and today I want to show you a 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.450
 trick that is so tricky but 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.470
 I want to share 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.750
 today's topic will be what to do when 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.490
 the braided hair begins to be 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.940
 stop or that the reference is 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.070
 they start to look ugly 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.380
 you here see me say the hair 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.380
 settled but really look 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.250
 if they can see how it is already disheveled 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.750
 the question that's to do here them 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.750
 I command the style of my braids first 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.330
 as you reach to see stretching 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.220
 for to one side then quickly 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.860
 what I'm going to do is throw less for 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.460
 the side and that is following the form of 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.410
 my hair is nothing extraordinary 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.120
 but it works for me look at these 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.120
 hats that are already coming out 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.340
 previously I have thrown water but I did not 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.560
 is going to throw more because I already washed the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.420
 hair today I'm going to use my scarf 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.420
 and I'm going to put it as tight as possible 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.470
 as tight as they can 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.470
 obviously without stagnating the salt 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:09.590
 in this way I thus prolonged a 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.360
 week plus my hairstyle and I avoid being 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.150
 removing the hairstyle by changing the hairstyle 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.450
 no need as you can see is 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.820
 a simple way to wear your hair and 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.690
 more when you have it freshly washed 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.250
 we know that we sprinkle us 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.450
 stop the hairs that have grown 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.610
 that have gone, let's say, revealing against 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.990
 the normal braiding that the hair carries 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.770
 it's a simple style and you can go out 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.950
 Well, if you want it, obviously I'm going to 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.950
 do 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.470
 this is the part of my hair like 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.820
 you can see it is fine 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.700
 analyzed yet but it is this trick 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.400
 I bring you so I avoided that hair 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.200
 it is embargo and once you have already 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.860
 enough time 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.030
 his hair is obviously crushed and already 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.910
 is your hairstyle again very well this 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.459
 I do it every night so I eat 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.200
 and the braids are so advanced already 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.860
 is watching the paradito there in the hair 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.720
 but I'm doing very well then that was my 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.720
 trick until the next
