00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 after the fifth snowstorm 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.910
 Tuesday snow on you and such 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.670
 had a thickness of 55 centimeters in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.280
 Friday the snow continues to listen and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.949
 many more inches fell look there 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.210
 so it went like hell, right? 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.720
 now digital snow has 84 1 at 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.740
 underline here 84 centimeters of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.349
 thickness 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.929
 How many inches of snow fell in the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.669
 Friday also wants to know only in the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.110
 friday when inches of snow 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.870
 they fell and here 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.700
 in this diagram he gives me a drawing 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.190
 this situation here we can 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.629
 check that in this rule the 55 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.899
 centimeters are here 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.219
 then this is going to be the thickness of the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.780
 snow that fell on Thursday the 55 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.199
 centimeters here 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.629
 It's 55 centimeters from here. 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.530
 only the snow after Thursday does not 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.989
 stopped falling 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.570
 she continued to fall and informed her 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.210
 new thickness here and there how many 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.610
 centimeters grew the thickness of snow 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.490
 from Thursday to Friday 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.200
 realize that 84 centimeters was how much 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.130
 I had snow there on Friday then 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.640
 here o 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.549
 At this point our ruler will be 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.390
 exactly where is the 84 centimeters 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.259
 of snow 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.180
 all this here is 84 centimeters and there 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.020
 How many inches of snow fell in the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.900
 friday 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.970
 Let's arraign this scheme mathematically. 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.630
 that looks only then on Thursday were 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.570
 55 cm and then on Friday 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.369
 that amount dropped here that I do not know 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.340
 that when I add these two 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.189
 quantities that give it 84 yes or no soon 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.210
 I came back here 55 centimeters fell in the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.540
 Thursday 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.820
 together with that interrogation there 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.990
 I do not know how much this here has to 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.250
 be equal to 84 centimeters in total 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.840
 snow thickness 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.420
 and now how do I find out this 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.459
 here is enough to subtract 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.920
 just make 84 - 55 that I will have this 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.050
 number that I need to add to 55 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.590
 to get 84 is a 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.490
 It's soon what I'm going to do here is going to be 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.250
 84 - that 55 centimeters and there I go 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.140
 result in the interrogation that 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.880
 It's exactly what I want to know. 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.760
 that the question is equal to a certain 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:36.000
 value here and now as 84 years to 55 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.400
 let's set up the account 84 - 55 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.820
 About an hour here is the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.450
 following O 14 is less than the rather agree 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.490
 with me 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.920
 make the color of the interrogation here 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.810
 people have the answer in the right color 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.730
 then 4 smaller than 5 I have to do the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.340
 that I have to ask for a dozen 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.040
 here 18 and here eight are here 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.200
 then it will be worth seven tens 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.220
 while that 4 a dozen will add 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.350
 10 units there and I came back then 14 14 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.040
 -5 Now I can do the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.000
 subtraction 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.810
 14 - five to nine right and seven 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.930
 dozens 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.760
 - five tens will give two tens I 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:21.239
 I'm going to have this piece here soon. 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.140
 took only this Friday 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.239
 bit here is worth 29 centimeters 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.610
 beauty then place the question here 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.950
 I can put the 29 and then I know that 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.090
 this account is really true 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.080
 being a sentence in the subject 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.600
 true 55 plus 29 actually equals 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.920
 84 in problems like this one is very 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.470
 important that you imagine the situation 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.020
 to put yourself in the place there 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.209
 situation and can then contextualize 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.000
 better in your mind what should be done 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.100
 so you have this picture in your 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.110
 mind you can draw a diagram 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.670
 if the problem does not draw for you 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.020
 in this case that has already been designed but 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.300
 If you did not come, you could draw a 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.880
 terminal in his mind and then mount a 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.440
 mathematical sentence that in this case here 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.260
 O because it has an unknown value a 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.989
 is also called the equation 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.970
 something like the other is an equation 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.739
 and then you can figure out the value 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.560
 that this unknown unknown value 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.239
 here then in the case of 29 and that is the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.489
 answer here for how much snow 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.030
 which fell on Friday until the next 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.030
