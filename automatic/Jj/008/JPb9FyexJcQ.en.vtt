like<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.580> might<00:04:08.760> see<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.030> somebody's<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.890> so

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
like you might see on somebody's and so

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.400 
like you might see on somebody's and so
the<00:04:11.340> customer<00:04:11.760> can<00:04:11.790> actually<00:04:12.210> come<00:04:12.420> along<00:04:12.690> and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
the customer can actually come along and

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.460 
the customer can actually come along and
see<00:04:13.860> how<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:15.240> alternator<00:04:15.600> supplies<00:04:16.110> the

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
see how the alternator supplies the

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.610 
see how the alternator supplies the
voltage<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.880> amperage<00:04:18.300> in<00:04:18.900> response<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.470> the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
loads right now we have no loads on so

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.690 
loads right now we have no loads on so
it's<00:04:21.959> only<00:04:22.140> about<00:04:22.470> 10<00:04:22.830> amps<00:04:23.130> or<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:23.400> just

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
it's only about 10 amps or so just

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.880 
it's only about 10 amps or so just
