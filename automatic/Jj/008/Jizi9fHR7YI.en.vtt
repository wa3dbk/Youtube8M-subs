00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.060

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.130
 to do a little bit like me the day 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.830
 where I came across the maps of 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:55.599
 pokemon these cards belonged to my 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:59.320
 nephew and I'm his godmother you see her 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:01.449
 godmother of baptism then between 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.710
 parentheses if you're not baptized but 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:03.849
 maybe it's time to go 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.229
 meet the priest in the church 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.229
 catholic to ask for baptism 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.560
 so I propose to do as I do 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.740
 that is, tearing it up and then throwing it 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.169
 all pokemon cards me my 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.729
 attention was of course of all 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.880
 throw in the trash so that 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:28.510
 my nephew can no longer be affected 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.000
 by the powers of these cards during a 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.350
 day I led him to confession and 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.700
 since is much better 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.160
 so I suggest you do the same 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.500
 jesus thing you know it's him 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.360
 simply hidden behind the priest is 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.910
 agree with all his daddy love 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.070
 to take all the errors of voice 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:49.070
 maybe you see on him he wants you 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:52.130
 I had it really deep and released me 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:55.730

00:06:52.130 --> 00:07:00.530
