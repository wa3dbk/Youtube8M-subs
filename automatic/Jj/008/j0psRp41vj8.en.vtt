another<00:00:30.349> basically<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> 20<00:00:31.890> lights<00:00:32.040> up

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
another basically that the 20 lights up

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.760 
another basically that the 20 lights up
and<00:00:32.460> then<00:00:32.840> gives<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> sound<00:00:34.290> effects<00:00:34.680> and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and then gives you a sound effects and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.850 
and then gives you a sound effects and
whatnot<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.870> which<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> not<00:00:37.170> saying<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.680> want

to do right now so let me go ahead do
this<00:00:39.960> what<00:00:40.620> we're<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:40.949> is<00:00:41.070> actually

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
this what we're going to do is actually

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.070 
this what we're going to do is actually
take<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.610> apart<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.300> I've<00:00:42.629> already<00:00:42.840> actually

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
take this apart so I've already actually

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.509 
take this apart so I've already actually
taken<00:00:43.410> apart<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.830> was<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.949> wrist<00:00:44.160> strap<00:00:44.220> that

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
taken apart there was a wrist strap that

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.009 
taken apart there was a wrist strap that
goes<00:00:44.640> across<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.030> back<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.290> hand<00:00:46.559> so

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
goes across the back for your hand so

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.150 
goes across the back for your hand so
that's<00:00:49.019> already<00:00:49.199> been<00:00:49.379> taken<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.830> so<00:00:50.070> I'm

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
that's already been taken out so I'm

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.650 
that's already been taken out so I'm
going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> take<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.580> screw<00:00:51.089> at<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.269> bottom

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
going to take the screw at the bottom

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.110 
going to take the screw at the bottom
there's<00:00:51.989> three<00:00:52.489> triple<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.550> batteries<00:00:53.970> in

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
there's three triple a batteries in

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.979 
there's three triple a batteries in
there<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> technically<00:00:55.829> we're<00:00:56.070> getting<00:00:56.989> prob

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
there so technically we're getting prob

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.530 
there so technically we're getting prob
about<00:00:58.110> three<00:00:58.440> volts<00:00:58.769> so<00:00:59.580> the<00:00:59.670> entire<00:00:59.940> unit

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.230 

take<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.659> out<00:01:03.839> about<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> battery<00:01:05.240> from

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
take that out about the battery from

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.180 
take that out about the battery from
aside<00:01:06.600> there's<00:01:06.810> screws<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.650> here<00:01:07.890> here

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
aside there's screws here here here here

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.050 
aside there's screws here here here here
here<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.030> then<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> top<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:11.060> go

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
here here and then one at the top so go

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.910 
here here and then one at the top so go
ahead<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.570> take<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.930> apart<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.920> you'll

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
ahead and take this apart and you'll

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.370 
ahead and take this apart and you'll
notice<00:01:17.189> there's<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.490> speaker<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> inside

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
notice there's a speaker on the inside

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.480 
notice there's a speaker on the inside
and<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.710> ahead<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.860> pry<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.310> in

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
and I can go ahead and pry that out in

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.800 
and I can go ahead and pry that out in
the<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:20.760> in<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.880> second<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:22.290> top<00:01:26.810> that's

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the here in a second and the top that's

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.420 
the here in a second and the top that's
where<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> button<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.890> far<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.189> took<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
where the button is so far just took the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.680 
where the button is so far just took the
batteries<00:01:29.729> back<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.180> thing<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:30.480> still

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
batteries back in this thing that still

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:52.720 
batteries back in this thing that still
work<00:01:31.070> see

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.420 

there<00:01:53.730> we<00:01:53.910> go<00:01:57.650> so<00:01:58.650> there's<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> three<00:01:59.190> different

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
there we go so there's a three different

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:09.680 
there we go so there's a three different
sound<00:01:59.610> effects<00:02:07.759> so<00:02:08.759> what<00:02:09.300> I'm<00:02:09.420> planning<00:02:09.570> on

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
sound effects so what I'm planning on

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.240 
sound effects so what I'm planning on
doing<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:10.020> actually<00:02:10.140> removing<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> speaker

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
doing is actually removing the speaker

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.110 
doing is actually removing the speaker
here<00:02:11.400> putting<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.209> larger<00:02:12.480> speaker

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
here putting in a larger speaker

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.370 
here putting in a larger speaker
disconnecting<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.300> battery<00:02:15.540> lead<00:02:15.959> here<00:02:16.200> and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
disconnecting the battery lead here and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.220 
disconnecting the battery lead here and
then<00:02:16.950> actually<00:02:17.100> putting<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.730> 3<00:02:18.630> volt<00:02:18.840> battery

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
then actually putting a 3 volt battery

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.520 
then actually putting a 3 volt battery
pack<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.920> there<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.790> then<00:02:21.000> removing<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.290> and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
pack in there and then removing this and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.770 
pack in there and then removing this and
I'm<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.770> take<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.070> multimeter<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.000> test

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
I'm going to take a multimeter and test

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.720 
I'm going to take a multimeter and test
the<00:02:24.900> voltage<00:02:25.050> on<00:02:25.560> how<00:02:25.890> much<00:02:26.040> voltage<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.520> going

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
the voltage on how much voltage is going

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.490 
the voltage on how much voltage is going
to<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.910> LED<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:27.900> set<00:02:28.080> up<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.260> ray<00:02:28.470> that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
to the LED and that's set up a ray that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.729 
to the LED and that's set up a ray that
goes<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.100> out<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:30.120> outside<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:31.320> what

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
goes on the out on the outside so what

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.330 
goes on the out on the outside so what
we'll<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.430> three<00:02:33.030> or<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.900> few<00:02:34.800> LEDs<00:02:34.950> on

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
we'll have is is three or a few LEDs on

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.979 
we'll have is is three or a few LEDs on
the<00:02:35.430> outside<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.000> then<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.480> will<00:02:36.660> control

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
the outside and then this will control

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.870 
the outside and then this will control
another<00:02:37.200> set<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:37.739> it'll<00:02:37.950> turn<00:02:38.250> brighter<00:02:38.580> and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
another set so it'll turn brighter and

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.810 
another set so it'll turn brighter and
then<00:02:39.570> once<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.320> sound<00:02:41.010> effects<00:02:41.250> go<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.610> and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
then once the sound effects go on and

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.050 
then once the sound effects go on and
then<00:02:42.330> turn<00:02:42.510> off<00:02:42.630> it'll<00:02:42.989> go<00:02:43.110> back<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.440> normal

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
then turn off it'll go back to normal

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.560 
then turn off it'll go back to normal
repulsor<00:02:45.470> light<00:02:46.470> strength<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.430> as<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.480> can

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
repulsor light strength so as you can

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.420 
repulsor light strength so as you can
see<00:02:48.780> here<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:50.160> palm<00:02:51.950> really<00:02:52.950> doesn't<00:02:53.280> have

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
see here the palm really doesn't have

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.259 
see here the palm really doesn't have
too<00:02:53.850> much<00:02:54.000> space<00:02:54.300> into<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.890> sides<00:02:56.269> or

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
too much space into it on the sides or

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.670 
too much space into it on the sides or
even<00:02:57.570> at<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.720> bottom<00:02:58.049> and<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:01.260> I'm<00:03:01.410> going<00:03:01.620> to

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
even at the bottom and so I'm going to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.380 
even at the bottom and so I'm going to
have<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.860> create<00:03:02.220> something<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.850> goes<00:03:03.090> down

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
have to create something that goes down

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.930 
have to create something that goes down
to<00:03:03.540> about<00:03:03.660> here<00:03:04.100> with<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.190> battery<00:03:05.489> pack<00:03:05.519> here

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
to about here with the battery pack here

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.699 
to about here with the battery pack here
or<00:03:06.090> maybe<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.510> back<00:03:06.690> or<00:03:06.959> something<00:03:07.590> that

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
or maybe on the back or something that

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.050 
or maybe on the back or something that
we<00:03:07.769> would<00:03:07.830> go<00:03:07.950> for<00:03:08.250> further<00:03:08.459> into<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.820> forearm

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
we would go for further into the forearm

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.970 
we would go for further into the forearm
so<00:03:09.510> there's<00:03:10.290> going<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.500> be<00:03:10.530> quite<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.769> bit<00:03:10.920> of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
so there's going to be quite a bit of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.000 
so there's going to be quite a bit of
engineering<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.700> need<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.360> done<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.660> this

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
engineering that need to be done to this

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.470 
engineering that need to be done to this
but<00:03:15.380> this<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.440> part<00:03:16.769> 1<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.220> series<00:03:18.060> on<00:03:18.360> how

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
but this is part 1 of the series on how

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.680 
but this is part 1 of the series on how
to<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.560> stay<00:03:20.010> tuned<00:03:20.190> guys<00:03:20.690> start

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
to do that so stay tuned guys start

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.630 
to do that so stay tuned guys start
trying<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.500> figure<00:03:22.680> out<00:03:22.709> values<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.370> whatnot

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
trying to figure out values and whatnot

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.600 
trying to figure out values and whatnot
we'll<00:03:23.820> come<00:03:23.970> back<00:03:24.120> with<00:03:24.299> another<00:03:24.630> video<00:03:24.930> soon

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
we'll come back with another video soon
