00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.050
 in a world dominated by android 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.240
 So the swu windows phone is difficult. 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.429
 imagine that one day black berry was once 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.080
 synonymous with what was most modern in 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.510
 terms of mobility 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.170
 however with the launch of blackberry 10 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.880
 the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.109
 the company seems willing to try 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.820
 to make up for lost time on account of 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.949
 launch of the c 10 model 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.170
 We also analyze the details of the new 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.329
 version of black's operating system 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.829
 berry that should be going forward 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.690
 in the new smartphone models 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.579
 presented by the company 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.020
 check out what our impressions were 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.570
 in this complete analysis with visual 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.129
 completely renovated the black berry 10 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.379
 west has a nice interface 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.020
 is organized 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.510
 the home screen does not display only the date 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.239
 including alerts and alerts. 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.850
 notifications and a shortcut to the camera 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.010
 just press the icon 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.790
 three seconds something practical but that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.380
 could be faster 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.659
 internally the icons gained a 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.790
 visual best worked and are displayed 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.180
 in small rectangles that includes the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.369
 respective name to reorder the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.900
 keep one pressed and drag 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.659
 Wherever you want 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.430
 the same way to delete an icon 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.430
 just click the trash symbol 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.329
 there is no quick access list for 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.880
 your favorite programs with icons 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.340
 fixed and every new screen all apps 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.490
 are renewed 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.710
 just as there is no support for idd 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 and ordering the elements 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.240
 obligatorily follows the order 16 apps 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.140
 per page just to create folders 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.320
 overlay two icons there is no button 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.000
 physical back on the Blackberry 10 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.369
 because of this the company decided 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.229
 bet on a new method to get out of 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.360
 applications and return to the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.549
 main application within a 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.829
 application you should slide your fingers 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.149
 below for the IMF to be 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.640
 minimized 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.099
 then slide to the right side 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.500
 to get access to your list of apps or 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.440
 left side for quick access 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.750
 black berry rambi this technique can 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.790
 confusing at times in 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.860
 especially in games when the gesture of 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.280
 slide from the bottom up can 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.130
 confuse with the game command 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.890
 the black bee vang works like the heart 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.480
 of the operating system is through it 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.120
 that you have access to all your 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.880
 messages and emails and notifications of 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.709
 social networks in an orderly fashion 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.140
 the system allows easy management 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.660
 content requiring few steps 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.820
 for configuration 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.290
 access is made only by sliding the 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.500
 finger right 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.360
 But not everything is perfect and in the case of 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.730
 for example to delete a 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.830
 message you must enter each one 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.790
 since there is no option for exclusion 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.860
 in large scale 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.360
 This can make it pretty hard 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.670
 The task of the recipient of many messages is 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.890
 can compose messages for any 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.930
 one of the compatible applications from 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.400
 of black rubby which makes the process 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.920
 simplified 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.690
 visually pleasing 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.590
 everything that goes on in your accounts 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.239
 looking at a single screen one of the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.880
 the black berry symbols has always been the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.230
 physical keyboard of the devices for the 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.910
 block bm s 10 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.110
 the company tried to maintain the same 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.840
 experience of using a device 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.239
 physical but virtual 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.209
 the result is undeniably enough 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.370
 satisfactory 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.620
 the keys are spaced apart and the 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.739
 smart way to learn from your 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.630
 typing in many words 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.040
 They are suggested in order to complete 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.900
 automatic your typing 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.390
 these suggestions are displayed in the middle of the 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.829
 keyboard just above the next letter 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.910
 possibly typed 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.739
 certainly the keyboard layout 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.120
 offered by black berry is among the 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.880
 better when compared to others 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.320
 operating systems making this a 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.150
 interesting product differential 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.359
 nothing but the basics is offered on the block 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.040
 bms when the subject is voice command 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.380
 access to it requires 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.320
 press the microphone key on the keyboard 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.010
 a new screen will open enabling the 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.140
 voice commands 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.300
 only simple functions are supported 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.850
 how to make calls to a contact from the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.850
 agenda annotate reminders or send sms 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.240
 another possibility is to do 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.890
 internet searches 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.110
 for this the operating system 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.570
 integrated with the bing search engine 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.460
 showing results similar to those 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.740
 can be found in one that glasses 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.130
 phone that uses the same 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.130
 structure 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.760
 the camera won a virtual button 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.550
 located in the lower corner of the 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.130
 apps page features featured 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.320
 it does not go beyond the basics is 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.050
 possible to choose the appearance of the photo 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.600
 lighting mode whether or not flash is used 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.030
 and the type of focus to hit a photo 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.880
 just click anywhere on the screen 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.730
 similarly switch between camera 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.710
 front and back is a simple task 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.990
 in the case of video there are options of 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.010
 image stabilization and recording 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.900
 720p and 1080p 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.300
 the initial application package 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.080
 offered by bel is if you do not 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.540
 Wish 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.790
 there are at least 30 pre-installed items 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.900
 which cover the main needs of the 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.510
 consumer 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.640
 some deserve a certain highlight as is the 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.690
 cior browser form case 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.690
 native support flash 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.490
 unfortunately there is no way to save 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.500
 content to read later or access 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.430
 some page previously viewed when 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.590
 you are offline compass calculator 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.800
 and watch have visuals with a line 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.250
 unique design very beautiful by the way the 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.980
 The map system used is bing 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.560
 Finally, another attraction of the system is 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.690
 bbm the messaging system between 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.410
 blackberry devices that includes 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.390
 voice and video chat features 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.280
 the blackberry app store and 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.810
 is not as vast as the versions of 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.520
 android is the 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.530
 even windows phone offers 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.450
 more interesting features 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.310
 however there are a good number of 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.070
 applications but what can disappoint 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.260
 consumers is the fact that much of the 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.690
 that there is paid 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.390
 killer apps missing programs that 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.730
 really make the difference in the device 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.010
 many applications are adapted from 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.270
 other versions and I'm in the visual 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.880
 bec bell s 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.310
 however find content in the store 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.960
 apps is not a difficult task and if the 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.820
 that you are looking for is available 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.220
 accessing the content will be a 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.020
 simple 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.940
 it is undeniable that the renewal by which 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.460
 black brs passed made the system 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.190
 attractive and able to fight equally 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.830
 same in the market a new virtual keyboard 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.170
 is among the best available and the 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.400
 beautiful and elegant look can do with 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.050
 that the appliance regains its prestige 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.050
 with the most demanding public 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.020
 however much improvement will have to be 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.930
 thing 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.880
 the voice commands practically 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:31.070
 there are no apps that actually do the 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.870
 difference in favor of the number of 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.300
 free apps is limited 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.640
 account should also be taken of the 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.610
 low quality of many apps tailored 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.530
 from other versions 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.270
 for those who thought the black bee west 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.030
 was dead we can say 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:50.150
 categorically that it is not 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:52.700
 otherwise renewed it resurfaces 

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.530
 promising and if evolution is maintained 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.600
 we may have back in the fray a 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.070
 competitor of weight in the next two 

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.590
 years 

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:03.880
 complete analysis of the world and
