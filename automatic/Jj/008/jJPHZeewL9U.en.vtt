00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
lipstick method is is that the emergency

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.560 
lipstick method is is that the emergency
of<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.930> liquid<00:01:09.320> of<00:01:09.980> the<00:01:10.250> lipstick<00:01:11.210> because

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
of the liquid of the lipstick because

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.720 
of the liquid of the lipstick because
what<00:01:11.780> can<00:01:11.930> happen<00:01:11.990> is<00:01:12.410> a<00:01:12.650> lipstick<00:01:13.070> texture<00:01:13.610> is

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
what can happen is a lipstick texture is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.110 
what can happen is a lipstick texture is
so<00:01:13.910> very<00:01:14.150> different<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:16.310> concealer

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
so very different to that of a concealer

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.020 
so very different to that of a concealer
a<00:01:17.330> lipstick<00:01:18.110> is<00:01:18.230> more<00:01:18.440> amoliant<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:19.370> has<00:01:19.700> more

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
a lipstick is more amoliant it has more

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.210 
a lipstick is more amoliant it has more
room<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.330> travel<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.170> doesn't<00:01:21.440> stay<00:01:21.680> put<00:01:22.010> the

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
room to travel it doesn't stay put the

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.910 
room to travel it doesn't stay put the
same<00:01:22.460> way<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.660> I<00:01:23.990> hope<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.320> kind<00:01:24.710> of<00:01:24.770> makes

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
same way so I hope that kind of makes

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.320 
same way so I hope that kind of makes
sense<00:01:25.010> so<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:25.580> you've<00:01:25.730> got<00:01:25.760> something<00:01:26.180> there

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
sense so that you've got something there

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.970 
sense so that you've got something there
that's<00:01:26.480> definitely<00:01:26.960> going<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.590> move<00:01:27.800> around

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
that's definitely going to move around

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.800 
that's definitely going to move around
and<00:01:28.700> you're<00:01:29.000> then<00:01:29.180> going<00:01:29.300> to<00:01:29.390> apply<00:01:29.450> your

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
and you're then going to apply your

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.350 
and you're then going to apply your
concealer<00:01:30.020> over<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.030> which<00:01:32.030> theoretically

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
concealer over it which theoretically

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.900 
concealer over it which theoretically
should<00:01:32.870> set<00:01:33.260> it<00:01:33.290> but<00:01:33.710> often<00:01:33.920> times<00:01:34.340> it

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
should set it but often times it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.940 
should set it but often times it
wouldn't<00:01:35.300> set<00:01:35.480> it<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.720> same<00:01:35.930> way<00:01:36.170> because<00:01:36.410> of

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
wouldn't set it the same way because of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.100 
wouldn't set it the same way because of
that<00:01:37.130> emolia<00:01:37.550> see<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.630> course<00:01:38.840> if<00:01:38.990> you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
in fact the correctors are everywhere

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.680 
in fact the correctors are everywhere
and<00:01:57.560> for<00:01:58.220> that<00:01:58.340> reason<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.000> recommend<00:01:59.570> it

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
and for that reason I recommend it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.860 
and for that reason I recommend it
correct<00:02:00.370> over<00:02:01.370> using<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.360> product<00:02:02.630> like<00:02:02.750> a

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
correct over using a product like a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.450 
correct over using a product like a
lipstick<00:02:03.350> or<00:02:03.590> even<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:03.920> cream

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
lipstick or even a cream

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.109 
lipstick or even a cream
because<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.870> Molen<00:02:06.410> see<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.680> them<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:07.010> just

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
because the Molen see of them is just

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.969 
because the Molen see of them is just
oftentimes<00:02:08.119> too<00:02:08.539> gray<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.140> leads<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.710> too

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
oftentimes too gray and leads to too

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.220 
oftentimes too gray and leads to too
much<00:02:10.130> trouble<00:02:10.490> underneath<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.210> ice<00:02:11.330> however

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
much trouble underneath the ice however

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.710 
much trouble underneath the ice however
with<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:12.980> said<00:02:13.190> if<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.940> have<00:02:14.090> had<00:02:14.300> great

and can leave too much of a cast

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.699 
and can leave too much of a cast
underneath<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.270> skin<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.750> good<00:02:51.140> corrector

underneath the skin a good corrector

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.190 
underneath the skin a good corrector
will<00:02:52.340> correct<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.120> color<00:02:53.390> issue<00:02:53.750> without

give it a go you could theoretically
