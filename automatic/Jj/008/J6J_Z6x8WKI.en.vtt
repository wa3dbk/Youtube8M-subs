00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.380
 are few weeks will know the work seven points 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:14.739
 supposed to be responsible for the main expenses may be removed from the city 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.739
 from Sao Paulo 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.720
 a woman who claims that you've been painting since 94 started doing a portrait 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.890
 more traditional graphite 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.350
 but in what moment is that if the way was to get more tight 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.780
 so actually 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.630
 it was when I was already Africans 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.140
 two three years 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.620
 and then I started to look for another reference I as a graffiti artist chile 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.090
 he only knows 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.000
 already had other references of intentions 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.400
 if you also want a cpi gifts to session the dragons ct from the bar sling 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.900
 I drink 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.030
 the only office 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.420
 the trick 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.420
 the difference 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.290
 each time you try to portray cases of the sections that you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.160
 even in the case of an individual 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.250
 this figure is outlawed 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.380
 Another little bird that means that bc henrique meirelles I found 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 nobody 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.890
 it's paradox 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.540
 at the end of the same sex you can guess what 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.780
 can suddenly be painting a yew average car 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.170
 We are taking a second vote. 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.120
 but I prefer 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.120
 but for me 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.140
 you work people realize that the two sides of the coin but demanding that the side 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.670
 little 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.670
 the bad side actually 25km 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.939
 nothing is so good and nothing is so bad this quality even ddd good and evil in 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.020
 yes it's not inside me too 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 carlos bahia 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:14.989
 at this stage deserves great works with it paulo sp that its first 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.179
 exposure is bringing just the fancy phrase fanzine but they did it 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:21.559
 tomorrow 27 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.159
 notwithstanding sheltered location 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.439
 kleber and distribution 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.879
 there are estimates - there is a way to feel that you show your work 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.639
 a cheap thing gets us reference we have in mind 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.139
 a portion of do-it-yourself supports 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.939
 for confucius exposure in the second stage doing this year had to have a 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.689
 different parade explained funchal was the headquarters of the games is part of the story 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.569
 this is the fifth producer 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.309
 I'll do great defense. 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.309
 I decided to put it all there. 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.249
 venice by the hope that you decipher the exhibition of the planet 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:02.209
