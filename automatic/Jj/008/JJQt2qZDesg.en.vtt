removable<00:03:03.840> drives<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:05.100> I've<00:03:05.250> done<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.610> as

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
removable drives so I've done that as

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.720 
removable drives so I've done that as
well<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.930> that's<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.410> one<00:03:07.650> aspect<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.400> tweak

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
well so that's just one aspect of tweak

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.020 
well so that's just one aspect of tweak
UI<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.780> find<00:03:10.380> can<00:03:10.620> make<00:03:10.800> Windows<00:03:11.160> XP<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.670> lot

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
UI that I find can make Windows XP a lot

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.200 
UI that I find can make Windows XP a lot
more<00:03:12.210> usable

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.370 

and<00:03:16.300> just<00:03:16.990> very<00:03:17.200> quickly<00:03:17.530> look

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
and just very quickly look

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.590 
and just very quickly look
a couple<00:03:18.650> of<00:03:18.860> these<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.490> you<00:03:20.180> may<00:03:20.330> want<00:03:20.540> to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
a couple of these and you may want to

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.270 
a couple of these and you may want to
look<00:03:20.810> through<00:03:21.050> this<00:03:21.200> further<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.830> really

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
look through this further to really

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.940 
look through this further to really
customize<00:03:22.520> windows<00:03:23.270> if<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.600> wish<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.170> these

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
customize windows if you wish and these

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.890 
customize windows if you wish and these
aren't<00:03:25.220> really<00:03:25.580> about<00:03:25.760> optimizing<00:03:26.510> windows

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
aren't really about optimizing windows
