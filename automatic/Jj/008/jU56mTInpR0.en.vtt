wiper<00:02:21.610> motions<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.330> kind<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.780> rub<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.410> to

wiper motions to kind of rub that on to

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.130 
wiper motions to kind of rub that on to
that<00:02:24.490> white<00:02:24.820> base<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.750> white<00:02:25.900> base

that white base and the white base

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.560 
that white base and the white base
provides<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.770> really<00:02:27.130> good<00:02:27.310> canvas<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.420> it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
provides a really good canvas so it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.870 
provides a really good canvas so it
shows<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:29.140> lot<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.800> pigmented<00:02:30.460> yellow

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
towards the end of my brows and in her

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.560 
towards the end of my brows and in her
video<00:02:47.770> it's<00:02:48.070> quite<00:02:48.370> blended<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.120> her<00:02:49.210> colors

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
video it's quite blended and her colors

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.980 
video it's quite blended and her colors
are<00:02:49.750> always<00:02:50.200> in<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.920> very<00:02:51.160> gradient<00:02:51.850> kind<00:02:52.840> of

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
are always in a very gradient kind of

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.570 
are always in a very gradient kind of
effect<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.740> you're<00:02:53.890> going<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.130> want<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.430> use

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
effect so you're going to want to use

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.750 
effect so you're going to want to use
that<00:02:54.820> same<00:02:55.060> shade<00:02:55.450> or<00:02:55.630> brush<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.770> apply<00:02:57.220> that

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
that same shade or brush to apply that

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.210 
that same shade or brush to apply that
color<00:02:58.060> because<00:02:59.050> it's<00:02:59.200> really<00:02:59.590> dense<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:00.130> you

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
color because it's really dense and you

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.770 
color because it's really dense and you
can<00:03:00.400> really<00:03:00.640> pack<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:00.910> on<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.480> then<00:03:01.510> we'll

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
can really pack it on and then we'll

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.340 
can really pack it on and then we'll
focus<00:03:02.410> on<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.710> blending<00:03:03.160> afterwards<00:03:04.350> so

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
focus on the blending afterwards so

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.870 
focus on the blending afterwards so
again<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:05.680> bring<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.070> into<00:03:06.430> your<00:03:06.580> crease

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880

and above your crease and just kind of
work<00:03:09.460> it<00:03:09.490> in<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.120> then<00:03:10.270> i'm<00:03:10.390> using<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.780> soft

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
work it in and then i'm using a soft

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.720 
work it in and then i'm using a soft

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
brown that's a couple shades darker than

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.210 
brown that's a couple shades darker than
my<00:03:12.970> skin<00:03:13.000> tone<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:14.290> blending<00:03:14.980> brush<00:03:15.010> and

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
my skin tone and a blending brush and

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.850 
my skin tone and a blending brush and
just<00:03:15.610> apply<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.120> right<00:03:16.420> above<00:03:17.320> your<00:03:17.620> crease

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.860 
area and kind of blend it in with that
orange<00:03:20.020> so<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.620> have<00:03:20.740> a<00:03:20.770> nice<00:03:20.980> transition

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
orange so you have a nice transition

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.180
