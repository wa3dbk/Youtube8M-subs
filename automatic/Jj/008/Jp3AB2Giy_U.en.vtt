00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240

to get to the end of my clothes that i
had<00:06:03.370> saved<00:06:04.240> back<00:06:04.539> you<00:06:04.960> know<00:06:05.110> over<00:06:05.409> the<00:06:05.529> years

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
had saved back you know over the years

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.189 
had saved back you know over the years
so<00:06:05.979> I'm<00:06:06.069> before<00:06:06.669> long<00:06:06.880> when<00:06:07.509> summer<00:06:07.750> gets<00:06:07.840> here

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
so I'm before long when summer gets here

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.570 
so I'm before long when summer gets here
it's<00:06:08.319> going<00:06:08.500> to<00:06:08.560> be<00:06:08.650> all<00:06:08.770> new<00:06:08.979> spring<00:06:09.430> and

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
it's going to be all new spring and

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.769 
it's going to be all new spring and
summer<00:06:09.789> clothes<00:06:10.060> because<00:06:10.270> I<00:06:10.389> don't<00:06:10.569> have

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:10.779 
summer clothes because I don't have

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:14.070 
summer clothes because I don't have
anything<00:06:11.020> and<00:06:11.550> size<00:06:12.550> eight<00:06:12.789> teens<00:06:13.090> laying

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
anything and size eight teens laying

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.339 
anything and size eight teens laying
around<00:06:14.380> these<00:06:14.620> jeans<00:06:14.889> or<00:06:15.069> size<00:06:15.340> 20<00:06:16.050> and<00:06:17.050> I

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
around these jeans or size 20 and I

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.080 
around these jeans or size 20 and I
think<00:06:17.469> when<00:06:18.340> spring<00:06:18.639> gets<00:06:18.849> here<00:06:19.000> I'll

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
think when spring gets here I'll

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.360 
think when spring gets here I'll
probably<00:06:19.300> be<00:06:19.539> in<00:06:19.630> 18<00:06:20.110> least<00:06:20.919> I<00:06:21.069> hope<00:06:21.219> so<00:06:22.169> um

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370
