00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
actually not the only one I saw one in

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.900 
actually not the only one I saw one in
around<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.930> spawn<00:02:48.230> area<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.739> think<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.220> if<00:02:49.730> you

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
around the spawn area I think and if you

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.220 
around the spawn area I think and if you
remember<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.180> one<00:02:50.480> area<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.870> was<00:02:51.049> like<00:02:51.200> a

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
remember this one area that was like a

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.839 
remember this one area that was like a
stairs<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:52.010> was<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.489> there<00:02:52.640> for<00:02:52.670> show

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
stairs that was just there for show

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.940 
stairs that was just there for show
behind<00:02:53.209> you<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.690> think<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.319> they<00:02:54.440> added<00:02:54.859> the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
behind you I think that they added the

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.500 
behind you I think that they added the
data<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.489> you<00:02:55.609> can<00:02:55.730> like<00:02:55.849> sit<00:02:56.060> up<00:02:56.180> behind

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
data and you can like sit up behind

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.550 
data and you can like sit up behind
there<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:56.780> think<00:02:56.989> there's<00:02:57.109> a<00:02:57.140> bunch<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.349> grass

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
there I think there's a bunch of grass

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.960 
there I think there's a bunch of grass
there<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:57.950> stuff<00:02:58.099> but<00:02:58.489> I'm<00:02:58.609> not<00:02:58.730> entirely

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
there and stuff but I'm not entirely

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.380 
there and stuff but I'm not entirely
sure<00:02:59.829> where<00:03:00.829> that<00:03:00.859> was<00:03:01.220> on<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.640> map<00:03:01.790> but<00:03:02.030> I

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
sure where that was on the map but I

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.259 
sure where that was on the map but I
think<00:03:02.720> that's<00:03:02.840> where<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.079> was<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:04.030> they<00:03:05.030> have

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
think that's where it was and they have

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.530 
think that's where it was and they have
also<00:03:05.799> put<00:03:06.799> four<00:03:07.579> new<00:03:07.730> characters<00:03:08.150> into<00:03:08.420> the

of<00:03:29.569> it's<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.260> bit<00:03:30.410> silly<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.769> way<00:03:30.859> that<00:03:31.040> they

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
of it's a bit silly the way that they

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.250

as<00:04:19.810> one<00:04:20.470> of<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.740> characters<00:04:21.310> or<00:04:21.550> one<00:04:21.730> of<00:04:21.760> the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
as one of the characters or one of the

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.620 
as one of the characters or one of the
bots<00:04:22.060> on<00:04:22.510> his<00:04:22.660> team<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.140> did<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:25.300> looked<00:04:25.510> like

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
bots on his team and did it looked like

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.270 
bots on his team and did it looked like
this<00:04:25.840> it<00:04:26.110> was<00:04:26.470> exactly<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.920> same<00:04:27.130> as<00:04:27.250> the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
this it was exactly the same as the

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.680 
this it was exactly the same as the
savage<00:04:27.610> creeper<00:04:27.940> so<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.120> think<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:28.450> was<00:04:28.570> like

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
that should be exciting and I'm not sure

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.230
