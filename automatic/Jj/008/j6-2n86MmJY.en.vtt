00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 matryoshka spoons yes it's a new catch 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.450
 cheaters drove okay guys dear 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.300
 map us de inferno for their game this 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.769
 side of the attack and what we will have by 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.690
 guys do n't even guess guys 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.580
 apparently going to go under the banana and there 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.529
 disconnect immediately when the dude no he 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.689
 hits one apparently the head and 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.160
 will you be any of this so they go 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.170
 take away another who was not full 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.180
 support for time passes kind of board 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.340
 before the guy on the banana lands you in 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.990
 head meanwhile help yourself yes and 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.820
 will he take it by the way somehow 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.070
 way he heard or 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.870
 saw through the center th we find out on 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.489
 actually no these moments seemed 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.180
 enough interests therefore perhaps 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.870
 open shift f2 to follow better 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.000
 all this happening as if to say 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.079
 one wise man in the soldiers and waiting 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 apparently the end of the round 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.809
 or the one who goes to Sarki although he 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.640
 should like already know what's on a banana 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.850
 the enemy that the wife was infa does not mean 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.070
 Jokes I do not know what is there moron 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.470
 a little lad was aiming for the 2 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.140
 round we really is a healer i saw you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.119
 saw we saw it think with that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.220
 agree dude who is watching a video but 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.680
 let's subtract these on the boat were 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.659
 default but still I suggest 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.610
 little settlement look at this 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.200
 guy well that little by little this will be 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.620
 enter and debug for example so well and 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.360
 lures it for sure 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:38.300
 although me and the coin named john does 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:44.950
 feels for heroten was even why not 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:49.520
 shoots not serious either 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.430
 God, he has a third what is it with 6 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:59.080
 why oh my god he has a delay 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.080
 dates der and eat oh god oh oh god i 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:11.980
 Seriously 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:15.350
 dude you put the delay on the trigger you 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:20.990
 put the delay on the trigger chet say 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.180
 i'm done for oh god but i'm the first time 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.580
 I see a down which fingers with a trigger 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.830
 how is it even possible if the trigger 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:34.400
 considered one of the most useless 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:37.130
 things with a goal can he either slow 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.140
 guys play cotton and be with the leader but 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.360
 I think not the essence of a single person 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.239
 which looks at a target of more than two 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.100
 seconds is impossible such okay about 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.459
 You can basically guess too 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.910
 if sound with would stay in x that is 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:56.290
 just an ordinary square and I honestly 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.290
 for now I think it's just from 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.140
 I can already see just comments like max 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.599
 a bunch you don't understand a guy just 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.909
 Andy Scout's Exposure And I Don't Know Him 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.400
 hopes some guy is sitting waiting 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.859
 until the last when the enemy is near him 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.659
 Sight will pass know how hashtag 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:21.189
 about sight there is about football and steam 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:22.870
 there is about sight so when the enemy 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:27.450
 pass near the sight he shoots 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.450
 From UAZ can direct why as you well 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.079
 this tin is just life 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.790
 what he saw on a banana he sees you 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.780
 do you need to take and what will 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.780
 will be at the headlights guys think 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.280
 listen with such knitting needles so godless 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:59.079
 where are you shooting bullets at you 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:02.049
 side fly cut down the fact that there was 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.959
 shorter than two points for just one 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.449
 moment immediately 2 1 he is kill 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.410
 twist bullets and the second he turns 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:14.019
 don't see the walls already it's just a tin 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.349
 okay guy goes to mid sees guys 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:20.049
 on the plus will kill apparently no guy 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.880
 calmly running away under the greens now you can 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.060
 pick up our weave which is just 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.159
 runs with cum with trigger and judging by 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.440
 all u in the form at that moment on a banana with 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:33.729
 aim 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.830
 although there is no my coins and here is trigger 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.810
 really fucking though in principle 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.090
 the moment is really similar to them which 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:45.570
 was on a banana in it yourself reconsider 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.570
 think no no moment like 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:55.920
 dude guy didn't go outside 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:57.540
 it was at fire if yes I am 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.040
 In principle, I can offer something else 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.080
 was if I happen to happen 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.520
 so I will press and this is literally God 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.850
 because you literally know when literally 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.210
 more than two months ago not even 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.860
 less than a month and a half such houses are not 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.110
 it was mean you shook the trample of the child 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.330
 cheaters they were back again 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.350
 my gosh guys what the fuck again 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.210
 returns to congo 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.430
 it's really a shame well on this one 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.330
 all do not forget to put likes to 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:30.480
 four in the ass thrust such 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:33.390
 a hot poker hot there 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.980
 understand that I was pleased to leave 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.610
 reader comments what is this guy 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.770
 was a cheater 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.090
 or did he live he is a pure player and 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.950
