the little plates all scratched so i

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.649

generator<00:01:19.870> i'm<00:01:20.870> guessing<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.380> guest<00:01:21.770> guy

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
generator i'm guessing the guest guy

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.080 
generator i'm guessing the guest guy
whoever<00:01:22.790> had<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.090> before<00:01:23.470> odd<00:01:24.470> new<00:01:24.770> tire<00:01:25.090> just

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
whoever had it before odd new tire just

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.790 
whoever had it before odd new tire just
one<00:01:26.270> which<00:01:26.660> that<00:01:26.840> bugs<00:01:27.080> makes<00:01:27.320> i<00:01:27.530> don't<00:01:27.680> like

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
one which that bugs makes i don't like

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.160 
one which that bugs makes i don't like
them<00:01:27.980> deal<00:01:28.130> by<00:01:28.400> which<00:01:29.030> one<00:01:29.330> because<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:32.170> just

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
them deal by which one because it just

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.100 
them deal by which one because it just
different<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:34.090> get<00:01:35.090> different<00:01:35.240> traction<00:01:35.960> and

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
different and get different traction and

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.690 
different and get different traction and
yeah<00:01:36.940> i'll<00:01:38.290> use<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.560> guessing<00:01:40.400> this<00:01:40.520> is<00:01:40.670> the

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
yeah i'll use the guessing this is the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:59.560 
yeah i'll use the guessing this is the
pto<00:01:41.590> not<00:01:42.590> sure<00:01:42.920> exactly<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:47.720> you'd<00:01:48.080> work<00:01:48.350> so

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.630 

you
