phone<00:02:22.040> 7<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.000> let's<00:02:23.239> see<00:02:23.420> which<00:02:23.660> how<00:02:24.230> much

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
phone 7 so let's see which how much

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:44.059 
phone 7 so let's see which how much
faster<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.190> Lumia<00:02:25.640> 800<00:02:26.150> launches<00:02:26.569> is

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.619 

I<00:02:44.159> should<00:02:44.819> point<00:02:44.939> out<00:02:45.060> both<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.239> them<00:02:45.450> are<00:02:45.599> in

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
I should point out both of them are in

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.679 
I should point out both of them are in
flight<00:02:46.140> mode<00:02:46.379> right<00:02:46.650> now<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.700> Lumia<00:02:48.090> 800

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
flight mode right now so the Lumia 800

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.170 
flight mode right now so the Lumia 800
is<00:02:49.010> noticeably<00:02:50.010> faster<00:02:50.249> when<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.790> comes<00:02:50.969> to

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
is noticeably faster when it comes to

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.809 
is noticeably faster when it comes to
launching<00:02:52.019> plants<00:02:52.379> vs<00:02:52.739> zombies<00:02:55.310> now<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.670> can

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
launching plants vs zombies now we can

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.890 
launching plants vs zombies now we can
let's<00:02:57.239> compare<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.780> size<00:02:58.019> so

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
let's compare the size so

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.900 
let's compare the size so
there's<00:03:00.470> around<00:03:00.739> seven<00:03:01.129> is<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.310> bit<00:03:01.519> thicker

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.520 

it's<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.270> bit<00:03:04.480> there<00:03:04.780> about<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.050> same<00:03:05.080> length

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
it's a bit there about the same length

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.800 
it's a bit there about the same length
and<00:03:06.720> they're<00:03:07.720> about<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.050> same<00:03:08.230> what<00:03:09.720> Lumia<00:03:10.720> is

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
and they're about the same what Lumia is

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.520 
and they're about the same what Lumia is
a<00:03:10.870> tiny<00:03:11.230> bit<00:03:11.500> wider<00:03:12.100> so<00:03:12.820> let's<00:03:13.810> compare<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.380> now

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
a tiny bit wider so let's compare it now

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.960 
a tiny bit wider so let's compare it now
with<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:15.390> iphone<00:03:16.390> 4<00:03:16.810> for<00:03:17.680> us<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.610> iphones

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
with the iphone 4 for us so the iphones

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.730 
with the iphone 4 for us so the iphones
a<00:03:19.180> little<00:03:19.900> bit<00:03:20.050> narrower

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:30.480 

they're<00:03:23.100> both<00:03:23.310> about<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.640> same<00:03:23.960> length<00:03:24.960> and

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.760 

Lumia<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.450> tiny<00:03:31.810> bit<00:03:32.190> thicker<00:03:33.190> but

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
Lumia is a tiny bit thicker but

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.550 
Lumia is a tiny bit thicker but
so<00:03:35.280> it's<00:03:35.400> got<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.550> nice<00:03:35.670> screen<00:03:36.290> very<00:03:37.290> solid

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
so it's got a nice screen very solid

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.670 
so it's got a nice screen very solid

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.620

right

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.180
