00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.840

 The case will now go to court. 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.530
 The lawyer of Fábio wants the state 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.640

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.520

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.260
 request for it to be verified 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.440
 established in kent so that it can be ascertained 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.250
 these facts that occurred within the

 human rights to be 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.270
 and there is a punishment for whoever 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.010
 the rights committee is entitled to 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.290
 human beings that acts directly in 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.030
 mines state prisons has taken 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.400

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.480
 as being severe 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.760
 we see as serious first doctor if 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.130
 to comply with a permit issued by 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.770

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.260
 released then this rigor 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.540
 I think it's unnecessary 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.480
 We know that there is a 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.510
 question of handcuffs use right for what 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:29.460

 compliance with the permit issued by the 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.670
 people find it extremely necessary 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.000
 with regard to a fact that was 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:43.290
 injury or body injury if 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.050

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.540
 we understand that a 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.010
 administrative investigation to determine 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:01.370
 if there was really failure and negligence 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.370
 of the agent that led the animal
