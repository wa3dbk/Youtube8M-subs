went I used to be pretty handy the I
hope<00:02:41.330> he<00:02:41.450> falls<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.750> bit<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:41.990> range<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:42.530> we<00:02:42.560> can

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
hope he falls a bit of a range so we can

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.590 
hope he falls a bit of a range so we can
use<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:42.920> as<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.220> demonstration<00:02:43.520> types<00:02:44.450> of
