00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
don't forget Prince but the artwork is

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.770 
don't forget Prince but the artwork is
pretty<00:02:55.280> impressive<00:02:55.549> too<00:02:55.970> watching<00:02:56.599> it<00:02:56.690> again

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
pretty impressive too watching it again

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.809 
pretty impressive too watching it again
I<00:02:56.959> really<00:02:57.470> like<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.890> scale<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.489> they<00:02:58.640> give<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
I really like the scale that they give a

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.580 
I really like the scale that they give a
lot<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.090> these<00:02:59.150> houses<00:02:59.599> and<00:02:59.750> castles<00:02:59.959> they

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
lot of these houses and castles they

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.170 
lot of these houses and castles they
actually<00:03:00.890> do<00:03:01.069> make<00:03:01.099> it<00:03:01.370> seem<00:03:01.640> rather<00:03:01.879> massive

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
actually do make it seem rather massive

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.750 
actually do make it seem rather massive
and<00:03:02.750> this<00:03:02.900> is<00:03:03.019> before<00:03:03.170> white<00:03:03.530> screen<00:03:03.890> it's<00:03:04.640> the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
and this is before white screen it's the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.400 
and this is before white screen it's the
basic<00:03:05.060> return<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.660> classic<00:03:05.900> fairytale

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
basic return to the classic fairytale

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.830 
basic return to the classic fairytale
and<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:07.069> does<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.400> pretty<00:03:07.549> decently<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.329> any

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
and it does it pretty decently and any

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.600 
and it does it pretty decently and any
problems<00:03:09.319> it<00:03:09.470> does<00:03:09.680> have<00:03:09.890> story<00:03:10.190> wise<00:03:10.400> I<00:03:10.579> think

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
problems it does have story wise I think

a<00:03:14.900> lava<00:03:15.260> we're<00:03:15.560> just<00:03:15.739> sort<00:03:15.889> of<00:03:15.950> written<00:03:16.130> this
