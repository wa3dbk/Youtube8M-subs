and I'm kind of impartial to the fact

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
and I'm kind of impartial to the fact
that<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.830> doesn't<00:01:23.100> end<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> game<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.520> kind<00:01:23.970> of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
that it doesn't end the game I kind of

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.060 
that it doesn't end the game I kind of
liked<00:01:24.210> how<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:25.020> could<00:01:25.200> earn<00:01:25.380> yourself<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.920> win

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.010 
liked how you could earn yourself a win
like<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.790> course<00:01:27.030> some<00:01:27.299> people<00:01:27.360> did

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
like that but of course some people did

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.010 
like that but of course some people did
not<00:01:28.049> like<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.250> um<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.150> guess<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.900> you're

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
not like that so um I guess if you're

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.039 
not like that so um I guess if you're
pleasing<00:01:31.229> more<00:01:31.560> people<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.930> have

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
pleasing more people then you can have

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.890 
pleasing more people then you can have
the<00:01:34.320> nuke<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> game<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.689> like

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.450 
the nuke not in the game but I do like
the<00:01:36.960> idea<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:38.270> EMP<00:01:39.270> double<00:01:39.720> XP<00:01:40.110> what<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> don't

pretty much and that's kind of bothers

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.149 
pretty much and that's kind of bothers
me<00:01:56.219> after<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> while<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.790> look<00:01:57.329> around<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159

are orange and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.090 
are orange and
I'm<00:02:03.450> not<00:02:03.600> entirely<00:02:03.870> sure<00:02:04.049> because<00:02:04.620> I<00:02:04.860> haven't

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
I'm not entirely sure because I haven't

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.530 
I'm not entirely sure because I haven't
really<00:02:05.340> experienced<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.030> whole<00:02:06.150> lot<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:06.420> my

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
really experienced a whole lot of my

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.529 
really experienced a whole lot of my
labs<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.009> don't<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.250> play<00:02:08.610> mw3<00:02:09.060> that

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
labs so I don't really play mw3 that

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.820 
labs so I don't really play mw3 that
often<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:11.120> but<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.150> for<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> ones<00:02:13.200> i<00:02:13.350> have<00:02:13.560> seen

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
often and but I for the ones i have seen

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.120 
often and but I for the ones i have seen
kind<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.880> sounds<00:02:15.390> like<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:16.500> sounds<00:02:17.040> are

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
kind of sounds like the sounds are

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.309 
kind of sounds like the sounds are
muffled<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.970> changes<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.630> volume<00:02:19.110> or

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
muffled like it changes the volume or

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.559 
muffled like it changes the volume or
something<00:02:19.709> which<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.580> also<00:02:20.819> another<00:02:21.090> thing<00:02:21.239> I

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
something which is also another thing I

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.350 
something which is also another thing I
don't<00:02:21.600> like<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:23.550> know<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.819> next<00:02:24.000> cod

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
don't like so you know in the next cod

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.080 
don't like so you know in the next cod
like<00:02:24.720> if<00:02:24.900> black<00:02:25.620> ops<00:02:25.890> 2<00:02:26.160> if<00:02:26.340> such<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.580> thing<00:02:26.700> ever

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
like if black ops 2 if such a thing ever

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.300 
like if black ops 2 if such a thing ever
does<00:02:27.390> come<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:28.290> exist<00:02:28.650> which<00:02:28.830> I'm<00:02:28.980> pretty<00:02:29.190> sure

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
does come to exist which I'm pretty sure

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.340 
does come to exist which I'm pretty sure
they<00:02:29.550> are<00:02:29.640> making<00:02:29.819> another<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:31.050> if<00:02:31.170> black

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
they are making another one but if black

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.290 
they are making another one but if black
ops<00:02:31.560> 2<00:02:31.770> decides<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.310> do<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> kind<00:02:33.180> of

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
ops 2 decides to do like a kind of

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.890 
ops 2 decides to do like a kind of
ultimate<00:02:33.840> 20<00:02:34.880> 25<00:02:35.880> killstreak<00:02:36.239> or<00:02:36.630> whatever

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
ultimate 20 25 killstreak or whatever

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.979 
ultimate 20 25 killstreak or whatever
then<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.530> think<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:38.010> should<00:02:38.190> kind<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.510> think

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
then I think it should kind of I think

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.150 
then I think it should kind of I think
it<00:02:40.170> definitely<00:02:40.290> should<00:02:40.590> kill<00:02:40.800> everyone<00:02:41.040> on

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
it definitely should kill everyone on

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.070 
it definitely should kill everyone on
the<00:02:41.280> other<00:02:41.400> team<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.880> like<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.630> idea<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.989> the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
the other team I like the idea of the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.259 
the other team I like the idea of the
EMP<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.769> like<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> idea<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.700> double<00:02:44.940> XP

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
EMP I like the idea of the double XP

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.729 
EMP I like the idea of the double XP
because<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.750> know<00:02:45.840> double<00:02:46.110> XP<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.410> not<00:02:46.590> really

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
because you know double XP is not really

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.380 
because you know double XP is not really
a<00:02:46.769> big<00:02:46.980> deal<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.640> nice<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.850> have<00:02:48.120> for

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
a big deal but it is nice to have for

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.690 
a big deal but it is nice to have for
the<00:02:48.480> rest<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.780> game<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.860> don't<00:02:50.459> want<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.670> to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
the rest of the game I don't want it to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.490 
the rest of the game I don't want it to
end<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.970> game<00:02:51.000> because<00:02:51.510> people<00:02:52.050> will<00:02:52.200> cry<00:02:52.470> if

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
end the game because people will cry if

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.120 
end the game because people will cry if
it<00:02:52.830> does<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:54.420> want<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.290> be<00:02:55.410> easier<00:02:56.070> to

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
it does and I want it to be easier to

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.100 
it does and I want it to be easier to
get<00:02:56.370> them<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.670> moab<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.450> harder<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.930> get<00:02:58.050> than

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
get them the moab but harder to get than

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.710 
get them the moab but harder to get than
the<00:02:58.350> nuke<00:02:58.530> i<00:02:58.800> think<00:02:59.400> i<00:03:00.000> like<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.420> have<00:03:00.540> some

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
the nuke i think i like to have some

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.259 
the nuke i think i like to have some
sort<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.959> balance<00:03:01.380> like<00:03:01.980> what<00:03:02.910> i<00:03:02.940> really<00:03:03.150> like

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
sort of balance like what i really like

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.720 
sort of balance like what i really like
about<00:03:03.330> modern<00:03:03.720> warfare<00:03:03.870> 2<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:05.640> know

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
about modern warfare 2 is that you know

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.580 
about modern warfare 2 is that you know
i<00:03:05.850> can<00:03:06.060> get<00:03:06.209> nukes<00:03:06.540> i<00:03:06.720> can<00:03:06.870> go<00:03:07.019> on<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.500> can

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
i can get nukes i can go on and it can

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.440 
i can get nukes i can go on and it can
play<00:03:07.739> like<00:03:08.010> one<00:03:08.340> or<00:03:08.489> two<00:03:08.519> games<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.209> get<00:03:09.420> a

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
play like one or two games and get a

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.240 
play like one or two games and get a
nuke<00:03:09.660> or<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:09.959> can<00:03:10.140> play<00:03:10.350> for<00:03:10.530> like<00:03:10.590> an<00:03:10.709> hour<00:03:10.799> get

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
nuke or I can play for like an hour get

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.990 
nuke or I can play for like an hour get
three<00:03:11.489> nukes<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:14.340> know<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.579> that's<00:03:14.790> one

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
three nukes and you know that that's one

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.300 
three nukes and you know that that's one
of<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.180> things<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.450> really<00:03:15.480> liked<00:03:15.810> about<00:03:15.900> mw2

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
of the things I really liked about mw2

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.550 
of the things I really liked about mw2
but<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.790> know<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:17.940> go<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.180> mw3<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:19.049> it's

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
but you know I go on mw3 and it's

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.110 
but you know I go on mw3 and it's
partially<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.220> do<00:03:20.370> with<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.610> fact<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
partially to do with the fact that the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.060 
partially to do with the fact that the
game<00:03:21.299> is<00:03:21.510> still<00:03:21.720> really<00:03:22.049> unrefined<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.950> will

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
game is still really unrefined and will

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.900 
game is still really unrefined and will
likely<00:03:23.570> never<00:03:24.570> actually<00:03:25.530> be<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> refined<00:03:26.610> level

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
likely never actually be a refined level

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.210 
likely never actually be a refined level
this<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.060> kind<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.420> cool<00:03:27.480> here<00:03:28.010> 25<00:03:29.010> killstreak

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
this is kind of cool here 25 killstreak

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.960 
this is kind of cool here 25 killstreak
there<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:30.019> get<00:03:31.019> turned<00:03:31.320> on<00:03:31.530> bro<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.790> I've

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
there and get turned on bro so I've

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.180 
there and get turned on bro so I've
already<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.390> nuke<00:03:33.750> I'd<00:03:34.019> make<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.890> kills

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
already a nuke I'd make it so that kills

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.420 
already a nuke I'd make it so that kills
everyone<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.640> other<00:03:35.760> team<00:03:36.500> EMPs<00:03:37.500> them<00:03:37.769> give

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
everyone the other team EMPs them give

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.340 
everyone the other team EMPs them give
to<00:03:38.579> double<00:03:38.850> XP<00:03:39.180> doesn't<00:03:40.079> make<00:03:40.200> everything

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
to double XP doesn't make everything

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.979 
to double XP doesn't make everything
orange<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.579> like<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.910> idea<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.660> being<00:03:42.840> a

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
orange and I like the idea of it being a

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.470 
orange and I like the idea of it being a
killstreak<00:03:43.380> list<00:03:43.709> killstreak<00:03:44.329> kind<00:03:45.329> of<00:03:45.390> like

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
killstreak list killstreak kind of like

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.610 
killstreak list killstreak kind of like
a<00:03:45.510> hidden<00:03:45.810> one<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.230> don't<00:03:46.410> have<00:03:46.530> to

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
a hidden one that you don't have to

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.500 
a hidden one that you don't have to
actually<00:03:46.799> turn<00:03:47.070> on<00:03:47.250> but<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.790> would<00:03:47.940> prefer<00:03:48.030> if

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
actually turn on but I would prefer if

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.979 
actually turn on but I would prefer if
it<00:03:48.660> was<00:03:48.840> more<00:03:49.230> like<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:50.030> 15<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.180> 20<00:03:51.480> kill<00:03:51.690> streak

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
it was more like a 15 to 20 kill streak

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.569 
it was more like a 15 to 20 kill streak
because<00:03:52.590> if<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:52.799> think<00:03:52.859> about<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.190> all<00:03:53.459> it

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
because if you think about it all it

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.490 
because if you think about it all it
really<00:03:53.700> does<00:03:53.790> without<00:03:54.329> any<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.720> game<00:03:54.900> all

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
really does without any of the game all

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.470 
really does without any of the game all
it<00:03:55.799> really<00:03:55.920> does<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.489> kill<00:03:56.700> six<00:03:56.970> people<00:03:57.060> if

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
it really does is kill six people if

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.630 
it really does is kill six people if
you're<00:03:57.600> in<00:03:57.750> like<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.930> 66<00:03:58.530> game<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.950> a

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
you're in like a 66 game and a

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.250 
you're in like a 66 game and a
killstreak<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.299> kill<00:04:00.450> six<00:04:00.720> people<00:04:00.780> isn't

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
killstreak to kill six people isn't

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.069 
killstreak to kill six people isn't
really<00:04:01.680> worth<00:04:01.890> like<00:04:02.160> 25<00:04:02.670> kills<00:04:02.970> oh<00:04:03.239> it's<00:04:03.870> cool

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
really worth like 25 kills oh it's cool

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.539 
really worth like 25 kills oh it's cool
but<00:04:04.440> I<00:04:04.500> think<00:04:04.739> would<00:04:04.799> be<00:04:04.920> more<00:04:05.100> fair<00:04:05.310> fight

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
but I think would be more fair fight

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.150 
but I think would be more fair fight
between<00:04:05.700> 15<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:06.390> 20<00:04:06.750> kills<00:04:06.989> with<00:04:07.350> your<00:04:07.530> gut<00:04:07.739> no

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
between 15 and 20 kills with your gut no

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.620 
between 15 and 20 kills with your gut no
