00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
get one now I think that I do believe

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.540 
get one now I think that I do believe
that<00:02:20.770> i'm<00:02:20.860> not<00:02:20.890> mistaken<00:02:21.070> with<00:02:21.460> the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
that i'm not mistaken with the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.180 
that i'm not mistaken with the
centerpieces<00:02:22.210> are<00:02:22.240> different<00:02:24.180> let<00:02:25.180> me<00:02:25.330> grab

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.770 

this<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.340> an<00:02:30.460> original<00:02:30.550> plastics<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:31.600> think

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
this is an original plastics and I think

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.880 
this is an original plastics and I think
the<00:02:31.870> centerpieces<00:02:32.410> are<00:02:32.440> different

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the centerpieces are different

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.100 
the centerpieces are different
something's<00:02:33.670> different<00:02:33.820> edges<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.600> having<00:02:35.050> a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
something's different edges and having a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.850 
something's different edges and having a
brain<00:02:35.320> fart<00:02:35.590> as<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.730> what<00:02:36.850> is<00:02:37.560> right<00:02:38.560> there

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
brain fart as to what is right there

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.240 
brain fart as to what is right there
this<00:02:39.130> is<00:02:39.250> original<00:02:39.460> plastic<00:02:40.150> sanchi<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:41.250> that

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
this is original plastic sanchi and that

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.560 
this is original plastic sanchi and that
piece<00:02:42.520> right<00:02:42.610> there<00:02:42.730> for<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.150> most<00:02:43.330> part

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
piece right there for the most part

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.810 
piece right there for the most part
looks<00:02:43.750> pretty<00:02:44.080> much<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.350> same<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:45.160> think<00:02:45.700> it's

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
looks pretty much the same I think it's

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.060 
looks pretty much the same I think it's
the<00:02:45.880> centerpiece<00:02:46.210> that's<00:02:46.630> different<00:02:47.080> if<00:02:47.890> i'm

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
the centerpiece that's different if i'm

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.690 
the centerpiece that's different if i'm
not<00:02:48.100> mistaken<00:02:48.340> oh<00:02:49.350> yeah<00:02:50.350> I'm<00:02:50.770> as<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.310> can<00:02:51.490> see

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
not mistaken oh yeah I'm as you can see

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.130 
not mistaken oh yeah I'm as you can see
on<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.300> left<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:53.460> actually<00:02:54.460> the<00:02:55.140> prototype

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
on the left is actually the prototype

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.190 
on the left is actually the prototype
and<00:02:56.380> on<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.130> right<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:58.120> original<00:02:58.630> pysanky

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
and on the right is the original pysanky

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.990 
and on the right is the original pysanky
the<00:02:59.650> center<00:02:59.950> cap<00:03:00.130> doesn't<00:03:00.430> have<00:03:00.640> these<00:03:00.790> little

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
the center cap doesn't have these little

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.550 
the center cap doesn't have these little
humping<00:03:01.600> geez<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.810> don't<00:03:01.930> know<00:03:02.020> if<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:02.200> kind<00:03:02.470> of

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
humping geez I don't know if you kind of

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.720 
humping geez I don't know if you kind of
see<00:03:02.740> that<00:03:02.860> with<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.040> lighting<00:03:03.370> right<00:03:03.490> there

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
see that with the lighting right there

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.180 
see that with the lighting right there
this<00:03:04.540> this<00:03:04.780> one<00:03:04.960> doesn't<00:03:05.260> have<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:06.010> can

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
this this one doesn't have it you can

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.030 
this this one doesn't have it you can
see<00:03:06.400> it's<00:03:07.180> completely<00:03:07.660> smooth<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.830> that's<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
see it's completely smooth so that's the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.830 
see it's completely smooth so that's the
only<00:03:09.190> difference<00:03:09.310> I'm<00:03:10.000> not<00:03:10.210> so<00:03:10.390> sure<00:03:10.420> if<00:03:10.690> I'm

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
only difference I'm not so sure if I'm

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.590 
only difference I'm not so sure if I'm
going<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.350> be<00:03:11.760> adding<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:13.060> appeal<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.450> this

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
going to be adding to appeal to this

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.000 
going to be adding to appeal to this
cube<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.050> guess<00:03:14.230> I'll<00:03:14.380> see<00:03:14.590> if<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:14.950> needs<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.570> but

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
cube I guess I'll see if it needs it but

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.710 
cube I guess I'll see if it needs it but
the<00:03:18.010> 10<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.580> could<00:03:18.790> be<00:03:18.910> why<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.120> tensions

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
the 10 that could be why the tensions

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.150 
the 10 that could be why the tensions
are<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:19.930> tight<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.739> won't<00:03:20.890> explode

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
are so tight so that it won't explode

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.430 
are so tight so that it won't explode
and<00:03:22.800> this<00:03:23.800> actually<00:03:24.040> one<00:03:24.370> has<00:03:24.550> my<00:03:25.440> aluminum

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
and this actually one has my aluminum

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.620 
and this actually one has my aluminum
core<00:03:26.800> in<00:03:26.950> there<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.760> i<00:03:27.850> got<00:03:28.000> from<00:03:28.180> me<00:03:28.390> three

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
core in there that i got from me three

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.240 
core in there that i got from me three
cubes<00:03:29.310> by<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.370> way<00:03:30.610> um<00:03:32.160> debating<00:03:33.160> about

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
cubes by the way um debating about

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.590 
cubes by the way um debating about
reviewing<00:03:33.640> that<00:03:33.910> there's<00:03:34.270> nothing<00:03:34.390> really
