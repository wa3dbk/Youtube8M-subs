00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 my name is not holstein 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.259
 Managing Director of e bike store in 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hamburg 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.250
 we are very fortunate that we are today 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.429
 two weeks after the eurobike in 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.420
 friedrichshafen the brand new flyer 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.049
 model flyer x series rs here in the shop 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.220
 to have 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.890
 that is the wheel that in 2014 with the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.230
 Segment sporty bicycles at flyer 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.109
 It will be a completely new one 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.849
 Frame geometry based on the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.700
 flyer thoroughbred that it already in the year 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:39.329
 2013 also gave up with the new 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.420
 Panasonic mid-engine next generation 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.030
 the first time with flyer with 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.370
 is used here in this council is 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.320
 a chain circuit installed and the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.440
 motor is in contrast to the old ones 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.360
 Panasonic engines significantly different 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.890
 The power is designed over the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 chainring in the front of the chain 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.520
 transfer and not about that anymore 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 little motor riddle like the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.270
 Panasonic engines before 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.030
 This creates a higher torque 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.390
 more dynamics more fun when driving in 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.159
 in the event the series rs is like flyer 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.229
 common in seven different 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.600
 combinations can be ordered 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.420
 hub circuits and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.689
 also a live circuit which is the force 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.380
 the wheel will be optimally translated here 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.280
 in a mountain bike version 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.130
 Of course there is the whole 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.290
 also with aprons and luggage rack 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 for commuters every day 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.610
 Dynamically your tracks on the street 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.500
 want to leave and of course the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.720
 want to have weather protection with the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.259
 Aprons you can see up here too 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.979
 the new display with a usb hub in 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.590
 at the same time mobile phones are loaded 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.659
 can be or navigation devices that 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.090
 I turn gets it this one is something 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.170
 clearer than the old display 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.759
 the dynamic of the medium sits 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.020
 handlebar and leaves the driver 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.119
 really good service 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.700
 by a remote control like here at the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.140
 page is installed and switch 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.210
 is as I said the whole wheel is only 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.190
 Come on the market in 2014 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.690
 this is the first outlook on it we 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.560
 are very glad that flyer a bit 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.440
 what has done 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.360
 the range has been revised because with 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.610
 the old panasonic engine in contrast 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.320
 flyer is already on the bosch motor 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.660
 Slightly slipped into the background 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.700
 the new panasonic engine also has the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.580
 But coaster brake over the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.580
 transmission less wear and tear 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.970
 a higher dynamic on the wheel of the battery 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.280
 Incidentally ampere hours in three sizes 12 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.710
 15 amp hours and the big battery will 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.690
 18 ampere hours have just the 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.640
 reach is clearly up 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.000
 what the working commuters are looking forward to 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.200
 becomes 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.270
 at fly, it's a new one 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.110
 Model is the rs series one 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.670
 combination of r &amp; s series visually very 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.110
 Well done and will be a great advice 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.570
 Advertise at the same time is also a 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.470
 new engine in the new panasonic next 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.450
 generation 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.670
 that means that the wheel actually 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.240
 just as it is here in the spring 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.400
 2014 will be on the market 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.440
 the e bike company always tries before 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.640
 to get a few series models 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.460
 they can assume that we already 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.870
 the end of 2013 november december the first 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.220
 new models also from others 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.140
 have manufacturers here in the shop 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.270
 will try for you to try 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.670
 try out 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.830
 the flyer series will be delivered 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.420
 classically in the first and second 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.220
 quarterly 2014 in advance the flyer rs 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.930
 but also the other manufacturers 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.850
 in the next few weeks and the next 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.800
 three months with their first models 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.990
 get by 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.930
 watch more videos now 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.690
 current e bikes as well videos with 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.790
 valuable tips for e bike all e 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.380
 of course you will find our bikes on our
