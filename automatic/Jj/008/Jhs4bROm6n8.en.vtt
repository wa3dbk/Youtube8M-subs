grey black rustic look on I'm not too

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.040 
grey black rustic look on I'm not too
sure<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.099> finish<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:33.050> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
sure if you can see the finish there the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.229 
sure if you can see the finish there the
case<00:00:34.290> does<00:00:34.590> look<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.920> fair<00:00:35.430> bit<00:00:35.670> more<00:00:35.910> sturdy

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
case does look a fair bit more sturdy

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.610 
case does look a fair bit more sturdy
than<00:00:36.630> some<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.050> their<00:00:37.140> previous<00:00:37.440> cases<00:00:39.620> pretty

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
than some of their previous cases pretty

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.369 
than some of their previous cases pretty
good<00:00:41.059> handles<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.270> latches<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.170> probably

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
good handles and latches on it probably

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.470 
good handles and latches on it probably
better<00:00:43.800> than<00:00:44.070> especially<00:00:44.789> that's<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.239> tele

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
better than especially that's the tele

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.160 
better than especially that's the tele
case<00:00:45.950> it<00:00:46.950> does<00:00:47.219> does<00:00:47.700> seem<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.239> hold<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.960> lot

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
case it does does seem to hold a lot

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.580 
case it does does seem to hold a lot
tighter<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:51.600> corners<00:00:52.079> pot<00:00:52.800> riveted<00:00:53.250> in

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
tighter the corners pot riveted in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
tighter the corners pot riveted in
similar<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.710> previous<00:00:55.980> ones<00:00:56.280> however<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.030> think

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
similar to previous ones however I think

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.389 
similar to previous ones however I think
these<00:00:57.510> ones<00:00:57.780> would<00:00:57.930> take<00:00:58.140> more<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.680> more<00:00:59.370> of

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
these ones would take more of a more of

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.619 
these ones would take more of a more of
a<00:00:59.550> knocking<00:00:59.940> than<00:01:00.149> than<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.140> tele<00:01:01.379> case<00:01:02.629> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
a knocking than than a tele case so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.899 
a knocking than than a tele case so
we'll<00:01:03.870> open<00:01:04.439> her<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.040> have<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> quick<00:01:05.430> look

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.969 

so<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.630> obviously<00:01:10.049> haven't<00:01:10.590> been<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.950> here

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
so we obviously haven't been in here

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.030 
so we obviously haven't been in here
before<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:11.909> assume<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.890> everything<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
before so we assume that everything is

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.210 
before so we assume that everything is
in<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.150> sample<00:01:15.960> model<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.920> there

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
in here this is a sample model so there

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.130 
in here this is a sample model so there
may<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.400> things<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.479> different<00:01:18.689> once

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
may be things that are different once

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.890 
may be things that are different once
the<00:01:19.409> full<00:01:20.009> production<00:01:20.369> starts<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.720> I'll<00:01:21.869> just

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the full production starts but I'll just

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.899 
the full production starts but I'll just
rip<00:01:22.290> everything<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.070> show<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.340> what<00:01:23.759> you

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
rip everything out and show you what you

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.960 
rip everything out and show you what you
should<00:01:24.240> get<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> package<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.850> we'll<00:01:26.850> go

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
should get in the package and we'll go

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.160 
should get in the package and we'll go
from<00:01:27.150> there<00:01:27.360> then<00:01:27.570> we'll<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> test<00:01:27.990> flight

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
from there then we'll do a test flight

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.819 
from there then we'll do a test flight
later

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
later

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.039 
later
so<00:01:29.610> starting<00:01:30.600> over<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> right<00:01:32.930> looks<00:01:33.930> like

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
so starting over on the right looks like

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.600 
so starting over on the right looks like
we've<00:01:34.500> we've<00:01:35.460> got<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> yeah<00:01:36.470> another<00:01:37.470> sky<00:01:37.890> RC

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
we've we've got a yeah another sky RC

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.929 
we've we've got a yeah another sky RC

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
charger and quite a fair bit bigger than

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.800 
charger and quite a fair bit bigger than
the<00:01:42.060> previous<00:01:42.180> charges<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
the previous charges you can see the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.710 
the previous charges you can see the
heat<00:01:45.810> fan<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.320> there<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:47.610> I'm<00:01:48.090> not<00:01:48.149> too<00:01:48.420> sure

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
heat fan in there so I'm not too sure

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.319 
heat fan in there so I'm not too sure
what<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.439> charge<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.490> will<00:01:51.149> no

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
what this charge is like but will no

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.249 
what this charge is like but will no
doubt<00:01:51.360> give<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:54.720> see<00:01:55.020> how<00:01:55.200> she

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
doubt give it a go and and see how she

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.570 
doubt give it a go and and see how she
runs

I'm<00:02:22.650> on<00:02:22.830> my<00:02:22.950> own<00:02:27.530> okay<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.590> there<00:02:29.520> we<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.850> it

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
I'm on my own okay so there we have it

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.520 
I'm on my own okay so there we have it
so<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.300> looks<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.540> we've<00:02:30.840> got<00:02:30.870> our<00:02:32.660> 4k<00:02:33.660> camera

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
so it looks like we've got our 4k camera

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.160 
so it looks like we've got our 4k camera
apparently<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:39.120> full<00:02:39.360> access<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.900> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
apparently and the full access and the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.060 
apparently and the full access and the
360<00:02:41.040> which<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.400> assume<00:02:41.760> will<00:02:41.970> be<00:02:42.000> run<00:02:43.070> you've

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
360 which I assume will be run you've

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.090 
360 which I assume will be run you've
got<00:02:44.310> some<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.750> can<00:02:45.960> zoom<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.710> get<00:02:46.890> that

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
got some if I can zoom in and get that

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.950 
got some if I can zoom in and get that
clear<00:02:47.460> probably<00:02:48.060> not<00:02:48.270> but<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.570> see<00:02:48.750> those

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
clear probably not but you can see those

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.010 
clear probably not but you can see those
orange<00:02:49.590> contact<00:02:50.400> pins<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> top<00:02:51.060> they

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
orange contact pins on the top they

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.020 
orange contact pins on the top they
obviously<00:02:52.530> meant<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.190> bottom<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.910> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
obviously meant to the bottom of the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.680 
obviously meant to the bottom of the
aircraft<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:56.180> initiate<00:02:57.180> all<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
aircraft and and initiate all the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.810 
aircraft and and initiate all the
actions<00:02:58.110> from<00:02:58.350> there<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:58.770> we<00:02:59.040> will<00:02:59.250> last<00:02:59.550> see

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
actions from there but we will last see

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.460 
actions from there but we will last see
when<00:03:00.000> we're<00:03:00.150> test<00:03:00.360> flying<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.990> if<00:03:01.320> that's

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
when we're test flying that if that's

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:11.930 
when we're test flying that if that's
the<00:03:01.650> case<00:03:07.970> okay<00:03:08.970> we've<00:03:09.390> got<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.950> know<00:03:11.040> pair<00:03:11.670> of

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
the case okay we've got you know pair of

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.250 
the case okay we've got you know pair of
leads<00:03:12.270> for<00:03:12.660> our<00:03:12.810> charger<00:03:14.900> I've<00:03:15.900> got<00:03:16.080> our

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
leads for our charger I've got our

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.880 
leads for our charger I've got our
standard<00:03:16.820> USB<00:03:17.820> cables<00:03:18.720> etc<00:03:18.959> for<00:03:19.739> the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
standard USB cables etc for the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.500 
standard USB cables etc for the
mainboard<00:03:20.640> upgrading<00:03:23.090> we've<00:03:24.090> got<00:03:24.300> our

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
mainboard upgrading we've got our

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.770 
mainboard upgrading we've got our
propellers<00:03:25.320> which<00:03:25.530> are<00:03:25.800> real<00:03:26.160> carbon<00:03:26.940> fiber

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
propellers which are real carbon fiber

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.460 
propellers which are real carbon fiber
unlike<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.830> telly<00:03:29.070> so<00:03:29.870> they're<00:03:30.870> not<00:03:31.050> just<00:03:31.320> a

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
unlike the telly so they're not just a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.040 
unlike the telly so they're not just a
black<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:31.920> color<00:03:32.220> they<00:03:32.459> are<00:03:32.489> carbon<00:03:33.269> props<00:03:33.600> a

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
black in color they are carbon props a

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.729 
black in color they are carbon props a
little<00:03:34.500> bit<00:03:34.590> smaller<00:03:34.950> than<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.310> X<00:03:35.430> 800<00:03:36.090> props

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
little bit smaller than the X 800 props

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.550 
little bit smaller than the X 800 props
but<00:03:37.739> they<00:03:38.430> look<00:03:38.790> at<00:03:39.390> first<00:03:39.690> saw<00:03:40.019> pretty<00:03:40.380> much

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
but they look at first saw pretty much

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.210 
but they look at first saw pretty much
similar<00:03:40.920> quality<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:43.080> what<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.380> X<00:03:43.530> 800<00:03:44.130> is

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
similar quality to to what the X 800 is

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:51.180 
similar quality to to what the X 800 is
running

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:04:03.339 

okay<00:03:52.190> clear<00:03:53.060> arms<00:03:53.450> out<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:59.750> motors<00:04:01.300> kV<00:04:02.349> 350

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
okay clear arms out so the motors kV 350

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.020 
okay clear arms out so the motors kV 350
which<00:04:03.650> masive<00:04:04.099> users<00:04:04.310> be<00:04:04.489> aware<00:04:04.730> if<00:04:04.880> you've

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
which masive users be aware if you've

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.050 
which masive users be aware if you've
already<00:04:05.209> been<00:04:05.450> looking<00:04:05.840> at<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:07.060> voyager

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
already been looking at the voyager

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.390 
already been looking at the voyager
anyway<00:04:08.450> we're<00:04:09.410> still<00:04:09.620> got<00:04:09.769> our<00:04:09.920> little<00:04:10.099> arrow

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
anyway we're still got our little arrow

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.440 
anyway we're still got our little arrow
indications<00:04:11.349> for<00:04:12.670> for<00:04:13.670> us<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.970> put<00:04:14.180> on<00:04:14.300> the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
indications for for us to put on the

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.330 
indications for for us to put on the
props<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.870> wrong<00:04:15.170> way<00:04:15.380> and<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.739> spins<00:04:16.130> and

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
props the wrong way and it spins and

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.819 
props the wrong way and it spins and
tips<00:04:16.549> over<00:04:17.000> one<00:04:17.900> thing<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.200> will<00:04:18.410> notice

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
tips over one thing I will notice

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.330 
tips over one thing I will notice
straight<00:04:19.190> away<00:04:19.220> which<00:04:20.530> which<00:04:21.530> was<00:04:22.010> hard<00:04:22.220> to

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
straight away which which was hard to

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.270 
straight away which which was hard to
see<00:04:22.520> in<00:04:22.639> the<00:04:22.760> photos<00:04:23.210> is<00:04:23.240> that<00:04:23.660> that<00:04:23.930> carbon

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
see in the photos is that that carbon

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.090 
see in the photos is that that carbon
rod<00:04:25.280> seems<00:04:26.380> probably<00:04:27.380> three<00:04:27.710> or<00:04:27.740> four<00:04:27.860> times

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
rod seems probably three or four times

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.040 
rod seems probably three or four times
more<00:04:28.729> sturdy<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.830> thicker<00:04:31.250> than<00:04:32.050> than

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
more sturdy and and thicker than than

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.290 
more sturdy and and thicker than than
the<00:04:33.200> cab<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.740> landing<00:04:34.610> gear<00:04:34.639> that<00:04:35.000> you<00:04:35.090> get

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
the cab and landing gear that you get

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.530 
the cab and landing gear that you get
with<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.570> scout<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.110> telly<00:04:36.350> so<00:04:37.540> definitely

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
with the scout and telly so definitely

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.230 
with the scout and telly so definitely
not<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.900> same<00:04:39.169> material<00:04:39.860> there<00:04:40.100> or<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.030> may<00:04:41.180> be

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
not the same material there or it may be

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.930 
not the same material there or it may be
still<00:04:41.540> carbon<00:04:42.080> but<00:04:42.320> yeah<00:04:43.190> they<00:04:43.400> feel<00:04:43.669> a<00:04:43.700> lot

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
still carbon but yeah they feel a lot

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.060 
still carbon but yeah they feel a lot
lot<00:04:44.300> stronger<00:04:44.830> so<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:46.760> whole<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.660> whole

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
lot stronger so the whole the whole

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.690 
lot stronger so the whole the whole
connection<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:49.960> an<00:04:50.960> arm<00:04:51.320> frame<00:04:51.860> seems<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.520> lot

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
connection and an arm frame seems a lot

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.690 
connection and an arm frame seems a lot
stronger<00:04:53.090> than<00:04:53.440> previous<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:55.130> seems<00:04:55.430> like

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
stronger than previous and it seems like

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.670 
stronger than previous and it seems like
they've<00:04:55.910> they've<00:04:56.479> gone<00:04:56.690> some<00:04:56.960> good<00:04:57.169> solid

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
they've they've gone some good solid

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.469 
they've they've gone some good solid
connections<00:04:58.250> into<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.610> aircraft's<00:04:59.270> there

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
connections into the aircraft's there

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.980 
connections into the aircraft's there
instead<00:04:59.870> of<00:04:59.930> tiny<00:05:00.200> little<00:05:00.470> pins<00:05:01.990> hopefully

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
instead of tiny little pins hopefully

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.260 
instead of tiny little pins hopefully
better<00:05:03.350> than<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.770> previous<00:05:04.130> worm<00:05:04.610> servos

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
better than the previous worm servos

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.029 
better than the previous worm servos
setups<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:07.990> see<00:05:08.990> how<00:05:09.169> they<00:05:09.350> go<00:05:09.560> but<00:05:09.860> they're

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
setups and see how they go but they're

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.510 
setups and see how they go but they're
definitely<00:05:10.600> definitely<00:05:11.600> a<00:05:11.630> lot<00:05:11.840> stronger<00:05:12.520> by

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
definitely definitely a lot stronger by

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.640 
definitely definitely a lot stronger by
the<00:05:13.580> looks<00:05:13.820> of<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.030> frame<00:05:14.390> and<00:05:14.630> and<00:05:14.960> the

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
the looks of the frame and and the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.810 
the looks of the frame and and the
connectors<00:05:16.430> in<00:05:16.580> general<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:21.770> what<00:05:22.460> else<00:05:22.669> will

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
connectors in general and what else will

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.219 
connectors in general and what else will
we<00:05:22.910> go<00:05:23.090> with<00:05:23.270> Katla<00:05:23.840> random<00:05:24.260> screws<00:05:24.710> here<00:05:25.100> and

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
we go with Katla random screws here and

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.270 
we go with Katla random screws here and
the<00:05:27.229> plates<00:05:27.590> for<00:05:27.950> the<00:05:28.010> tops<00:05:28.250> of<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.490> props<00:05:28.820> and

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
the plates for the tops of the props and

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.740 
the plates for the tops of the props and
and<00:05:31.280> it<00:05:31.400> looks<00:05:31.610> like<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:32.060> last<00:05:32.300> thing<00:05:32.630> we've

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
and it looks like the last thing we've

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.300 
and it looks like the last thing we've
got<00:05:32.990> to<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.229> actual<00:05:33.590> body<00:05:33.830> of<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:34.130> aircraft

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
got to the actual body of the aircraft

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.250 
got to the actual body of the aircraft
so<00:05:34.850> I<00:05:35.000> will<00:05:35.150> pull<00:05:35.330> this<00:05:35.479> out<00:05:35.690> and<00:05:35.870> have<00:05:35.990> a<00:05:36.050> quick

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
so I will pull this out and have a quick

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.219 
so I will pull this out and have a quick
look

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.270 

so<00:05:40.220> most<00:05:40.430> of<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.669> have<00:05:40.700> seen<00:05:40.910> photos<00:05:41.660> already

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
so most of you have seen photos already

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.270 
so most of you have seen photos already
it<00:05:43.280> looks<00:05:43.520> like<00:05:43.789> we've<00:05:43.970> got<00:05:44.000> our<00:05:44.360> air

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
it looks like we've got our air

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.590 
it looks like we've got our air
transmission<00:05:46.280> on<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.400> on<00:05:46.880> the<00:05:47.090> bottom<00:05:47.240> for

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
transmission on the on the bottom for

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.379 
transmission on the on the bottom for
the<00:05:47.780> video<00:05:48.410> signal<00:05:48.889> I'm<00:05:49.190> guessing<00:05:49.669> it<00:05:50.210> looks

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
the video signal I'm guessing it looks

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.150 
the video signal I'm guessing it looks
like<00:05:50.570> there's<00:05:50.720> a<00:05:50.750> channel<00:05:51.050> selection<00:05:51.979> there

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
like there's a channel selection there

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.550 
like there's a channel selection there
with<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.750> with<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.840> little<00:05:54.080> dip<00:05:54.260> switches

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
with the with the little dip switches

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.260 
with the with the little dip switches
which<00:05:54.919> is<00:05:55.130> hard<00:05:55.669> to<00:05:55.820> see<00:05:56.060> in<00:05:56.210> this<00:05:56.330> light<00:05:56.389> and

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
which is hard to see in this light and

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.860 
which is hard to see in this light and
obviously<00:05:59.270> our<00:06:00.070> retractable<00:06:01.070> undercarriage

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
obviously our retractable undercarriage

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.890 
obviously our retractable undercarriage
there's

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
there's

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.879 
there's
there's<00:06:04.169> a<00:06:04.290> receiver<00:06:05.480> or<00:06:06.480> the<00:06:06.780> female<00:06:07.380> side<00:06:07.680> of

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
there's a receiver or the female side of

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.040 
there's a receiver or the female side of
our<00:06:08.040> contact<00:06:08.550> depends<00:06:08.910> where<00:06:09.210> that<00:06:09.419> that

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
our contact depends where that that

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.590 
our contact depends where that that
gimbal<00:06:10.470> goes<00:06:10.650> so<00:06:11.040> that<00:06:11.370> looks<00:06:11.910> like<00:06:12.180> where<00:06:12.419> it

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
gimbal goes so that looks like where it

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.520 
gimbal goes so that looks like where it
where<00:06:13.500> it<00:06:13.590> all<00:06:13.710> talk<00:06:13.949> to<00:06:14.190> each<00:06:14.370> other<00:06:14.580> up<00:06:14.790> there

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
where it all talk to each other up there

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.200 
where it all talk to each other up there
and<00:06:16.530> we've<00:06:16.830> got<00:06:17.040> our<00:06:17.220> battery<00:06:17.669> which<00:06:17.850> you<00:06:18.000> will

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
and we've got our battery which you will

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.409 
and we've got our battery which you will
see<00:06:18.510> Susana<00:06:19.500> Diez<00:06:19.770> maybe<00:06:20.490> you<00:06:20.669> can't<00:06:20.940> see<00:06:21.060> that

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
see Susana Diez maybe you can't see that

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.210 
see Susana Diez maybe you can't see that
but<00:06:21.690> I'll<00:06:21.840> read<00:06:22.110> it<00:06:22.139> out<00:06:22.320> to<00:06:22.530> you<00:06:22.590> it<00:06:22.740> is<00:06:22.860> 11

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
but I'll read it out to you it is 11

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.409 
but I'll read it out to you it is 11
point<00:06:23.430> 1<00:06:23.610> volt<00:06:24.380> 5200<00:06:25.380> milliamp<00:06:25.830> and<00:06:26.130> I<00:06:26.910> assume

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
point 1 volt 5200 milliamp and I assume

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.740 
point 1 volt 5200 milliamp and I assume
that<00:06:27.449> just<00:06:27.810> pulls<00:06:28.139> out<00:06:28.350> the<00:06:28.530> back<00:06:29.600> which<00:06:30.600> it

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
that just pulls out the back which it

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.250 
that just pulls out the back which it
does<00:06:31.020> so<00:06:31.970> so<00:06:32.970> basically<00:06:33.449> that's<00:06:33.690> a<00:06:33.960> whole

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
does so so basically that's a whole

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.860 
does so so basically that's a whole
battery<00:06:34.710> there<00:06:34.889> she's<00:06:35.100> a<00:06:35.130> fear<00:06:35.490> fear<00:06:36.450> whack<00:06:36.690> of

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
battery there she's a fear fear whack of

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.730 
battery there she's a fear fear whack of
a<00:06:36.960> battery<00:06:37.940> so<00:06:38.940> although<00:06:39.389> it's<00:06:39.660> only<00:06:39.780> 50<00:06:40.260> 200

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
a battery so although it's only 50 200

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.879 
a battery so although it's only 50 200
milliamps<00:06:41.040> it's<00:06:41.900> near<00:06:42.900> on<00:06:43.110> double<00:06:43.500> the<00:06:43.620> size

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
milliamps it's near on double the size

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:47.590 
milliamps it's near on double the size
of<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.780> 350<00:06:45.780> battery<00:06:46.169> by<00:06:46.320> the<00:06:46.380> looks<00:06:46.620> of<00:06:46.770> it

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
of a 350 battery by the looks of it

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.790 
of a 350 battery by the looks of it
they've<00:06:48.600> got<00:06:48.750> their<00:06:48.900> standard<00:06:49.350> charging

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
they've got their standard charging

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.100 
they've got their standard charging
instructions<00:06:50.610> on<00:06:50.760> the<00:06:50.880> top<00:06:51.090> which<00:06:51.330> looks<00:06:51.810> like

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
instructions on the top which looks like

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.409 
instructions on the top which looks like
it<00:06:52.560> uses<00:06:52.950> very<00:06:53.250> similar<00:06:53.580> connections<00:06:54.120> to<00:06:54.330> the

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
it uses very similar connections to the

00:06:54.419 --> 00:07:00.770 
it uses very similar connections to the
Scout<00:06:54.720> and<00:06:54.900> Sally<00:06:57.260> and<00:06:58.700> and<00:06:59.700> our<00:06:59.940> aircraft<00:07:00.450> so

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
Scout and Sally and and our aircraft so

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.750 
Scout and Sally and and our aircraft so
we've<00:07:00.960> got<00:07:01.169> our<00:07:01.350> a<00:07:01.650> little<00:07:02.100> connectors<00:07:02.580> there

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
we've got our a little connectors there

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.279 
we've got our a little connectors there
for<00:07:02.970> 12<00:07:03.270> volts<00:07:03.630> and<00:07:03.720> USB

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:04.289 
for 12 volts and USB

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:06.409 
for 12 volts and USB
there's<00:07:04.680> our<00:07:04.860> pins<00:07:05.160> in<00:07:05.430> there<00:07:05.610> for<00:07:05.880> our<00:07:05.940> arms

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:06.419 
there's our pins in there for our arms

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.550 
there's our pins in there for our arms
which<00:07:07.460> they<00:07:08.460> do<00:07:08.520> look<00:07:08.970> a<00:07:09.120> fair<00:07:09.360> bit<00:07:09.570> fair<00:07:10.410> bit

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
which they do look a fair bit fair bit

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.529 
which they do look a fair bit fair bit
stronger<00:07:10.950> so<00:07:11.310> hopefully<00:07:11.880> they<00:07:12.120> they<00:07:12.690> are<00:07:12.900> and

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
stronger so hopefully they they are and

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:18.230 
stronger so hopefully they they are and
we've<00:07:15.539> got<00:07:15.720> all<00:07:15.840> our<00:07:15.870> internal<00:07:16.350> workings<00:07:17.240> it's

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
we've got all our internal workings it's

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.480 
we've got all our internal workings it's
not<00:07:18.539> a<00:07:18.570> real<00:07:18.960> heavy<00:07:19.289> aircraft<00:07:19.590> without<00:07:20.340> the

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
not a real heavy aircraft without the

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.879 
not a real heavy aircraft without the
battery<00:07:20.669> in<00:07:21.030> it<00:07:21.950> it<00:07:22.950> seems<00:07:23.250> to<00:07:23.460> be<00:07:23.610> fairly

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:24.889 
battery in it it seems to be fairly

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:29.779 
battery in it it seems to be fairly
fairly<00:07:25.889> light<00:07:26.539> so<00:07:27.539> will<00:07:27.870> will<00:07:28.220> will<00:07:29.220> charger

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:29.789 
fairly light so will will will charger

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:32.659 
fairly light so will will will charger
