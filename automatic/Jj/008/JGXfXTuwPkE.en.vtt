00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
strategic situation in close combat gate

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.960 
strategic situation in close combat gate
with<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> con<00:00:07.230> this<00:00:07.620> time<00:00:07.950> we<00:00:08.250> get<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.519> see<00:00:08.760> a

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
with a con this time we get to see a

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.330 
with a con this time we get to see a
mini-map<00:00:09.630> as<00:00:09.900> well<00:00:10.110> which<00:00:10.679> will<00:00:10.950> give<00:00:11.099> us<00:00:11.219> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
mini-map as well which will give us a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.520 
mini-map as well which will give us a
broader<00:00:12.150> picture<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.900> strategic

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
broader picture of the strategic

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.250 
broader picture of the strategic
situation<00:00:14.070> now<00:00:14.460> I'm<00:00:14.639> pretty<00:00:15.360> impressive<00:00:15.960> why

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
situation now I'm pretty impressive why

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.760 
situation now I'm pretty impressive why
see<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.160> like<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.029> layout<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:19.470> kind<00:00:19.710> of

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
see I like the layout and it kind of

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.250 
see I like the layout and it kind of
reminds<00:00:20.160> me<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.760> strategic<00:00:21.689> map<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.050> last

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
reminds me of the strategic map in last

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.189 
reminds me of the strategic map in last
and<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.890> being<00:00:23.699> tall<00:00:24.090> rather<00:00:24.600> than<00:00:24.900> broad

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
and on and being tall rather than broad

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.560 
and on and being tall rather than broad
like<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.830> was<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.130> Panthers<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.580> fog<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.119> I

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
like it was in Panthers in the fog and I

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.509 
like it was in Panthers in the fog and I
know<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:28.109> lot<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.590> liked<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.099> strategic

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
know a lot of you liked the strategic

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.070 
know a lot of you liked the strategic
map<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.820> last<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.119> Ireland<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.660> hopefully

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
map and last on Ireland so hopefully

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.930 
map and last on Ireland so hopefully
you'll<00:00:31.230> be<00:00:31.260> happy<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.130> obviously

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
you'll be happy with this but obviously

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.540 
you'll be happy with this but obviously
there's<00:00:33.120> no<00:00:33.210> paratroopers<00:00:34.070> what<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.340> get

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
there's no paratroopers what we do get

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.270 
there's no paratroopers what we do get
to<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.790> though<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.090> wide<00:00:36.840> range<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.739> units

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
to see though is a wide range of units

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.400 
to see though is a wide range of units
on<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> map<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.210> first<00:00:39.270> time<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.290> have

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
on the map for the first time so we have

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.650 
on the map for the first time so we have
units<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.920> include<00:00:41.040> Panthers<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.120> Mark

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
units that include Panthers and Mark

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.150 
units that include Panthers and Mark
fours<00:00:43.110> things<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
fours things like that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880 
fours things like that
which<00:00:44.550> I'm<00:00:44.789> happy<00:00:44.969> about<00:00:45.120> because<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.860> a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
which I'm happy about because we get a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
which I'm happy about because we get a
better<00:00:47.190> sense<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.789> what<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> expect<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
better sense of what to expect in a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.470 
better sense of what to expect in a
battle<00:00:49.070> having<00:00:50.070> units<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.820> icons

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
battle having units that have icons

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.689 
battle having units that have icons
whereas<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.230> Panthers<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.710> fog<00:00:52.949> where<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
whereas in Panthers in the fog where it

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700 
whereas in Panthers in the fog where it
was<00:00:53.820> kind<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.059> hard<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.600> gauge<00:00:54.989> exactly<00:00:55.020> what

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
was kind of hard to gauge exactly what

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.799 
was kind of hard to gauge exactly what
we<00:00:55.829> had<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:56.879> were<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> strategic<00:00:57.390> map

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
we had when we were on the strategic map

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.900 
we had when we were on the strategic map
so<00:00:58.079> I'm<00:00:58.800> quite<00:00:59.070> happy<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.399> these<00:00:59.489> additions

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
so I'm quite happy with these additions

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.830 
so I'm quite happy with these additions
I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> great<00:01:01.079> idea<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.660> well<00:01:03.660> done

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
I think it's a great idea so well done

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.350 
I think it's a great idea so well done
to<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.080> developers<00:01:04.850> unlike<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.030> previous

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
to the developers unlike the previous

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.760 
to the developers unlike the previous
screen<00:01:06.869> shot<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.320> had<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
screen shot which we had of the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.030 
screen shot which we had of the
strategic<00:01:08.189> map<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:09.000> terrain<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.840> is

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
strategic map the terrain here is

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.060 
strategic map the terrain here is
slightly<00:01:11.040> more<00:01:11.280> grainy<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.119> guess<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:13.380> appears

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
slightly more grainy I guess it appears

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.960 
slightly more grainy I guess it appears
like<00:01:14.220> they've<00:01:14.340> gone<00:01:14.460> back<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.850> made

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
like they've gone back and made

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.429 
like they've gone back and made
improvements<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.750> look<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.110> terrain

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
improvements to the look of the terrain

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.380 
improvements to the look of the terrain
and<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:17.340> opinion<00:01:17.460> they've<00:01:17.939> done<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> pretty

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and in my opinion they've done a pretty

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.499 
and in my opinion they've done a pretty
good<00:01:18.509> job<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> much<00:01:20.610> nicer<00:01:20.640> strategic

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
good job this is a much nicer strategic

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.850 
good job this is a much nicer strategic
map<00:01:21.659> than<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.140> panels<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> fog

until then I guess that's just gonna be
in<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.740> next<00:01:49.829> month<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.250> two<00:01:50.369> because<00:01:50.520> they

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
in the next month or two because they

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.770 
in the next month or two because they
said<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.210> gonna<00:01:51.329> be<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> first

quarter<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.290> year<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> month<00:01:54.210> or

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
so left I guess but it's modest I'm I'm

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.840 
so left I guess but it's modest I'm I'm
excited<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> release<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> game<00:01:59.610> but

want to give you something that is
properly<00:02:47.970> tested<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.439> think<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:49.919> that

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
properly tested and I think that that

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.679 
properly tested and I think that that
was<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.459> problem<00:02:50.730> with<00:02:50.790> Panthers<00:02:51.329> in<00:02:51.419> the<00:02:51.450> fog

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
was the problem with Panthers in the fog

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.250 
was the problem with Panthers in the fog
at<00:02:51.840> release<00:02:52.579> Panthers<00:02:53.579> in<00:02:54.239> my<00:02:54.480> opinion<00:02:54.900> even

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
at release Panthers in my opinion even

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.979 
at release Panthers in my opinion even
now<00:02:55.500> feels<00:02:56.250> kind<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.639> rushed<00:02:56.939> and<00:02:57.180> perhaps<00:02:57.599> not

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
now feels kind of rushed and perhaps not

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.559 
now feels kind of rushed and perhaps not
play<00:02:58.260> tested<00:02:58.769> right

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
play tested right

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.270 
play tested right
they're<00:03:00.569> obviously<00:03:00.719> taking<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.799> fact<00:03:02.069> into

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
they're obviously taking that fact into

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.890 
they're obviously taking that fact into
account<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.969> I<00:03:03.389> think<00:03:03.689> they're<00:03:03.780> learning

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
account and I think they're learning

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.159 
account and I think they're learning
from<00:03:04.169> the<00:03:04.590> mistakes<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.280> awesome<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.049> would

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
from the mistakes so awesome and I would

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.530 
from the mistakes so awesome and I would
be<00:03:07.260> happy<00:03:07.530> for<00:03:07.560> Conrad<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.400> catharsis<00:03:08.909> etc<00:03:09.359> to

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
be happy for Conrad and catharsis etc to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.670 
be happy for Conrad and catharsis etc to
give<00:03:09.780> us<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.200> polished<00:03:11.040> product<00:03:11.219> in<00:03:11.790> say<00:03:12.680> second
