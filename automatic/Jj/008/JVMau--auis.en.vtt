00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
the sails are building so let's make

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.890 
the sails are building so let's make
this<00:02:04.190> one<00:02:04.400> a<00:02:04.460> little<00:02:04.729> more<00:02:04.880> rounded<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.690> not

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
this one a little more rounded and not

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.930 
this one a little more rounded and not
quite<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:06.290> straight<00:02:06.950> as<00:02:07.190> this<00:02:07.370> one<00:02:07.640> in<00:02:07.820> the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
quite so straight as this one in the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.110 
quite so straight as this one in the
front<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:08.840> will<00:02:09.229> continue<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:10.340> do<00:02:10.519> this

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
front so I will continue to do this

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.780 
front so I will continue to do this
saving<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.140> white<00:02:12.459> of<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:14.239> paper<00:02:14.739> for<00:02:15.739> all<00:02:15.980> my

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
saving the white of the paper for all my

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.930 
saving the white of the paper for all my
sails<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:17.629> go<00:02:18.140> across<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.890> also<00:02:19.280> think<00:02:19.700> I'll

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
sails and go across I also think I'll

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.960 
sails and go across I also think I'll
kind<00:02:20.299> of<00:02:20.420> sharpen<00:02:21.379> this<00:02:21.500> edge<00:02:21.830> here<00:02:21.860> on<00:02:22.700> this

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
kind of sharpen this edge here on this

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.559 
kind of sharpen this edge here on this
this<00:02:23.599> this<00:02:23.870> boat<00:02:24.409> in<00:02:24.739> front<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.060> bring<00:02:26.299> this

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
mast down here as well I will continue

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.350 
mast down here as well I will continue
using<00:02:30.409> this<00:02:30.680> sharper<00:02:31.159> all<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.640> way<00:02:31.760> across<00:02:32.090> on

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360
