00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
below which is the belkin hope which is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.100 
below which is the belkin hope which is
really<00:02:05.820> full<00:02:05.940> of<00:02:06.000> my<00:02:06.150> committee<00:02:06.590> but<00:02:08.179> it's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
really full of my committee but it's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.770 
really full of my committee but it's
I<00:02:10.310> use<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.490> for<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.910> time<00:02:12.120> capsule<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.600> know

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
I use it for the time capsule I know

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.940 
I use it for the time capsule I know
I've<00:02:12.900> only<00:02:12.990> got<00:02:13.200> one<00:02:13.350> thing<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.860> at<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
I've only got one thing in and at the

moment and but you know you can put
loads<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.250> things<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.580> there<00:02:17.730> anyway<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.800> it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
loads of things in there anyway so it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.320 
loads of things in there anyway so it
just<00:02:20.070> sits<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:20.310> all<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> time<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:21.120> turns

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
just sits here all the time it turns

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.180 
just sits here all the time it turns
itself<00:02:21.510> on<00:02:23.660> every<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:25.080> don't<00:02:25.590> know<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.950> tell<00:02:26.100> you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
about 30-40 minutes and you can just

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.140 
about 30-40 minutes and you can just
hear<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.470> spinning<00:02:28.770> quietly<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.880> know<00:02:29.970> your

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
it's working on the screen it'll have to

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.900 
it's working on the screen it'll have to
do<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> time<00:02:37.320> machine<00:02:37.470> going<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.459> circle<00:02:38.670> and

do a time machine going in a circle and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.690 
do a time machine going in a circle and
you<00:02:39.030> know<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.300> working<00:02:39.600> takes<00:02:40.260> about<00:02:40.700> 10-15

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
you know it's working takes about 10-15

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.340 
you know it's working takes about 10-15

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
minutes for it to finish and that's it

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.510 
minutes for it to finish and that's it
you<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.800> backed<00:02:43.980> up<00:02:44.100> everything's

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
you know it's backed up everything's

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
you know it's backed up everything's
doing<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.770> what<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.980> haven't<00:02:47.940> done<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.360> this

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
doing the what I haven't done with this

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.530 
doing the what I haven't done with this
which<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.110> reason<00:02:49.230> about<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:51.300> my

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
which is the reason about this the my

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.500 
which is the reason about this the my
book<00:02:51.750> studio<00:02:52.380> edition<00:02:52.680> 500<00:02:53.310> gigabyte<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.790> use

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
book studio edition 500 gigabyte is use

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.170 
book studio edition 500 gigabyte is use
it<00:02:54.660> as<00:02:54.780> external<00:02:55.320> hard<00:02:56.190> drive<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.610> thought<00:02:56.970> I'd

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
it as external hard drive I thought I'd

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.610 
it as external hard drive I thought I'd
never<00:02:57.239> seen<00:02:57.660> any<00:02:57.780> way<00:02:57.930> said<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.350> could<00:02:58.470> do

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
never seen any way said you could do

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.890 
never seen any way said you could do
that<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.070> maybe<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.090> can<00:03:00.300> i'm<00:03:00.420> sure<00:03:00.570> last<00:03:00.750> we

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
that and maybe you can i'm sure last we

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.180 
that and maybe you can i'm sure last we
probably<00:03:01.140> may<00:03:01.380> be<00:03:01.500> partitioned<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.100> or

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
probably may be partitioned it or

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.830 
probably may be partitioned it or
something<00:03:02.489> but<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.180> figured<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.690> know<00:03:03.720> I

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
something but I figured you know I

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.880 
something but I figured you know I
didn't<00:03:04.140> wanna<00:03:04.260> mess<00:03:04.380> around<00:03:04.410> with<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.800> too

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
didn't wanna mess around with it too

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.580 
didn't wanna mess around with it too
much<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.550> bought<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.420> said<00:03:06.600> but<00:03:07.440> look

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
much so I bought that and said but look

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.900 
much so I bought that and said but look
into<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:07.890> more<00:03:07.920> if<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.250> want<00:03:08.280> because<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.670> think

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
into it more if you want because I think

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.940 
into it more if you want because I think
you<00:03:09.000> probably<00:03:09.150> can't<00:03:09.540> do<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.800> make<00:03:10.920> it

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
you probably can't do it and to make it

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.530 
you probably can't do it and to make it
as<00:03:11.130> an<00:03:11.250> external<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.880> know<00:03:12.000> Warren<00:03:12.300> his<00:03:12.390> high

a<00:03:44.280> basic<00:03:44.730> print<00:03:45.060> function<00:03:45.299> so<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.780> could<00:03:45.989> tell

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
a basic print function so I could tell

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.920

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
the document from you know office or you

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.680 
the document from you know office or you
know<00:03:49.280> pages<00:03:50.280> animal<00:03:50.700> print<00:03:50.940> straight<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.660> to

this<00:03:52.560> here<00:03:52.830> come<00:03:53.310> out<00:03:53.459> fine<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:54.959> know<00:03:55.049> I

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
this here come out fine but you know I

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.080 
this here come out fine but you know I
figured<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.500> might<00:03:55.769> as<00:03:55.830> well<00:03:55.980> try<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.190> Wi-Fi<00:03:56.610> the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
figured I might as well try to Wi-Fi the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.810 
figured I might as well try to Wi-Fi the
HP<00:03:57.480> zone<00:03:58.019> Wi-Fi<00:03:58.500> stuff<00:03:58.799> and<00:03:59.040> don't<00:03:59.400> work<00:03:59.610> even

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
HP zone Wi-Fi stuff and don't work even

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.500 
HP zone Wi-Fi stuff and don't work even
better<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.209> i<00:04:00.450> bypassed<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:02.239> time<00:04:03.239> capsule

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
better so i bypassed the time capsule

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.210 
better so i bypassed the time capsule
which<00:04:03.780> i<00:04:03.870> didn't<00:04:04.230> think<00:04:04.260> i<00:04:04.470> would<00:04:04.530> do<00:04:04.799> but<00:04:05.160> i

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
which i didn't think i would do but i

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.280 
which i didn't think i would do but i
did<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.640> end<00:04:05.820> so<00:04:06.120> but<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.780> did<00:04:06.900> work<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:07.260> a
