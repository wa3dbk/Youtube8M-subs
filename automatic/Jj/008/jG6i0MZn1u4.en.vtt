Wow<00:02:47.790> two<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.630> row<00:02:48.840> very<00:02:49.290> lucky<00:02:49.739> right<00:02:49.950> now

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.010 

not<00:02:53.730> enough<00:02:53.970> materials<00:02:54.480> go<00:02:54.690> any<00:02:54.810> further

not enough materials go any further
we'll<00:02:55.350> probably<00:02:55.500> have<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.770> go<00:02:55.920> hunting<00:02:56.220> for

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
we'll probably have to go hunting for

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.460 
we'll probably have to go hunting for
them<00:02:56.520> right<00:02:56.760> after<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.270> dodge<00:02:57.810> I'll<00:02:58.230> have<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
them right after this dodge I'll have to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.229 
them right after this dodge I'll have to
change<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.980> out<00:02:59.010> because<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.610> like<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.910> get<00:03:00.030> HP

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
change that out because I like to get HP

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.290 
change that out because I like to get HP
in<00:03:00.690> this<00:03:00.900> slot<00:03:01.140> right<00:03:01.200> here

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.060 

HP<00:03:06.300> awesome<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.110> second<00:03:07.440> slot<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.920> won't

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
HP awesome in the second slot so I won't

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.550 
HP awesome in the second slot so I won't
have<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.340> go<00:03:08.610> get<00:03:08.760> that

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.500 

all<00:03:12.130> right<00:03:12.490> we're<00:03:12.640> going<00:03:12.790> through<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.209> not

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
all right we're going through this not

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.449 
all right we're going through this not
enough<00:03:13.660> material<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:14.440> we're<00:03:14.590> gonna<00:03:14.680> do<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:14.980> lot

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
enough material so we're gonna do a lot

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.420 
enough material so we're gonna do a lot
of<00:03:15.569> hunting<00:03:16.569> for<00:03:17.170> sure<00:03:17.350> critical<00:03:17.950> rate<00:03:18.220> I'll

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
of hunting for sure critical rate I'll

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.000 
of hunting for sure critical rate I'll
keep<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:22.230> attack<00:03:23.230> speed<00:03:23.620> I'll<00:03:23.800> probably

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
keep that attack speed I'll probably

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.720 
keep that attack speed I'll probably
change<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.790> one<00:03:25.030> out<00:03:25.800> just<00:03:26.800> because<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.280> like

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
change that one out just because I like

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.670 
change that one out just because I like
to<00:03:27.910> swap<00:03:28.180> my<00:03:28.360> characters<00:03:28.900> out<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.410> know<00:03:29.500> all

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
to swap my characters out you know all

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.790 
to swap my characters out you know all
the<00:03:29.950> time<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.610> prefer<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.750> have<00:03:31.989> abilities

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
the time and I prefer to have abilities

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.500 
the time and I prefer to have abilities
that<00:03:33.190> are<00:03:33.370> beneficial<00:03:33.730> even<00:03:34.000> if<00:03:34.300> there's

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
that are beneficial even if there's

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.809 
that are beneficial even if there's
strikers<00:03:35.140> or<00:03:35.770> if<00:03:36.069> I'm<00:03:36.220> just<00:03:36.459> using<00:03:36.640> my

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
strikers or if I'm just using my

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.820 
strikers or if I'm just using my
specials<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:37.810> that's<00:03:38.140> just<00:03:38.319> kind<00:03:38.650> of<00:03:38.739> a

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
specials so that's just kind of a

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.680 
specials so that's just kind of a
personal<00:03:39.280> preference<00:03:39.580> let's<00:03:40.060> change<00:03:40.390> out

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
personal preference let's change out

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.820 
personal preference let's change out
this<00:03:42.330> physical<00:03:43.330> attack<00:03:43.720> by<00:03:43.930> level<00:03:44.350> just<00:03:44.680> for

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
this physical attack by level just for

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.900 
this physical attack by level just for
the<00:03:44.920> sake<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.130> video<00:03:45.459> I'm<00:03:45.640> gonna<00:03:45.760> leave<00:03:45.880> that

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
the sake of video I'm gonna leave that

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.590 
the sake of video I'm gonna leave that
first<00:03:46.360> slot<00:03:46.660> alone<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:48.580> probably<00:03:49.090> will

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
first slot alone and I probably will

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.990 
first slot alone and I probably will
just<00:03:49.660> leave<00:03:50.140> if<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.470> goes<00:03:50.739> energy<00:03:51.070> attack<00:03:51.670> but

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
just leave if it goes energy attack but

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.479 
just leave if it goes energy attack but
all<00:03:52.180> attack<00:03:52.540> would<00:03:52.690> be<00:03:52.750> ideal<00:03:53.530> right<00:03:53.860> here<00:03:54.220> and

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
all attack would be ideal right here and

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.790 
all attack would be ideal right here and
later<00:03:55.090> I'm<00:03:55.330> going<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:55.720> go<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:56.290> change<00:03:56.500> it

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
later I'm going to go in and change it

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.590 
later I'm going to go in and change it
but<00:03:57.010> for<00:03:57.190> right<00:03:57.220> now<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.850> think<00:03:57.910> I'm<00:03:58.269> just<00:03:58.300> going

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
but for right now I think I'm just going

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.150 
but for right now I think I'm just going
to<00:03:58.690> be<00:03:58.810> happy<00:03:59.200> if<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.380> can<00:03:59.560> get<00:03:59.709> an<00:03:59.830> energy

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
to be happy if I can get an energy

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.550 
to be happy if I can get an energy
attack<00:04:00.670> just<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.360> straight<00:04:01.630> energy<00:04:02.019> attack<00:04:02.319> one

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
attack just a straight energy attack one

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.500 
attack just a straight energy attack one
for<00:04:02.769> this<00:04:02.890> video<00:04:03.190> be<00:04:03.459> fine

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.820 

all<00:04:07.510> right<00:04:07.750> we'll<00:04:07.959> just<00:04:08.019> leave<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.350> there<00:04:08.620> with

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
all right we'll just leave it there with

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.100 
all right we'll just leave it there with
the<00:04:08.920> energy<00:04:09.340> attack<00:04:09.640> that's<00:04:09.970> not<00:04:10.180> optimal<00:04:10.900> but

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
the energy attack that's not optimal but

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.110 
the energy attack that's not optimal but
that's<00:04:11.230> fine<00:04:11.380> all<00:04:11.739> defense<00:04:12.160> is<00:04:12.400> great<00:04:12.760> and

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
that's fine all defense is great and

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.539 
that's fine all defense is great and
we'll<00:04:13.420> change<00:04:13.600> this<00:04:13.810> first<00:04:14.080> slot<00:04:14.410> to<00:04:14.709> get<00:04:14.890> HP

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
we'll change this first slot to get HP

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:23.190 
we'll change this first slot to get HP
by<00:04:16.209> level<00:04:16.750> or<00:04:17.019> just<00:04:17.320> straight<00:04:17.650> HP<00:04:21.090> HP<00:04:22.090> by<00:04:22.750> level

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
by level or just straight HP HP by level

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.020 
by level or just straight HP HP by level
that's<00:04:23.410> actually<00:04:23.950> a<00:04:23.979> little<00:04:24.190> better<00:04:24.370> than<00:04:24.669> HP

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
that's actually a little better than HP

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.060 
that's actually a little better than HP
