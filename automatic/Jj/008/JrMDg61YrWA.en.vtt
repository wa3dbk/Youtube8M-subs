now<00:00:19.460> this<00:00:19.580> is<00:00:19.730> a<00:00:19.760> starter<00:00:20.210> kit<00:00:20.450> comes<00:00:20.960> with<00:00:21.050> two

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
now this is a starter kit comes with two

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.620 
now this is a starter kit comes with two
adapters<00:00:21.529> they're<00:00:21.950> both<00:00:22.160> identical<00:00:22.480> rated<00:00:23.480> up

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
adapters they're both identical rated up

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.870 
adapters they're both identical rated up
to<00:00:23.689> 500<00:00:24.470> mega<00:00:24.650> bits<00:00:24.860> as<00:00:25.130> you<00:00:25.279> can<00:00:25.430> see<00:00:25.610> they're

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
to 500 mega bits as you can see they're

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.050 
to 500 mega bits as you can see they're
low<00:00:26.689> power<00:00:27.140> consumption<00:00:28.070> when<00:00:28.369> it's<00:00:28.550> an<00:00:28.640> idle

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060

comes<00:00:48.890> with<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.100> two<00:00:49.370> Ethernet<00:00:49.969> cables<00:00:50.329> that

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
comes with the two Ethernet cables that

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.450 
comes with the two Ethernet cables that
you<00:00:50.540> would<00:00:50.660> need<00:00:50.750> for<00:00:50.960> either<00:00:51.140> adapter<00:00:51.829> okay

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
you would need for either adapter okay

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.410 
you would need for either adapter okay
it<00:00:52.579> doesn't<00:00:52.730> matter<00:00:52.969> which<00:00:53.090> one<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:53.329> use

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
it doesn't matter which one you use

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.240 
it doesn't matter which one you use
they're<00:00:53.780> both<00:00:53.960> interchangeable<00:00:54.710> it<00:00:54.890> both

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
they're both interchangeable it both

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.430 
they're both interchangeable it both
identical<00:00:55.790> so<00:00:56.149> it's<00:00:56.930> just<00:00:57.050> a<00:00:57.200> matter<00:00:57.350> of

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
identical so it's just a matter of

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.470 
identical so it's just a matter of
setting<00:00:57.649> it<00:00:57.860> up<00:00:57.950> properly<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:58.610> plugging<00:00:59.360> it

have to do is take one of those adapters
plug<00:01:37.040> in<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.220> ethernet<00:01:37.610> cable<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.119> plug<00:01:38.299> it

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
plug in the ethernet cable and plug it

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.749 
plug in the ethernet cable and plug it
into<00:01:38.720> your<00:01:39.080> router<00:01:39.409> okay<00:01:39.950> that's<00:01:40.130> step<00:01:40.460> one

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
into your router okay that's step one

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.380 
into your router okay that's step one
all<00:01:41.360> right<00:01:41.540> don't<00:01:42.020> plug<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.350> into<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:43.670> power

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
all right don't plug it into a power

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.510 
all right don't plug it into a power
adapter<00:01:44.630> bar<00:01:45.200> by<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.560> way<00:01:45.740> plug<00:01:46.009> it<00:01:46.130> plug<00:01:46.159> the

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
adapter bar by the way plug it plug the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.270 
adapter bar by the way plug it plug the
adapter<00:01:46.610> straight<00:01:47.360> into<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.720> wall<00:01:47.840> socket

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
adapter straight into the wall socket

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.749 
adapter straight into the wall socket
okay<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:49.790> after<00:01:50.030> you've<00:01:50.360> plugged<00:01:51.320> that<00:01:51.439> into

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
okay so after you've plugged that into

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.870 
okay so after you've plugged that into
your<00:01:52.960> your<00:01:53.960> router<00:01:54.560> then<00:01:55.159> you'll<00:01:55.460> have<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.759> hit

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
your your router then you'll have to hit

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
works but the building construction of

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.310 
works but the building construction of
this<00:02:01.310> little<00:02:01.610> adapter<00:02:01.820> is<00:02:02.240> solid<00:02:02.750> okay<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.200> do

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
this little adapter is solid okay I do

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.020 
this little adapter is solid okay I do
like<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:03.799> has<00:02:03.890> some<00:02:03.920> ventilation<00:02:04.369> in<00:02:04.790> there

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
like it has some ventilation in there

everything looks solid strong
construction<00:02:08.899> which<00:02:09.350> is<00:02:09.470> good<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:09.950> course

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
construction which is good and of course

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.470 
construction which is good and of course
you've<00:02:10.310> got<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.579> LEDs<00:02:10.970> for<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.239> power

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
you've got the LEDs for the power

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.560 
you've got the LEDs for the power
ethernet<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.680> data<00:02:12.950> now<00:02:13.640> let's<00:02:14.209> look<00:02:14.420> at

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
ethernet and the data now let's look at

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.840 
ethernet and the data now let's look at
it<00:02:14.720> here<00:02:14.870> I've<00:02:15.019> plugged<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.440> in<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.799> got<00:02:16.340> one<00:02:16.610> end

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
it here I've plugged it in I got one end

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.240 
it here I've plugged it in I got one end
of<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.090> ethernet<00:02:17.510> connected<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.530> rj45

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
of the ethernet connected to the rj45

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.910 
of the ethernet connected to the rj45
plug<00:02:19.549> there<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.150> other<00:02:20.390> end<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.739> going

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
plug there the other end of it is going

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.890 
plug there the other end of it is going
to<00:02:21.980> go<00:02:22.069> all<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.400> way<00:02:22.430> up<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.730> my<00:02:22.819> router<00:02:23.090> which

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
to go all the way up to my router which

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.390 
to go all the way up to my router which
is<00:02:24.050> just<00:02:24.470> beside<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.010> basically<00:02:25.400> and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
is just beside it basically and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.910 
is just beside it basically and
that's<00:02:27.090> step<00:02:27.450> one<00:02:27.720> okay<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.260> plugging<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.799> into

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
that's step one okay so plugging it into

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.949 
that's step one okay so plugging it into
your<00:02:29.129> router<00:02:29.340> there's<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.180> black<00:02:30.360> cable<00:02:30.629> on

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
your router there's the black cable on

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.589 
your router there's the black cable on
the<00:02:31.110> left<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.879> that's<00:02:33.090> step<00:02:33.390> one

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
the left and and and that's step one

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.839 
the left and and and that's step one
step<00:02:33.750> two<00:02:33.900> take<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.560> other<00:02:34.739> adapter<00:02:35.310> doesn't

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
step two take the other adapter doesn't

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.039 
step two take the other adapter doesn't
matter<00:02:35.939> which<00:02:36.150> way<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.329> plug<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.689> into<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
matter which way you plug it into the

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.429 
matter which way you plug it into the
into<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.620> wall<00:02:37.799> just<00:02:38.069> plug<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.459> there<00:02:38.640> and

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
into the wall just plug it in there and

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.350 
into the wall just plug it in there and
once<00:02:40.439> it's<00:02:40.709> connected<00:02:41.370> there<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:41.879> powered<00:02:42.239> up

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
once it's connected there and powered up

and<00:03:33.389> it<00:03:33.480> detected<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.109> powerline<00:03:35.010> device

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
and it detected the powerline device

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.670 
and it detected the powerline device
there<00:03:35.699> and<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.150> quality<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.629> and<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.470> gave<00:03:37.650> me

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
there and the quality and and it gave me

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.369 
there and the quality and and it gave me
some<00:03:37.799> megabits<00:03:38.340> there<00:03:38.940> as<00:03:39.209> well<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:40.049> can<00:03:40.199> set

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
some megabits there as well you can set

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.559 
some megabits there as well you can set
up<00:03:40.500> an<00:03:40.650> internal<00:03:41.220> network<00:03:41.579> between<00:03:41.909> the<00:03:42.419> two

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
up an internal network between the two

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.140 
up an internal network between the two
adapters<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.549> you<00:03:44.549> can<00:03:44.699> do<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.909> as<00:03:45.120> well

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
adapters so you can do that as well

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.970 
adapters so you can do that as well
instead<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.659> password<00:03:46.109> which<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.349> nice<00:03:46.590> i'm

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
instead of password which is nice i'm

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.729 
instead of password which is nice i'm
using<00:03:47.549> my<00:03:47.699> default<00:03:48.540> local<00:03:48.930> area<00:03:49.199> network<00:03:49.500> so

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
using my default local area network so

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.349 
using my default local area network so
there's<00:03:50.040> no<00:03:50.220> security<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.909> between<00:03:51.239> the

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
there's no security in between the

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.039 
there's no security in between the
adapters<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:51.989> i<00:03:52.889> ran<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.940> speedtest<00:03:54.299> basically

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
adapters and i ran a speedtest basically

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.309 
adapters and i ran a speedtest basically
so<00:03:55.229> i<00:03:55.260> went<00:03:55.560> online<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:56.690> speedtest.net<00:03:57.690> and

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
so i went online to speedtest.net and

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.039 
so i went online to speedtest.net and
did<00:03:58.859> a<00:03:58.889> quick<00:03:59.190> speed<00:03:59.549> test<00:03:59.819> to<00:04:00.030> see<00:04:00.239> how<00:04:00.750> fast

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
did a quick speed test to see how fast

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.309 
did a quick speed test to see how fast
it<00:04:01.290> performed<00:04:01.799> indeed<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:03.379> met<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:06.319> speeds

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
it performed indeed it met the speeds

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.170 
it performed indeed it met the speeds

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
that my internet service provider

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.360 
that my internet service provider
advertises<00:04:10.019> I<00:04:10.139> should<00:04:10.470> be<00:04:10.590> getting<00:04:10.859> so<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.069> got
