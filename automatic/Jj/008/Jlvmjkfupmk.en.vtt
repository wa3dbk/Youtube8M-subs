interplant on my list is java fern java
fern<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> very<00:00:56.670> simple<00:00:57.059> plant<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.449> take<00:00:57.629> care

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
fern is a very simple plant to take care

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.310 
fern is a very simple plant to take care
of<00:00:57.899> its<00:00:58.739> lighting<00:00:59.489> knees<00:00:59.760> are<00:00:59.969> very

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
of its lighting knees are very

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.640 
of its lighting knees are very
undemanding<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.210> it's<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.350> don't<00:01:04.439> need

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
undemanding and it's just you don't need

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.350 
undemanding and it's just you don't need
any<00:01:04.830> special<00:01:06.530> fertilizers<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.920> any<00:01:08.460> special

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
any special fertilizers or any special

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.780 
any special fertilizers or any special
substrate<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.170> thing<00:01:10.380> it'll<00:01:11.100> just

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
substrate for this thing it'll just

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.730 
substrate for this thing it'll just
attach<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.900> throw<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.380> anywhere

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
attach it I just throw it in anywhere

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.969 
attach it I just throw it in anywhere
and<00:01:13.799> it'll<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.189> happy<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:16.530> next<00:01:16.740> thing

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and it'll be happy so the next thing

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.460 
and it'll be happy so the next thing
that<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.400> closely<00:01:18.240> related<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.840> John<00:01:19.170> friend

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that is closely related to John friend

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.420 
that is closely related to John friend
is<00:01:19.590> an<00:01:20.780> anubius<00:01:21.810> anubius<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.220> there

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is an anubius anubius is right up there

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.600 
is an anubius anubius is right up there
and<00:01:24.020> it's<00:01:25.020> also<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.619> very<00:01:25.710> simple<00:01:26.310> plant<00:01:26.490> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and it's also a very simple plant to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.660 
and it's also a very simple plant to
take<00:01:26.700> care<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.330> actually<00:01:27.630> put<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> on

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
take care of you can actually put it on

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.980 
take care of you can actually put it on
to<00:01:29.670> your<00:01:29.820> substrate<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.570> risk<00:01:30.810> will

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
to your substrate and this risk will

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.440 
to your substrate and this risk will
kind<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.290> dig<00:01:31.560> down<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.159> but<00:01:32.450> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
kind of dig down in there but you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.760 
kind of dig down in there but you
definitely<00:01:33.659> don't<00:01:33.960> want<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.200> plant<00:01:34.560> these

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
definitely don't want to plant these

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.560 
definitely don't want to plant these
plants<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.280> down<00:01:35.460> deep<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.060> your<00:01:36.150> substrate

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
plants and down deep in your substrate

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.840 
plants and down deep in your substrate
due<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.590> fact<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.979> they<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.310> rhizomes

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
due to the fact that they have rhizomes

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.600 
due to the fact that they have rhizomes
and<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:40.020> rhizomes<00:01:40.409> are<00:01:40.650> where<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.159> Leafs

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and the rhizomes are where the Leafs

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.090 
and the rhizomes are where the Leafs
come<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.450> by<00:01:43.259> planting<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.770> down<00:01:43.950> in

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
come out of and by planting it down in

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.100 
come out of and by planting it down in
your<00:01:44.130> substrate<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.390> rhizomes<00:01:45.810> are<00:01:45.960> just

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
your substrate the rhizomes are just

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.679 
your substrate the rhizomes are just
going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> end<00:01:46.439> up<00:01:46.500> rotting<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.689> eventually

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
going to end up rotting and eventually

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.539 
going to end up rotting and eventually
killing<00:01:49.049> off<00:01:49.229> your<00:01:49.409> plant<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.920> that's<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.520> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
killing off your plant and that's what I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.520 
killing off your plant and that's what I
did<00:01:50.759> when<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.909> first<00:01:50.970> had<00:01:51.329> John<00:01:51.570> fern<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
did when I first had John fern when I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.010 
did when I first had John fern when I
was<00:01:52.619> first<00:01:52.770> getting<00:01:52.950> into<00:01:53.159> playing<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> tanks

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
was first getting into playing the tanks

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.490 
was first getting into playing the tanks
so<00:01:55.020> next<00:01:56.600> next<00:01:57.600> plant<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:57.899> have<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.320> list

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
so next next plant we have on the list

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.950 
so next next plant we have on the list
is<00:01:58.680> cryptic<00:01:59.280> Orion<00:01:59.930> green<00:02:01.130> wind<00:02:02.130> time<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:03.719> this

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
is cryptic Orion green wind time so this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.929 
is cryptic Orion green wind time so this
plane<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.320> also<00:02:04.619> very<00:02:04.799> simple<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.310> take<00:02:05.520> care

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
plane is also very simple to take care

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.969 
plane is also very simple to take care
of<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.520> grow<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.819> basically

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
of it's it it can grow on basically

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.020 
of it's it it can grow on basically
barely<00:02:10.979> any<00:02:11.129> light<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:12.209> very

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
barely any light it's very

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.270 
barely any light it's very
demanding<00:02:13.630> other<00:02:13.870> than<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.350> does<00:02:14.830> have<00:02:15.040> some

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
demanding other than it does have some

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.590 
demanding other than it does have some
nice<00:02:16.060> nice<00:02:16.690> root<00:02:17.020> systems<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:17.950> they<00:02:18.850> can<00:02:19.420> be

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
your tank and it'll just go wild so I've

make it grow up and one of the things I

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.470 
make it grow up and one of the things I
do<00:03:47.380> suggest<00:03:47.769> for<00:03:48.130> an<00:03:48.340> Acuras<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.120> want<00:03:49.299> it<00:03:49.359> to

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
do suggest for an Acuras you want it to

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.390 
do suggest for an Acuras you want it to
grow<00:03:49.630> just<00:03:50.410> like<00:03:50.530> any<00:03:50.709> of<00:03:50.829> your<00:03:50.980> other<00:03:51.040> plants

grow just like any of your other plants
that<00:03:51.700> don't<00:03:52.120> really<00:03:52.420> need<00:03:52.570> any<00:03:53.850> fertilization

that don't really need any fertilization
from<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.180> roots<00:03:55.420> like<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.870> Nubia<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.470> java

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220

I<00:04:04.890> do<00:04:05.890> give<00:04:06.579> this<00:04:06.730> tank<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.209> dosing<00:04:07.630> of<00:04:09.750> some<00:04:11.010> API

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
I do give this tank a dosing of some API

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.449 
I do give this tank a dosing of some API
leaf<00:04:13.030> stone<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.630> that<00:04:14.560> seems<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:14.859> work<00:04:14.950> fairly

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
leaf stone and that seems to work fairly

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.860 
leaf stone and that seems to work fairly
well<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:17.519> like<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:18.609> was<00:04:18.729> saying<00:04:18.880> -<00:04:19.390> what<00:04:19.840> I

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
well and and like I was saying - what I

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.870 
well and and like I was saying - what I
suggest<00:04:20.260> when<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.440> get<00:04:20.590> any<00:04:20.769> Macker<00:04:21.070> is<00:04:21.280> is<00:04:21.519> to

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
suggest when you get any Macker is is to

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.310 
suggest when you get any Macker is is to
float<00:04:22.090> at<00:04:22.270> your<00:04:22.419> top<00:04:22.570> for<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.810> while<00:04:22.990> let<00:04:23.200> it

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
float at your top for a while let it

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.200 
float at your top for a while let it
develop<00:04:23.590> some<00:04:23.890> roots<00:04:24.130> because<00:04:24.700> he<00:04:24.820> might<00:04:25.000> have

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
develop some roots because he might have

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.159 
develop some roots because he might have
some<00:04:25.390> roots<00:04:25.630> back

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
some roots back

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.129 
some roots back
if<00:04:26.409> I<00:04:26.499> can<00:04:26.680> get<00:04:26.800> it<00:04:26.919> there<00:04:27.210> we<00:04:28.210> go<00:04:28.389> and<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.020> can

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
that's that and another plant that I did

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.379 
that's that and another plant that I did
have<00:05:34.330> before<00:05:34.479> is<00:05:35.490> water<00:05:36.490> wisteria<00:05:36.699> that<00:05:37.210> plane

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
up and that's where that plane when it's

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
requirements for them and they can't

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.360 
requirements for them and they can't
take<00:06:03.069> over<00:06:03.250> your<00:06:03.460> tank<00:06:04.830> another<00:06:05.830> plant<00:06:06.099> that<00:06:06.189> I

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
take over your tank another plant that I

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.040 
take over your tank another plant that I
might<00:06:07.060> be<00:06:07.180> thinking<00:06:07.300> about<00:06:07.599> getting<00:06:07.719> pretty

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
might be thinking about getting pretty

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.320 
might be thinking about getting pretty
soon<00:06:08.229> here<00:06:08.469> is<00:06:08.620> some<00:06:09.310> duck<00:06:09.819> weed<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.300> that

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
soon here is some duck weed and that

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.070 
soon here is some duck weed and that
stuff<00:06:11.199> is<00:06:11.379> very<00:06:12.330> very<00:06:13.330> good<00:06:13.599> at<00:06:13.689> absorbing

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
stuff is very very good at absorbing

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.129 
stuff is very very good at absorbing
nitrates<00:06:14.740> Anala<00:06:15.039> and<00:06:15.419> just<00:06:16.419> purifying<00:06:16.960> your

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
nitrates Anala and just purifying your

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.529 
nitrates Anala and just purifying your
water<00:06:17.379> but<00:06:18.009> one<00:06:18.219> drawback<00:06:18.430> to<00:06:18.789> that<00:06:18.819> is<00:06:19.149> that

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
water but one drawback to that is that

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.559 
water but one drawback to that is that
it<00:06:19.810> can<00:06:19.870> block<00:06:20.560> out<00:06:20.740> a<00:06:20.770> bunch<00:06:21.189> of<00:06:21.310> light<00:06:21.569> which

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569 
it can block out a bunch of light which

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:23.969 
it can block out a bunch of light which
can<00:06:22.750> be<00:06:22.930> good<00:06:23.080> depending<00:06:23.319> on<00:06:23.649> what<00:06:23.830> you're

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
can be good depending on what you're

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.790 
can be good depending on what you're
looking<00:06:24.069> for<00:06:24.370> and<00:06:24.990> it<00:06:25.990> can<00:06:26.199> just<00:06:26.319> take<00:06:26.409> over

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
looking for and it can just take over

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.110 
looking for and it can just take over
and<00:06:27.039> just<00:06:27.189> get<00:06:27.399> stuck<00:06:27.669> in<00:06:27.819> all<00:06:27.909> your<00:06:28.089> other
