00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
version of an oil entered here we have a

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.299 
version of an oil entered here we have a
quarter<00:00:34.580> pint<00:00:34.870> mason<00:00:35.870> jar<00:00:36.080> we<00:00:36.710> ever<00:00:36.830> wick<00:00:37.130> in

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
quarter pint mason jar we ever wick in

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.030 
quarter pint mason jar we ever wick in
there<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:37.940> it's<00:00:38.150> been<00:00:38.360> trimmed<00:00:38.720> to<00:00:39.650> a<00:00:39.680> point

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
there and it's been trimmed to a point

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.170 
there and it's been trimmed to a point
and<00:00:40.340> we're<00:00:40.460> just<00:00:40.580> going<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.879> pull<00:00:41.059> it<00:00:41.150> down

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
and we're just going to pull it down

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.100 
and we're just going to pull it down
through<00:00:41.750> there<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:43.059> it<00:00:44.059> has<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.660> rough<00:00:44.840> side

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
through there and it has the rough side

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.380 
through there and it has the rough side
edges<00:00:45.410> out<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.460> we<00:00:46.640> want<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:46.970> rough<00:00:47.150> side

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
edges out so we want the rough side

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
edges out so we want the rough side
edges<00:00:47.690> on<00:00:47.989> this<00:00:48.230> one<00:00:48.470> up<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.930> rough<00:00:51.140> edges

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
edges on this one up and the rough edges

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.970 
edges on this one up and the rough edges
inside<00:00:52.100> out<00:00:52.550> help<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.750> wick<00:00:53.960> from<00:00:54.470> slipping

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
inside out help the wick from slipping

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.280 
inside out help the wick from slipping
down<00:00:55.190> into<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.000> jar<00:00:56.269> and<00:00:56.600> potentially

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
down into the jar and potentially

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.219 
down into the jar and potentially
causing<00:00:57.769> a<00:00:57.920> fire<00:00:58.659> I've<00:00:59.659> never<00:00:59.900> had<00:01:00.080> it<00:01:00.199> happen

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
causing a fire I've never had it happen

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.700 
causing a fire I've never had it happen
but<00:01:01.100> that's<00:01:01.309> not<00:01:01.610> to<00:01:01.790> say<00:01:02.000> it<00:01:02.210> wouldn't<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:03.470> now

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
but that's not to say it wouldn't so now

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.690 
but that's not to say it wouldn't so now
we<00:01:03.769> have<00:01:04.250> lid<00:01:04.729> number<00:01:05.059> two<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:06.490> see<00:01:07.490> how<00:01:07.640> the

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
we have lid number two and see how the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.840 
we have lid number two and see how the
rough<00:01:07.940> edges<00:01:08.180> are<00:01:08.960> up<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:10.100> we're<00:01:10.520> going<00:01:10.700> to

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
rough edges are up and we're going to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.210 
rough edges are up and we're going to
slide<00:01:11.240> that<00:01:11.270> right<00:01:11.990> over<00:01:12.440> our<00:01:12.650> little<00:01:13.040> wick

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
slide that right over our little wick

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.940 
slide that right over our little wick

and you want just enough wick showing

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.550 
and you want just enough wick showing

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
that when you need to pull the candle up

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.649 
that when you need to pull the candle up
the<00:01:18.890> wick<00:01:19.100> up<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.909> can<00:01:20.060> grab<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:20.299> with<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.600> pair

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
the wick up you can grab it with a pair

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.320 
the wick up you can grab it with a pair
of<00:01:21.020> needle<00:01:21.619> nose<00:01:21.770> pliers<00:01:21.909> but<00:01:22.909> of<00:01:23.000> course

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
of needle nose pliers but of course

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.500 
of needle nose pliers but of course
people<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:24.320> course<00:01:25.100> blow<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.670> out<00:01:25.820> first

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510
