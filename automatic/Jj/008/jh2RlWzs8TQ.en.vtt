00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.550
 we assume that it will be the new Spanish 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.850
 then let's make a bet let's go 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.320

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.309

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.739
 cars words 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.050
 when cleaning windshield dresses 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.320
 'batman and robin' that is one will win and 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.600
 two wins lose I 'm going to tell you the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.370
 most talked about candidates and we're going to 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.020
 discuss a little bit and we already chose the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.809
 which suits us more 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.330
 the first steven smith who is the son 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.490
 of will smith playing more 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.100
 morals instead of a peter pan 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.410
 Aha as you think they can have that 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.680
 option not what then 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.390
 jaden smith we eliminated it was not one 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.350
 of the candidates also more more 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:25.930
 strong is logan lerman percy jackson the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.930
 that goes worse and that no way 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.210
 he is also one of the most 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.070
 strong at three we like quite a lot 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.640
 Andrew Garfield I was also the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.640
 skills 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.580
 I do not think the part say that you see in the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.259
 vision of the tips according to marvel 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.970
 to organize this spider-man test and 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.770
 in wind and it came then that I 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.409
 I think they're not going to hire him for that 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.509
 I feel ugly for him because it was done 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.880
 super fan of young children there is a photo 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.110
 on your screen right now you're andrew 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.180
 garfield the little tracing 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.190
 spider-man and it was the comic-con and fuck and 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 I fulfilled my dream of being the spiderman 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.780
 I feel he has done for him because he 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.899
 finished the third and sonia I had a choice 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.370
 to make a contract with marvel because 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.370
 can not enroll the character 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.459
 and the other is michael algae swims 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.439
 it does not do not look like the brain also 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.270
 the strongest candidates without 'the 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.570
 cool 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.540
 no massify accommodate 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.140
 marijuana one of the favorite ones of 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.730
 charlie 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.730
 they are the games of hunger 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.120
 appointment has face that they have to save 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.780
 good another of the candidates I'm not 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.780
 allowing is antón walking and how is 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.620
 mom 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.890
 another one of the strongest candidates or you 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.960
 they stood up lerman and tyrants ryan who is 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.840
 you know him for being the one of mails 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.450
 runner and I also think it's one of my 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.960
 favorites I'm thinking seriously 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.880
 in showing on the web does not act so cool 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.560
 so I think that if I would need 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.510
 just like logan lerman with a good 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.220
 training and good one of those too 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.870
 of the freddie highmore candidates that 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.440

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.920

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.650
 walking the rumors that say it is 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.250

 where as a basis for putting our plan 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.919
