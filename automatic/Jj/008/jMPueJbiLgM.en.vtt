00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello friends first of all I want 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.700
 thank you are watching this video 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.920
 because this week we celebrate the first 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.690
 year of life of bundling bando and not 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.240
 it would be possible if in some host that 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.130
 you have given in the tutorial videos 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.500
 so I'd like us to do a 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.960
 toast this year and for those who 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.789
 I hope they keep coming and can not 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.670
 have a toast if we do not have a 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.859
 bottle so this baas video tutorial 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.309
 about wrapping a gift bottle 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.660
 does not have any difficulty simply 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.040
 we are going to need 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.900
 a piece of napkin and a ribbon that 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.040
 is what we will do to you, it does not have anything 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:50.400
 more we open the napkin completely with 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.400
 the printed part face down 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.829
 we put our bottle in the center 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.129
 we try to always be there that does not 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.820
 is going to move and we started 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.820
 going up one side 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.130
 and making folds holding with the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.150
 finger 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.440
 and making folds 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.440
 everything along 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.730
 we are holding 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.630
 and we turn 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.130
 as you see consists of this simply 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.580
 keep trying not to let go 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.840
 we will put our hands 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.840
 while we keep going up 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.720
 with a paper napkin or paper 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.880
 silk is much easier as a piece of 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.880
 wrapping paper because it is more malleable 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.280
 Now I'm going to turn my hand to follow 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.280
 doing it over here 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.690
 the technique is this which the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.700
 bottle is called larger smaller 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.090
 we are simply doing these 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.090
 folds 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.560
 once we have folded all the paper 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.420
 around the bottle we are going to 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.650
 secure it with a ribbon that we have 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.519
 previously cut it we put it 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.519
 in the table 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.450
 and we lower the bottle
