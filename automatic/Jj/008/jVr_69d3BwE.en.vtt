Douglas<00:01:37.520> made<00:01:37.700> these<00:01:37.880> for<00:01:38.119> special<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:38.750> we

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
Douglas made these for special so we

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.809 
Douglas made these for special so we
could<00:01:38.990> go<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.319> make<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.530> tires<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.670> would

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
could go and make the tires this would

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.480 
could go and make the tires this would
be<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:40.939> 14<00:01:41.359> and<00:01:41.509> a<00:01:41.600> 15<00:01:41.929> inch<00:01:42.109> tire<00:01:42.490> basically

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
be a 14 and a 15 inch tire basically

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.090 
be a 14 and a 15 inch tire basically

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
Baja races that's what the pattern came

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.750 
Baja races that's what the pattern came
from<00:02:12.110> tested<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.870> rhinos<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.049> razors<00:02:15.760> versus

basically our Bighorn and a couple of

basically our Bighorn and a couple of
your<00:02:18.860> pedal<00:02:19.129> tires

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
your pedal tires

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.600 
your pedal tires
very<00:02:21.640> very<00:02:22.209> predictable<00:02:22.989> very<00:02:23.340> good<00:02:24.340> steering

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
very very predictable very good steering

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.030 
very very predictable very good steering
all<00:02:25.120> kinds<00:02:25.420> conditions<00:02:25.900> similar<00:02:26.530> dried<00:02:26.830> it's

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
all kinds conditions similar dried it's

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.240 
all kinds conditions similar dried it's
a<00:02:27.099> radial<00:02:27.430> tire<00:02:28.170> imagine<00:02:29.170> that

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
a radial tire imagine that

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.710 
a radial tire imagine that
serve<00:02:30.490> sidewall<00:02:31.030> probably<00:02:31.420> use<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.570> little

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
serve sidewall probably use a little

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.890 
serve sidewall probably use a little
more<00:02:31.840> strength<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.380> way<00:02:33.330> yeah<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.600> mean<00:02:34.750> it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
more strength that way yeah I mean it

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.300 
more strength that way yeah I mean it
especially<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.800> rate<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.100> construction

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
especially with the rate of construction

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.360 
especially with the rate of construction
you<00:02:36.970> will<00:02:37.000> get<00:02:37.240> that<00:02:37.390> squirm<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:39.280> know

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
you will get that squirm that you know

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.770 
you will get that squirm that you know
with<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:41.010> radial<00:02:42.010> side<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.220> little<00:02:42.750> softer<00:02:43.750> I

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
with the radial side a little softer I

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.120 
with the radial side a little softer I
guess<00:02:44.050> in<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.290> bias<00:02:44.470> for<00:02:44.770> lack<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.100> better

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
guess in the bias for lack of a better

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.330 
guess in the bias for lack of a better
term<00:02:45.340> provides<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.090> lot<00:02:46.240> more<00:02:46.300> stiff<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:48.190> lower

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
term provides a lot more stiff the lower

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.190 
term provides a lot more stiff the lower
profile<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.940> helps<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.970> mean<00:02:52.720> anyone<00:02:52.959> wants<00:02:53.170> to

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
profile it helps I mean anyone wants to

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.449 
profile it helps I mean anyone wants to
check<00:02:53.380> out<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.590> ride<00:02:53.800> out<00:02:53.950> there<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.280> there

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
check out a ride out there that there

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:29.339 
check out a ride out there that there
you<00:02:54.520> go<00:02:56.190> yeah

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.739 

okay<00:03:30.349> one<00:03:30.530> more<00:03:30.680> time
