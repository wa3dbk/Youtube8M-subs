very<00:00:23.820> nice<00:00:24.060> sound<00:00:24.619> especially<00:00:25.619> when<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.130> play

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
very nice sound especially when I play

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.060 
very nice sound especially when I play
it<00:00:26.580> here<00:00:27.500> just<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:28.980> room<00:00:31.070> however

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
it here just here in the room however

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.180 
it here just here in the room however
when<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.730> use<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.290> play<00:00:34.829> through<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
when I use this and play through the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.860 
when I use this and play through the
amplifier<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.590> think<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.710> noticed<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.870> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
amplifier I think I noticed that the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.860 
amplifier I think I noticed that the
sound<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> little<00:00:40.980> bit<00:00:41.300> weaker<00:00:42.300> than<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
sound is a little bit weaker than the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.639 
sound is a little bit weaker than the
other<00:00:44.090> harmonicas<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.649> open

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
other harmonicas you can see it's open

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.369 
other harmonicas you can see it's open
here<00:00:52.370> maybe<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.910> could<00:00:54.149> contribute<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
here maybe that could contribute to the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.569 
here maybe that could contribute to the
weak<00:00:55.590> your<00:00:55.800> song<00:00:58.039> but<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.309> very<00:00:59.460> good

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
weak your song but it's a very good

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.979 
weak your song but it's a very good
sound<00:00:59.969> anyway<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.570> play<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.190> through<00:01:02.190> this

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
sound anyway I play it here through this

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:20.600 
sound anyway I play it here through this
small<00:01:03.989> file<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.430> Thunder<00:01:06.390> Chan<00:01:06.869> 600

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.520 

and<00:01:21.610> of<00:01:21.760> course<00:01:21.970> it's<00:01:22.780> about<00:01:23.020> capping

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
and of course it's about capping

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.650 
and of course it's about capping
technique<00:01:23.860> also<00:01:24.100> I'm<00:01:24.550> not<00:01:24.610> very<00:01:25.210> good<00:01:25.330> at<00:01:25.630> that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
technique also I'm not very good at that

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:33.420 
technique also I'm not very good at that
but<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:27.070> very<00:01:27.280> -<00:01:27.550> very<00:01:29.640> difficult<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:32.430> get

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
but it's very - very difficult to get

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.730 
but it's very - very difficult to get
rid<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.640> these<00:01:33.850> holes<00:01:34.150> by<00:01:35.050> coupling<00:01:35.700> so

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
rid of these holes by coupling so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.710 
rid of these holes by coupling so
compared<00:01:38.740> with<00:01:38.860> another<00:01:39.300> Horner<00:01:40.300> Golden

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
compared with another Horner Golden

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.930 
compared with another Horner Golden
Melody<00:01:40.870> and<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:41.950> can<00:01:42.160> see<00:01:42.340> there<00:01:42.670> are<00:01:42.790> no

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
Melody and you can see there are no

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:55.200 
Melody and you can see there are no
holes<00:01:43.180> there<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:54.040> more<00:01:54.280> bottom<00:01:54.729> it's<00:01:54.940> more

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
holes there it's more bottom it's more

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.620 
holes there it's more bottom it's more
to<00:01:55.660> reach<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:56.020> sound<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.619> I<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.240> cheap

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
to reach a sound so I have the cheap

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.430 
to reach a sound so I have the cheap
solution<00:02:02.110> for<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:03.090> quick<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.300> cheap<00:02:04.450> I<00:02:04.780> use

here in homes
I<00:02:11.430> got<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.520> idea<00:02:12.610> when<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:13.000> saw<00:02:13.300> Monica<00:02:13.989> friend

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
I got the idea when I saw Monica friend

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.300 
I got the idea when I saw Monica friend
he<00:02:14.500> had<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.950> harmonica<00:02:15.489> where<00:02:16.020> there<00:02:17.020> were

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
he had the harmonica where there were

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.180 
he had the harmonica where there were
metallic<00:02:18.310> pieces<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.150> solder<00:02:19.989> here<00:02:20.200> sober<00:02:20.830> no

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
metallic pieces a solder here sober no

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.229 
metallic pieces a solder here sober no
holes<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:24.370> looked<00:02:24.850> like<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.209> a

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
holes so it looked like this this is a

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.940 
holes so it looked like this this is a
owner<00:02:28.540> crossover<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:29.800> similar<00:02:30.190> to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
owner crossover that is similar to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:44.470 
owner crossover that is similar to
Horner<00:02:32.950> Marine<00:02:33.519> Band<00:02:33.670> deluxe<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:35.340> plate

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.250 

I<00:02:48.549> go<00:02:49.549> back<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:51.010> one<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.040> marine<00:02:52.400> Bugalugs

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
I go back to one a marine Bugalugs

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:06.520 
I go back to one a marine Bugalugs
with<00:02:54.260> holes<00:03:03.670> very<00:03:04.670> nice<00:03:04.849> sound<00:03:05.299> but<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.260> think

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
with holes very nice sound but I think

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:19.960 
with holes very nice sound but I think
this<00:03:06.680> is<00:03:06.830> a<00:03:06.860> bit<00:03:07.220> more<00:03:07.430> about<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.640> minute<00:03:18.970> you

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
this is a bit more about a minute you

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.270 
this is a bit more about a minute you
can<00:03:20.120> try<00:03:20.329> yourselves<00:03:20.840> see<00:03:21.200> if<00:03:21.319> you<00:03:21.440> agree<00:03:22.069> with

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
can try yourselves see if you agree with

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.089 
can try yourselves see if you agree with
me<00:03:22.400> or<00:03:22.430> not<00:03:24.579> so<00:03:25.840> here<00:03:26.840> are<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.260> earplugs<00:03:27.769> I'm

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
me or not so here are the earplugs I'm

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.270 
me or not so here are the earplugs I'm
going<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.430> use<00:03:28.579> and<00:03:29.379> they<00:03:30.379> are<00:03:30.410> very<00:03:30.500> soft<00:03:30.890> and

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
going to use and they are very soft and

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.580 
going to use and they are very soft and
when<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.519> push<00:03:31.760> put<00:03:32.209> pressure<00:03:32.540> on<00:03:32.810> them<00:03:33.019> and

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
when you push put pressure on them and

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.190 
when you push put pressure on them and
then<00:03:34.160> put<00:03:34.340> them<00:03:34.370> in<00:03:34.640> your<00:03:34.730> ears<00:03:34.879> and<00:03:37.810> then<00:03:38.810> they

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
then put them in your ears and then they

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.819 
then put them in your ears and then they
will<00:03:39.440> expand<00:03:40.629> so<00:03:41.629> I'm<00:03:41.720> going<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.019> use<00:03:42.230> them<00:03:42.590> on

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
will expand so I'm going to use them on

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.849 
will expand so I'm going to use them on
this<00:03:43.390> very<00:03:44.390> nice

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:24.020 

okay<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.190> have<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.519> cover<00:04:18.480> plates<00:04:18.720> here<00:04:23.030> you

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
okay I have the cover plates here you

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.640 
okay I have the cover plates here you
can<00:04:24.180> see<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.450> hole<00:04:24.630> here<00:04:28.370> and<00:04:29.370> then<00:04:29.730> I<00:04:30.650> put

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
can see the hole here and then I put

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.630 
can see the hole here and then I put
pressure<00:04:31.860> on<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:33.470> then<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.650> stick<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.310> in<00:04:35.400> here

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
pressure on it then I stick it in here

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:46.710 
pressure on it then I stick it in here
so

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.480 

little<00:04:47.410> bit<00:04:47.530> more<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.390> thick<00:04:49.660> end<00:04:49.960> will

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
little bit more so the thick end will

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.120 
little bit more so the thick end will
come<00:04:51.490> in<00:04:51.670> as<00:04:52.210> much<00:04:52.450> as<00:04:52.660> possible<00:04:55.020> okay<00:04:56.130> and

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
come in as much as possible okay and

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.620 
come in as much as possible okay and
then<00:04:57.640> it<00:04:57.760> will<00:04:57.940> expand<00:04:58.830> okay<00:05:00.030> some<00:05:01.030> more<00:05:01.360> maybe

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
then it will expand okay some more maybe

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.360 
then it will expand okay some more maybe
not<00:05:01.960> too<00:05:02.140> much<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:03.430> it<00:05:03.550> will<00:05:03.730> disappear<00:05:05.370> maybe

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
not too much and it will disappear maybe

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:14.390 
not too much and it will disappear maybe
like<00:05:06.610> this<00:05:08.790> okay

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.080 

so<00:05:15.030> we<00:05:15.210> can't<00:05:15.449> have<00:05:15.660> this<00:05:15.840> of<00:05:16.080> course<00:05:16.790> so<00:05:17.790> take

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
so we can't have this of course so take

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:31.270 
so we can't have this of course so take
a<00:05:18.120> sharp<00:05:18.690> knife<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:21.710> cut<00:05:24.199> some<00:05:25.199> peace

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:46.159 

small

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:55.390 

okay<00:05:46.800> like<00:05:47.069> this<00:05:49.520> something<00:05:52.969> maybe<00:05:53.969> you<00:05:54.180> can

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
okay like this something maybe you can

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.580 
okay like this something maybe you can
take<00:05:56.400> away<00:05:56.669> some<00:05:57.150> song<00:05:57.569> here<00:05:57.840> but<00:05:58.110> I<00:05:58.139> don't

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
take away some song here but I don't

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.860 
take away some song here but I don't
think<00:05:58.919> it's<00:05:59.129> it's<00:05:59.669> needed<00:06:00.180> because<00:06:00.300> it's<00:06:00.659> very

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
think it's it's needed because it's very

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.540 
think it's it's needed because it's very
soft<00:06:02.060> it's<00:06:03.060> easy<00:06:03.360> to<00:06:03.800> put<00:06:04.800> this<00:06:04.949> away<00:06:05.249> when<00:06:05.460> you

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
soft it's easy to put this away when you

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:13.420 
soft it's easy to put this away when you
screw<00:06:05.759> it<00:06:05.939> on

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.100 

okay<00:06:14.090> now<00:06:14.300> you<00:06:14.360> have<00:06:14.690> both<00:06:14.930> cover<00:06:15.440> plates<00:06:17.110> with

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
okay now you have both cover plates with

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:28.409 
okay now you have both cover plates with
the<00:06:18.229> earplugs<00:06:18.740> cut<00:06:19.610> away<00:06:20.290> excesses<00:06:21.290> and<00:06:26.919> then

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
the earplugs cut away excesses and then

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.810 
the earplugs cut away excesses and then
maybe<00:06:29.419> you<00:06:29.630> want<00:06:29.750> to<00:06:30.250> push<00:06:31.250> this<00:06:31.490> down<00:06:31.759> a

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
maybe you want to push this down a

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.990 
maybe you want to push this down a
little<00:06:32.000> bit<00:06:32.350> and<00:06:33.370> then<00:06:34.370> you<00:06:34.520> mount<00:06:34.669> it<00:06:34.970> to

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
little bit and then you mount it to

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.590 
little bit and then you mount it to
harmonica<00:06:35.830> make<00:06:36.830> sure<00:06:37.039> you<00:06:37.370> have<00:06:37.940> taken<00:06:38.360> away

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
harmonica make sure you have taken away

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.689 
harmonica make sure you have taken away
enough<00:06:38.960> so<00:06:39.289> it<00:06:39.410> won't<00:06:40.300> interfere<00:06:41.300> with<00:06:41.750> the

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699 
enough so it won't interfere with the

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:49.810 
enough so it won't interfere with the
reeds<00:06:43.699> here<00:06:48.340> it<00:06:49.340> shouldn't<00:06:49.580> be<00:06:49.639> too<00:06:49.789> difficult

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
reeds here it shouldn't be too difficult

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.610 
reeds here it shouldn't be too difficult
to<00:06:50.360> put<00:06:51.080> this<00:06:51.320> together<00:06:51.940> maybe<00:06:52.940> you<00:06:53.090> have<00:06:53.240> to

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
to put this together maybe you have to

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.529 
to put this together maybe you have to
take<00:06:54.620> this<00:06:54.800> away<00:06:54.979> when<00:06:55.430> you<00:06:55.520> screw<00:06:56.330> it

00:06:58.529 --> 00:06:58.539 
take this away when you screw it

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:04.270 
take this away when you screw it
okay<00:06:59.560> now<00:07:00.560> my<00:07:00.979> low<00:07:01.460> C<00:07:01.960> is<00:07:02.960> ready<00:07:03.289> their<00:07:04.130> ear

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
okay now my low C is ready their ear

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.159 
okay now my low C is ready their ear
plugs<00:07:04.610> in<00:07:05.000> or<00:07:05.180> all<00:07:05.750> four<00:07:06.080> holes<00:07:07.810> so<00:07:08.810> it's<00:07:08.990> time

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:09.169 
plugs in or all four holes so it's time

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:14.159 
plugs in or all four holes so it's time
to<00:07:09.199> try<00:07:09.470> it

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:16.199
