 patience good we do this is going to be 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.660
 as a bonus also on how to stick to 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.330
 the wifi of our computer without the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.780
 need a router a router is a 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.730
 device this your purchase is like a 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.480
 modem connects to the computer and 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:44.289
 emits a wireless signal so our 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.539
 this mobile phone this other 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.700
 computers whatever they receive that 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.670
 signal 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.200
 good but now we are going to have wifi to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.840
 through our computer without the 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:00.010
 need for a modem and a modem 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.710
 this hardware moved and literally if 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.470
 we can not virtual what we are going to have 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.510
 well let's start going to my page 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.860
 web he will be in the description of 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.860
 video we are going to download 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.030
 and here we go to the tab 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.030
 programs 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.940
 good what we are here here them 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:31.170
 will leave the link here of the wifi 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.450
 good to play and download 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.799
 here they will be waiting for about five 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.799
 seconds all the advertising 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.979
 but it's only about five seconds more 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.000
 it takes a lot and then they give it here in 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.000
 Missing advertising 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.890
 then he appeared first 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.210
 farc and look at the test weighs almost nothing 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.210
 download it 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.640
 one at a time is downloaded very fast 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.369
 we can execute this once and for all 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.240
 here or go to the download window in 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.580
 our documents and of iu 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.480
 and execute it over there but I'm going to 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.480
 execute for you 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.880

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.450
 had just downloaded but this is the 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.310
 original 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.040
 as you see here this is going to be a 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.500
 executor tele dancing and will start them 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.500

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.450
 this is very weird but we're going to 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.150
 close this and the start program will 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.330
 removed this already appears here an icon that 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.300
 will tell them the guaira is already activated that 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.510
 it will be this window here which 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.980
 let's give real 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.680
 giving you here here we are going to choose a 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.590
 name for our wifi network I already 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.780
 I have one I did not place but I already have one 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.830
 which is called 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.830
 it's called like that 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.930
 ah 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.599
 so it will be called 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.120
 thus I have the password I will not be 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.370
 to show 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.379
 but you have to place one and here 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.909
 confirm the password here can 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.970
 place the network name that you 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.620
 they prefer and then they give it to be put host 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.340
 later they will be loading 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.340
 loading and this something like this will appear 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.820

 another test to see that they serve 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:36.710
 so that it is clear to them we go to the 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.710
 opera mini 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:47.940

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:19.969
 enough proof that it does serve 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:23.359
