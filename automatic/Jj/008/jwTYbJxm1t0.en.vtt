00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 Hello dear friends 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.420
 probably many have heard that galaxy s5 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.760
 can measure your pulse but i think that 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.130
 Now Korea is not necessary and important and well 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.550
 just samsung engineers want to show 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.099
 what they achieved what they know how I think that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.600
 This chip is not so cool and very many 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.219
 smartphones will be able to repeat without 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.860
 any sensors let's do it 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.960
 let's prove the tonometer is on I do the same 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.940
 cuff 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.260
 on your hand and measure the pressure let's 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.969
 put 130 add it was less 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.969
 noise or tonometer and turn on 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.640
 Well, we see that I have a pulse 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.580
 equals 90 90 one beat per minute i 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.500
 I think it's a bit much of course but we 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.500
 Now we do not look at my pulse and 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.119
 let's see how well it will show 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.440
 pulse nexus 4 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.350
 most ordinary smartphone without any 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.930
 Steep sensors Attach a finger in the camera 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.210
 and flashes to simultaneously cover up and 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.210
 both and press start 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.230
 shows 80 beats per minute now 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.050
 let's do such a small test 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.050
 let's do the measurement number again 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:37.439
 and we will see that my heart is not working 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.959
 very stable and the readings given 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:43.049
 applications are true that is he 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.109
 shows really my heart 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.030
 rhythm really correctly points 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.909
 on the number of beats per minute he let's 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.650
 check this application again 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.620
 this is the way the finger was put 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.650
 the flash will shine a little warm 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.760
 depending on which smartphone we see 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.329
 that again here 78 87 the same as he 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:13.250
 just showed the tonometer 76 and here 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:13.250
 generally 75 is just a perfect match 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.019
 This application works on the principle 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.000
 changes camera response to 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.269
 light transmission i.e. flash 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.479
 light up our finger as it has blood 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.129
 shrinking heart blood moves 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:32.180
 ip-cameras intersect these movements with 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.810
 using light transmission 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.959
 this application is really 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.760
 the measurement is very accurate 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.010
 it does not use sensors except 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.959
 cameras and flash incidentally in 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.000
 smartphones without flash is also possible 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.699
 using this application but must also 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.530
 be very bright lighting in such 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:53.099
 case even he can and without flash 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.189
 measure your pulse given application 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:59.220
 It costs 50 hryvnia in the market and it is 200 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:03.359
 rubles and it is worth the money 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.180
 because it's just really cool 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.459
 the program few people do not know and she 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.750
 just killing samsungge feature 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.439
 that no extra is needed 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.230
 sensors ordinary smartphone camera can 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.730
 do that without a problem i think that 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.590
 this application gains some 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.360
 the popularity of the way the application 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.380
 there is for android you can download it 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:30.310
 by fear code also for ios link to 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.520
 ios in itunes and a link for welding downloads 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.810
 then I throw off in the description with you was bionic 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.810
 review to new meetings
