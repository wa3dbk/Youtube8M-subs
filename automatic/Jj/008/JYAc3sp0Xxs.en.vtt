00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Hmm 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.990
 2 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:15.750
 Hello Asori kddi san and you owe to have xperia vl 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.430
 Now that the review video has become part 4 and talk about it every time 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.780
 Sorry for the long 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.960
 Though this time is distinguished service to check the performance of the photos and videos Well Hey, is this 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.450
 xperia we expect the kana not it be a cinch 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.830
 First of all the day 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:36.940
 Check the specs of the spray xperia 4.3 inches 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:41.650
 In 1280 times 720 pixels, the pixel density is 342 tpi 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.950
 Completely it is on the degree specification was up to before I will not exceed the iphone 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.440
 I tried to play side-by-side videos of youtube 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.420
 ox 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.899
 Because the screen is larger in Peria, it is natural to look at it naturally 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:01.250
 But only you will see is a look at the Well 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:05.119
 also this because the people of the xperia is is is strong color clearly high contrast 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:10.409
 I think it's a matter of taste, but the iphone was a bit quick 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:16.020
 I think that the color of the xperia will be a little stiffer 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.859
 The spec is about a line of 3 million pixels and is about 1.6 times faster than iphone 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.819
 is not it 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:26.219
 Back-illuminated cmos sensor with lens f 2.4 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:30.400
 Features of to say that is to say Nenan disaster is a function of premium Random Auto 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:34.480
 I ne Well the recent digital camera of Sony but I'm with Closed 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:40.600
 It is great to say that it has come to the smartphone already 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.260
 That 's why a cpu with high processing power lives in . This is smart 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.720
 you know 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:50.420
 It automatically is the I macro mode When you go closer to the Gu' the ne camera is on the subject 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.380
 If you take a photo in the dark from here 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:59.270
 Take photos of multiple photos and compose them 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.740
 Because I can take a picture with less noise, I always use this mode basically 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.110
 I think it's a good image taken with xperia vl and iphone 5 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.030
 Let's compare and a little 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.140
 xperia vl is a premium om auto with iphone 5 normal full 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.370
 I'm taking pictures with auto 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.299
 Processing of the image is story does not have any 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.590
 The iphone is trimmed to fit the xperia because the vertical and horizontal sizes are different. 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.590
 I just 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.720
