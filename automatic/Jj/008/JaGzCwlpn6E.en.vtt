could wear a 32 Ian some of them which

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.640 
could wear a 32 Ian some of them which
surprised<00:01:17.369> myself<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.409> it

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
surprised myself but you know it was it

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.890 
surprised myself but you know it was it
was<00:01:19.680> true<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.670> some<00:01:20.880> people<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.420> fits<00:01:21.689> really

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
was true but some people it fits really

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.359 
was true but some people it fits really
true<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.799> matter<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> trying

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
true so it's just a matter of trying

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.679 
true so it's just a matter of trying
around<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> finding<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> size<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.570> works

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
around and finding the size that works

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.020 
around and finding the size that works
right<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> mean<00:01:25.409> I'm<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> 34c<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.610> found<00:01:26.790> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
right I mean I'm a 34c it and I found it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.240 
right I mean I'm a 34c it and I found it
that's<00:01:27.240> my<00:01:27.570> side<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:28.049> true<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.530> yeah<00:01:28.920> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that's my side it's true for you yeah so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.160 
that's my side it's true for you yeah so
it<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.579> depends<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.000> body<00:01:30.479> shape<00:01:30.780> this

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
it just depends on the body shape this

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.899 
it just depends on the body shape this
bra<00:01:31.320> comes<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.280> really<00:01:32.369> great<00:01:32.670> like

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
bra comes in and it's really great like

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.480 
bra comes in and it's really great like
peachy<00:01:33.329> Chevron<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.140> also<00:01:34.229> comes<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.890> men<00:01:35.070> in

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
peachy Chevron it also comes and men in

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.390 
peachy Chevron it also comes and men in
pink<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.329> black<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.650> lot<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.130> color

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
pink and black they do a lot of color

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
pink and black they do a lot of color
yeah<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:38.670> there<00:01:38.850> might<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.150> orange

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
