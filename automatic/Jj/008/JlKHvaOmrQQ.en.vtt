00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
think is three really yeah

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.670 
think is three really yeah
the<00:05:18.970> important<00:05:19.449> thing<00:05:19.599> to<00:05:19.630> remember<00:05:19.870> is<00:05:20.409> that

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
the important thing to remember is that

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.360 
the important thing to remember is that
the<00:05:21.460> event<00:05:21.789> of<00:05:21.970> job<00:05:22.210> loss<00:05:22.860> while<00:05:23.860> it<00:05:24.039> creates

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
the event of job loss while it creates

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.219 
the event of job loss while it creates
lots<00:05:24.669> of<00:05:24.820> uncertainty<00:05:25.780> is<00:05:25.900> just<00:05:26.139> the

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
lots of uncertainty is just the

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.170 
lots of uncertainty is just the
beginning<00:05:26.710> because<00:05:27.550> it's<00:05:27.760> really<00:05:27.940> the

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
beginning because it's really the

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.149 
beginning because it's really the
cascade<00:05:28.750> of<00:05:28.780> other<00:05:29.169> events<00:05:29.650> that<00:05:29.800> happen

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
cascade of other events that happen

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.189 
cascade of other events that happen
after<00:05:30.370> that<00:05:30.940> create<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.539> stressors<00:05:32.020> for

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
after that create the stressors for

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.189 
after that create the stressors for
people<00:05:32.590> we<00:05:33.400> tend<00:05:33.639> to<00:05:33.759> move<00:05:33.909> on<00:05:34.210> especially<00:05:34.720> in

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
people we tend to move on especially in

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.490 
people we tend to move on especially in
the<00:05:35.560> United<00:05:35.889> States<00:05:36.509> and<00:05:37.509> look<00:05:38.020> for<00:05:38.199> the<00:05:38.259> next

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
the United States and look for the next

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.529 
the United States and look for the next
piece<00:05:38.919> of<00:05:39.099> economic<00:05:39.220> growth<00:05:39.729> and<00:05:40.000> some<00:05:40.210> people

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
piece of economic growth and some people

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:41.240 
piece of economic growth and some people
can<00:05:40.720> do<00:05:40.900> that

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
can do that

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.250 
can do that
but<00:05:42.250> a<00:05:42.280> lot<00:05:42.820> of<00:05:42.850> people<00:05:43.120> are<00:05:43.360> left<00:05:43.570> behind<00:05:43.750> and
