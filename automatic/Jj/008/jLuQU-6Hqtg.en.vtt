1/2 cups of all purpose flour and I
quickly<00:01:11.630> realize<00:01:12.110> as<00:01:12.350> I'm<00:01:12.470> making<00:01:12.619> this<00:01:12.890> that

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
quickly realize as I'm making this that

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.890 
quickly realize as I'm making this that
the<00:01:13.340> batter<00:01:13.549> is<00:01:13.729> very<00:01:14.000> thin<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.630> you're

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
the batter is very thin and you're

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.039 
the batter is very thin and you're
supposed<00:01:15.259> to<00:01:15.409> take<00:01:15.619> this<00:01:15.860> batter<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.930> form<00:01:17.930> it

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
supposed to take this batter and form it

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.690 
supposed to take this batter and form it
into<00:01:18.320> little<00:01:18.470> balls<00:01:18.680> that<00:01:19.340> you're<00:01:19.520> going<00:01:19.640> to

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
into little balls that you're going to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.440 
into little balls that you're going to
put<00:01:20.240> then<00:01:20.659> roll<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.140> sugar<00:01:22.000> being<00:01:23.000> quickly

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
put then roll and sugar being quickly

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.240 
put then roll and sugar being quickly
obvious<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.350> there's<00:01:24.590> no<00:01:24.710> way<00:01:24.860> you're<00:01:25.100> going

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
obvious that there's no way you're going

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.090 
obvious that there's no way you're going
to<00:01:25.280> form<00:01:25.549> this<00:01:25.790> batter<00:01:26.409> into<00:01:27.409> ball<00:01:27.740> shapes

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
to form this batter into ball shapes

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.870 
to form this batter into ball shapes
there's<00:01:28.520> just<00:01:28.700> no<00:01:28.939> way<00:01:29.149> it<00:01:29.210> was<00:01:29.509> really<00:01:30.170> sticky

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
there's just no way it was really sticky

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.550 
there's just no way it was really sticky
and<00:01:32.079> it's<00:01:33.079> just<00:01:33.320> no<00:01:33.469> way<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:34.189> I<00:01:34.219> decided<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:35.560> add

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
and it's just no way so I decided to add

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.609 
and it's just no way so I decided to add
1/2<00:01:37.100> cup<00:01:37.399> of<00:01:37.610> flour<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.540> see<00:01:39.380> what<00:01:39.530> would

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
1/2 cup of flour and see what would

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.560 
1/2 cup of flour and see what would
happen<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.100> I<00:01:40.219> stirred<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:40.640> together<00:01:40.969> this

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
happen and I stirred this together this

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.870 
happen and I stirred this together this
happens<00:01:42.229> on<00:01:42.320> occasion<00:01:42.380> with<00:01:42.950> recipes<00:01:43.460> either

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
happens on occasion with recipes either

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.270 
happens on occasion with recipes either

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
the suppose can certainly happen very

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.889 
the suppose can certainly happen very
easily<00:01:48.399> because<00:01:49.399> um<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:50.539> do<00:01:50.659> everything

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
easily because um you do everything

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.170 
easily because um you do everything
right<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:51.259> still<00:01:51.619> doesn't<00:01:51.770> work<00:01:51.950> out<00:01:52.219> this

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
right and still doesn't work out this

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.480 
right and still doesn't work out this
still<00:01:53.450> was<00:01:53.630> sticky<00:01:54.079> but<00:01:54.619> after<00:01:54.950> all<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.219> flour

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
still was sticky but after all the flour

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.190 
still was sticky but after all the flour
is<00:01:55.670> incorporated<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:56.450> was<00:01:56.600> certainly<00:01:56.899> stiff

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
is incorporated it was certainly stiff

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.450 
is incorporated it was certainly stiff
enough<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.560> be<00:01:57.649> able<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.859> roll<00:01:58.039> it<00:01:58.070> into<00:01:58.310> little

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
enough to be able to roll it into little

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.530 
enough to be able to roll it into little
balls<00:01:58.609> but<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:58.939> was<00:01:59.030> still<00:01:59.180> quite<00:01:59.299> soft

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.050 

but<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.530> did<00:02:07.650> work<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:08.130> was<00:02:08.310> able<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.580> roll<00:02:08.790> into

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
but it did work I was able to roll into

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.580 
but it did work I was able to roll into
little<00:02:09.240> balls<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.720> then<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.229> put<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
little balls and then you put it on a

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.010
