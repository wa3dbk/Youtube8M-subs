been<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> military<00:00:37.020> there's<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.829> many

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
been in the military there's so many

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.040 
been in the military there's so many
variables<00:00:38.040> take<00:00:38.550> into<00:00:39.000> consideration<00:00:39.719> when<00:00:39.989> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
variables take into consideration when I

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.869 
variables take into consideration when I
trained<00:00:40.290> actors<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.890> trained<00:00:41.219> them<00:00:41.250> basically

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
trained actors I trained them basically

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.850 
trained actors I trained them basically
in<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> truncated<00:00:42.660> version<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.260> how<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.410> learned

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
in a truncated version of how I learned

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.040 
in a truncated version of how I learned
so<00:00:44.129> battle<00:00:44.610> drills<00:00:44.789> six<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.270> example<00:00:45.750> would

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
so battle drills six for example would

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
so battle drills six for example would
take<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.379> years<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> master<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.340> mean<00:00:47.550> really

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
take you years to master I mean really

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.160 
take you years to master I mean really
if<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.000> want<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> professionally<00:00:48.629> like
