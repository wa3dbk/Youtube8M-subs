00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.820
 No 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.950
 my name is ann kathrin kohls and 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.900
 because of me are just two girls 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.670
 died and it would be probable 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.590
 become even more if you still have me 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.599
 a little bit could have played 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.279
 in the horror adventure at till dawn can 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.059
 namely basically every one of the eight 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.350
 should protagonists die their playable 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.000
 horrorfilm follows a group 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.379
 young people are more typical 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.180
 teen slasher manner in one 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.790
 Make your parents' home cozy 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.949
 want in a snowstorm on the 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.559
 top of a snowy mountains next to 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.030
 at the former sanatorium where for ten 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.020
 years a crazy fire-fighter 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.940
 dash killer runs around and I had 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.500
 already mentioned is right there in front of you 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.579
 year also the two mentioned him 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.489
 girls are gone 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.680
 whose corpses would never be found what 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.960
 So there could be better than me 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.770
 with all his friends right there 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.770
 to meet again 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.270
 Sounds suspiciously, of course now 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.820
 cliché fireworks is it at first 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.619
 look also a group teenager in one 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.929
 abandoned log cabin a serial killer 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.569
 and the toastag is finished 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.550
 standard holes at till dawn is on 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.020
 However, just the little bit more trouble 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.360
 that it's on average too 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.640
 Exceptionally could lift around the 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.310
 to anticipate question antje thorn has more 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.080
 from heavy rain than from the clock when we 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.700
 Though we collect our figure though 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.899
 mainly hints or meetings 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.270
 Decisions Dialoge and 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.670
 video sequences but true to the saying 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.200
 put you in my position act 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.819
 even the oldest fish it completely 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.300
 different if we influence them ourselves 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.470
 can 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.800
 I saw you 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.570
 through the telescope earlier we got ourselves 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.670
 happened to hit a while ago 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.090
 therefore we have for this evening is the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.090
 forbidden 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.770
 when the girl in the horror movie alone 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.930
 that was to be expected when we started 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.520
 decide us for the left and so on 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.700
 your killer maybe right in your arms 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.110
 it is our fault alone 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.460
 but our actions are not just 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.590
 direct consequences 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.930
 Some decisions are only made 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.690
 much later than wise or true 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.620
 stupid out until thorn lies namely 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.570
 very much worth it 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.540
 butterfly effect in which each 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.320
 action and no matter how small 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.320
 has far-reaching consequences 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.950
 No 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.209
 if we do not prevent for example 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.640
 that matt his girlfriend emily with her 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.739
 That's why ex maxit starts a dispute 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.750
 in the meantime our new flame 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:28.230
 leave the hut and directly in series 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:28.700
 my territory does not contribute anything 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.319
 m 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.569
 we could have prevented that 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.310
 I do not know what happens anymore 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.019
 change as soon as the butterflies are in the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.950
 Picture emerges are the consequences 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.950
 indispensable 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.620
 jazz 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.620
 Yes 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.329
 if till dawn now so heavy rain 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.799
 with less crime and more blood is 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.189
 it then just so small-scale 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.900
 no an action like shaving on the toilet 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.150
 go with antje dorn not with 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.769
 while we still open doors 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.790
 or turn objects around them more exactly 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.939
 to inspect 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.989
 However, we do not brush our teeth anymore 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.760
 we can run for that and stuff like that 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.260
 shoot 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.329
 assuming we have a weapon 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.019
 not very much according to horrorfilm set 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.019
 often the case 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.169
 while at the beginning especially the 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.330
 Relationship of the teenager to each other 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.770
 foreground and the killer only stand 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.659
 and to be seen in the background 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.789
 he stages in the course of the game 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:38.930
 cameras microphones and flamethrowers 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:40.490
 his own little horror cabinet and 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.379
 we are in the middle of it when sam in barth 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.550
 being surprised by the murderer or emilia 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.550
 with help to get help 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.040
 The characters change depending on 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.630
 scene at the death of our character goes 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.480
 the game also to the next figure 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.730
 About Although it is possible that all 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.870
 Our protégés bite at dawn 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.700
 Antje thorn survive 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.950
 the game does not make it for us though 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.540
 the game is interrupted slightly 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.700
 namely from a fictitious meeting with a 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.220
 Therapists specifically ask questions 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.660
 we answer our fears 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.280
 the truth we should one 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.630
 individually tailored to us the 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.990
 say horror experience 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.610
 In any case, the developers 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.170
 you see the set of images and 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.330
 I want you to tell me 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:33.460
 which are fixed in each set 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.460
 most scared 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:41.129
 and that's in it while we're at it 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.899
 horrorfilmen like to turn your head under 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.909
 We can not hide pillows here 

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:46.709
 just throw the controller away because 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.899
 Otherwise we will let our figures sting 

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:50.789
 Add to that the fear of hella 

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:52.469
 sam &amp; co really 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.929
 detailed mimic animations 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.249
 can literally feel together with the 

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:58.259
 really atmospheric soundtrack 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:00.899
 creates an interesting playable 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.369
 horrorfilm could if he stays that way 

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:02.849
 like what they saw when playing 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:04.589
 to have 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.360
 not only at first but also at 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:07.459
 play through second and third times 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.219
 stay exciting 

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:13.169
 This style delivers absolutely crazy 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:14.819
 the whole thing is becoming a trend 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.059
 we never forget 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.059
 OK
