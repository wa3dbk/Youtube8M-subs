Disney fairy tale again I don't know if
that<00:03:26.220> was<00:03:26.370> intentional<00:03:27.030> or<00:03:27.060> if<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.329> was<00:03:27.480> a

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
that was intentional or if it was a

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.569 
that was intentional or if it was a
cultural<00:03:28.109> thing<00:03:28.170> but<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:29.069> was<00:03:29.190> definitely<00:03:29.519> a

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
cultural thing but it was definitely a

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.370 
cultural thing but it was definitely a
little<00:03:29.700> odd<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.660> not<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:30.959> they<00:03:31.049> have<00:03:31.079> no

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
little odd it's not that they have no

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.440 
little odd it's not that they have no
chemistry<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:32.160> for<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.430> film<00:03:32.760> we<00:03:32.970> know<00:03:33.239> is

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
chemistry but for a film we know is

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.479 
chemistry but for a film we know is
supposed<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.780> be<00:03:33.900> based<00:03:34.109> on<00:03:34.349> real<00:03:34.650> life<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:35.370> a

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
supposed to be based on real life it's a

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.610 
supposed to be based on real life it's a
touch<00:03:35.700> distracting<00:03:36.389> I<00:03:36.599> also<00:03:36.930> start<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.349> notice

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
touch distracting I also start to notice

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.930 
touch distracting I also start to notice
things<00:03:37.829> that<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.160> guess<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.519> never<00:03:38.639> really

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
things that I guess I never really

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.610 
things that I guess I never really
picked<00:03:39.180> up<00:03:39.299> from<00:03:39.389> Miyazaki<00:03:39.930> before<00:03:40.319> that<00:03:40.530> are

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
also a little weird like he never really

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.809 
also a little weird like he never really
does<00:03:42.810> sweating<00:03:43.319> or<00:03:43.470> crying<00:03:43.980> correctly<00:03:44.700> it

does sweating or crying correctly it

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.309 
does sweating or crying correctly it
always<00:03:45.120> kind<00:03:45.329> of<00:03:45.389> looks<00:03:45.599> like<00:03:45.810> they<00:03:45.989> have<00:03:46.139> some

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
don't look right it looks like some sort

of<00:03:55.980> weird<00:03:56.310> demon<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:57.209> don't<00:03:57.480> know<00:03:57.630> could

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
of weird demon that I don't know could

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.110 
of weird demon that I don't know could
they<00:03:58.260> have<00:03:58.410> fixed<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.859> up<00:03:58.919> or<00:03:59.280> something<00:03:59.639> but

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
they have fixed that up or something but

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.520 
they have fixed that up or something but
aside<00:04:00.329> from<00:04:00.389> that<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.930> film<00:04:01.169> is<00:04:01.260> very

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
aside from that this film is very

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.039 
aside from that this film is very
obviously<00:04:02.099> a<00:04:02.250> romanticized<00:04:03.060> version<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.870> true

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
obviously a romanticized version of true

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.500 
obviously a romanticized version of true
life<00:04:04.290> events<00:04:04.799> yeah<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.310> lot<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.940> technically

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
life events yeah a lot of it technically

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.569 
life events yeah a lot of it technically
happen<00:04:07.079> but<00:04:07.319> it's<00:04:07.500> pretty<00:04:07.799> clear<00:04:08.250> there<00:04:08.459> was<00:04:08.519> a

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
happen but it's pretty clear there was a

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.640 
happen but it's pretty clear there was a
lot<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.819> creative<00:04:09.239> liberties<00:04:09.690> but<00:04:10.079> never<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.620> a

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
lot of creative liberties but never to a

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.800 
lot of creative liberties but never to a
point<00:04:10.919> where<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:11.220> insulting<00:04:12.000> it's<00:04:12.540> kind<00:04:12.750> of

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
point where it's insulting it's kind of

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.809 
point where it's insulting it's kind of
like<00:04:12.959> tombstones<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.680> got<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.980> basic<00:04:14.370> story<00:04:14.669> in

people down but yeah they obviously
change<00:04:17.459> stuff<00:04:17.729> up<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.090> make<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.510> flow<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.780> little

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
change stuff up to make it flow a little

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.580 
change stuff up to make it flow a little
nicer<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.709> be<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.159> little<00:04:20.340> bit<00:04:20.549> more<00:04:20.729> epic

something incredible failing time after
time<00:05:04.340> but<00:05:04.370> still<00:05:04.790> getting<00:05:05.030> right<00:05:05.210> back<00:05:05.419> up<00:05:05.630> to

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
time but still getting right back up to

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.350 
time but still getting right back up to
try<00:05:05.960> again<00:05:06.260> much<00:05:07.010> like<00:05:07.190> Miyazaki<00:05:07.850> it's<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.180> guy

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
try again much like Miyazaki it's a guy

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.120 
try again much like Miyazaki it's a guy
who<00:05:08.419> loves<00:05:08.810> his<00:05:08.930> work<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:09.470> loves<00:05:09.740> doing

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
who loves his work and loves doing

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.800 
who loves his work and loves doing
beyond<00:05:10.460> what<00:05:10.669> he<00:05:10.790> thought<00:05:10.940> he<00:05:11.090> was<00:05:11.210> capable<00:05:11.450> of

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
beyond what he thought he was capable of

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.450 
beyond what he thought he was capable of
definitely<00:05:12.470> might<00:05:12.680> push<00:05:12.919> some<00:05:13.130> people's

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
sensibilities the wrong way but I think

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.750 
sensibilities the wrong way but I think
