alright<00:00:02.900> so<00:00:03.170> i<00:00:03.199> figured<00:00:03.799> i<00:00:03.920> would<00:00:04.160> go<00:00:04.820> ahead

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:04.910 
alright so i figured i would go ahead

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.730 
alright so i figured i would go ahead
and<00:00:05.000> make<00:00:05.330> a<00:00:05.360> video<00:00:05.660> of<00:00:05.810> this<00:00:05.990> issue<00:00:06.230> because<00:00:06.529> i

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
and make a video of this issue because i

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.310 
and make a video of this issue because i
can't<00:00:07.160> really<00:00:07.370> pinpoint<00:00:08.120> you<00:00:09.019> know<00:00:09.139> the

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
can't really pinpoint you know the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.959 
can't really pinpoint you know the
problem<00:00:09.769> with<00:00:09.799> my<00:00:10.459> fuses<00:00:10.969> and<00:00:11.679> i<00:00:12.909> didn't<00:00:13.909> even

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
problem with my fuses and i didn't even

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.150 
problem with my fuses and i didn't even
have<00:00:14.209> a<00:00:14.240> freakin<00:00:14.690> cluster<00:00:15.349> test<00:00:15.589> until<00:00:15.949> maybe

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
have a freakin cluster test until maybe

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.490 
have a freakin cluster test until maybe
20<00:00:16.699> minutes<00:00:16.849> ago<00:00:17.150> because<00:00:17.570> i'm<00:00:17.720> a

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
20 minutes ago because i'm a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.870 
20 minutes ago because i'm a
retard<00:00:19.269> anyways<00:00:20.980> so<00:00:21.980> basically<00:00:22.519> what<00:00:22.789> i'm

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
retard anyways so basically what i'm

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.900 
retard anyways so basically what i'm
going<00:00:23.029> to<00:00:23.089> do<00:00:23.330> is<00:00:26.410> put<00:00:27.410> it<00:00:27.499> and<00:00:27.650> put<00:00:28.519> the<00:00:28.640> key<00:00:28.789> to

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
going to do is put it and put the key to

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.220 
going to do is put it and put the key to
position<00:00:29.269> one<00:00:29.300> task<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:31.720> basically<00:00:32.720> figure

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
position one task and basically figure

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.700 
position one task and basically figure
out<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.560> voltage<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.250> figure<00:00:34.520> out<00:00:34.580> why<00:00:35.030> my

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
out the voltage and figure out why my

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.440 
out the voltage and figure out why my
battery<00:00:36.710> keeps<00:00:37.130> dying<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:41.120> put<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.330> to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
battery keeps dying to put it to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:56.020 
battery keeps dying to put it to
position<00:00:41.750> one<00:00:42.020> and<00:00:42.470> hold<00:00:43.570> the<00:00:44.570> trip<00:00:45.440> reset

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.350 

go<00:00:57.030> ahead<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:58.370> 19<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.610> make<00:00:59.790> sure<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.149> not

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
go ahead put it 19 to make sure it's not

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:14.359 
go ahead put it 19 to make sure it's not
locked

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:26.399 

all<00:01:15.369> right<00:01:15.579> good<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:16.720> select<00:01:17.020> test<00:01:17.380> 9<00:01:25.409> 12

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
all right good and select test 9 12

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:35.609 
all right good and select test 9 12
volts<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:28.030> right<00:01:28.180> i'll<00:01:28.270> start<00:01:28.509> it<00:01:28.570> up<00:01:34.619> go

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
volts all right i'll start it up go

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.080 
volts all right i'll start it up go
ahead<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:35.860> turn<00:01:36.039> on<00:01:36.070> headlights<00:01:36.369> Oh<00:01:38.850> Boggs

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.770 

air<00:01:43.090> conditioning<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.960> about<00:01:44.140> medium<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.659> I'm

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
air conditioning to about medium and I'm

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:56.380 
air conditioning to about medium and I'm
gonna<00:01:46.899> rev<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.590> about<00:01:47.799> say<00:01:48.420> 2000

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.020 

so<00:01:56.960> apparently<00:01:57.320> with<00:01:58.010> everything<00:01:58.550> while<00:01:58.970> I

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
so apparently with everything while I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.310 
so apparently with everything while I
can<00:01:59.270> turn<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.479> radio<00:01:59.750> on<00:01:59.810> because<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.050> pull<00:02:00.229> the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
can turn the radio on because I pull the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.360 
can turn the radio on because I pull the
 fuse<00:02:00.920> out<00:02:01.100> but<00:02:01.780> with<00:02:02.780> everything

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
 fuse out but with everything

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.430 
 fuse out but with everything
kind<00:02:04.370> of<00:02:04.600> sort<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.690> Ronnie<00:02:05.900> hey<00:02:06.050> don't<00:02:06.290> run

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
kind of sort of Ronnie hey don't run

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.760 
kind of sort of Ronnie hey don't run
light<00:02:06.650> on<00:02:06.800> as<00:02:06.920> well<00:02:07.070> why<00:02:07.280> not<00:02:08.530> maybe<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.649> was

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
light on as well why not maybe I was

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.060 
light on as well why not maybe I was
going<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:09.950> turn<00:02:10.039> on<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.459> don't<00:02:10.670> really<00:02:10.850> think<00:02:11.209> so

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
going to turn on I don't really think so

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.640 
going to turn on I don't really think so
so<00:02:13.070> with<00:02:13.310> oh<00:02:13.550> maybe<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.420> L<00:02:14.570> blinkers<00:02:17.380> I'm<00:02:18.380> just

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
so with oh maybe the L blinkers I'm just

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.410 
so with oh maybe the L blinkers I'm just
going<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.860> make<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.010> difference<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:20.300> with

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
going to make a difference so with

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.160 
going to make a difference so with
everything<00:02:20.660> running<00:02:21.020> I'm<00:02:21.709> getting<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.310> lot<00:02:22.489> of

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
everything running I'm getting a lot of

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.830 
everything running I'm getting a lot of
fluctuation<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.739> seems<00:02:25.250> like<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.840> seems

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
fluctuation and it seems like it seems

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.780 
fluctuation and it seems like it seems
like<00:02:27.110> right<00:02:27.350> now<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.010> alternator<00:02:28.580> is

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
like right now that the alternator is

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.170 
like right now that the alternator is
just<00:02:29.060> old<00:02:29.330> because<00:02:30.340> yes<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:31.610> dropped<00:02:31.940> down<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
just old because yes it's dropped down a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.080 
just old because yes it's dropped down a
12.2<00:02:32.900> and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.000 

yeah<00:02:40.660> just<00:02:40.959> just<00:02:41.019> not<00:02:41.379> going<00:02:41.590> anywhere<00:02:41.739> with

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
yeah just just not going anywhere with

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.699 
yeah just just not going anywhere with
us<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:46.750> looks<00:02:46.959> like<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.440> alternator

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
us so it looks like it's the alternator

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.009 
us so it looks like it's the alternator
and<00:02:48.190> anybody<00:02:49.090> wanted<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.629> confirm<00:02:49.959> that

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
and anybody wanted to confirm that

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.120 
and anybody wanted to confirm that
that'd<00:02:50.530> be<00:02:50.650> great<00:02:51.000> thank<00:02:52.000> you
