00:00:03.946 --> 00:00:07.947
You might have noticed that Ford is downsizing their motor gamma.

00:00:08.284 --> 00:00:11.547
They are the first to have a 3 cylinder in a 'Focus'.

00:00:11.703 --> 00:00:15.409
Not this one, this is the ST, but this model also has to turn in a cylinder.

00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:17.852
The ST wil go from a 5 cylinder to a 4 cylinder.

00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:21.670
Fortunately 25 HP is added and 360 Nm torque.

00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:25.908
Knowing Ford, they made a nicely steering car out of this. 

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:27.877
We shall put it to the test!

00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:38.261
The ST is easy to recognize, it has bigger bumpers, different sill cladding and specific 18 inch wheels.

00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:44.074
In the rear the midplaced exhaust and spoiler stand out.

00:00:44.327 --> 00:00:47.201
Furthermore there are some special colors available.

00:00:47.263 --> 00:00:51.515
For example this 'Tangerine Scream', which speaks for itself....

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:57.824
When seen from a distance, this even reminds of the yellow from a 70's Cadet or Ascona. 

00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:08.582
We want to know how the car drives, steers and feels, if it's a fun car.....

00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:14.645
But ofcourse also the sound. Comparing to it's forerunner we mis one cylinder. We are driving a 4 cylinder....

00:01:15.168 --> 00:01:18.598
Ford came up with a solution: the sound symposer...

00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:33.136
More sound is lead into the interior...when given full gas, it reminds of a Honda Civic with an open air filter.

00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:36.540
But still not as sensational as the 5 cylinder...

00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:48.516
250 HP, 25 more as it's forerunner and a 260 Nm Torque.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:53.480
The car reacts well to the gas, even with low revs.

00:01:53.757 --> 00:01:59.483
Even when taken to higher revs, despite being a turbo motor, the car stands it's ground.

00:02:00.648 --> 00:02:05.013
We already know the 'Focus' as a well steering car, this ST is even better. 

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:09.366
With this car Ford introduces the 'Sport Steering System'.

00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:14.119
So while steering in, the feeling increases.

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:19.028
When driving a straight line, whilst being in the mid position, it's a little bit indirect.

00:02:18.942 --> 00:02:22.125
But when you're steering in, the sensitivity and sharpness increase.

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:28.686
With less speed the power steering wil increase, so parking and city driving is easier.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:36.537
When talking about the steering with a front wheel drive and 250 HP,

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:40.424
You'll also be talking about the drive responses, the so called torque steer.

00:02:41.123 --> 00:02:44.836
What does one feel of this? When you'll give a lot of gas the car wants to go straight

00:02:45.307 --> 00:02:48.637
You'll have alot of driving force, a lot of torque: 360 Nm....

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.772
Ford thought of this, not a ravo nuckle suspension as with the 'RS',

00:02:54.164 --> 00:02:56.915
this car has a 'torque steer compensator' 

00:02:57.164 --> 00:03:02.155
This means that the power steering will give steering corrections.

00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:06.564
But with this the problem has not been solved at it's core...

00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:10.981
It only fixes something which originates from the front wheels.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.863
So the problem will be obstructed in an electronical way. 

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:19.794
So when you'll give full gas you still feel the drive responses,

00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:28.277
and the electronical system will give opposing force so that you can take a corner in a normal way. 

00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:35.120
So it will modorate, but you can feel that it's an electronical system.

00:03:44.504 --> 00:03:48.837
A car with front wheel drive and such power would also need a differential lock.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.928
It doesn't have a mechanical lock but an electronical one. 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.871
This brakes the inner front wheel when entering a corner full speed. 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.576
the electronical differential lock will intervere the traction problems using the ESP,

00:04:05.157 --> 00:04:11.430
This will ensure that you can normally take the corner without any understeer.

00:04:15.035 --> 00:04:19.601
I know you're thinking that this will take away all driving pleasure.

00:04:19.736 --> 00:04:22.162
Which is not the case, the system works subtile,

00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:26.071
the ESP can be turned off or you can turn on the sportive mode,

00:04:25.907 --> 00:04:33.965
so you still get a little bit lift-off oversteer, keeping power and full acceleration...

00:04:39.204 --> 00:04:42.270
Important interior details in which the ST stands out,

00:04:42.487 --> 00:04:44.917
are ofcourse the Recaro's which are eye catchers.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.320
And also the 3 meters for the turbo pressure, oil pressure and oil temperature. 

00:04:50.572 --> 00:04:55.249
The leather patched steering wheel with ST logo, and the special gearshift.

00:04:56.916 --> 00:05:01.347
This is the first sportive car Ford will sell worldwide.

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.276
So all markets will be served, also the U.S.

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:10.085
Concerning driving experience, this car is between a Golf GTI and a Megane RS.

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:14.527
Just a little sharper than the Golf and a little milder than the Megane.

00:05:15.185 --> 00:05:19.731
All together: the steering, the sound, experience, road behaviour 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.079
come to a nice car to be on the road with, a fun car.

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:25.766
While driving these mountain roads we really had fun steering.

00:05:27.122 --> 00:05:31.917
Ford doesn´t only sell it as a 5 door hatchback but also as a stationcar.

00:05:32.562 --> 00:05:38.170
So if you need a practical car, with a lot of space and speed, this is an ideal combination.

00:05:38.965 --> 00:05:44.441
The prices start at €33.135,- and during september the car will be available at the dealer.
