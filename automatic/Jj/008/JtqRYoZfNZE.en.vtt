sleeping<00:02:41.220> with<00:02:41.370> me<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.240> mean<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.690> braved<00:02:43.050> it

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
sleeping with me so I mean I braved it

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.290 
sleeping with me so I mean I braved it
through<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.680> got<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:43.980> out<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.160> there<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:45.000> it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
through and got it out of there but it

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.000 
through and got it out of there but it
was<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.930> know<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:46.200> was<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.620> could<00:02:46.800> feel

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
was you know it was like I could feel

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.740 
was you know it was like I could feel
that<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.580> know<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:47.790> saying<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.360> what<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.570> is

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
that you know I'm saying so what that is

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.310 
that you know I'm saying so what that is
is<00:02:48.960> that's<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.550> releasing<00:02:50.550> cortisol<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.750> so

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
is that's a releasing cortisol and so

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.790 
is that's a releasing cortisol and so
what<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.560> found<00:02:52.800> out<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.580> holy<00:02:53.820> basil

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
what I found out is that the holy basil

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.100 
what I found out is that the holy basil
really<00:02:55.800> helps<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.130> mitigate<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:57.360> stress

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
really helps to mitigate that stress

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.650 
really helps to mitigate that stress
response<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.160> i<00:02:59.190> recommend<00:02:59.730> if<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.510> get<00:03:00.630> a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
response so i recommend if you get a

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.230 
response so i recommend if you get a
chance<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.410> make<00:03:02.250> sure<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.610> you've<00:03:02.760> got<00:03:02.790> some
