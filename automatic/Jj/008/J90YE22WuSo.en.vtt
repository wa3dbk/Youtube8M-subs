00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.440
 19 to 23 May well draw the railway museum from the village 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.240
 train 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.530
 around 15,000 was for cleaning this event 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 motivated enough here 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.380
 the alkmaarders thomas about happiness 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.320
 there he is 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.320
 the most famous resident of so on 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.120
 competitor, we suffer 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.210
 how she took this high visit 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.020
 the controlled and eric de zwart better known as the voice of thomas 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.950
 nor does fochteloÃ«rveen disappear 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.410
 from that moment it is not clear how many suspects 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.510
 The advice states celebration of four hundred employees is one for traffic 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.770
 record attempt 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.310
 but what a record 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.230
 sold in total very long 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.920
 I found the vehicle of the Netherlands team 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.499
 it is true that they are coming 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.849
 35 euros 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.619
 no this is a dream 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.619
 the longest holds the railroad in the Netherlands 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:27.290
 welcome we have 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.290
 good to realize that is for the museum in Amsterdam 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.059
 Pieter Finch 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:40.659
 Who is the mole 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.659
 the line up 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:49.319
 but there's more 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.609
 that there is singing 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.609
 that's the last piece 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.569
 a great happy but the charities that do not appeal to this wouter 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.569
 reelman then received a gift such as 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.469
 it is a nice job it is also mainly to play with 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.469
 and that was allowed 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:58.769
 and while an indoor fire is being played 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.680
 koen verweij outside just before he leaves the voice of thomas 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:05.570
 the eu wants you 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.209
 I have my preference 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.260
 and why 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.369
 ten years ago 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:12.579
 tax free who knew me 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.480
 Patrick's end no further than 2 2 when I was asked I got the vote 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.719
 to finish this summer 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:22.779
 not knowing that that would be a huge success and now after ten years of victory 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.020
 still fit securely into the straw one 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.130
 while I'm in the right place to get the leaked memo cell write 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.090
 of the young Dutch 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.540
 there is still a bit of a living environment, otherwise I fear it will be 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.540
 generation I have noticed in a record attempt 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.840
 and that will be 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.840
 when you go to seventh place in the third race was held 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:09.809
 He is cheerful when it gets much nicer if you don't have a visa 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:13.819
 if i'm a bit naughty that's at least a bit of mischief from that 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.839
 the nice thing about thomas woman is that there is always a moral in very large 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:18.150
 poverty 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.449
 so if everyone behaves like that 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.779
 does what else does 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.439
 it comes with this again available
