00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
timers also can be logged so before

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.560 
timers also can be logged so before
you've<00:00:17.010> used<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.430> iphone<00:00:17.789> timer<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.359> time<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
you've used the iphone timer to time a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.420 
you've used the iphone timer to time a
certain<00:00:18.990> activity<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.830> know<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:19.980> want<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.310> do

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
certain activity you know you want to do

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.099 
certain activity you know you want to do
see<00:00:20.789> how<00:00:20.939> long<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.359> were<00:00:21.449> spending<00:00:21.779> on

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
see how long you were spending on

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.170 
see how long you were spending on
something<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.400> went<00:00:23.699> ahead<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.090> you

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
something and so you went ahead and you

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.210 
something and so you went ahead and you
started<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> timer<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.289> then<00:00:25.680> when<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.099> were

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
started the timer and then when you were

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.429 
started the timer and then when you were
done<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.550> stop<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.970> timer<00:00:27.230> probably<00:00:28.230> then

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
done you stop the timer probably then

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
done you stop the timer probably then
got<00:00:28.710> out<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.890> piece<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.160> paper<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.580> wrote<00:00:30.029> it

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
got out a piece of paper and wrote it

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.389 
got out a piece of paper and wrote it
down<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.410> application<00:00:31.679> actually

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
down so in this application actually

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.360 
down so in this application actually
allows<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.329> create<00:00:34.070> activities<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
allows you to create activities and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.910 
allows you to create activities and
categorize<00:00:36.059> them<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.559> start

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
categorize them so that you can start

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.040 
categorize them so that you can start
timers<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:38.940> multiple<00:00:39.390> timers<00:00:39.750> running

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
timers and have multiple timers running

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.740 
timers and have multiple timers running
at<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> same<00:00:40.379> time<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:42.059> sleep<00:00:42.510> timer

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
at the same time so I have a sleep timer

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.590 
at the same time so I have a sleep timer
running<00:00:43.170> right<00:00:43.469> now<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:45.770> and

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
running right now as you can see and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.910 
running right now as you can see and
then<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.899> course<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.500> was<00:00:49.710> done<00:00:49.890> with

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
then of course when I was done with

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.689 
then of course when I was done with
sleep<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:51.149> stop<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.690> timer<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.370> I<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.579> go

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
sleep I can stop that timer and I can go

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.600 
sleep I can stop that timer and I can go
ahead<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.969> start<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.510> work<00:00:54.660> timer<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:56.399> now<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
ahead and start my work timer and now I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.729 
ahead and start my work timer and now I
have<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.910> work<00:00:57.149> timer<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.410> could<00:00:58.590> run

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
have a work timer going and I could run

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.650 
have a work timer going and I could run
this<00:00:58.949> throughout<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.430> day<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.820> then<00:01:00.420> when

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
this throughout the day and then when

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.840 
this throughout the day and then when
I'm<00:01:00.780> done<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:00.989> work<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:02.100> stop<00:01:02.370> or<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> could

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
I'm done with work I can stop or I could

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.700 
I'm done with work I can stop or I could
stop<00:01:03.090> during<00:01:03.359> my<00:01:03.600> lunch<00:01:03.809> break<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.470> can

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
stop during my lunch break and I can

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.789 
stop during my lunch break and I can
maybe<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> walk<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
maybe I do you know I go for a walk a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.480 
maybe I do you know I go for a walk a
little<00:01:08.100> bit<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.400> exercise<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.240> could<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.020> that

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
little bit of exercise I could do that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.190 
little bit of exercise I could do that
any<00:01:11.490> category<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.360> wanted<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> set<00:01:13.020> up

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
any category that I wanted to set up

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.450 
any category that I wanted to set up
maybe<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.890> decide<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:15.060> some<00:01:15.299> reading<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:17.400> I

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
maybe I decide to do some reading so I

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.280 
maybe I decide to do some reading so I
could<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.759> instead<00:01:18.299> there's<00:01:18.930> even

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
could do that instead there's even

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
could do that instead there's even
really<00:01:19.560> no<00:01:19.770> need<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.159> come<00:01:20.400> back<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.000> turn

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
really no need to come back in and turn

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.780 
really no need to come back in and turn
off<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> timer<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.710> easily<00:01:22.979> switch<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.729> up

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
off a timer I can easily switch that up

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.740 
off a timer I can easily switch that up
to<00:01:24.479> movies<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.610> as<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.390> movies

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
to movies and as you can see the movies

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.560 
to movies and as you can see the movies
turned<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.280> go<00:01:29.310> look<00:01:29.640> at<00:01:29.729> my<00:01:29.850> logs<00:01:30.180> i

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
turned on so if I go look at my logs i

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.230 
turned on so if I go look at my logs i
can<00:01:30.750> log<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.890> I've<00:01:31.979> done<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.460> day<00:01:32.549> you
