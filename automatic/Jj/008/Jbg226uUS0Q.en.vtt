00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.750
 hello everyone i'm on my own again 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.700
 project and doing what I'm doing 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.379
 energy dummy house hoping 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.930
 what can I do passive 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.369
 housing construction and so now how can we 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.020
 seeing my back we are pretty to 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.529
 cool that is on our street 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.310
 frost 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.470
 and now a short video about what I would 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.259
 I wanted to talk, I have not yet created 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.720
 your passive house so that I can you 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:37.040
 really prove it but that I have 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.289
 energy-efficient structure is obtained 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:45.070
 that's about it I can already safely assure 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:47.329
 It means all the insulation work on 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.180
 vapor barrier and other types and charge itself 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.680
 i still have u not finished however i already 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.430
 I meet in the fourth consecutive winter and house 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.859
 without heating 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.109
 I meet 4 in a row winter without heating 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.109
 now I want to show you like a father 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.350
 regular junkers boiler 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.700
 decisive tank system underfloor heating and 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.540
 Belgian heating system from 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.000
 comb and connector logical question 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.230
 if this is a passive house, why should I 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.640
 need such a heating system 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.790
 nevertheless on i will be because 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.190
 I want to make a house that would not 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.500
 depended on any circumstances if 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.300
 suddenly my technology won't work i'm at 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.580
 anyway i can always turn on 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.060
 heating and warm floors can 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.340
 vector floors in perspective 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.410
 I'll connect this whole thing to the heat 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.530
 pump to solar collectors it all 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.360
 I have a huge boiler room in it 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.110
 I can then all together 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.960
 filters are different cleaning and everything is all all all 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.470
 Anything field for imagination is about what 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.349
 Now I say see this park is 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.690
 says that the street is clearly a minus 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.390
 now I 'll show you the focus 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.170
 mean my boiler as we see now 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.170
 it is disabled. 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.260
 not the maximum frosts that we have 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.240
 were 2014 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.080
 This is anomalous frosts for Latvia such 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.750
 just does not happen to -24 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.970
 this year -24 we kept for three days 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.330
 it's just phenomenal i don't remember my 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.530
 the story that's what was so cold in my 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.810
 underfloor heating system and in the system 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:49.780
 convector heating on the second floor 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:52.120
 there was a water house without heating and when i 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.960
 I will tell someone that I have become completely 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.690
 system without 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.940
 energy carrier in which there is water then 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.430
 do you understand what should have been natural 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.320
 happen so here is my house nothing 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.680
 this did not happen that is to me 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.910
 all the pipes were under water pressure and 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.670
 say that absolutely i got off easy 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.460
 No, it did not work those pipes that were 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.440
 in isolation on the second floor and in the floor with 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.360
 Zina nothing happened all 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.150
 works perfectly everything works fine and 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.709
 had a problem that's just those tubes I 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.900
 now I am with the boiler that is 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.980
 I got a problem 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.260
 with comb 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.370
 here in these places, that is, these here 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.280
 three combs of six possible upper 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.360
 If they really froze at me 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.790
 in the house they tore 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.290
 that is, I want to say what gives me 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.330
 confidence about what i'm doing 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.239
 right but at this stage at 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.880
 least if you leave your home 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.790
 complete water supply system 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.280
 under pressure and you will get frost minus 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.830
 24 degrees just think what's wrong with her 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.000
 will be as a builder definitely say 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.810
 what's in all the houses 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.959
 any reasonable person will not do so in 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.760
 I have no regrets for my house and that is 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.010
 the best test of my strength 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.600
 systems and do it standing with confidence 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.030
 what if I have any 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.130
 the problem I have for it is absolutely not afraid and 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.560
 builders easily rework these 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.430
 flaws and maybe apologize the system 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.320
 it was not necessary to do our insulation 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.450
 moreover now i will show you my 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.510
 gas meter 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.700
 we included easy floor heating 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.130
 but there was testing to actually have 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.130
 excluded heating here is my gas 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.290
 counter 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.980
 if we look carefully at me 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.980
 is obtained in a month 77 cubic meters of gas that is 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.380
 per month 77 cubic meters of gas I had it 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.080
 February month now I will show that I 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.080
 heated that was understandable that is 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.090
 if we look at my house even 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.870
 the front part is not completely insulated 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:58.620
 that is, see this something that is insulated 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.670
 something is not, and then there is again 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.590
 that all systems and insulation and all systems 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.260
 I have not yet installed insulation 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.870
 since I wanted to and frost have already come and 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.150
 nevertheless I have nothing to fear now 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.410
 I show the entrance to the house look in it 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.840
 there is a door there is no door that is 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:26.580
 this is the only thermal insulation from the point 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:29.940
 view well i mean here believe it 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:34.800
 want not but it was even here 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.780
 a thermometer I unfortunately rugs 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.520
 removed the thermometer times that is 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.880
 it turns out that even when I have 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.400
 frankly minus it all in my house 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.500
 equals warmer than on the street in the house no one 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.880
 does not live no movement happens 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.940
 why explain it well I hope that 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.920
 bad insulation Well here is 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.740
 video 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.000
 Dmitry oral video because what kind of media 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.160
 I'm a plumber before the construction world 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.150
 but no less you paved the plumbing 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.640
 which does not freeze at minus 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.580
 the temperature outside due to the fact 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.750
 the weatherization of which we have laid everything for now 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.750
 thanks for being with us
