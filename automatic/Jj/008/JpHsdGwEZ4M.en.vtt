know very much in its creation stage at

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.370 
know very much in its creation stage at
the<00:02:51.700> moment<00:02:51.730> like<00:02:52.269> we're<00:02:52.780> all<00:02:52.900> feeding<00:02:53.260> off

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
the moment like we're all feeding off

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.670

each other you know looking at
that<00:02:55.980> inspired<00:02:56.400> me<00:02:56.579> to<00:02:56.700> do<00:02:56.819> something<00:02:56.849> else

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
that inspired me to do something else

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.940 
that inspired me to do something else
with<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.810> dancing<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.409> I<00:02:58.469> think<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.769> same

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
with the dancing and I think the same

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.170 
with the dancing and I think the same
thing<00:02:58.980> people<00:02:59.459> came<00:02:59.579> in<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.730> look<00:02:59.939> at<00:03:00.030> what

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
thing people came in to look at what

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.550 
thing people came in to look at what
we've<00:03:00.269> done<00:03:00.299> with<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.599> dancing<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.079> far<00:03:01.290> and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
we've done with the dancing so far and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.410 
we've done with the dancing so far and
that's<00:03:02.069> going<00:03:02.219> to<00:03:02.310> inspire<00:03:02.430> some<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.329> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
that's going to inspire some of the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.599 
that's going to inspire some of the
seven<00:03:03.750> projections<00:03:04.409> or<00:03:04.560> stuff<00:03:04.739> okay<00:03:05.400> great
