there<00:00:40.680> probably<00:00:41.610> more<00:00:41.820> than<00:00:42.030> I'll<00:00:42.980> move<00:00:43.980> with

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
there probably more than I'll move with

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.279 
there probably more than I'll move with
it<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> regular<00:00:44.670> basis<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:46.050> something

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
it on a regular basis but just something

it on a regular basis but just something
to<00:00:46.350> test<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:48.079> my<00:00:49.079> Forks<00:00:49.489> turned<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.640> pretty

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
to test on my Forks turned out pretty

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.619 
to test on my Forks turned out pretty
good<00:00:54.530> right<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:55.829> using<00:00:56.039> an<00:00:56.430> AC<00:00:56.640> winch

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
good right now I'm using an AC winch

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.299 
good right now I'm using an AC winch
they<00:00:57.870> got<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.199> Old<00:00:58.440> Harbor

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
they got from Old Harbor

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.360 
they got from Old Harbor
Harbor<00:01:00.090> Freight<00:01:00.329> AC<00:01:01.260> unit<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.859> right<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.010> may

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
Harbor Freight AC unit for right now may

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.630 
Harbor Freight AC unit for right now may
slip<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.850> swap<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:04.189> with<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> DC

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
slip that swap that out with a with a DC

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.289 
slip that swap that out with a with a DC
unit<00:01:06.290> as<00:01:07.340> time<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.549> when<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.700> permits<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.270> I

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
unit as time and when it permits but I

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.730 
unit as time and when it permits but I
had<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> shelf<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.439> that's<00:01:10.619> what

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
had this in on the shelf so that's what

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.840 
had this in on the shelf so that's what
I<00:01:10.770> use<00:01:13.340> cable<00:01:14.340> goes<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:15.659> little<00:01:16.850> channel

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
I use cable goes up have little channel

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.190 
I use cable goes up have little channel
in<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> top<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.840> could<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
in the top there so I could get the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.499 
in the top there so I could get the
maximum<00:01:19.350> lift<00:01:21.590> comes<00:01:22.590> back<00:01:22.860> down<00:01:23.159> into<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.330> hole

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
maximum lift comes back down into a hole

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.670 
maximum lift comes back down into a hole
in<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.720> backing<00:01:25.170> plate<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> carriage<00:01:26.390> so

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
in the backing plate on the carriage so

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.789 
in the backing plate on the carriage so
it's<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
it's a

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:57.359 
it's a
push<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> button<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.340> see<00:01:32.580> what<00:01:32.700> happens

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.080 

so<00:01:58.369> not<00:01:58.789> too<00:01:58.939> bad<00:01:58.969> now<00:01:59.899> as<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:00.469> can<00:02:00.619> see<00:02:00.740> here

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
so not too bad now as you can see here

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.440 
so not too bad now as you can see here
two<00:02:02.090> roller<00:02:02.329> bearings<00:02:02.780> in<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.829> lower<00:02:04.369> rear<00:02:05.149> of

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
two roller bearings in the lower rear of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.990 
two roller bearings in the lower rear of
the<00:02:05.869> carriage<00:02:06.289> and<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:07.130> can't<00:02:07.369> really<00:02:07.549> see

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
the carriage and you can't really see

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.440 
the carriage and you can't really see
too<00:02:08.330> well<00:02:08.360> but<00:02:09.190> two<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:12.650> top<00:02:12.890> front<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
too well but two in the top front so the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.000 
too well but two in the top front so the
weight<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.930> carriage<00:02:15.260> itself<00:02:15.709> and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
weight of the carriage itself and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.790 
weight of the carriage itself and
whatever<00:02:16.310> load<00:02:16.640> that's<00:02:16.849> on<00:02:17.030> there<00:02:17.590> loads<00:02:18.590> the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
whatever load that's on there loads the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.509 
whatever load that's on there loads the
bearings<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:20.480> tracks<00:02:20.780> pretty<00:02:20.989> good<00:02:21.519> might

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
bearings so it tracks pretty good might

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.680 
bearings so it tracks pretty good might
have<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.730> play<00:02:22.910> around<00:02:23.090> with<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.450> little

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
have to play around with that a little

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.259 
have to play around with that a little
bit<00:02:23.840> but<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.560> about<00:02:24.890> overall<00:02:25.310> about<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.760> 60

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
bit but I have about overall about a 60

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:40.690 
bit but I have about overall about a 60
inch<00:02:26.299> lift

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:03:01.630 

and<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:42.030> what<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.209> need<00:02:42.420> about<00:02:42.569> perfect

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:11.270 

okay<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.880> even<00:03:03.390> with<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> load<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:06.590> C<00:03:10.280> rolls

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
okay and even with a load on it C rolls

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.720 
okay and even with a load on it C rolls
pretty<00:03:11.700> easily<00:03:13.310> easy<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.520> turn<00:03:15.470> got<00:03:16.470> some<00:03:16.730> five

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
pretty easily easy to turn got some five

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.870 
pretty easily easy to turn got some five
inch<00:03:17.940> casters<00:03:18.480> on<00:03:18.630> there<00:03:19.400> maybe<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.550> little<00:03:20.610> bit

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
inch casters on there maybe a little bit

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.720 
inch casters on there maybe a little bit
soft<00:03:21.180> but<00:03:21.860> for<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.950> shop<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.190> worked<00:03:23.580> just

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
soft but for the shop that worked just

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.230 
soft but for the shop that worked just
fine

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
fine

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.840 
fine
so<00:03:25.250> there<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.430> overview<00:03:28.580> mostly<00:03:29.580> scrap

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
so there it is overview mostly scrap

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.890 
so there it is overview mostly scrap
metal<00:03:30.120> head<00:03:30.300> laying<00:03:30.540> around<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.870> shop<00:03:32.900> total
