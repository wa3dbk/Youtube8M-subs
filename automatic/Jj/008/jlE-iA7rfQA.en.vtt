this<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.130> dead<00:00:05.310> wood<00:00:05.490> stove<00:00:05.880> it's<00:00:06.780> a

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
this is the dead wood stove it's a

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.640 
this is the dead wood stove it's a
biomass<00:00:07.710> stove<00:00:08.330> fueled<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.600> twigs<00:00:10.080> sticks

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
biomass stove fueled with twigs sticks

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.830 
biomass stove fueled with twigs sticks
pine<00:00:11.010> cones<00:00:11.309> essentially<00:00:12.300> whatever<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.690> can

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
pine cones essentially whatever you can

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.179 
pine cones essentially whatever you can
put<00:00:12.990> into<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.940> its<00:00:14.940> height<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.769> 21.5<00:00:16.769> inches

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
put into it its height this 21.5 inches

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.109 
put into it its height this 21.5 inches
which<00:00:18.060> makes<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.510> good<00:00:18.660> height<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.140> cooking

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
which makes it a good height for cooking

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.580 
which makes it a good height for cooking
so<00:00:21.119> I'm<00:00:21.240> gonna<00:00:21.390> fire<00:00:21.690> this<00:00:21.900> thing<00:00:21.960> up<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
so I'm gonna fire this thing up and

up<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:58.500> stove<00:01:58.800> would<00:01:59.010> really<00:01:59.250> come<00:01:59.520> into<00:01:59.670> its

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
up this stove would really come into its

up this stove would really come into its
own<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.300> had<00:02:00.479> some<00:02:00.690> good<00:02:00.840> firewood<00:02:01.490> but<00:02:02.490> you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
own if it had some good firewood but you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.940 
own if it had some good firewood but you
can't<00:02:02.880> always<00:02:03.000> guarantee<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.900> so<00:02:04.470> we<00:02:04.800> did

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
can't always guarantee that so we did

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.320 
can't always guarantee that so we did
the<00:02:05.070> best<00:02:05.190> we<00:02:05.340> could<00:02:05.580> with<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:05.970> we<00:02:06.060> had<00:02:06.210> to
