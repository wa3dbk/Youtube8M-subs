00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
on the clutch and brake at most or even

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.950 
on the clutch and brake at most or even
better<00:01:24.640> just<00:01:24.850> one<00:01:25.120> so<00:01:25.420> did<00:01:25.570> you<00:01:25.630> have<00:01:25.750> a<00:01:25.780> good

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
better just one so did you have a good

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.010 
better just one so did you have a good
hold<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.380> handlebars<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.630> you're<00:01:31.870> simply

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
hold of the handlebars so you're simply

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.750 
hold of the handlebars so you're simply
lean<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.380> bit<00:01:32.530> forward<00:01:32.680> pull<00:01:33.340> on<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.580> brake

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
lean a bit forward pull on the brake

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.610 
lean a bit forward pull on the brake
give<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.210> lot<00:01:34.420> of<00:01:34.450> throttle<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:35.050> then<00:01:35.200> really

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
give a lot of throttle and then really

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.330 
give a lot of throttle and then really
touch<00:01:36.280> right<00:01:36.520> I<00:01:37.830> give<00:01:38.830> about<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.070> third

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
touch right I give about a third

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.100 
touch right I give about a third
throttle<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.910> smaller<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.360> bike<00:01:40.540> is<00:01:40.840> the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
throttle the smaller the bike is the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.600 
throttle the smaller the bike is the
more<00:01:41.260> throttle<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.680> need<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:42.010> give<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.490> then

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
more throttle you need to give and then

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.070 
more throttle you need to give and then
let<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.970> clutch<00:01:43.150> go<00:01:43.360> briskly<00:01:43.750> but<00:01:43.930> at<00:01:44.020> the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
let the clutch go briskly but at the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.170 
let the clutch go briskly but at the
same<00:01:44.200> time<00:01:44.470> be<00:01:45.040> on<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.250> brake<00:01:45.430> too<00:01:45.640> so<00:01:46.030> it's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
same time be on the brake too so it's

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.280 
same time be on the brake too so it's
three<00:01:46.450> things<00:01:46.690> that<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.930> have<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.200> be

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
three things that you have to be

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:55.969 
three things that you have to be
controlling<00:01:47.830> touch<00:01:48.310> brake<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.820> gas
