questions try to watch this video why we

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.570 
questions try to watch this video why we
need<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.369> classification<00:01:38.590> because<00:01:39.590> there<00:01:40.460> are

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
need a classification because there are

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.490 
need a classification because there are
a<00:01:40.610> huge<00:01:40.910> number<00:01:41.119> of<00:01:41.680> living<00:01:42.680> of<00:01:43.149> living

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
a huge number of living of living

a huge number of living of living
organisms<00:01:45.500> there<00:01:45.830> are<00:01:46.090> 1.7<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.270> 1.8<00:01:48.170> million

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
organisms there are 1.7 to 1.8 million

organisms there are 1.7 to 1.8 million
living<00:01:49.990> organisms<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:52.520> we<00:01:53.090> want<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.479> classify

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
living organisms and we want to classify

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.150 
living organisms and we want to classify
them<00:01:54.350> if<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:54.920> want<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.220> study<00:01:55.690> every<00:01:57.160> organism

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
them if you want to study every organism

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.609 
them if you want to study every organism
it<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.550> not<00:01:58.700> possible<00:01:59.179> so<00:01:59.960> we<00:02:00.140> need<00:02:00.289> a<00:02:00.320> system

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
it is not possible so we need a system

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.160 
it is not possible so we need a system
to<00:02:00.830> classify<00:02:01.149> we<00:02:02.149> need<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.420> make<00:02:02.630> them<00:02:02.869> into

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
to classify we need to make them into

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.210 
to classify we need to make them into
groups<00:02:03.470> we<00:02:04.070> need<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.340> make<00:02:04.520> them<00:02:04.700> into<00:02:05.000> groups

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
groups we need to make them into groups

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.170 
groups we need to make them into groups
like<00:02:07.220> these<00:02:08.000> are<00:02:08.269> plants<00:02:09.190> these<00:02:10.190> are<00:02:10.250> animals

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
like these are plants these are animals

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.380 
like these are plants these are animals
these<00:02:12.080> are<00:02:12.320> birds<00:02:13.360> these<00:02:14.360> are<00:02:14.630> insects<00:02:16.390> these

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
these are birds these are insects these

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.890 
these are birds these are insects these
are<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.950> very<00:02:19.549> specific<00:02:20.360> er<00:02:21.459> in-plan

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
are like very specific er in-plan

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.990 
are like very specific er in-plan
microorganisms<00:02:23.900> microorganisms<00:02:24.769> like<00:02:25.760> this

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
microorganisms microorganisms like this

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.300 
microorganisms microorganisms like this
we<00:02:26.150> want<00:02:26.329> to<00:02:26.420> classify<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.350> we'll<00:02:27.950> get<00:02:28.160> an

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
we want to classify so that we'll get an

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.150 
we want to classify so that we'll get an
idea<00:02:29.290> about<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.650> different<00:02:30.680> living

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
idea about the different living

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.410 
idea about the different living
organisms<00:02:32.290> tags<00:02:33.290> are<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:34.120> scientific<00:02:35.120> term

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
organisms tags are the scientific term

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.650 
organisms tags are the scientific term
for<00:02:35.780> these<00:02:36.019> categories<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.920> taxa<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:38.000> the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
for these categories is taxa in the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.740 
for these categories is taxa in the
classification<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:40.190> define<00:02:40.750> different

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
classification we define different

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.280 
classification we define different
categories<00:02:42.530> based<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.370> nominal<00:02:43.820> Eicher

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
categories based on the nominal Eicher

categories based on the nominal Eicher
different<00:02:45.290> observable<00:02:46.100> characters<00:02:46.579> we

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
different observable characters we

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.880 
different observable characters we
define<00:02:47.090> them<00:02:47.239> in<00:02:47.360> two<00:02:47.450> categories<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:48.739> is

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
define them in two categories that is

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.740 
define them in two categories that is
scientifically<00:02:49.430> called<00:02:49.790> tags<00:02:50.090> on<00:02:50.329> the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
scientifically called tags on the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.750 
scientifically called tags on the
scientific<00:02:51.260> term<00:02:51.470> for<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.950> category<00:02:52.519> means

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
scientific term for the category means

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.560 
scientific term for the category means
it<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.350> not<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.410> right<00:02:54.650> word<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.610> scientifically

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
it is not a right word so scientifically

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.500 
it is not a right word so scientifically
by<00:02:57.320> law<00:02:57.500> biologists<00:02:58.220> call<00:02:58.549> them<00:02:58.790> as<00:02:58.940> tags<00:02:59.269> on

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
by law biologists call them as tags on

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.789 
by law biologists call them as tags on
for<00:02:59.959> example<00:03:00.440> animals<00:03:01.180> mammals<00:03:02.530> dogs

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
for example animals mammals dogs

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.240 
for example animals mammals dogs
these<00:03:04.700> represent<00:03:05.180> tags<00:03:06.049> are<00:03:06.290> actually<00:03:06.709> animal

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
these represent tags are actually animal

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.300 
these represent tags are actually animal
itself<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.420> tags<00:03:08.690> are<00:03:08.930> mammals<00:03:09.620> itself<00:03:10.160> is

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
itself is a tags are mammals itself is

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.800 
itself is a tags are mammals itself is
taxa<00:03:11.290> dogs<00:03:12.290> itself<00:03:12.680> is<00:03:12.799> tags

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
taxa dogs itself is tags

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.010 
taxa dogs itself is tags
at<00:03:13.990> different<00:03:14.740> levels<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.150> important

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
at different levels this is important

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.360 
at different levels this is important
you<00:03:17.980> can't<00:03:18.250> keep<00:03:18.490> dog<00:03:19.319> in<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.830> tags<00:03:21.100> of

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
you can't keep dog in the tags of

animals dog is having separate tags on

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.240 
animals dog is having separate tags on

but they come under animals mammals

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.980 
but they come under animals mammals
something<00:03:27.850> like<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.120> based<00:03:28.510> on<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.810> word

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
something like that based on the word
