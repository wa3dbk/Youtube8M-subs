down<00:00:28.349> first<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.340> body<00:00:29.640> motion<00:00:30.179> which

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
down first we have the body motion which

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.470 
down first we have the body motion which
is<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.650> sliding<00:00:32.610> motion<00:00:32.820> all<00:00:33.149> right<00:00:33.270> so

boom and the second motion here is the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.180 
boom and the second motion here is the
step<00:00:41.730> touch<00:00:41.940> motion<00:00:42.390> which<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.200> boom<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
step touch motion which we have boom and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.069 
step touch motion which we have boom and
then<00:00:44.640> instead<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.149> stepping<00:00:45.510> over<00:00:45.719> we're

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
then instead of stepping over we're

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.970 
then instead of stepping over we're
going<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> slide<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.579> then<00:00:48.440> slide<00:00:49.440> so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
going to go to slide and then slide so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.590 
going to go to slide and then slide so
one<00:00:50.570> two<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:52.530> two<00:00:52.670> one<00:00:53.670> two<00:00:54.469> one<00:00:55.469> two<00:00:56.600> alright

let me start putting these couple of
different<00:01:12.330> movements<00:01:12.689> together<00:01:12.780> first<00:01:13.350> let's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
different movements together first let's

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.700 
different movements together first let's
work<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.369> our<00:01:14.790> forward<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.960> an<00:01:16.229> up

work out on our forward so we have an up
and<00:01:17.100> up<00:01:17.820> motion<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.780> slip<00:01:19.439> slide<00:01:20.340> step

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and up motion with the slip slide step

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.240 
and up motion with the slip slide step
slide<00:01:21.500> emotions<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.680> putting<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> two

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
slide emotions so putting the two

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and slide up and slap alright so the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.870 
and slide up and slap alright so the
trick<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.710> you've<00:01:52.979> got<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.490> keep<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
trick here is you've got to keep the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.290 
trick here is you've got to keep the
balance<00:01:54.030> school<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.570> wanna<00:01:54.720> go<00:01:54.840> boom<00:01:57.439> slide

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
balance school you wanna go boom slide

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.590 
balance school you wanna go boom slide
/<00:02:00.460> 5<00:02:01.480> /<00:02:02.480> right<00:02:03.410> so<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:04.370> it<00:02:04.760> would<00:02:05.180> be<00:02:05.330> for

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
/ 5 / right so that is it would be for

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.050 
/ 5 / right so that is it would be for
so<00:02:05.990> put<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.320> upper<00:02:06.560> body<00:02:06.740> or<00:02:07.010> for<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.310> arms<00:02:07.580> we

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
and boom boom and boom motion this one

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.920 
and boom boom and boom motion this one
is<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.250> little<00:02:13.370> bit<00:02:13.670> tricky<00:02:14.000> but<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.660> trick

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
is a little bit tricky but the trick

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.230 
is a little bit tricky but the trick
here<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.650> want<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.890> keep<00:02:16.070> it<00:02:16.190> elbows<00:02:16.580> in
