feel like what it looks like wood and I

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.270 
feel like what it looks like wood and I
mean<00:02:23.269> it<00:02:23.420> does<00:02:23.630> feel<00:02:23.959> like<00:02:24.140> wood<00:02:24.410> but<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.100> not

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
mean it does feel like wood but it's not

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.710 
mean it does feel like wood but it's not
rough<00:02:25.610> it's<00:02:25.850> kind<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.150> like<00:02:26.269> there's<00:02:26.540> a

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
rough it's kind of like there's a

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.870 
rough it's kind of like there's a
coating<00:02:27.380> which<00:02:28.040> makes<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.459> back<00:02:28.640> reach

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
coating which makes the back reach

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.309 
coating which makes the back reach
smooth<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:29.450> you're<00:02:29.569> not<00:02:29.690> going<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.930> get<00:02:30.110> any

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
smooth so you're not going to get any

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.410 
smooth so you're not going to get any
splinters<00:02:30.650> while<00:02:31.400> holding<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.850> phone<00:02:32.150> and
