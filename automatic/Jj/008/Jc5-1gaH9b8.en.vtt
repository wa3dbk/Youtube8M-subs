worse<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:29.069> also<00:02:29.550> gets<00:02:29.819> that<00:02:30.000> fifty

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
worse is that it also gets that fifty

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.880

therefore<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.489> off<00:02:35.580> tank<00:02:35.850> should<00:02:35.970> keep<00:02:36.120> them

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
therefore the off tank should keep them

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.210 
therefore the off tank should keep them
