00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.600 
is we think good enough and could handle
competing<00:02:32.720> in<00:02:32.989> practice<00:02:33.470> then<00:02:33.769> that's<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.519> guy

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
competing in practice then that's a guy

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:56.550 
competing in practice then that's a guy
will<00:02:34.819> strongly<00:02:35.060> look<00:02:35.360> up

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.199 

I<00:02:57.180> think<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.270> went<00:02:59.340> fairly<00:03:00.340> well<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.880> was<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.030> lot

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
I think it went fairly well it was a lot

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.590 
I think it went fairly well it was a lot
of<00:03:01.240> fun<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:02.230> think<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:03.130> there's<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.670> large

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
of fun I think that there's a large

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.120 
of fun I think that there's a large
difference<00:03:05.110> between<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.560> sluta<00:03:05.830> system

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
difference between that sluta system

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.730 
difference between that sluta system
that<00:03:06.250> we'll<00:03:06.370> see<00:03:06.550> on<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.740> scholarship

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
that we'll see on the scholarship

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.710 
that we'll see on the scholarship
athletes<00:03:09.130> which<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.400> what<00:03:09.490> we<00:03:09.610> had<00:03:09.760> here<00:03:10.000> but<00:03:10.390> I

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
athletes which is what we had here but I

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.910 
athletes which is what we had here but I
know<00:03:11.050> there's<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.319> couple<00:03:11.440> guys<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.860> would

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
know there's a couple guys that would

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.650 
know there's a couple guys that would
love<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.280> do<00:03:12.790> everything<00:03:13.120> they<00:03:13.239> can<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.480> make

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
love to do everything they can to make

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:29.430 
love to do everything they can to make
it<00:03:13.900> work

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.660 

probably<00:03:30.440> one<00:03:30.560> where<00:03:30.740> I<00:03:30.770> felt<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.250> push<00:03:31.490> is

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
probably one where I felt a push is

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.280 
probably one where I felt a push is
really<00:03:31.910> hard<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.390> I<00:03:32.690> thought<00:03:32.870> I'd<00:03:32.990> do<00:03:33.080> well

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
really hard and I thought I'd do well

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.170 
really hard and I thought I'd do well
you<00:03:33.500> can<00:03:33.650> always<00:03:33.800> do<00:03:34.010> better<00:03:34.040> but<00:03:34.520> overall<00:03:35.030> I'm

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
you can always do better but overall I'm

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.150 
you can always do better but overall I'm
happy<00:03:35.210> with<00:03:35.540> myself<00:03:35.690> just<00:03:36.080> hope<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.010> did

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
happy with myself just hope that I did

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.400 
happy with myself just hope that I did
