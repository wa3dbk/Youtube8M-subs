 many obstacles between Opel and GM and Opel tie them behind 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.119

 there is also a chance to recover in the normal station 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.169
 scenes 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.479

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:17.559
 and when switching 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.939
 Bochum and Schalke meet 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.729
 that means they can 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.999
 twice 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.849
 set a brake once 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.389
 the municipality Glarus run and because the cord should take

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.709
 she given more options 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.709
 that is one of those essential difference between these 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:22.460
 for newcomers and in many points still a normal station recover 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.460
 flown with a normal Munich RPO 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.770

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.209
 Want to have joy or even look what would say what 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.340
 Eventually, not enough flour catch up 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.120
 And these are supposed to be essential differences finally all 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.909
 touched 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.379
 would like to 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.819
 the favored consequences animal welfare first became 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.589
