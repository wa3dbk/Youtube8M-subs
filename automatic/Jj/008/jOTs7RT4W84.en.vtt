ruling<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> lock<00:01:24.090> extension<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.110> do

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
ruling with the lock extension you do

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.249 
ruling with the lock extension you do
have<00:01:25.530> two<00:01:25.740> palm<00:01:26.070> rule<00:01:26.369> for<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> considerably

have two palm rule for a considerably

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.850 
have two palm rule for a considerably
long<00:01:28.619> time<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:30.090> reason<00:01:30.570> why<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:30.990> once

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
long time the reason why is because once

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.010 
long time the reason why is because once
your<00:01:32.130> palm<00:01:32.460> rule<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.540> can't

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
your palm rule is here we really can't

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.080 
your palm rule is here we really can't
do<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.650> right<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.009> because<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.670> lots<00:01:35.909> of

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
do that right now because it's lots of

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.499 
do that right now because it's lots of
tight<00:01:37.159> once<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.310> palm<00:01:38.640> roll<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.299> would

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
tight once you palm roll it it would

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.130 
tight once you palm roll it it would
palm<00:01:40.200> rule<00:01:40.530> right<00:01:41.130> into<00:01:41.820> his<00:01:42.119> natural<00:01:42.840> hair

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
palm rule right into his natural hair

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.850 
palm rule right into his natural hair
like<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:45.210> when<00:01:45.420> his<00:01:45.600> hair<00:01:45.899> grows<00:01:46.259> out<00:01:46.500> it

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
like this so when his hair grows out it

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.410 
like this so when his hair grows out it
grows<00:01:47.250> into<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.240> locks<00:01:48.479> by<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.590> way<00:01:50.420> they

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
grows into the locks by that way they

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.130 
grows into the locks by that way they
both<00:01:52.049> look<00:01:53.000> consistent<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> straight

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
both look consistent you have a straight

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.219 
both look consistent you have a straight
line<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.590> right<00:01:55.740> into<00:01:56.490> his<00:01:56.670> hair<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.960> do

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
line going right into his hair if you do

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.069 
line going right into his hair if you do
interlock<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.180> gonna<00:02:00.450> look<00:02:00.689> real

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
interlock it it is not gonna look real

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.950 
interlock it it is not gonna look real
so<00:02:01.920> interlocking<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> couple

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
so interlocking it is just for a couple

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.859 
so interlocking it is just for a couple
of<00:02:04.170> months<00:02:04.590> after<00:02:04.759> when<00:02:05.759> his<00:02:05.880> hair<00:02:06.240> has<00:02:06.540> grown
