00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.840
 everyone here we are welcome to a 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.180
 new video of the best digital soccer 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.130
 Welcome to what is the explanation 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.860
 of what the tournament will be playing with 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.259
 subscribers when with you 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.480
 then I explain what the thing is going 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.060
 I will organize two tournaments one in play 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.380
 4 and another one on Xbox and I know many 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.539
 You said yes because I do not do it in 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.880
 play 3 and it's basically because I do not 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.760
 I have it are from our two consoles and 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.260
 that 's where I'm going to do them I started the 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.029
 last year so I had but this year 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.990
 already the modern records so neither 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.880
 how to do it 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.190
 The first thing you have to do is go to 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.860
 the description take the stroke link 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.989
 boom and vote for the one with just 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.270
 you want the tournament to start because 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.760
 It's worth as much as in a jellybee so 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.370
 You can vote between teams one or between 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.440
 play 4 I want to emphasize that the tournament is 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.010
 for subscribers so it is necessary 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.809
 that you are subscribed to the channel and how I'm going 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.600
 to choose the subscribers that were 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.719
 obviously you have to understand what 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.420
 and we can play with 300,000 people that 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.880
 you have to understand it then how am I going to 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.640
 making the selection is very simple 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.360
 example I the selection matches do not 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.490
 it goes live then to access 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.649
 what is the tournament because I will play it jce 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.820
 among you you will have to beat me 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.340
 my 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.340
 and live 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.400
 it will have to be demonstrated how to select 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.220
 the people are very simple or by twitter 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.660
 for example if today this video before 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.310
 that the time of the live one arrives 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.620
 six thirty when I start 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.350
 prepare them and such we come to what 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.040
 it's been 5000 likes today 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.840
 I'll start with the live tournament and 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.540
 how to select people the truth is 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.370
 which is very easy because by twitter eye 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.950
 it's important to have twitter follow me on 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.480
 twitter because out there I say everything is 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.960
 very easy access on twitter for which 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.660
 do not have it then I an hour before 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.550
 of the tournament I will pick up and put a tweet 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.920
 saying for example 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.020
 founder at the beginning of last year I 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.970
 touched a principles and almost all year and 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.880
 half with the noses that player 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.920
 important then it would be since the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.490
 physical trainer would be something else 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.650
 then the first three or four 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.540
 I'll take four because we say we have one 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.820
 of reserve in case it fails me any and 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.450
 such three four players that I 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.190
 answer before they will be the ones that play 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.720
 then basically to select a 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.000
 the people who will play with me 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.520
 you will have to be attentive to twitter to 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.740
 my twitter and answer the questions 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.920
 what will I do about myself or about me 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.720
 channel I know that everyone would like that 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.400
 I will play against the 300,000 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.910
 subscribers that I come but it's 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.040
 physically impossible already then not 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.010
 I can play with everyone and you have to 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.380
 select people in some way 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:02.180
 as the tournament is, the tournament will be 12 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.939
 participants then then 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.010
 when twelve people have reached me 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:10.800
 put you in a live I win two 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.620
 because in six direct we would have 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.240
 we will do the tournament among you in the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.790
 tournament I will not participate simply 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.470
 participate 'aces' among you and as 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.530
 not what will be the prize of this merit 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.940
 then nothing more and nothing less than 10 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.740
 millions of coins many say 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.470
 but is that the xbox you will not pay 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.780
 so many in the how many surely in a 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.480
 I already tell you, it's 10 coins 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.330
 in a play account of 4 play 3 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.650
 but you also have to say that now that 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.320
 the tops have been finished 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.330
 surely the tournament will be finished 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.480
 after the hutis arrive 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.760
 that the coins will have gone down because 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.730
 there are not so many specials 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.650
 say it and the price of xbox is a 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.990
 little bit cheaper so surely 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.780
 we will also give the 10 million in xbox 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.270
 if you think of any rule or 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.490
 anything that good they can 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.960
 let's say benefit or any criticism 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.450
 constructive towards when I am 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.580
 doing or as we say we could 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.470
 change one that was better me 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.080
 I accept all you put us in the 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.000

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.680
