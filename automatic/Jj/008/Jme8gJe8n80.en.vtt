broccoli I think and some beans and they

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.320 
broccoli I think and some beans and they
should<00:00:35.750> grow<00:00:35.930> up<00:00:36.080> on<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:37.610> two<00:00:37.790> trellises

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
should grow up on the two trellises

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.700 
should grow up on the two trellises
there<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:38.780> then<00:00:38.960> we've<00:00:39.140> just<00:00:39.320> got<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:39.470> bird

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
there and then we've just got a bird

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.650 
there and then we've just got a bird
netting<00:00:39.950> over<00:00:40.160> here<00:00:40.460> with<00:00:40.640> some<00:00:40.790> PVC<00:00:41.120> pipe<00:00:41.480> to

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
netting over here with some PVC pipe to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
netting over here with some PVC pipe to
keep<00:00:41.810> it<00:00:41.930> off<00:00:42.400> keep<00:00:43.400> the<00:00:43.520> birds<00:00:43.760> from<00:00:44.680> eating

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
keep it off keep the birds from eating

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.830 
keep it off keep the birds from eating
up<00:00:45.800> our<00:00:46.090> young<00:00:47.090> little<00:00:47.330> tender<00:00:48.460> plants<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.840> so

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
up our young little tender plants and so

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.480 
up our young little tender plants and so
then<00:00:51.110> we'll<00:00:51.260> have<00:00:51.380> a<00:00:51.440> lot<00:00:51.620> more<00:00:51.680> it's<00:00:52.310> in<00:00:52.460> the

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
then we'll have a lot more it's in the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.980 
then we'll have a lot more it's in the
shade<00:00:52.760> at<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.000> moment<00:00:53.300> from<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.510> one<00:00:53.690> tree

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
shade at the moment from the one tree

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.730 
shade at the moment from the one tree
it's<00:00:54.920> about<00:00:55.040> noon<00:00:55.460> or<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:55.970> today<00:00:56.300> I<00:00:56.330> guess<00:00:56.740> but

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
it's about noon or so today I guess but

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.530 
it's about noon or so today I guess but
the<00:00:58.190> Sun<00:00:58.340> is<00:00:58.370> directly<00:00:58.640> overhead<00:00:58.910> in<00:00:59.450> the

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
the Sun is directly overhead in the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.320 
the Sun is directly overhead in the
summer<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.020> those<00:01:00.200> beds<00:01:00.410> should<00:01:00.590> be<00:01:00.740> great

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
summer so those beds should be great

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.250 
summer so those beds should be great
during<00:01:02.330> the<00:01:02.450> summer<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.280> this<00:01:04.280> whole<00:01:04.550> area

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
during the summer and this whole area

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.640 
during the summer and this whole area
we've<00:01:06.260> moved<00:01:06.500> back<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.040> forth<00:01:07.100> around<00:01:07.550> here

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
we've moved back and forth around here

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.310 
we've moved back and forth around here
around<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:10.130> corner<00:01:10.520> with<00:01:10.760> our<00:01:11.320> chicken

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
around the corner with our chicken

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.780 
around the corner with our chicken
tractor<00:01:12.650> which<00:01:12.890> happens<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.280> be<00:01:13.370> right<00:01:13.610> there

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
tractor which happens to be right there

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.940 
tractor which happens to be right there
right<00:01:13.970> now<00:01:14.260> we've<00:01:15.260> already<00:01:15.440> moved<00:01:15.620> it<00:01:15.800> around

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
right now we've already moved it around

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.880 
right now we've already moved it around
once<00:01:16.370> and<00:01:16.760> back<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:17.900> its<00:01:18.020> original<00:01:18.260> starting

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
once and back to its original starting

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.640 
once and back to its original starting
point<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.550> goes<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:19.940> way<00:01:20.350> we<00:01:21.350> move<00:01:21.560> it

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
point and so it goes this way we move it

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.750 
point and so it goes this way we move it
about<00:01:21.830> once<00:01:22.070> or<00:01:22.190> twice<00:01:22.340> every<00:01:23.080> day<00:01:24.080> or<00:01:24.760> two

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
about once or twice every day or two

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.560 
about once or twice every day or two
days<00:01:26.000> or<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:28.870> so<00:01:29.870> that's<00:01:30.080> how<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.260> works

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
days or so and so that's how that works

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.390 
days or so and so that's how that works
that's<00:01:32.570> some<00:01:32.810> nice<00:01:33.290> mint<00:01:33.680> growing<00:01:33.950> over<00:01:34.250> there

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
that's some nice mint growing over there

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.600 
that's some nice mint growing over there
against<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:35.000> spearman<00:01:35.600> against<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.020> wall

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
against the spearman against the wall

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.710 
against the spearman against the wall
we've<00:01:37.610> actually<00:01:37.820> dried<00:01:38.150> that<00:01:38.360> before

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
we've actually dried that before

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.450 
we've actually dried that before
