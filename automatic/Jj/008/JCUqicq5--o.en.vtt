00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:02.890 

poke<00:03:51.650> these<00:03:52.370> holes<00:03:52.670> with<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> pen<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:02.480> run<00:04:02.720> the

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
poke these holes with a pen to run the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:14.129 
poke these holes with a pen to run the
string<00:04:03.849> through<00:04:04.849> the<00:04:05.000> back<00:04:06.040> like<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.069> and

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.529

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
then you're going to put it in through

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.570 
then you're going to put it in through
here<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:19.459> pull<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:20.060> through<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.959> back<00:04:21.550> so<00:04:22.550> now

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
here and pull it through the back so now

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:36.400 
here and pull it through the back so now
we're<00:04:23.360> going<00:04:23.539> to<00:04:23.690> do<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.910> other<00:04:26.479> side<00:04:35.260> put<00:04:36.260> it

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
we're going to do the other side put it

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.290 
we're going to do the other side put it
through<00:04:36.710> like<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:40.460> this<00:04:40.669> is<00:04:40.729> what<00:04:41.090> it

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
through like that so this is what it

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.460 
through like that so this is what it
should<00:04:41.570> look<00:04:41.599> like

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.070 

okay<00:04:50.700> so<00:04:51.700> now<00:04:51.970> we're<00:04:52.180> going<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.420> take<00:04:52.630> two<00:04:52.840> pipe

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
okay so now we're going to take two pipe

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.810 
okay so now we're going to take two pipe

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
cleaners and put them together and then

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.630 
cleaners and put them together and then
make<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.390> into<00:04:58.660> a<00:04:58.930> circle<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:01.860> this<00:05:02.860> is<00:05:03.190> what

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
make it into a circle and this is what

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.540 
make it into a circle and this is what
it<00:05:03.850> should<00:05:04.120> look<00:05:04.150> like<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.800> now<00:05:09.010> we're<00:05:09.370> going

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550
