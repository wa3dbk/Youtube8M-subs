00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.509
 in this computer app video we are going to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.809
 see what is a led bulb and what 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.849
 advantages you offer these tired of spending 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.610
 money buying light bulbs that last very 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.430
 little your electricity bill comes every day 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.520
 higher because it saves money with 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.529
 led bulbs a led bulb is 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.710
 a lamp that uses solid state 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.080
 LEDs as light source lighting 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.689
 led stands out for consuming between 80 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.020
 and 90% less electricity than a 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.760
 traditional incandescent bulb and if 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.790
 we compare it with low light bulbs 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.809
 Consumption of fluorescent technology spends 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.700
 65% less electricity though 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.410
 these bulbs cost a little more than 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.379
 the traditional the truth is that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.149
 generate higher savings lately 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.890
 its use has also been highly recommended 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.070
 for different economic reasons and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.160
 environmental what other advantages does the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.530
 use of the led spending a light bulb 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.680
 halogen spends 18 euros a year while 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.140
 that an LED spends only one euro 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.340
 time a led bulb can reach 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.290
 to last up to 25 years low voltage the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.720
 possibility of feeding 12 and 24 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.780
 volts greatly reduces the risks 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.940
 of being electrocuted low 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.160
 heat emission when consuming little 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.760
 Energy led light bulbs emit little 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.950
 heat is the so-called cold light ecology 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.080
 The LED bulbs are totally 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.060
 recyclable and ecological since it does not 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.700
 they contain mercury not even 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.460
 toxic materials as for example in 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.979
 fluorescent lamps versatility 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.250
 you can find all kinds of colors 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.509
 on led even the mix of them 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.390
 we also find all kinds of 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.980
 lamps tubes flat panels strips 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.740
 Led streetlights LEDs and industrial spotlights 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.800
 did you know that it comes from the acronym 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.320
 English light emitting diet that in 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.390
 Spanish means light emitting diode and 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.150
 refers to an opto component 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.570
 electric or passive more specifically a 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.880
 diode that emits light the LEDs were used 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.680
 before frequently as indicators in 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.330
 many devices and also in 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.130
 illumination 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.350
 the first LEDs emitted red light from 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.540
 low intensity but the devices 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.490
 current emit high-brightness light in the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.030
 visible infrared spectrum and 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.070
 ultraviolet what interesting truth then 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.420
 share it on social networks and do not 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.910
 forget to click on the button me 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.320
 like remember there are many more videos 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.660
 of the computer app that you are 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.660
 waiting until later 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.660
 good
