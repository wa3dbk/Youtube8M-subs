00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
official name it's probably not that's

so<00:00:34.760> one<00:00:35.300> thing<00:00:35.510> is<00:00:35.780> when<00:00:36.320> belkin<00:00:37.129> came<00:00:37.519> out

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
so one thing is when belkin came out

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.369 
so one thing is when belkin came out
with<00:00:38.089> this<00:00:38.269> device<00:00:38.690> I<00:00:38.899> was<00:00:39.079> really<00:00:39.350> upset

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
with this device I was really upset

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.549 
with this device I was really upset
because<00:00:39.920> they<00:00:40.190> did<00:00:40.429> not<00:00:40.460> have<00:00:41.059> any<00:00:41.559> Android

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
because they did not have any Android

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.340 
because they did not have any Android
app<00:00:42.890> to<00:00:43.760> support<00:00:44.179> this<00:00:44.329> device<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:44.960> was<00:00:45.199> only

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
app to support this device it was only

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.450 
app to support this device it was only
supported<00:00:45.949> by<00:00:46.100> iOS<00:00:46.429> I<00:00:47.319> kind<00:00:48.319> of<00:00:48.409> a<00:00:48.559> lame<00:00:48.949> move<00:00:49.280> I

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
supported by iOS I kind of a lame move I

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.430 
supported by iOS I kind of a lame move I
think<00:00:49.760> I<00:00:49.969> think<00:00:50.210> Apple<00:00:50.659> probably<00:00:51.050> gave<00:00:51.230> them

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
think I think Apple probably gave them

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.840 
think I think Apple probably gave them
some<00:00:51.679> money<00:00:51.769> for<00:00:52.069> that<00:00:52.190> but<00:00:52.969> now<00:00:54.579> there<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:55.699> an

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
some money for that but now there is an

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.750 
some money for that but now there is an
app<00:00:56.030> for<00:00:56.809> this<00:00:56.989> device<00:00:57.350> for<00:00:57.769> Android<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.370> it

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
app for this device for Android and it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.540 
app for this device for Android and it
works<00:00:58.999> really<00:00:59.390> really<00:00:59.629> well<00:01:00.050> now<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:01.100> one

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
works really really well now the one

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.610 
works really really well now the one
thing<00:01:01.729> that<00:01:01.789> I<00:01:01.969> like<00:01:02.329> about<00:01:02.359> this<00:01:02.690> device<00:01:03.319> is

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
thing that I like about this device is

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.490 
thing that I like about this device is
that<00:01:03.679> it's<00:01:04.489> rated<00:01:04.909> at<00:01:05.120> 15<00:01:05.510> amp<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:06.200> can

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
that it's rated at 15 amp so you can

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.160 
that it's rated at 15 amp so you can
actually<00:01:06.710> run<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.460> really<00:01:08.180> really<00:01:08.509> heavy<00:01:09.020> duty

specific<00:02:29.700> times<00:02:30.210> or<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.830> turn<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.340> then

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
specific times or you can turn on then

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.580 
specific times or you can turn on then
off<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:35.120> for<00:02:36.120> for<00:02:36.510> an<00:02:36.570> air<00:02:36.690> conditioner<00:02:37.350> for

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
off so for for an air conditioner for

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.410 
off so for for an air conditioner for
example<00:02:38.600> this<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.170> turn<00:02:40.530> on<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.250> then<00:02:42.180> off

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
example this the turn on and then off

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.500 
example this the turn on and then off
would<00:02:42.870> probably<00:02:43.320> work<00:02:43.500> best<00:02:45.110> etc<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:47.450> let<00:02:48.450> me

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
would probably work best etc so let me

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.840 
would probably work best etc so let me
demonstrate<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.590> what<00:02:50.130> happens<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:50.790> you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
demonstrate that so what happens so you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.640 
demonstrate that so what happens so you
select<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.390> switch<00:02:52.220> select<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.400> switch<00:02:53.670> and

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
select the switch select the switch and

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.560 
select the switch select the switch and
I'm<00:02:55.650> going<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.890> tell<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.430> turn<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:57.560> see<00:02:59.570> and

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
I'm going to tell it to turn on see and

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.640 
I'm going to tell it to turn on see and
I'm<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.140> tell<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.770> do<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.340> every<00:03:02.940> day

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
I'm going to tell it to do it every day

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:12.210 
I'm going to tell it to do it every day
at<00:03:08.450> six

test

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.290 

safe

safe

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.230 

so<00:03:51.100> it<00:03:51.250> turned<00:03:51.459> out<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:52.950> 613<00:03:53.950> Cain<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.550> this

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
so it turned out so 613 Cain and this

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.970 
so it turned out so 613 Cain and this
turned<00:03:55.540> out<00:03:55.660> automatically<00:03:56.940> so<00:03:57.940> this<00:03:58.540> is<00:03:58.569> the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
turned out automatically so this is the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.440 
turned out automatically so this is the
schedule<00:03:59.980> or<00:04:00.220> rules<00:04:02.310> list<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:04.180> is<00:04:04.330> the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
schedule or rules list and this is the

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.690 
schedule or rules list and this is the
one<00:04:04.600> that<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.870> schedule<00:04:05.380> now<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:05.920> you<00:04:06.580> can

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
one that I schedule now and you can

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.150 
one that I schedule now and you can
toggle<00:04:06.940> between<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.630> devices<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.800> and

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
toggle between the devices and the and

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.800 
toggle between the devices and the and
the<00:04:09.250> rules<00:04:09.580> as<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:10.540> will<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:12.180> great<00:04:13.180> device<00:04:13.540> I

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
the rules as you will so great device I

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.099 
the rules as you will so great device I
think<00:04:14.020> it's<00:04:14.140> very<00:04:14.410> very<00:04:14.770> useful<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.959> know<00:04:16.989> I

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.319 
think it's very very useful I you know I
wish<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.859> had<00:04:17.980> something<00:04:18.280> like<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:18.730> years<00:04:19.090> and

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
wish I had something like this years and

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.070 
wish I had something like this years and
years<00:04:19.540> ago<00:04:19.810> but<00:04:20.290> they're<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.430> only<00:04:21.750> brand<00:04:22.750> or

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
years ago but they're the only brand or

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.890 
years ago but they're the only brand or
or<00:04:24.040> socket<00:04:24.610> that<00:04:24.970> I<00:04:25.030> know<00:04:25.150> of<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.510> can

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
or socket that I know of that can

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.380 
or socket that I know of that can
actually<00:04:26.110> do<00:04:26.560> this<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.640> doesn't<00:04:28.000> really

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
actually do this and it doesn't really

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.900 
actually do this and it doesn't really
well<00:04:28.780> so<00:04:30.390> it<00:04:31.390> gets<00:04:31.870> my<00:04:32.110> thumb<00:04:32.470> up<00:04:32.740> right<00:04:33.700> now

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
well so it gets my thumb up right now

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.800 
well so it gets my thumb up right now
and<00:04:34.260> oh<00:04:35.260> now<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.770> app<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.850> Android<00:04:37.210> app<00:04:37.360> is<00:04:37.600> in

and oh now the app the Android app is in

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.570 
and oh now the app the Android app is in
beta<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.350> haven't<00:04:38.680> noticed<00:04:39.010> anything<00:04:39.310> that

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
beta I haven't noticed anything that

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.450 
beta I haven't noticed anything that
doesn't<00:04:39.790> work<00:04:40.320> completely<00:04:41.320> it's<00:04:42.160> still<00:04:42.430> a

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
of the house that's a possibility to all

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.230 
of the house that's a possibility to all
right<00:05:11.680> so<00:05:11.979> let<00:05:12.190> me<00:05:12.280> show<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.700> device<00:05:13.000> up

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
right so let me show you the device up

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.779 
right so let me show you the device up
close<00:05:14.220> this<00:05:15.220> is<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.520> back<00:05:15.700> label<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:17.669> as<00:05:18.669> you

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
close this is the back label and as you

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.000 
close this is the back label and as you
can<00:05:18.970> see<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.390> input<00:05:19.720> is<00:05:19.870> 120<00:05:20.380> volts<00:05:20.800> the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
can see the input is 120 volts the

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.170 
can see the input is 120 volts the
output<00:05:21.039> and<00:05:21.729> input<00:05:22.330> is<00:05:22.900> 15<00:05:23.560> amps<00:05:23.950> so<00:05:24.280> really<00:05:25.060> it

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180
