00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
was all speedy but it would just sound

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.249 
was all speedy but it would just sound
like<00:01:54.979> someone<00:01:55.399> else<00:01:55.579> you<00:01:56.299> know<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:56.689> I<00:01:56.719> redid<00:01:57.200> a

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
like someone else you know so I redid a

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.789 
like someone else you know so I redid a
lot<00:01:57.469> of<00:01:57.619> guitars<00:01:57.950> with<00:01:58.909> Jonathan<00:01:59.499> at<00:02:00.499> his

Nels vocal tracks needed a lot of work
but<00:02:06.560> not<00:02:06.740> because<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.249> singer<00:02:07.609> doesn't<00:02:07.999> have

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420
