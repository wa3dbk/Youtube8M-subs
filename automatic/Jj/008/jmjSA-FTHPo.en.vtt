00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.270 

so<00:00:01.140> in<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.319> video<00:00:01.469> what<00:00:01.709> we're<00:00:01.860> gonna<00:00:01.949> do<00:00:02.129> is

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so in this video what we're gonna do is

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.680 
so in this video what we're gonna do is
turn<00:00:02.520> on<00:00:02.580> the<00:00:03.270> Dell<00:00:03.929> XPS<00:00:04.970> 8700<00:00:05.970> for<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.390> first

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
turn on the Dell XPS 8700 for the first

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.900 
turn on the Dell XPS 8700 for the first
time<00:00:07.020> so<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:07.710> can<00:00:07.890> hear<00:00:08.220> what<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.490> sounds<00:00:08.880> like

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
time so you can hear what it sounds like

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.900 
time so you can hear what it sounds like
when<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.110> computer<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.590> actually<00:00:10.830> on<00:00:11.280> now<00:00:11.880> I

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
when the computer is actually on now I

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.079 
when the computer is actually on now I
do<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.710> the<00:00:13.710> side<00:00:13.950> panel<00:00:14.400> off<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.670> this

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
do have the the side panel off of this

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.720 
do have the the side panel off of this
unit<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:15.870> purpose<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.590> will<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.130> charged<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.550> will

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
unit on purpose I will be charged I will

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.550 
unit on purpose I will be charged I will
be<00:00:17.880> putting<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> panel<00:00:18.720> back<00:00:18.869> on<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.350> can

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
be putting the panel back on so you can

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.470 
be putting the panel back on so you can
hear<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> difference<00:00:20.130> between<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.490> two<00:00:20.699> so

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
hear the difference between the two so

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:37.680 
hear the difference between the two so
here<00:00:21.630> we<00:00:21.750> go

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.000 

this<00:00:38.230> is<00:00:38.379> Windows<00:00:38.739> 7

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
this is Windows 7

00:00:41.010 --> 00:01:03.660 
this is Windows 7
here<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> first<00:00:41.640> time

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.120 

so<00:01:04.210> this<00:01:04.330> unit<00:01:04.479> is<00:01:04.750> fairly<00:01:05.199> quiet<00:01:05.590> what<00:01:05.979> you

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
so this unit is fairly quiet what you

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.250 
so this unit is fairly quiet what you
are<00:01:06.280> hearing<00:01:06.640> they're<00:01:06.970> here<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.840> little<00:01:08.020> bit<00:01:08.170> of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
are hearing they're here a little bit of

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.359 
are hearing they're here a little bit of
sound<00:01:08.500> from<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.340> spin-dry

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.300 

right<00:01:16.240> now<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.450> camera<00:01:17.320> where<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.710> webcam<00:01:18.100> is

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
right now the camera where the webcam is

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.569 
right now the camera where the webcam is
approximately<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.619> little<00:01:21.189> over<00:01:21.429> a<00:01:21.460> foot

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
approximately but a little over a foot

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.980 
approximately but a little over a foot
maybe<00:01:22.420> 13<00:01:23.140> 14<00:01:23.170> inches<00:01:23.920> away<00:01:24.100> from<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:25.359> front

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
maybe 13 14 inches away from the front

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.319 
maybe 13 14 inches away from the front
of<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.469> of<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:28.060> computer<00:01:28.840> case<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.060> is

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
of the of the computer case so that is

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:32.490 
of the of the computer case so that is
the<00:01:31.479> sound<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.810> you're<00:01:31.959> hearing<00:01:31.990> from

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
the sound that you're hearing from

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.160 
the sound that you're hearing from
approximately<00:01:32.770> that<00:01:33.369> distance<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.240> will<00:01:34.929> move

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
approximately that distance I will move

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.709 
approximately that distance I will move
the<00:01:35.350> camera<00:01:35.649> a<00:01:35.770> little<00:01:36.009> bit<00:01:36.159> closer<00:01:36.459> so<00:01:37.240> you

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
the camera a little bit closer so you

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.940 
the camera a little bit closer so you
can<00:01:37.840> hear<00:01:38.140> what<00:01:38.259> it<00:01:38.350> sounds<00:01:38.649> like<00:01:38.679> close

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
can hear what it sounds like close

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.520 
can hear what it sounds like close
closer

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.100 

so<00:01:45.860> this<00:01:46.100> is<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.370> inside<00:01:46.730> of<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.910> computer

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
so this is the inside of the computer

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:56.539 
so this is the inside of the computer
and<00:01:48.110> I'll<00:01:48.230> just<00:01:48.410> put<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.710> right<00:01:48.740> here

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.450 

so<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> sound<00:01:57.710> when<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.829> are<00:01:59.009> almost

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
so that is a sound when you are almost

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.789 
so that is a sound when you are almost
directly<00:02:00.420> inside<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.289> computer<00:02:01.469> case

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
directly inside of the computer case

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.609 
directly inside of the computer case
it's<00:02:02.759> basically<00:02:03.149> right<00:02:03.539> where<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> bezel<00:02:04.289> or

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it's basically right where the bezel or

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.020 
it's basically right where the bezel or
starting<00:02:04.860> right<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> side<00:02:05.399> panel<00:02:05.429> would

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
starting right with the side panel would

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.400 
starting right with the side panel would
be<00:02:06.439> that<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> distance<00:02:08.009> away<00:02:08.310> from<00:02:08.670> this

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
be that is the distance away from this

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.750 
be that is the distance away from this
computer<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.679> were<00:02:10.800> your<00:02:11.340> listen<00:02:11.670> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
computer that you were your listen to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.000 
computer that you were your listen to
right<00:02:11.940> now<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:13.260> reason<00:02:13.410> why<00:02:13.590> I'm<00:02:13.680> putting<00:02:13.709> in

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
right now the reason why I'm putting in

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.559 
right now the reason why I'm putting in
this<00:02:14.099> closest<00:02:14.489> because<00:02:14.730> some<00:02:14.910> people<00:02:15.239> like<00:02:15.420> to

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
this closest because some people like to

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.979 
this closest because some people like to
have<00:02:15.720> their<00:02:15.840> computer<00:02:17.360> right<00:02:18.360> beside<00:02:18.720> them<00:02:18.840> on

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
have their computer right beside them on

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.350 
have their computer right beside them on
the<00:02:19.110> desk<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.459> basically<00:02:20.819> as<00:02:21.090> close

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
the desk so this is basically as close

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.729 
the desk so this is basically as close
as<00:02:21.569> possible<00:02:21.629> that<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.230> would<00:02:22.379> be<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
as possible that you would be to the

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.430 
as possible that you would be to the
computer<00:02:23.129> I<00:02:23.340> would<00:02:23.670> assume<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:25.230> I'm<00:02:25.319> just

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
computer I would assume so I'm just

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.600 
computer I would assume so I'm just
going<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.590> back<00:02:25.799> up<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:26.099> little<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.489> can

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
going to back up a little and you can

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.699 
going to back up a little and you can
see<00:02:26.730> what<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:26.970> insides<00:02:27.330> look<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.319> in

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
see what the insides look like and in

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.670 
see what the insides look like and in
terms<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.069> what<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.370> layer<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.959> computer

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
terms of what the layer of that computer

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.680 
terms of what the layer of that computer
case<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.099> so<00:02:32.730> what<00:02:32.970> you'll<00:02:33.120> see<00:02:33.150> here<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
case is so what you'll see here is the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.059 
case is so what you'll see here is the
three<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> half<00:02:36.959> inch<00:02:37.170> drive<00:02:37.440> there<00:02:37.860> that

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
three and a half inch drive there that

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.910 
three and a half inch drive there that
is<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.610> spin<00:02:39.090> drive<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:40.110> have<00:02:40.319> here<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.769> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
is the spin drive we have here it is the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
is the spin drive we have here it is the
video<00:02:41.220> card<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.959> CPU<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.860> fan<00:02:44.069> spinning

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
video card the CPU of the fan spinning

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.039 
video card the CPU of the fan spinning
there<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.599> then<00:02:45.720> up<00:02:45.840> top<00:02:46.019> here<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
there and then up top here we have the

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.589 
there and then up top here we have the
SD<00:02:49.049> there's<00:02:50.010> already<00:02:50.130> a

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
SD there's already a

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.489 
SD there's already a
DVD<00:02:52.459> drive<00:02:53.459> right<00:02:53.849> over<00:02:53.909> here<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.290> course

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:55.499 
DVD drive right over here and of course

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.849 
DVD drive right over here and of course
the<00:02:55.620> power<00:02:55.709> supply<00:02:56.099> over<00:02:56.430> here<00:02:56.609> so<00:02:57.329> that<00:02:57.359> is

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
the power supply over here so that is

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.949 
the power supply over here so that is
the<00:02:58.859> internals<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.639> case<00:02:59.939> you<00:03:00.540> will<00:03:00.689> find

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
the internals of the case you will find

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.069 
the internals of the case you will find
that<00:03:01.079> it<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.379> a<00:03:01.409> bit<00:03:01.769> compact<00:03:02.780> but<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.900> does

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
that it is a bit compact but it does

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.959 
that it is a bit compact but it does
allow<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.409> a<00:03:04.859> little<00:03:05.219> bit<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.340> an<00:03:05.489> expansion

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
allow for a little bit of an expansion

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.750 
allow for a little bit of an expansion
over<00:03:06.269> here<00:03:06.719> in<00:03:06.840> terms<00:03:07.049> of<00:03:07.230> days<00:03:07.560> two<00:03:08.370> more<00:03:08.549> days

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
over here in terms of days two more days

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.429 
over here in terms of days two more days
over<00:03:09.180> here

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
over here

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.619 
over here
what's<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.250> smaller<00:03:11.609> day<00:03:11.909> over<00:03:12.209> here<00:03:12.239> you

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
what's the smaller day over here you

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.229 
what's the smaller day over here you
could<00:03:12.780> probably<00:03:12.989> fit<00:03:13.349> something<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:13.769> as<00:03:13.889> well

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
could probably fit something in as well

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.890 
could probably fit something in as well
aside<00:03:15.239> from<00:03:15.299> that<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:16.439> motherboard<00:03:17.689> see<00:03:18.689> here

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
aside from that the motherboard see here

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.899 
aside from that the motherboard see here
doesn't<00:03:19.379> really<00:03:19.409> have<00:03:19.859> any<00:03:20.189> additional

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
doesn't really have any additional

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.909 
doesn't really have any additional
expansion<00:03:21.719> slots<00:03:22.019> except<00:03:22.439> that<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.620> was<00:03:22.739> one

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
expansion slots except that it was one

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.970 
expansion slots except that it was one
of<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.099> bottom<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.549> there<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.900> does<00:03:25.109> have

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
of the bottom of there so it does have

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.220 
of the bottom of there so it does have
some<00:03:26.269> expansion<00:03:27.269> slots<00:03:27.510> but<00:03:27.659> not<00:03:27.900> too<00:03:28.049> much

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
some expansion slots but not too much

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.770 
some expansion slots but not too much
you<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:29.040> can<00:03:29.189> fit<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.669> this<00:03:29.849> machine<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.299> total
