00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
two but one of the things I wanted to

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.640

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
resin but you can certainly use them for

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.470 
resin but you can certainly use them for

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
that way too and with the plaster it's

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.880 
that way too and with the plaster it's
really<00:04:25.210> fun<00:04:25.600> for<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.050> kids<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.470> be<00:04:26.500> able<00:04:26.680> to
