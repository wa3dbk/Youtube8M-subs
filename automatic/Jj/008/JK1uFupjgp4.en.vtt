00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 And then I'll make you a video 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.929
 of the midwest is that the spiral 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.559
 the custom shop it is an animal made by 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.530
 men 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.630
 hugo vinÃ­cius de oliveira the pedal board 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.240
 I'll try to make a better video of him. 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.820
 But man I need to make this video and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.699
 show you a little of him 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.050
 souza does not offend blue junior and my 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:32.450
 epiphone guitar sheraton i always go 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:37.190
 use a little of the flat here of reverb 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.190
 and because I hope you like the sound 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.300
 is 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.300
 ae 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.260
 using it tightly closed 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.850
 tony here the output volume is high 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.040
 but the low gain 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.309
 so it gets a little more raw called 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.610
 so the way you have more sound 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.610
 his 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.210
 he very much respects the dynamics of the hand 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.060
 so this is something I liked 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.700
 A lot of him if you weigh him dirty 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.830
 Geez, and if you take it off a bit, he will not. 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.659
 There is the one with strong pressure, right? 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.659
 he will respect the dynamics that will give 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.319
 I'm going to use it too. 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.319
 given a little point you feel 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.890
 is 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:41.920
 I try to face as the team found the sound 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:44.319
 the animal was making a sound until 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:50.379
 now, and I thought I remembered a lot 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:54.239
 do a tribute here to there're 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.239
 giving now is on the show day 1 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.050
 entrepreneurs understood the true and 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.300
 good rock'n'roll 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.030
 So I thought the sound was the team. 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.140
 it's very very well well organic animal 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.040
 hot 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.520
 so my suggestion is the middle one 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.260
 if you saw it was an animal drive then a 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.260
 Hugs everyone, thanks guys
