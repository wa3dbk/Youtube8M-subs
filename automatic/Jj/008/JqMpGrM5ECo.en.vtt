project<00:05:56.550> this<00:05:56.880> I<00:05:57.210> believe<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.870> 21st<00:05:58.350> century

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
project this I believe the 21st century

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.580 
project this I believe the 21st century
will<00:05:59.430> be<00:05:59.460> the<00:05:59.700> century<00:06:00.000> of<00:06:00.419> the<00:06:00.570> brain<00:06:00.870> I<00:06:01.200> think

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
will be the century of the brain I think

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.340

and<00:06:04.650> it<00:06:05.550> seems<00:06:05.820> to<00:06:06.090> me<00:06:06.240> that<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.660> fields<00:06:07.140> need

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
and it seems to me that the fields need

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.650 
and it seems to me that the fields need
this<00:06:07.740> kind<00:06:08.010> of<00:06:08.160> initiative<00:06:08.760> really<00:06:09.090> to<00:06:09.450> move

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
this kind of initiative really to move

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.450 
this kind of initiative really to move
forward<00:06:10.140> and<00:06:10.320> I<00:06:10.500> see<00:06:10.710> fantastic

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
forward and I see fantastic
