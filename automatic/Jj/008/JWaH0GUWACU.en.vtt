until<00:01:11.590> firm<00:01:12.100> do<00:01:12.790> not<00:01:12.940> skip<00:01:13.240> this<00:01:13.270> step<00:01:13.690> it'll

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
until firm do not skip this step it'll

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.570 
until firm do not skip this step it'll
that<00:01:14.290> makes<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.710> dough<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:14.830> lot<00:01:15.070> easier<00:01:15.460> to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
that makes the dough a lot easier to

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.080 
that makes the dough a lot easier to
handle

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
handle

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.410

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
so in chop a piece of dough make

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.840 
so in chop a piece of dough make
approximately<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.200> one-inch<00:01:53.590> bowl<00:01:54.190> of<00:01:54.550> dough
