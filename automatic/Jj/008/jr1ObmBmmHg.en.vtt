00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.950
 hello girls again how are you 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.620
 well in this video we are going to get what 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.440
 is the face shape to know how to get out 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.809
 what kind of face do we have and for that 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.860
 we are going to need a pen a notebook 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.310
 and a tape can be a quote from this 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.560
 type or it can be a rule 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.630
 and we're going to start measuring so 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.529
 I suggest you place yourself in front of a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.199
 where they can from the face to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.940
 Take the following steps first 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.030
 what are we going to take out 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.430
 is the measurement of where our 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.930
 hair where our hair grows 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.969
 up to the eye chin if they have a 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.360
 tape of this type is not going to stick to 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.610
 the face but you have to keep the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.799
 straight so that the measures are more 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.329
 precise 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.550
 so let's measure from where else 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.210
 The hair 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.640
 up to the chin 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.890
 in the notebook we mark a line in the 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.810
 center 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.810
 with the measures you have given us 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.620
 in this case it's 20 centimeters that 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.620
 I'm checking in there are 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.840
 now the next step we are going to 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.759
 take out is from 100 to 100 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.149
 we also place the tape by 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.149
 encimita 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.210
 and there it is 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.220
 from the middle line that we mark 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.310
 is where we are going to divide for example in 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.650
 this case in total gave me 12 centimeters 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.700
 then we mark the middle line 6 for 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.700
 here and 6 here 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.760
 this line will be drawing up 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.760
 up this way 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.540
 the next measure will be in the eyes 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.920
 the line that traces the eyes 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.920
 we also measure 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.849
 and we're going to put it a little bit 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.849
 below 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.390
 the third line will go in the ears 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.690
 more or less where the alternate 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.690
 cheekbones 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.239
 there 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.260
 we put them 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.260
 in a straight way 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.940
 and we also draw the line 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.370
 here it is 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.580
 and finally the fourth line will go in 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.950
 the little bone where the 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.120
 jaw 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.120
 although more or less 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.530
 let's take the measure 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.530
 and we draw it 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:38.910
 here we are going to have a scheme like this 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.910
 more or less 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:46.610
 and what we are going to do is in a way 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.610
 straight interlace each of the points 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:56.990
 they also take 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:04:00.530
 the tape or the ruler and we started to join 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.610
 according to the drawing you give us is the kind of 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.610
 face that we are going to have 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.230
 will not exactly come out for example a 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.960
 heart if it has the shape of the heart or 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.210
 a perfect circle but if it goes 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.760
 very similar to the structure although with 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:21.730
 straight lines something that would be 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.210
 and the shape of the face right now I'm going to 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.210
 to show 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.990
 in this case 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.360
 this would be my face 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.040
 It is an oval face and right now they 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.750
 show that if the eye is not 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:48.360
 can distinguish what they can do 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.350
 is to draw around either the circle 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.700
 the oval the triangle squared and see 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.850
 how closely the figure resembles 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.130
 if you can see you can form a new 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.900
 value that's why it's called face 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.780
 oval that type if on the contrary 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.529
 can draw a circle if it's more like 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.419
 a triangle and so on 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:13.539
 gives you the face shape that they have 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.809
 good as you can see to know what kind of 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:19.059
 we hold it serves us a lot for 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:21.789
 make up our hair for the types of 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:25.089
 Haircuts for accessories and 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.739
 many more things then I hope that 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.509
 it works for them to share with me what 

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:30.489
 type of face have any doubt already 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.239
 they know we are and we keep seeing 

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:33.239
 bye
