00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.229 
can go into another channel yeah sure
let's<00:02:08.259> give<00:02:08.409> it<00:02:08.439> a<00:02:08.500> shot<00:02:08.530> there<00:02:09.489> we<00:02:09.579> are<00:02:09.610> ok

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
let's give it a shot there we are ok

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.289 
let's give it a shot there we are ok
there<00:02:10.420> we<00:02:10.509> are<00:02:10.659> I<00:02:10.929> may<00:02:11.680> have<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:12.189> to<00:02:12.790> adjust<00:02:13.209> the

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
there we are I may have to to adjust the

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.580 
there we are I may have to to adjust the
contrast<00:02:13.599> a<00:02:14.019> little<00:02:14.290> bit<00:02:14.439> so<00:02:15.360> sometimes<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.629> so

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
contrast a little bit so sometimes I so

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.440 
contrast a little bit so sometimes I so
it's<00:02:17.769> dependent<00:02:18.220> on<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.459> lighting<00:02:18.849> so<00:02:19.209> yeah

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
it's dependent on the lighting so yeah

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.210 
it's dependent on the lighting so yeah
yeah<00:02:19.599> it<00:02:19.689> so<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.870> know<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:20.709> not<00:02:20.860> actually

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
yeah it so I know it's not actually

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.550 
yeah it so I know it's not actually
seeing<00:02:21.489> our<00:02:21.700> headsets<00:02:22.180> really<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:22.630> all<00:02:22.780> we<00:02:23.440> do

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
seeing our headsets really at all we do

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.380 
seeing our headsets really at all we do
try<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:23.800> catch<00:02:24.099> water<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.819> Hat<00:02:24.970> earlier

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
try and catch water in the Hat earlier

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.860 
try and catch water in the Hat earlier
turns<00:02:25.630> out<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.780> Hat<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:25.900> black<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.530> does<00:02:26.680> know

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
turns out the Hat is black so does know

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.740 
turns out the Hat is black so does know
work<00:02:27.019> yeah<00:02:27.739> exactly<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:31.099> case<00:02:31.720> what<00:02:32.720> I

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
work yeah exactly so in this case what I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.830 
work yeah exactly so in this case what I
can<00:02:32.930> try<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.200> do<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.680> too<00:02:34.489> yeah<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.330> freeze

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
can try to do it too yeah I can freeze

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.500 
can try to do it too yeah I can freeze
this<00:02:36.019> image<00:02:36.379> I<00:02:36.620> say<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.549> then<00:02:37.909> I<00:02:38.030> can<00:02:38.209> try<00:02:38.450> it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
this image I say and then I can try it

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.240 
this image I say and then I can try it
to<00:02:38.870> tilt<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.379> little<00:02:39.560> bit<00:02:39.799> oh<00:02:40.209> nice<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:42.250> sort

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
to tilt it a little bit oh nice and sort

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.119 
to tilt it a little bit oh nice and sort
of<00:02:43.370> like<00:02:43.549> this<00:02:44.590> that's<00:02:45.590> quite<00:02:45.769> impressive

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
of like this that's quite impressive

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.339 
of like this that's quite impressive
piece<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.700> tech<00:02:46.909> that<00:02:47.120> you've<00:02:47.239> got<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.629> thank

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
piece of tech that you've got that thank

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:56.649 
piece of tech that you've got that thank
you<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:55.700> know<00:02:55.819> what<00:02:55.970> it's<00:02:56.090> really<00:02:56.360> hard<00:02:56.540> to

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
you you know what it's really hard to

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:57.910 
you you know what it's really hard to
actually<00:02:56.750> say<00:02:57.140> anything<00:02:57.470> about<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:57.769> Gary

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
actually say anything about this Gary

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.660 
actually say anything about this Gary
just<00:02:58.190> like<00:02:58.310> it's<00:02:58.640> just<00:02:58.849> you<00:02:59.840> could<00:02:59.959> see<00:03:00.260> it

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
just like it's just you could see it

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.770 
just like it's just you could see it
there's<00:03:01.670> not<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.849> lot<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.030> say<00:03:02.269> that<00:03:02.420> it's<00:03:02.540> like

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
there's not a lot to say that it's like

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.750 
there's not a lot to say that it's like
this<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:03.290> how<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.620> is<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:04.129> is<00:03:04.250> extremely

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
this is how it is this is extremely

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.089 
this is how it is this is extremely
unusual<00:03:05.000> stuff<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:06.019> people<00:03:06.709> would<00:03:06.950> have

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
unusual stuff that people would have

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.839 
unusual stuff that people would have
really<00:03:07.310> thought<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.940> couple<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.269> years<00:03:08.420> ago

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
really thought of a couple of years ago

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.580 
really thought of a couple of years ago
and<00:03:10.849> I<00:03:11.090> mean<00:03:11.420> there<00:03:11.629> there<00:03:11.989> are<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.109> lot<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.290> ways

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
and I mean there there are a lot of ways

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.589 
and I mean there there are a lot of ways
to<00:03:12.829> play<00:03:13.040> this<00:03:13.069> game<00:03:13.489> yeah<00:03:13.879> this<00:03:14.060> is<00:03:14.180> one<00:03:14.420> way

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
to play this game yeah this is one way

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.420 
to play this game yeah this is one way
to<00:03:14.629> play<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.170> game<00:03:15.349> uh-huh<00:03:15.530> but<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.099> can<00:03:16.250> also

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
to play the game uh-huh but you can also

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.460 
to play the game uh-huh but you can also
for<00:03:16.970> example<00:03:17.390> draw<00:03:17.629> something<00:03:18.109> on<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.290> sheet

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
for example draw something on the sheet

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.259 
for example draw something on the sheet
of<00:03:18.560> paper<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:19.040> hold<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.430> hold<00:03:19.579> it<00:03:19.849> up<00:03:19.940> here

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
of paper and hold and hold it up here

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.809 
of paper and hold and hold it up here
yeah<00:03:20.629> and<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.200> then<00:03:21.590> freeze<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.099> image<00:03:22.129> yeah

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
yeah and and then freeze the image yeah

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.910 
yeah and and then freeze the image yeah
it's<00:03:23.420> got<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:23.629> automated<00:03:24.140> reality<00:03:24.560> crayon

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
it's got like automated reality crayon

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.770 
it's got like automated reality crayon
physics<00:03:25.129> a<00:03:25.459> little<00:03:25.640> bit<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:26.120> mean<00:03:26.359> I<00:03:26.390> can<00:03:26.599> also

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
physics a little bit I mean I can also

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.380 
physics a little bit I mean I can also
invert<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.470> image<00:03:27.500> all<00:03:28.459> right<00:03:28.790> some<00:03:28.970> awesome

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
invert the image all right some awesome

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.199 
invert the image all right some awesome
all<00:03:29.569> solid<00:03:30.170> it<00:03:30.290> it's<00:03:30.470> Floyd<00:03:30.829> Wow<00:03:31.280> yeah<00:03:31.790> okay

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
all solid it it's Floyd Wow yeah okay

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.870 
all solid it it's Floyd Wow yeah okay
like<00:03:32.840> this<00:03:32.989> for<00:03:33.290> God's<00:03:33.500> inside<00:03:33.859> but<00:03:34.639> I<00:03:34.669> will

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
like this for God's inside but I will

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.629 
like this for God's inside but I will
invert<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.209> back<00:03:35.599> and<00:03:35.900> change<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.410> color<00:03:36.639> back

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
invert it back and change the color back

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.400 
invert it back and change the color back
to<00:03:37.910> this<00:03:38.169> yeah<00:03:39.489> so<00:03:40.489> in<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.120> we<00:03:41.780> also<00:03:41.989> we<00:03:42.260> have

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
to this yeah so in and we also we have

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.059 
to this yeah so in and we also we have
about<00:03:42.879> about<00:03:43.879> 80<00:03:44.540> levels<00:03:45.049> okay<00:03:45.470> at<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.889> moment

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
about about 80 levels okay at the moment

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.110 
about about 80 levels okay at the moment
yeah<00:03:46.790> but<00:03:47.750> we<00:03:48.139> also<00:03:48.290> have<00:03:48.609> portals<00:03:49.609> in<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:49.940> new

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
yeah but we also have portals in the new

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.009 
yeah but we also have portals in the new
level<00:03:50.450> package<00:03:50.750> here<00:03:50.989> yep<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:52.660> in<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:53.780> case

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
level package here yep so in this case

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.460 
level package here yep so in this case
we<00:03:54.769> have<00:03:54.919> to<00:03:55.359> guide<00:03:56.359> us<00:03:56.569> through<00:03:56.599> the<00:03:57.049> portals

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
we have to guide us through the portals

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.369 
we have to guide us through the portals
and<00:03:57.769> it<00:03:57.949> will<00:03:58.129> go<00:03:58.519> oh<00:03:58.819> wow<00:03:59.359> on<00:03:59.720> the<00:04:00.169> other<00:04:00.260> side

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
and it will go oh wow on the other side

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.740 
and it will go oh wow on the other side
so

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
so

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.950 
so
we<00:04:02.410> can<00:04:02.560> try<00:04:02.770> there<00:04:03.010> too<00:04:03.250> yeah<00:04:03.790> how<00:04:04.270> I'm<00:04:04.660> going

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
we can try there too yeah how I'm going

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.170 
we can try there too yeah how I'm going
to<00:04:05.020> ask<00:04:05.170> how<00:04:05.470> exactly<00:04:06.100> do<00:04:06.580> you<00:04:06.610> come<00:04:06.880> up<00:04:06.910> with<00:04:07.030> a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
to ask how exactly do you come up with a

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.520 
to ask how exactly do you come up with a
game<00:04:07.390> like<00:04:07.570> this<00:04:07.630> where<00:04:07.990> did<00:04:08.110> this<00:04:08.170> idea<00:04:08.350> come

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
game like this where did this idea come

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.550 
game like this where did this idea come
from<00:04:08.790> it's<00:04:09.790> just<00:04:10.180> somewhere<00:04:10.930> in<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.290> park

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
from it's just somewhere in the park

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.740 
from it's just somewhere in the park
you're<00:04:11.920> sitting<00:04:12.250> somewhere<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.030> then<00:04:13.600> you're

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
you're sitting somewhere and then you're

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.039 
you're sitting somewhere and then you're
thinking<00:04:14.110> well<00:04:14.980> maybe<00:04:15.010> we<00:04:15.670> should<00:04:16.000> just

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
thinking well maybe we should just

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.930 
thinking well maybe we should just
invert<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.410> principle<00:04:18.040> of<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.400> level<00:04:18.700> being

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
invert the principle of the level being

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.810 
invert the principle of the level being
in<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.329> game<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.870> today<00:04:20.859> being<00:04:21.040> outside<00:04:21.400> yeah

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
in the game and today being outside yeah

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.760 
in the game and today being outside yeah
creates<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.480> level<00:04:22.630> yeah<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.320> player<00:04:23.530> is<00:04:23.740> the

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
creates a level yeah the player is the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.520 
creates a level yeah the player is the
level<00:04:24.160> what<00:04:24.310> that's<00:04:25.110> mind-bending<00:04:26.110> when<00:04:26.470> you

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
level what that's mind-bending when you

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.890 
level what that's mind-bending when you
think<00:04:26.740> about<00:04:26.800> it<00:04:27.240> yeah<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:30.190> then<00:04:30.610> we<00:04:30.730> just

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
think about it yeah and then we just

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.750 
think about it yeah and then we just
when<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.050> technology<00:04:32.380> was<00:04:32.650> available<00:04:33.070> like

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
when the technology was available like

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.090 
when the technology was available like
the<00:04:34.060> ipad<00:04:34.390> 2<00:04:34.570> it<00:04:34.780> just<00:04:34.990> fit<00:04:35.200> it<00:04:35.350> right<00:04:35.500> into<00:04:35.830> the

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
the ipad 2 it just fit it right into the

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.740 
the ipad 2 it just fit it right into the
concept<00:04:36.580> yeah<00:04:36.820> so<00:04:37.120> we<00:04:37.240> saw<00:04:37.419> yes<00:04:37.780> on<00:04:37.960> my<00:04:38.080> head<00:04:39.750> it

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
concept yeah so we saw yes on my head it

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.450 
concept yeah so we saw yes on my head it
might<00:04:40.930> be<00:04:41.080> a<00:04:41.110> great<00:04:41.410> platform<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.950> do<00:04:42.190> it<00:04:42.310> on

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
might be a great platform to do it on

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.370 
might be a great platform to do it on
since<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.360> only<00:04:43.600> time<00:04:43.750> want<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.930> feel<00:04:44.050> okay

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
since the only time want to feel okay

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.750 
since the only time want to feel okay

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
does work really really well yeah I can

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.260 
does work really really well yeah I can
try<00:05:17.380> to<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:18.340> do<00:05:18.430> variant<00:05:18.760> of<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:18.910> game<00:05:19.090> where

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
try to to do variant of the game where

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
try to to do variant of the game where
you<00:05:19.360> try<00:05:19.390> and<00:05:19.570> fit<00:05:19.810> as<00:05:19.900> much<00:05:20.020> of<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.200> water

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
you try and fit as much of the water

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
you try and fit as much of the water
into<00:05:20.500> my<00:05:20.650> head<00:05:20.890> it's<00:05:21.130> humanly<00:05:21.400> possible<00:05:23.310> it's

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
into my head it's humanly possible it's

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.010 
into my head it's humanly possible it's
different<00:05:24.520> either<00:05:24.760> if<00:05:25.060> I<00:05:25.270> move<00:05:25.450> my<00:05:25.600> t-shirts

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
different either if I move my t-shirts

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.350 
different either if I move my t-shirts
slightly<00:05:26.440> this<00:05:26.590> way<00:05:26.650> then<00:05:27.610> surely<00:05:28.000> becomes<00:05:28.270> a

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
slightly this way then surely becomes a

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.780 
slightly this way then surely becomes a
little<00:05:28.570> bit<00:05:28.660> easier<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:30.550> think<00:05:30.580> you're

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
little bit easier you I think you're

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.860 
little bit easier you I think you're
dealing<00:05:31.060> with<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.330> lighting<00:05:31.660> in<00:05:31.780> the

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
dealing with the lighting in the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.659 
dealing with the lighting in the
background<00:05:32.290> at<00:05:32.470> being<00:05:32.680> an<00:05:32.770> actual<00:05:33.100> obstacle

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
background at being an actual obstacle

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.850 
background at being an actual obstacle
to<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.910> level<00:05:34.180> yeah<00:05:34.900> I<00:05:35.169> guess<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.470> magic<00:05:35.560> pill

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
to the level yeah I guess the magic pill

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.380 
to the level yeah I guess the magic pill
try<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.130> take<00:05:36.460> this<00:05:36.640> into<00:05:36.820> a<00:05:36.910> different<00:05:37.240> room

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
try to take this into a different room

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.710 
try to take this into a different room
because<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:37.900> room<00:05:38.290> is<00:05:38.320> too<00:05:38.560> hard<00:05:38.820> uh-huh<00:05:39.820> yeah

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
because the room is too hard uh-huh yeah

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.350 
because the room is too hard uh-huh yeah
i<00:05:41.080> mean<00:05:41.410> this<00:05:42.010> game<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.460> all<00:05:42.610> about<00:05:42.640> changing

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
i mean this game is all about changing

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.080 
i mean this game is all about changing
your<00:05:43.390> environment<00:05:44.200> so<00:05:44.500> if<00:05:44.740> it<00:05:45.610> doesn't<00:05:45.910> work

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
your environment so if it doesn't work

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.400 
your environment so if it doesn't work
at<00:05:46.240> first<00:05:46.419> you<00:05:46.810> just<00:05:46.840> change<00:05:47.350> your

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
at first you just change your

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.250 
at first you just change your
environment<00:05:47.800> so<00:05:48.160> does<00:05:48.430> work<00:05:48.729> for<00:05:48.970> example<00:05:49.419> yes

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
environment so does work for example yes

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.650 
environment so does work for example yes
case<00:05:50.560> i<00:05:50.710> would<00:05:50.860> just<00:05:51.070> turn<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:52.000> ipad<00:05:52.300> a<00:05:52.330> little

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
case i would just turn the ipad a little

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.350 
case i would just turn the ipad a little
bit<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:53.130> maybe<00:05:54.130> okay<00:05:54.610> your<00:05:54.790> head<00:05:55.000> is<00:05:55.150> in<00:05:55.270> the

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
bit and maybe okay your head is in the

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.600 
bit and maybe okay your head is in the
way<00:05:55.510> so<00:05:55.570> you<00:05:56.229> might<00:05:56.410> move<00:05:56.919> it<00:05:57.070> a<00:05:57.160> little<00:05:57.190> bit<00:05:57.460> to

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
way so you might move it a little bit to

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.140 
way so you might move it a little bit to
the<00:05:57.729> right<00:05:57.760> I<00:05:58.210> don't<00:05:58.930> know

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.480 

maybe<00:06:03.140> you<00:06:03.320> move<00:06:03.530> your<00:06:03.710> head<00:06:03.890> a<00:06:03.920> little<00:06:04.070> bit<00:06:04.310> to

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
maybe you move your head a little bit to

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.540 
maybe you move your head a little bit to
the<00:06:04.610> right<00:06:04.640> and<00:06:05.060> then<00:06:05.150> I<00:06:05.890> could<00:06:06.890> I<00:06:07.070> could<00:06:07.100> solve

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
the right and then I could I could solve

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.450 
the right and then I could I could solve
it<00:06:08.170> stop<00:06:09.170> it<00:06:09.350> sort<00:06:09.530> of<00:06:09.560> there<00:06:09.800> somewhere<00:06:10.400> it

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
it stop it sort of there somewhere it

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.710 
it stop it sort of there somewhere it
will<00:06:10.550> go<00:06:10.700> to<00:06:10.760> the<00:06:10.970> teleporter<00:06:11.450> there<00:06:16.390> but<00:06:17.390> sing

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
will go to the teleporter there but sing

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.210 
will go to the teleporter there but sing
is<00:06:17.900> steadily<00:06:18.410> not<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:18.680> most<00:06:18.800> efficient<00:06:19.190> way

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
is steadily not the most efficient way

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.070 
is steadily not the most efficient way
to<00:06:19.280> do<00:06:19.490> I<00:06:19.640> need<00:06:19.760> more<00:06:19.880> limbs<00:06:20.210> and<00:06:20.660> it's<00:06:20.870> thirty

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
to do I need more limbs and it's thirty

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.620 
to do I need more limbs and it's thirty
five<00:06:21.320> or<00:06:21.350> six<00:06:21.680> limbs<00:06:21.890> that<00:06:22.070> yeah<00:06:22.850> that's<00:06:23.450> when

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
five or six limbs that yeah that's when

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.330 
five or six limbs that yeah that's when
you<00:06:23.750> call<00:06:24.020> a<00:06:24.050> friend<00:06:24.260> in<00:06:24.530> and<00:06:24.770> yeah<00:06:24.980> he's<00:06:25.100> like

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
you call a friend in and yeah he's like

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.740 
you call a friend in and yeah he's like
that<00:06:25.520> this<00:06:25.760> actually<00:06:25.940> seems<00:06:26.210> like<00:06:26.450> the<00:06:26.570> kind

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
that this actually seems like the kind

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.360 
that this actually seems like the kind
of<00:06:26.960> thing<00:06:27.020> that<00:06:27.260> I<00:06:27.470> would<00:06:27.650> having<00:06:28.160> to<00:06:28.250> get

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
of thing that I would having to get

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.130 
of thing that I would having to get
drunk<00:06:28.640> with<00:06:28.910> friends<00:06:29.330> with<00:06:29.510> and<00:06:29.720> act<00:06:29.840> like<00:06:29.990> an

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
drunk with friends with and act like an

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.350 
drunk with friends with and act like an
idiot<00:06:30.290> in<00:06:30.680> it<00:06:31.640> requires<00:06:31.970> a<00:06:32.030> little<00:06:32.210> bit<00:06:32.300> of

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
idiot in it requires a little bit of

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.900 
idiot in it requires a little bit of
thought<00:06:32.920> if<00:06:33.920> you<00:06:33.980> tilt<00:06:34.310> your<00:06:34.400> head<00:06:34.640> a<00:06:34.700> little

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
thought if you tilt your head a little

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.390 
thought if you tilt your head a little
bit<00:06:35.030> to<00:06:35.270> the<00:06:35.420> left<00:06:35.750> yeah<00:06:36.230> this<00:06:36.770> this<00:06:37.160> will

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
bit to the left yeah this this will

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.670 
bit to the left yeah this this will
probably<00:06:37.670> be<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:38.690> best<00:06:38.930> way<00:06:39.170> to<00:06:39.230> solve<00:06:39.620> this

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
probably be the best way to solve this

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.550 
probably be the best way to solve this
level<00:06:40.420> so<00:06:41.420> this<00:06:41.510> is<00:06:41.630> a<00:06:41.660> chiropractor

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
level so this is a chiropractor

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.490 
level so this is a chiropractor
simulator<00:06:42.980> right<00:06:43.190> now<00:06:43.370> yeah<00:06:44.170> my<00:06:45.170> hand<00:06:45.380> over

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
simulator right now yeah my hand over

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.180 
simulator right now yeah my hand over
there<00:06:47.110> yeah<00:06:48.110> a<00:06:48.140> little<00:06:48.620> bit<00:06:48.710> too<00:06:48.860> getting<00:06:49.100> in

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
there yeah a little bit too getting in

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.100 
there yeah a little bit too getting in
there<00:06:49.370> yeah<00:06:50.000> but<00:06:50.240> it's<00:06:50.390> all<00:06:50.510> most<00:06:50.720> efficient

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
there yeah but it's all most efficient

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.200 
there yeah but it's all most efficient
way<00:06:51.140> to<00:06:51.200> do<00:06:51.470> it<00:06:51.590> but<00:06:51.680> it<00:06:51.800> does<00:06:51.950> it<00:06:52.130> yeah<00:06:52.790> if<00:06:53.060> we

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
way to do it but it does it yeah if we

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.240 
way to do it but it does it yeah if we
wait<00:06:53.390> a<00:06:53.420> little<00:06:53.540> little<00:06:54.050> little<00:06:54.200> bit<00:06:54.620> yeah<00:06:54.980> and

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
wait a little little little bit yeah and

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.510 
wait a little little little bit yeah and
then<00:06:55.490> we<00:06:55.850> solve<00:06:56.090> it<00:06:56.270> well<00:06:57.140> there<00:06:57.350> you<00:06:57.440> go<00:06:57.520> well

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
then we solve it well there you go well

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.250 
then we solve it well there you go well
that's<00:06:58.760> falling<00:06:59.150> the<00:06:59.210> most<00:06:59.360> unusual<00:06:59.540> ipad
