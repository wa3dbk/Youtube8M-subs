00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.110 

in<00:00:12.950> the<00:00:13.040> last<00:00:13.250> lesson<00:00:13.429> we<00:00:13.610> learned<00:00:13.820> how<00:00:13.910> to<00:00:13.969> do

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
in the last lesson we learned how to do

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.420 
in the last lesson we learned how to do
major<00:00:14.360> and<00:00:14.629> minor<00:00:14.840> chords<00:00:15.070> using<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:16.160> six

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
major and minor chords using the six

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.589 
major and minor chords using the six
string<00:00:16.640> as<00:00:16.760> your<00:00:16.910> route<00:00:17.090> or<00:00:17.270> what<00:00:17.480> we<00:00:17.570> would

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
string as your route or what we would

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.409 
string as your route or what we would
refer<00:00:17.779> to<00:00:18.080> as<00:00:18.199> the<00:00:18.230> eform<00:00:18.880> now<00:00:19.880> let's<00:00:20.029> expand

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:20.419 
refer to as the eform now let's expand

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.420 
refer to as the eform now let's expand
upon<00:00:20.630> that<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.020> we'll<00:00:21.169> throw<00:00:21.590> some<00:00:21.619> seven

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
upon that and we'll throw some seven

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.120 
upon that and we'll throw some seven
chords<00:00:22.700> and<00:00:22.849> some<00:00:22.970> sus<00:00:23.180> chords<00:00:23.509> into<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:23.840> mix

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
chords and some sus chords into the mix

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.679 
chords and some sus chords into the mix
again<00:00:25.130> we're<00:00:25.400> going<00:00:25.520> to<00:00:25.579> be<00:00:25.669> using<00:00:25.700> six<00:00:26.270> string

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
again we're going to be using six string

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.679 
again we're going to be using six string
as<00:00:26.930> our<00:00:27.140> route<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:28.359> remember<00:00:29.359> that<00:00:29.510> all

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
as our route and remember that all

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.150 
as our route and remember that all
natural<00:00:30.109> notes<00:00:30.230> are<00:00:30.439> a<00:00:30.470> whole<00:00:30.679> step<00:00:30.859> apart

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
natural notes are a whole step apart

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160 
natural notes are a whole step apart
with<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.429> exception<00:00:31.789> of<00:00:31.880> E<00:00:32.150> and<00:00:32.269> F<00:00:32.419> and<00:00:32.720> B<00:00:32.750> and

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
with the exception of E and F and B and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.689 
with the exception of E and F and B and
C<00:00:33.379> which<00:00:33.590> are<00:00:33.739> right<00:00:33.860> next<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:34.220> each<00:00:34.280> other<00:00:34.550> a

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
C which are right next to each other a

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.750 
C which are right next to each other a
half<00:00:35.000> step<00:00:35.239> apart<00:00:35.589> so<00:00:36.589> with<00:00:36.860> that<00:00:37.040> logic<00:00:37.309> we

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
half step apart so with that logic we

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.740 
half step apart so with that logic we
have<00:00:37.940> e<00:00:38.089> f<00:00:38.720> g<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:39.980> a<00:00:40.489> you're<00:00:41.030> on<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.360> sixth

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
have e f g and a you're on the sixth

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.430 
have e f g and a you're on the sixth
string<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:43.059> then<00:00:44.059> if<00:00:44.180> we<00:00:44.300> were<00:00:44.450> to<00:00:44.629> start<00:00:44.989> at<00:00:45.230> g

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
string and then if we were to start at g

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.529 
string and then if we were to start at g
and<00:00:45.739> go<00:00:45.920> down<00:00:46.219> a<00:00:46.550> half<00:00:46.760> step<00:00:46.820> we<00:00:47.120> would<00:00:47.239> have<00:00:47.360> G

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
and go down a half step we would have G

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.810 
and go down a half step we would have G
flat<00:00:47.780> if<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:48.559> were<00:00:48.620> to<00:00:48.739> start<00:00:48.829> a<00:00:49.010> G<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:49.309> go<00:00:49.370> up<00:00:49.550> a

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
flat if we were to start a G and go up a

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.590 
flat if we were to start a G and go up a
half<00:00:50.030> step<00:00:50.090> we<00:00:50.899> would<00:00:51.050> be<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.199> g-sharp<00:00:52.420> so<00:00:53.420> let's

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
half step we would be a g-sharp so let's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.869 
half step we would be a g-sharp so let's
do<00:00:53.750> g7<00:00:54.430> will<00:00:55.430> find<00:00:55.670> our<00:00:55.820> route<00:00:56.030> e<00:00:56.210> f<00:00:56.780> g<00:00:57.640> bar<00:00:58.640> all

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
do g7 will find our route e f g bar all

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.459 
do g7 will find our route e f g bar all
the<00:00:58.910> way<00:00:59.090> across<00:00:59.239> here<00:00:59.629> at<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.840> third<00:01:00.079> fret

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
the way across here at the third fret

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.279 
the way across here at the third fret
with<00:01:01.340> your<00:01:01.370> first<00:01:01.640> finger<00:01:01.850> your<00:01:02.780> third<00:01:03.109> finger

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
with your first finger your third finger

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.380 
with your first finger your third finger
would<00:01:03.530> go<00:01:03.680> at<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:03.920> 5th<00:01:04.190> fret<00:01:04.430> of<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:05.000> 5th

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
would go at the 5th fret of the 5th

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.010 
would go at the 5th fret of the 5th
string<00:01:05.690> your<00:01:05.930> second<00:01:06.380> finger<00:01:06.590> goes<00:01:07.340> at<00:01:07.670> the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
string your second finger goes at the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.139 
string your second finger goes at the
4th<00:01:09.020> fret<00:01:09.289> of<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.619> 3rd<00:01:09.950> string<00:01:10.190> and<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:11.030> is

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
4th fret of the 3rd string and this is

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.210 
4th fret of the 3rd string and this is
one<00:01:11.300> way<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.450> play<00:01:11.600> g7

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.250 

the<00:01:15.760> way<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:15.880> like<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.210> do<00:01:16.390> it<00:01:16.510> is<00:01:16.600> I<00:01:16.660> like<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.050> do

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
the way I like to do it is I like to do

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.320 
the way I like to do it is I like to do
that<00:01:17.380> same<00:01:17.740> exact<00:01:18.250> form<00:01:18.610> but<00:01:18.880> now<00:01:19.030> I<00:01:19.060> add<00:01:19.300> my

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
that same exact form but now I add my

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.640 
that same exact form but now I add my
pinky<00:01:20.190> to<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.400> 6th<00:01:22.000> fret<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:23.140> second

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
pinky to the 6th fret of the second

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.440 
pinky to the 6th fret of the second
string

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.630 

and<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:28.140> g7<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.310> were<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.430> take

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and that's g7 now if you were to take

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
and that's g7 now if you were to take
that<00:01:29.820> shape<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.360> bring<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:30.719> a<00:01:31.350> half<00:01:31.649> step

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that shape and bring it down a half step

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.810 
that shape and bring it down a half step
that<00:01:32.070> would<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.280> G<00:01:32.520> flat<00:01:32.759> seven

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
that would be G flat seven

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.810 
that would be G flat seven
and

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.219 

take<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.149> and<00:01:39.329> bring<00:01:39.539> it<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
take that up and bring it up a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.230 
take that up and bring it up a
whole-step<00:01:42.079> you<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.229> G<00:01:43.409> sharp<00:01:43.649> 7<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:45.090> by

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
whole-step you have G sharp 7 then by

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.620 
whole-step you have G sharp 7 then by
that<00:01:45.390> same<00:01:45.539> token<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.229> e<00:01:46.500> f<00:01:47.009> g<00:01:47.069> a<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that same token we have e f g a do that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.490 
that same token we have e f g a do that
same<00:01:48.899> shape<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:50.009> your<00:01:50.219> route<00:01:51.409> we<00:01:52.409> have

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
same shape from a as your route we have

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.520 
same shape from a as your route we have
a<00:01:52.619> seven<00:01:53.069> down<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> half<00:01:54.179> step<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:55.759> flat<00:01:56.759> seven<00:01:57.530> so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
a seven down a half step a flat seven so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.340 
a seven down a half step a flat seven so
just<00:01:58.709> get<00:01:58.799> used<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.340> chord<00:01:59.670> shape<00:02:00.350> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
just get used to that chord shape and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.800 
just get used to that chord shape and
wherever<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.770> put<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.069> root<00:02:02.600> that's<00:02:03.600> what

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
wherever you put the root that's what

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.310 
wherever you put the root that's what
you<00:02:03.929> got<00:02:04.140> we'll<00:02:05.069> have<00:02:05.189> f<00:02:05.399> sharp<00:02:05.609> here
