okay still sound on this line but

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.010 
okay still sound on this line but
instead<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.369> sliding<00:01:56.610> laterally<00:01:57.299> we're

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
instead of sliding laterally we're

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.280 
instead of sliding laterally we're
running<00:01:58.380> linear<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.340> line<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.079> let's<00:02:01.079> say

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
running linear on this line so let's say

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
running linear on this line so let's say
step<00:02:01.710> off<00:02:01.860> real<00:02:02.009> quick<00:02:02.189> me<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:03.750> I'm
