00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.390
 recovery 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:14.170
 switch off the appliance with the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.420
 off the device off 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.100

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:47.000
 good recovery screen 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:57.610
 already in recovery the situation is simpler 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:00.320
 you will insure select the files 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.119
 and the first step is to install xperia 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:10.429
 a framework team the framework inspires 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:13.040
 the framework that confirms good flash with 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.379

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.689
 I'll mark everything at once here I 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:22.010
 I think most people use the 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:24.050
 bad time that is the twr p select all 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.060
 at one time who uses only install one of 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.340
 each time 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.140
 finally we will install the romi 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.140
 install the audio recorder let's 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.040

 when the appliance is switched off 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.180
 animation loading 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.920

 turn 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.160
 4 out of 8 but if it is recovery it does not support 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.250
 is there everything once to install one by 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.250
 one 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.680
 remembering that you only need to have 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.280
 a device with a cult and cost 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.280

 the device will turn on and optimize the 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.519
 installed applications 12 of 17 more 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.130

 functional and a lot of fighting he is focusing on 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:53.440
 anyway optimizing the application lacks only 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:56.250

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.350
 is very similar exactly by the 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.840
 navigation bar and the icons that 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.150

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:05.480
 now here we will put the bar 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:09.900
 not the battery icon lying down 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:14.150
