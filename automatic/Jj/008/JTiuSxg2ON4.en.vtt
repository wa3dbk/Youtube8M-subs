 this delicious oatmeal you know that the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.610
 Good porridge is already famous because 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.400
 lowers bad cholesterol levels 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.740
 in the blood so it's great for 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.930
 the brain stimulates you 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.060
 the children will be very attentive 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.310
 to school if you serve him is rich 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.439
 oatmeal ingredients on screen write down the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:35.610
 very well you require two cups of 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.530
 oatmeal two cups of oatmeal two 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.690
 cups or four cups of milk 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.640
 depending on how special here 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.059
 that can double the amount of milk 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.610
 one if it's going to be a cup, put two and 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.239
 so let's put a teaspoon of 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.239
 vanilla extract 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.550
 we are going to put muscovado sugar to taste 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.079
 and fruit fruit in the season which 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.210
 you prefer fruits of the forest you 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.860
 they are wonderful then I am desquito 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.680
 a lot on facebook asking me how it 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.710
 makes the oats and I will gladly 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.710
 I explain to you that it is very easy 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.159
 it's not instant oatmeal are flakes of 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.159
 oatmeal real oatmeal not because it is 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.690
 snapshot is very very like the idea is 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.929
 processed is very finite is much more 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.330
 dim and it is not this oatmeal that so much 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.539
 does well then here we put by 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.509
 example two cups of oatmeal by four 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.610
 cups of milk takes a little oats 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.759
 a little bit I mean about 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.310
 ten minutes at medium heat you are going to 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.630
 be moving by moving it until 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.729
 oatmeal absorb 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.700
 all the milk and you see how it 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.890
 convert in this texture look here the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.500
 I have already ready the vein really 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.710
 delicious many people think that they do not 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.250
 like but look if you put the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.009
 ingredients I think suitable for 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.479
 sweeten the but not too much so that 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.429
 it does not become something that is not 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.710
 healthy if we put a lot of sugar 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.989
 then we are no longer doing good 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.050
 let's also put a teaspoon 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.060
 final vanilla extract the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.220
 vanilla and it gives a delicious flavor to the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.760
 oats until now as you see I have not 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.970
 put sugar nothing else this oatmeal with 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.610
 Milk if you get to thicken put more 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.220
 milk is depending on the consistency that 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.890
 you want me I like it that way a little 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.900
 which is really annoying dense suavecita the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.569
 let's spend a few more seconds 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.599
 while we're going to start a little 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.290
 banana that is full of potassium is very 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:46.049
 good has too much iron 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.689
 it says that fruits between faster 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.579
 they oxidize more iron they have is a good 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.909
 way to know which fruits have iron 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.920
 then the pear the apple the banana 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.140
 who sees that they rust as soon as it 's 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.510
 its high amount of iron then 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:06.030
 let's serve oatmeal is ready 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.310
 believe me that is delicious also 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.609
 you can put cinnamon instead of vanilla 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.670
 you can put a little ground cinnamon 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:17.990
 and it is very rich also then here 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.570
 we see how thick it is 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.730
 what we are going to do is put a little 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.250
 of sugar and muscovado sugar 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.900
 mascabado or the brown sugar until the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.690
 people who see us on the other side of the 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.570
 good border is very rich is much more 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.880
 healthy that white sugar is not so 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.820
 processed and nothing else with a little 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.110
 can achieve a lot then here you 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.910
 let's put strawberries 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.520
 raspberries that I was asked by the way 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.920
 on facebook that if the raspberry is washed 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.990
 does not wash the raspberry because it 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.900
 It usually breaks down as it is a 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.930
 So delicate fruit is already clean 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:02.840
 that do not have to wave the garlic the mound 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:07.990
 of oatmeal entrusts oatmeal to children 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.990
 it's more I keep asking my mom how 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:25.060
 the apprentice then pretty much started me 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.060
