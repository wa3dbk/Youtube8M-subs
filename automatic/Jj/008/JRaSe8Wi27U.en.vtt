00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.150
 hi girls as they are today we are going to knit 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:10.850
 this openwork point very easy to perform 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.320
 this is the right side of the fabric the 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:18.850
 reverse side 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.850
 here I have five reasons 1 2 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.380
 455 motives across and a few 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.990
 motives on high 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.789
 the graph along with the explanation of 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.070
 the symbols I will leave posted on my 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.470
 blog link which you will find under this 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.990
 video 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.190
 this is demagogic 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:42.340
 As you can see, it's very simple in the graph 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.730
 are indicated 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.590
 the odd turns in the laps for 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.860
 this-we have how we are presented 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.810
 knitted stitches we weave with the knit 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.840
 add 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.510
 we started knitting the first round 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.610
 aha here are also not indicated two 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.430
 edge points have to add two 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.670
 points we begin to weave the first 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.400
 back we knit the edge point after 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.520
 two points upside down 2 points to the right 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.390
 Loop next to the right decrease 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.010
 simple and we repeat to weave 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.170
 from here 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.840
 and we weave as many times as 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.560
 necessary in my case to repeat this reason 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.540
 five times and we finish the round with 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.100
 these balance points so that of 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.610
 the two sides are the same tissue 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.940
 the return of number 3 the same 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.090
 we weave until here we repeat the 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.250
 reason as many times as necessary 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.790
 and finish the round with these points of 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.700
 Balance 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.740
 in the even turns we weave as we already 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.750
 I said how the points are presented 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:00.000
 Now let's weave two reasons 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.080
 for this we have to mount 18 points 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.160
 7 points 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.610
 + 7 2 and more two together from the edge 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.930
 good 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.170
 I have 18 mounted points 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.750
 and we're going to start knitting around 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.570
 number 1 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.560
 first point of the edge we passed without 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.239
 to knit 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.239
 two points add 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.519
 two points to the right 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.960
 nothing 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.020
 next to the right 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.050
 simple decrease for this we spent a 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.570
 knit without knitting 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.740
 the next point we weave it with the 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.740
 point of the right 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.969
 we introduce the left needle here by 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.969
 the second point 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.790
 and the point that we knit passes inside 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.080
 the point that is on the left needle 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.750
 we let go 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.450
 and again the motive is repeated here 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.210
 we knit a motive now let's weave 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.210
 another one again two points upside down 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.130
 two points to the right 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.340
 next to the right 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.090
 decreased simple we passed a point without 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.220
 to knit 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.770
 a point we weave with the point of 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.350
 straight 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.850
 and we slip this point that we do not weave 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.850
 over the knitting 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.690
 and now if at the end of lap two 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.300
 upside down points 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.490
 we always leave the edge 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.550
 reverse 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.460
 lap number 2 and all laps 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.920
 weave pairs how we present the 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.770
 points the first point we had without 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.140
 to knit 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.240
 in the difference this is the point at 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.430
 right and this is the point to greg is that 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.200
 have one then the point is at 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.200
 right we weave it to the right 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.690
 and the point that is presented to us in reverse 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.690
 We protect with the wrong point 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.979
 upside down 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.020
 you must 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.020
 check 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.890
 you must 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.890
 the Arabs 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.810
 of right 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:55.400
 right and last edge point to 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:58.310
 reverse row number 3 we give back we give 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.650
 return to the fabric first point we had 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.270
 without knitting 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.270
 two points upside down 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:15.860
 two points together to the right we take two 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:19.790
 points we have points to the right 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:23.289
 right next to the loop 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:26.350
 two points to the right 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.970
 and the motive is repeated 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.970
 two points upside down 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.690
 two points together to the right 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.600
 next to the right 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.200
 two points to the right 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.450
 and at the end of the round two points to the 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.900
 setback that are balance points 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.730
 together from the edge upside down the turn 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.940
 number four we weave how we are 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.790
 present the points 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.500
 and the number 5 spin we knit just like 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.490
 turn number 1 is the reason 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:08.400
 repeat that was all I hope you like 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.590
 that reason if they are not yet subscribed 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.560
 to my channel subscribe not to lose 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:18.470
 new ideas I wish you the best that 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.470
 have a nice day and see you chao
