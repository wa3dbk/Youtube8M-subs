00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.980
 musical applications this is one of 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.660
 great forces of nokia you know if 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.060
 you already presented we have nokia 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.860
 music especially that's really part 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.050
 forces with also applications 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.370
 photography here is exactly so if I 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.590
 come back to the camera 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.820
 the camera is a 5 megapixel camera and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.660
 we find in the back you see it 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.400
 there is no flash led 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.290
 we are promised 2.7 the beautiful photo 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.729
 despite everything with this photo sensor and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.410
 quite rightly yet on the occasion of 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.170
 his test when we have precisely 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.910
 got the phone in test then the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.190
 phone for other spect skis has 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.570
 so he has this famous camera 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.770
 he has a polycarbonate gift 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.110
 so he has a screen that is a screen 4 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.490
 super sensuous inches so super 1,600 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.080
 I mean, what does that mean? 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.910
 that can be used with a glove it's 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.100
 the great brand also at 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.270
 noka then it's a super 4 inch screen 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.950
 111 it if i ps with a wsvga resolution 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.390
 that's next to that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.090
 of course you are struggling 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.640
 we have the famous gps needed 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.820
 precisely for the functions 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.790
 it's a drive we obviously have 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.870
 so we have a battery that's it 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.490
 another spec is given a little while while 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.470
 bulk but just before the test will arrive 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.179
 in a while some time very 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.830
 quickly i hope we also have a 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.170
 battery of which and a 1430 milliamperes 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.660
 so a processor that is a double 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.130
 heart 1 gigahertz to eat them not 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.080
