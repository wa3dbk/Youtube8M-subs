00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.849
 What am I reading in the month of April 2014?

 right 62 ending the final line of the 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.550
 andre the ranking of that book 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.169
 memories of him and also about the art of 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.849
 writing or anything else 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.170
 I'm good at the very end I think 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.719
 today, female 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.190
 should have 30 pages to read and soon 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.539
 but I'll make a video about this book 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.550
 which I'm finding inefficient 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.460
 national very good people 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.980
 I am also the the legend of the temptation 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.320
 impossible to take vargas llosa which is a 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.130
 book he wrote about the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.050
 victor's miserable on goal and I 'm 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.239
 still at the beginning of this lime book 50 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.399
 pages more or less as soon as you finish 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.720
 reading this book I make a video 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.780
 so we can talk about the amazing 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 sensational the miserable and at last I go 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.850
 comment on this book is also there 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.070
 was that my project of a tale 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.960
 per day and the first story book that 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.670
 I picked it up at the beginning of the year. 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.760
 here the file barreto is what are the tales 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.620
 complete with this super cool edition 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.220
 and what happens 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.250
 I read a point until the end of March. 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.940
 per day and I'm on page 440 of this 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.979
 book this book has over 700 pages 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.100
 So you see, they 're still reading a 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.540
 tale could this book here for whatever 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.030
 June determines then I resolved to abort 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.409
 one against the day with barreto file I go 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.390
 put this book and for reading and 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.340
 and I'll pick up other books 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.799
 account and to Helleno per day because the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.680
 my original idea was to separate 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.570
 tales right I could use the month of 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.909
 October is a mystery tales of a robot 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.299
 things like this one do not 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.460
 there is a lot to see and we agree 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.920
 tales are super short and have about 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.450
 of 100 there two pages a few stories are 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.659
 Larger lines, right? 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.099
 but most have two-page type 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.349
 then it was not working to make a 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.379
 I tell a story a day with this one I'm going to put 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.390
 for reading then this month and I'll get 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.870
 some other collection of books 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.760
 mystery in the team 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.980
 of mystery tales for him reminds and 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.159
 separating through the ruhr 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.500
 for now will see is in the last video 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.330
 channel in the closing video of the month 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.830

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.569

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.560
 curse of the titan 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.060
 I really liked the third book I 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.239
 I liked the third one more than the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.760
 previous right but anyway am not yet 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.340

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.280
 of this month 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.440
 then in April I also want 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.359

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.909
 you in the last book I do not remember 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.609
 very well of the first two books of 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.859
 bne day 11 the first book when i read 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:23.760
 I was in school I still had to 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:25.410
 16 and 17 years the jazz in August the second 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.190
 book had already begun to work on 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.470
 your dvd so 19 or 20 years but anyway 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.209
 I do not remember the books very well and 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.690
 my memory of this story that is 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.799
 medium mixed with the memory of the 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.810
 movies, right? 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.200
 and movies are different from books 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.690
 so I'll reread by de jong this month he 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.370
 then finish the technology by reading then 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.129
 the third and last volume that is crazy 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.510
 by the boy was released last year and 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.579
 such 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.069
 who lent this book went to joão 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.269
 kisses and thinks to leave the link below 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.129
 to her blog that is the lipstick of 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.269
 clarice a very cool blog who does not 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.040
 knows 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:09.000
 know it is so this is it and so people 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.040
 fill in jones are booklet this clip 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.530
 So I say little books is not for everyone. 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.090
 - need not at last are books that 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.500
 he's good like this 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.510
 but they are very fast reading books 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.310
 so I know the time I get these 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.530
 books here to read this one he has 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.880
 about 300 pages that in two days I 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.699
 I can read that it's already a little bigger 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.229
 wine has more than 400 pages and that 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.780
 take a little longer to read 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.110
 mastic beach volley super fast that 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.060
 we could be goodbye 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.980
 People either do not know or even 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.890
 now this my current phase I will find 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.600
 It was a fun time for another writer. 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.610
 chick lit that I also liked in this 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.740
 The time that I went to reread afterwards, I found it bad. 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.800
 It's but I know a lot of people who like it. 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.320
 people kiss you nothing against who like 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.240
 of mercantis but did not want to survive 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.580
 to re-read even with a little fear of 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.100
 relief from where you do not like 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.330
 I do not think we'll see there we 'll see if 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.250
 Even then I go back to make a video. 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.600
 about videogames 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.070
 So these are the books that are in 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.410
 March in the month of April 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.420
 I'll find a way to fit another one. 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.150
 free in the middle is to be know each other 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.380
 Finally, let's go to the five options of 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.380
 You choose from the month of April. 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.820

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.950
 Here, for you, you can vote. 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.620
 By the number you can vote for the name 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.090
 the book or the author's name right I 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.980
 I'll leave the book titles and the 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.930

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.000

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.010
