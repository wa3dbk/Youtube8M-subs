00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.820 
meter line of Canada just picking and
going<00:02:12.970> looks<00:02:13.599> like<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> try<00:02:14.140> there<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.709> the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
going looks like a try there to the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.259

Georgians<00:02:16.080> 23<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.200> 7<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:17.860> ends<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:19.060> half

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269
