so I guess their land series are the new
gaming<00:00:27.800> laptop<00:00:28.220> so<00:00:28.369> I<00:00:28.430> guess<00:00:28.610> or<00:00:28.789> are<00:00:29.240> there

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419

yes Ellen is after the series for you
and<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.550> can<00:00:34.760> be<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.090> powerful<00:00:35.600> laptops<00:00:37.989> is

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
and it can be the powerful laptops is

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.630 
and it can be the powerful laptops is
the<00:00:39.350> most<00:00:39.530> powerful<00:00:40.129> one<00:00:40.370> is<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:40.760> LD<00:00:41.300> 7pw

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
the most powerful one is the LD 7pw

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.479 
the most powerful one is the LD 7pw
privately<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:44.239> comes<00:00:44.540> with<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:44.960> core<00:00:45.170> i7

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
privately it comes with a core i7

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.850 
privately it comes with a core i7
transferring<00:00:46.519> right<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.450> highest<00:00:47.860> i7

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
transferring right so the highest i7

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.990 
transferring right so the highest i7
processor<00:00:49.280> I<00:00:49.309> guess<00:00:50.860> has<00:00:51.860> a<00:00:51.890> flat<00:00:52.250> part

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
processor I guess has a flat part

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.900 
processor I guess has a flat part
and<00:00:55.000> it<00:00:55.150> also<00:00:55.330> has<00:00:55.690> 8<00:00:56.590> gigabytes<00:00:57.160> of<00:00:57.610> RAM

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
and it also has 8 gigabytes of RAM

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.180 
and it also has 8 gigabytes of RAM
mm-hmm<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:58.480> one<00:00:58.720> terabyte<00:00:59.200> of<00:00:59.260> hard<00:00:59.500> drive

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
mm-hmm and one terabyte of hard drive

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.860 
mm-hmm and one terabyte of hard drive
all<00:01:00.460> right<00:01:00.670> so<00:01:00.820> one<00:01:00.970> terabyte<00:01:01.300> hard<00:01:01.480> drive<00:01:01.690> one

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
all right so one terabyte hard drive one

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.600 
all right so one terabyte hard drive one
8<00:01:02.080> gigabytes<00:01:02.620> of<00:01:02.740> RAM<00:01:02.920> that's<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.190> lot<00:01:03.310> of<00:01:03.430> RAM

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
8 gigabytes of RAM that's a lot of RAM

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.330 
8 gigabytes of RAM that's a lot of RAM
what<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.690> screen<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.530> screen<00:01:05.590> is<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.160> big

let's move on to the other one here the
smallest<00:02:09.490> one<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.729> think<00:02:10.000> yes<00:02:10.330> this<00:02:10.600> one<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:11.050> a

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
smallest one I think yes this one is a

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.199 
smallest one I think yes this one is a
very<00:02:11.200> interesting<00:02:11.709> product<00:02:12.160> because<00:02:12.580> despite

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
very interesting product because despite

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.920 
very interesting product because despite
a<00:02:13.360> big<00:02:13.630> small<00:02:14.110> fire<00:02:14.380> after<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.100> 11.6<00:02:16.060> screen

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
a big small fire after the 11.6 screen

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.610 
a big small fire after the 11.6 screen
which<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.650> based<00:02:17.890> on<00:02:18.040> HD<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:19.480> comes<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.500> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
which is based on HD it comes to the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.020 
which is based on HD it comes to the
core<00:02:20.830> i5<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.640> smaller<00:02:21.970> than<00:02:22.510> 8<00:02:22.690> gigabytes<00:02:24.030> so

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
core i5 as a smaller than 8 gigabytes so
