00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.640
 fell over 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900
 see you people do not expect before 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.700

 the news from the next waffle that 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.980
 is viewed a lot but I am one 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.810
 bit against it 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.190
 i mean what's next somebody that 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.500
 the player travel viewed up to 1000 times 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.340
 becomes a million times a billion times and 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.870
 rowed 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.180

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.750
 what i it is then the for i am mean 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.860
 here suddenly so many people own talent 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.390
 things can fall over 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.920
 in other words I want to be a pity 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.510
 that that has become a viral video 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.550
 I had beautiful moze I was also the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.690
 last new hjoed did not want big ones 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.760
 target basics 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.920
 when I come across you put someone like that 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.930
 actually just shows how to make a the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.640
 matter lama how you pull things through 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.290
 Upbringing should do but the run out 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.980
 way tackles and he throws in the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.510
 screen 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.269
 if you get to know them through your house 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.200
 shit about underneath his one has to do 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.819
 and I have to say it's pretty well 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.170
 funny again something like that where you 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.430
 not really one and I invite 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.829
 mean everyone who can lard and 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.239
 to throw ipads over pedophiles 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.650
 almost serious then i would make this one 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.510
 that have people everywhere about it 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.130
 in europe the people video baby blame 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.299
 reason for faults of the people I will 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.860
 mean you go my way someone 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.720
 the attack against itself is quite good 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.280
 in sofia no that man there that man there 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.080
 yes that may be at feyenoord that 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.520
 Shooting 50 men doesn't matter because 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.900
 also one often has to give year 5 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.190
 no longer selling in mechanical nobody 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.479
 dead along the hockey stick may 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.160
 no more books can be played but 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.930
 what is different just like hey man i ours 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.010
 exactly the same video 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.630
 find you blaming a lot 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.250
 people to the last party would be very your 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.900
 had video miss or realistic throw 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.520
 ultrasound to reality is coming off the tree 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.630
 and one of them come true and then 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.400
 I would understand or not so much 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.419
 cruelty with me just that was yes 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.530
 that people like that are those people 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.849
 man may not have died 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.919
 more differences between realistic ai 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.729
 the realistic demands of reality and it 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.770
 fitness 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.479
 oh man this is really the spelling this 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.620
 files with cup mario from the scope it 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.300
 can now be a little clearer dragon 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.610
 I think video games have on teachers 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.930
 and of course about the 5 why videos 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.970
