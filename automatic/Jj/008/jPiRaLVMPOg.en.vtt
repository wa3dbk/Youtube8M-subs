00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
so it can't rock me so then I decide to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.109 
so it can't rock me so then I decide to
predict<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.650> switch<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.070> he<00:01:31.160> goes<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.369> bureau

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
predict the switch and he goes to bureau

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.890 
predict the switch and he goes to bureau
for<00:01:32.570> MU<00:01:32.780> garros<00:01:33.650> which<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:34.430> pro<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.150> he<00:01:35.720> misses

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
for MU garros which is pro and he misses

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.410 
for MU garros which is pro and he misses
his<00:01:36.110> aqua<00:01:36.440> tail<00:01:36.590> which<00:01:36.860> is<00:01:37.040> love<00:01:37.340> for<00:01:37.580> me<00:01:37.700> and

I'm<00:01:53.000> like<00:01:53.149> this<00:01:53.420> has<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.750> be<00:01:53.840> banded<00:01:54.289> if<00:01:54.410> it's

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
I'm like this has to be banded if it's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.969 
I'm like this has to be banded if it's
not<00:01:54.680> banded<00:01:55.130> then<00:01:55.340> my<00:01:55.640> mom<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.600> man<00:01:57.500> anyway
