00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:14.190
 devil is real 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:20.750
 I built his cages unusual 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.750
 readings rows not keep 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.210
 It's been over eight years now 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.640
 that doom 3 graphic enthusiastic player 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.529
 let into ecstasy but left so 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.140
 you feel really old only when you are 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.420
 Consider that the original already with it 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.730
 his twentieth birthday is celebrating for 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.739
 it software a reason to celebrate and a 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.149
 Thick job package to lace this for 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.309
 German youth protection authorities 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.090
 some years still absolutely unthinkable 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.280
 would have been 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.629
 Now the bundle is the only one 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.160
 indexing it now also in germany 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.170
 completely uncut appeared 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.300
 at least if you want the wolfenstein 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.340
 bonus level once ignored the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:08.900
 but for all international versions 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:11.400
 have been defused yet without 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.049
 swastikas and Nazi soldiers leaves that 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.840
 total package little wishes open 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.880
 the bfg edition offers besides a mustard 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.890
 modernized version of the 3 also 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.900
 the two predecessors stupid 1 and 2 as well 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.350
 the research on her extension for 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.390
 The 3 that appeared in 2005 is extra 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.799
 bonus there are then the lost levels 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.570
 but also exactly this impression 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.000
 they look more like 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.470
 Unearthed level corpses on these 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.180
 they are already right 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.600
 extensive playing time even further 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.600
 stretch 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.729
 for the bfg package, doom 3 became graphical 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.649
 a little more polished and is with it 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.079
 even today it's quite a respectable one 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.500
 game with support for rtp resolution 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.909
 and extremely stable 60 frames being the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.950
 players mostly of darkness anyway 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.899
 is surrounded and can not see much 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.399
 there is already an advantage that the 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.090
 Flashlight now always available 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.609
 stands 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.229
 in the original one had to still between the 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.509
 choose funzel and his shooting spear 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.579
 but not as often suspected 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.200
 but had atmospheric reasons 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.000
 developer john carmack so that 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.430
 calculating light sources facilitated 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.560
 Now, the dark corridors, however, can 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.599
 always be lit what the game 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.599
 then do something less scary 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.159
 be spoiled and modern player 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.859
 but he too the actual gameplay 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.319
 to find scary because three works 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.450
 in places very stale room for 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.459
 room is especially concerned with it 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.859
 meet and monster after monster 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.269
 Do the fact that too 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.799
 pretty much every dark corner or 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.659
 locked door a monster out 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.030
 it jumps in the times of dead space 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.700
 no real warranty anymore 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.980
 the almost 20 to 25 hours playing time 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.069
 for doom 3 including the addons is 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.319
 therefore above all one very monotonous only 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.120
 the action section on the ebay package will be launched 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.769
 by introducing new weapon like the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.750
 gravity gun and some right 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.159
 crazy high level for a short time 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.230
 once really exciting 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.239
 another shortcoming for fans of 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.010
 original language is the fact that 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.079
 the german and at version of the game 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.359
 only offer German voice output 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.359
 The picture must go online again immediately 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.150
 the bfg edition is a successful and 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.129
 priced fairly calculated bundle for 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.569
 the fans or players the one piece 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.060
 want to catch up on game history 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.919
 however, it should be noted 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.959
 that the actual gameplay far out 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.239
 aged worse than the graphics 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.639
 because the simple rumgeballer appeared 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.190
 already in 2004 like a simple reissue 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.859
 from doom 2 in chic high-tech optics 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.159
 and looks hopeless in 2012 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:06.379
 old fashioned for the full enjoyment of the bfg 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.540
 edition is therefore a nostalgic one 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.280
 transfiguration glasses urgently needed the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.120
 but unfortunately the sales box is not 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:20.100
 included 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:25.080
 the role is taken we became tables 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:29.690
 because my children have conspired me it 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.690
 is expected
