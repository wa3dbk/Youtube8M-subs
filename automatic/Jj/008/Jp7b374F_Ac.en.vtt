00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
really limited run I thought I knew a

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.460 
really limited run I thought I knew a
little<00:04:11.150> bit<00:04:11.270> about<00:04:11.390> it<00:04:12.250> by<00:04:13.250> saying<00:04:13.550> that

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
little bit about it by saying that

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.979 
little bit about it by saying that
originally<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.500> thought<00:04:15.830> these<00:04:15.980> were<00:04:16.190> released

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
originally I thought these were released

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.530 
originally I thought these were released
out<00:04:17.989> of<00:04:18.049> Japan<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:18.950> sold<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:19.940> European

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
out of Japan and sold to the European

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.230 
out of Japan and sold to the European
market<00:04:20.960> is<00:04:20.989> what<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.229> thought<00:04:21.700> because<00:04:22.700> my<00:04:22.729> red

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
market is what I thought because my red

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.010 
market is what I thought because my red

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
series that one is a Japanese console

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.540 
series that one is a Japanese console
but<00:04:33.620> this<00:04:34.129> one<00:04:34.430> actually<00:04:34.849> plays<00:04:35.509> us<00:04:35.900> games<00:04:36.550> so

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
but this one actually plays us games so

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.760 
but this one actually plays us games so
and<00:04:38.180> an<00:04:38.479> according<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.900> this<00:04:38.990> guy's<00:04:39.229> story<00:04:39.530> he

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
the Sony store in New York I think is

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.379 
the Sony store in New York I think is
what<00:04:44.150> he<00:04:44.240> said<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:45.860> I'm<00:04:46.400> not<00:04:46.610> I'm<00:04:46.849> not<00:04:46.909> too<00:04:47.180> sure

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
what he said so I'm not I'm not too sure

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.570 
what he said so I'm not I'm not too sure
that's<00:04:47.629> that<00:04:47.930> honestly<00:04:48.470> I<00:04:48.560> thought<00:04:49.039> I<00:04:49.099> knew<00:04:49.340> a

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
that's that honestly I thought I knew a

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.430 
that's that honestly I thought I knew a
little<00:04:50.210> bit<00:04:50.449> more<00:04:50.629> about<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.960> series<00:04:51.139> but<00:04:51.409> I

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
little bit more about the series but I

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.320 
little bit more about the series but I
guess<00:04:51.800> I<00:04:51.919> apparently<00:04:52.099> don't<00:04:52.400> so<00:04:53.000> if<00:04:53.090> any<00:04:53.240> of

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.850 
of them I think my ocean blue is
actually<00:07:17.900> in<00:07:17.990> pretty<00:07:18.169> good<00:07:18.259> shape<00:07:19.330> but<00:07:20.330> uh

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
actually in pretty good shape but uh

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.019 
actually in pretty good shape but uh
this<00:07:21.860> is<00:07:22.039> probably<00:07:22.279> the<00:07:22.370> nicest<00:07:22.490> one<00:07:22.789> I<00:07:22.819> got

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:23.029 
this is probably the nicest one I got

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:24.459 
this is probably the nicest one I got
now<00:07:23.150> so<00:07:23.270> I<00:07:23.330> might<00:07:23.509> end<00:07:23.569> up<00:07:23.750> getting<00:07:24.020> rid<00:07:24.289> of<00:07:24.319> one

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:24.469 
now so I might end up getting rid of one

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:26.230 
now so I might end up getting rid of one
of<00:07:24.529> the<00:07:24.620> other<00:07:24.800> ones<00:07:24.949> it's<00:07:25.400> not<00:07:25.550> in<00:07:25.969> the<00:07:26.060> best

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 
of the other ones it's not in the best

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.439
