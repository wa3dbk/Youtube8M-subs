fantastic<00:00:05.910> it<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.089> but<00:00:06.330> so<00:00:06.540> many<00:00:06.629> people<00:00:07.080> don't

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
fantastic it is but so many people don't

own<00:00:07.830> one<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.309> kind<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.940> didn't<00:00:09.360> even<00:00:09.450> consider

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
own one and kind of didn't even consider

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.200 
own one and kind of didn't even consider
it<00:00:10.080> as<00:00:10.260> an<00:00:10.380> option<00:00:10.800> it's<00:00:11.340> got<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> full<00:00:11.730> aps-c

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210

and<00:00:15.509> it's<00:00:16.470> incredibly<00:00:17.070> well<00:00:17.310> featured<00:00:17.820> but<00:00:18.090> to

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
and it's incredibly well featured but to

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.820 
and it's incredibly well featured but to
be<00:00:18.539> honest<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.960> think<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.260> reason<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.619> didn't

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
be honest I think the reason it didn't

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.070 
be honest I think the reason it didn't
go<00:00:19.949> down<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.340> well<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.390> design<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.990> is

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
go down that well is the design of it is

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.900 
go down that well is the design of it is
just<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.680> functional<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.460> got<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> real

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
just so functional it's got a real

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
German efficiency air to it I'm not sure

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.480 
German efficiency air to it I'm not sure
why<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:28.140> wasn't<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.680> huge<00:00:28.949> hit

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
why this one wasn't a huge hit

rechargeable battery however the seven

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.710 
rechargeable battery however the seven
actually<00:03:13.040> has<00:03:13.580> significantly<00:03:14.450> better

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
actually has significantly better

shots<00:03:16.730> compared<00:03:17.240> to<00:03:17.390> 360<00:03:18.110> now<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:19.250> might

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
shots compared to 360 now you might

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.650 
shots compared to 360 now you might
think<00:03:19.460> the<00:03:19.790> seven<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.120> going<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.300> be<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.450> lot

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
think the seven is going to be a lot

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.940 
think the seven is going to be a lot
bigger<00:03:20.870> but<00:03:21.110> it's<00:03:21.290> actually<00:03:21.680> slightly

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
bigger but it's actually slightly

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.430 
bigger but it's actually slightly
thinner<00:03:22.490> but<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.270> is<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.450> little<00:03:23.930> bit<00:03:24.080> heavier

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
thinner but it is a little bit heavier

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.830 
thinner but it is a little bit heavier
but<00:03:24.680> not<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.220> much<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.640> you'd<00:03:25.790> notice<00:03:26.030> really

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
but not so much that you'd notice really

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.660 
but not so much that you'd notice really
made<00:03:27.020> an<00:03:27.170> effort<00:03:27.320> on<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.770> six<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.190> cut<00:03:28.460> down

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
made an effort on the six to cut down

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.120 
made an effort on the six to cut down
weight<00:03:29.030> even<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.780> battery<00:03:30.230> compartment<00:03:30.800> is

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
weight even the battery compartment is

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.550 
weight even the battery compartment is
all<00:03:31.280> cut<00:03:31.610> out<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:32.060> save<00:03:32.300> metal<00:03:32.810> which<00:03:33.230> is<00:03:33.260> where

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
all cut out to save metal which is where

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.550 
all cut out to save metal which is where
I<00:03:33.590> think<00:03:33.710> that<00:03:34.070> weight<00:03:34.280> savings<00:03:34.790> comes<00:03:35.090> in

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
I think that weight savings comes in

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.900 
I think that weight savings comes in
taking<00:03:36.560> a<00:03:36.590> look<00:03:36.740> at<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:36.920> finish<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.400> them<00:03:37.640> it's

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
taking a look at the finish of them it's

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.420 
taking a look at the finish of them it's
really<00:03:38.360> nice<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:39.160> definitely<00:03:40.160> definitely

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
really nice I definitely definitely

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.520 
really nice I definitely definitely
prefer<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.150> six<00:03:41.570> though<00:03:41.780> in<00:03:41.960> my<00:03:42.110> personal

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
prefer the six though in my personal

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.570 
prefer the six though in my personal
opinion<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:44.000> seven<00:03:44.390> has<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.780> bit<00:03:45.320> of<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.580> unusual

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580

blacks and on that shot you can see that

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.400 
blacks and on that shot you can see that
there's<00:05:28.190> just<00:05:28.280> more<00:05:28.760> detail<00:05:29.390> held<00:05:29.750> especially

in the black areas on the NEX six but

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.830 
in the black areas on the NEX six but
overall<00:05:34.550> I'm<00:05:34.850> fairly<00:05:35.240> impressed<00:05:35.570> with<00:05:35.720> those

overall I'm fairly impressed with those
results<00:05:36.380> especially<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:37.220> six<00:05:37.520> let's<00:05:37.850> take

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
results especially the six let's take

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.630 
results especially the six let's take
another<00:05:38.120> shot<00:05:38.540> that's<00:05:38.780> at<00:05:38.960> ISO<00:05:39.320> 3200<00:05:39.920> that's<00:05:40.490> a

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
another shot that's at ISO 3200 that's a

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.970 
another shot that's at ISO 3200 that's a
full<00:05:40.850> crop<00:05:41.180> and<00:05:41.510> Orick<00:05:42.440> and<00:05:42.620> that's<00:05:42.770> looking

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
full crop and Orick and that's looking

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.490 
full crop and Orick and that's looking
pretty<00:05:43.040> tidy<00:05:43.700> now<00:05:44.570> I<00:05:44.600> really<00:05:45.020> think<00:05:45.260> that<00:05:45.410> the

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
pretty tidy now I really think that the

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.470 
pretty tidy now I really think that the
six<00:05:45.770> is<00:05:45.920> going<00:05:46.100> to<00:05:46.160> be<00:05:46.280> a<00:05:46.310> hit<00:05:46.610> because<00:05:47.090> it<00:05:47.270> is

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
six is going to be a hit because it is

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.870 
six is going to be a hit because it is
just<00:05:47.780> that<00:05:47.930> much<00:05:48.170> more<00:05:48.230> familiar<00:05:48.920> in<00:05:49.400> terms<00:05:49.430> of

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
just that much more familiar in terms of

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.180 
just that much more familiar in terms of
layout<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:50.450> the<00:05:50.900> finish<00:05:51.290> on<00:05:51.560> the<00:05:51.710> paint<00:05:51.980> as

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
layout and the finish on the paint as

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.160 
layout and the finish on the paint as
weird<00:05:52.460> as<00:05:52.580> that<00:05:52.760> is<00:05:52.910> I<00:05:52.940> think<00:05:53.390> will<00:05:53.570> be<00:05:53.720> a<00:05:53.750> bit

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
weird as that is I think will be a bit

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.810 
weird as that is I think will be a bit
of<00:05:54.200> a<00:05:54.350> difference<00:05:54.740> in<00:05:54.860> terms<00:05:54.920> of<00:05:55.250> how<00:05:55.400> well<00:05:55.640> it

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
of a difference in terms of how well it

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.000 
of a difference in terms of how well it
sells<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.360> seven<00:05:57.080> is<00:05:57.200> incredibly<00:05:57.830> well

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
have been added into the six and I think

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.460 
have been added into the six and I think
it's<00:06:14.060> kind<00:06:14.300> of<00:06:14.330> a<00:06:14.420> sweet<00:06:14.750> spot<00:06:15.050> at<00:06:15.290> that

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
resolution of the NEX seven if I was

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.770 
resolution of the NEX seven if I was
going<00:06:19.730> to<00:06:19.760> get<00:06:19.940> one<00:06:20.060> of<00:06:20.150> these<00:06:20.270> I<00:06:20.510> would

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
going to get one of these I would

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.720 
going to get one of these I would
personally<00:06:21.170> go<00:06:21.470> for<00:06:21.830> the<00:06:21.920> six<00:06:22.130> no<00:06:22.310> questions

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
personally go for the six no questions

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.090 
personally go for the six no questions
asked<00:06:23.030> it's<00:06:23.180> that<00:06:23.330> much<00:06:23.540> newer<00:06:23.870> at<00:06:24.170> the<00:06:24.680> focus

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
asked it's that much newer at the focus

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.670 
asked it's that much newer at the focus
is<00:06:25.250> that<00:06:25.400> much<00:06:25.580> faster<00:06:25.910> and<00:06:26.360> ISO<00:06:27.140> performance

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
is that much faster and ISO performance

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.430 
is that much faster and ISO performance
is<00:06:28.010> significantly<00:06:29.000> better<00:06:29.270> so<00:06:29.870> personally

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
is significantly better so personally

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.140 
is significantly better so personally
the<00:06:30.770> six<00:06:31.010> is<00:06:31.190> the<00:06:31.220> king<00:06:31.520> of<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:31.730> hill<00:06:31.910> from

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
the seven though still so underrated as

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.690 
the seven though still so underrated as
a<00:06:37.330> compact<00:06:38.330> mirrorless<00:06:38.810> camera<00:06:39.700> it's

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
a compact mirrorless camera it's

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.970 
a compact mirrorless camera it's
feature-packed<00:06:41.120> I<00:06:41.600> sound<00:06:42.080> like<00:06:42.110> an<00:06:42.320> ad<00:06:42.500> it's

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
feature-packed I sound like an ad it's

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.790 
feature-packed I sound like an ad it's
um<00:06:43.280> if<00:06:43.580> it<00:06:44.120> just<00:06:44.240> wasn't<00:06:44.600> so<00:06:44.750> bloody<00:06:45.140> dry<00:06:45.560> and

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
um if it just wasn't so bloody dry and

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.400 
um if it just wasn't so bloody dry and
sanitary<00:06:46.340> looking<00:06:46.790> I<00:06:46.880> reckon<00:06:47.540> it<00:06:47.720> would<00:06:47.960> have

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
sanitary looking I reckon it would have

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.540 
sanitary looking I reckon it would have
sold<00:06:48.710> like<00:06:48.920> hotcakes

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550
