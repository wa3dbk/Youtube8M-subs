00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
caps right here that looks like that's

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.200 
caps right here that looks like that's
going<00:06:06.110> to<00:06:06.199> be<00:06:06.349> kind<00:06:06.529> of<00:06:06.620> a<00:06:06.770> beating<00:06:07.490> to<00:06:07.669> do<00:06:07.819> but

anyways let's see how it goes and then
hopefully<00:06:11.599> we'll<00:06:11.629> have<00:06:11.870> the<00:06:12.199> the<00:06:12.680> new<00:06:12.800> shock

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
hopefully we'll have the the new shock

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.249 
hopefully we'll have the the new shock
tower<00:06:13.279> already<00:06:14.150> all<00:06:14.360> right<00:06:14.509> so<00:06:14.690> I<00:06:14.719> got<00:06:14.930> the<00:06:15.110> new

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259 
tower already all right so I got the new

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.249 
tower already all right so I got the new
Shakhtar<00:06:15.919> on<00:06:16.270> front<00:06:17.270> shock<00:06:17.509> tower<00:06:17.750> it<00:06:18.110> was

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.259 
Shakhtar on front shock tower it was

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.279 
Shakhtar on front shock tower it was
actually<00:06:18.919> pretty<00:06:19.159> easy<00:06:20.139> getting<00:06:21.139> those

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
actually pretty easy getting those

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.920 
actually pretty easy getting those
eclipse<00:06:21.710> on<00:06:21.949> I<00:06:22.190> was<00:06:22.400> worried<00:06:22.729> about<00:06:22.819> the<00:06:23.509> trick

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
eclipse on I was worried about the trick

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.820 
eclipse on I was worried about the trick
that<00:06:24.469> I<00:06:24.500> learned<00:06:24.650> is<00:06:26.409> essentially<00:06:27.409> just<00:06:27.620> hold

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
that I learned is essentially just hold

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.600 
that I learned is essentially just hold
the<00:06:27.949> buggy<00:06:28.159> up<00:06:28.490> and<00:06:29.500> get<00:06:30.500> an<00:06:30.589> area<00:06:30.949> where<00:06:31.190> i<00:06:31.219> can

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
the buggy up and get an area where i can

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.469 
the buggy up and get an area where i can
place<00:06:32.240> the<00:06:32.779> eclipse<00:06:33.409> flush<00:06:33.949> and<00:06:34.339> then<00:06:35.240> just

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
place the eclipse flush and then just

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.409 
place the eclipse flush and then just
pinch<00:06:35.750> them<00:06:35.990> on<00:06:36.169> so<00:06:36.879> hopefully<00:06:37.879> you<00:06:38.150> guys<00:06:38.240> were

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
pinch them on so hopefully you guys were

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.350 
pinch them on so hopefully you guys were
able<00:06:38.539> to<00:06:38.659> somewhat<00:06:39.080> see<00:06:39.319> that<00:06:39.500> but<00:06:40.180> we're<00:06:41.180> on

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
able to somewhat see that but we're on

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.019 
able to somewhat see that but we're on
and<00:06:41.779> they're<00:06:42.589> straight<00:06:42.979> and<00:06:43.610> everything

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:44.029 
and they're straight and everything

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:51.490 
and they're straight and everything
looks<00:06:44.240> good<00:06:44.569> so<00:06:48.190> that's<00:06:49.190> part<00:06:49.520> one<00:06:50.500> shock

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
looks good so that's part one shock

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.200 
looks good so that's part one shock
towers<00:06:51.889> essentially<00:06:52.400> the<00:06:52.520> screws<00:06:52.849> that<00:06:53.089> you

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
towers essentially the screws that you

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.670
