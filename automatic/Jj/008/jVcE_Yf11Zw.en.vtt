I'm<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.810> now<00:00:01.589> while<00:00:02.100> we're<00:00:02.310> at<00:00:02.429> it<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.610> want<00:00:02.820> to

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
I'm a now while we're at it I want to

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.309 
I'm a now while we're at it I want to
talk<00:00:03.629> briefly<00:00:03.959> about<00:00:04.879> some<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:06.000> the

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
talk briefly about some of the

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.009 
talk briefly about some of the
advantages<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:08.570> laminated<00:00:09.570> blades<00:00:12.019> these

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
advantages of laminated blades these

to the blades toughness additionally
even<00:01:38.939> though<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> core<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.170> blade<00:01:40.500> is

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
even though the core in this blade is

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100 
even though the core in this blade is
harder<00:01:41.130> than<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.790> soft<00:01:42.119> stainless<00:01:42.899> steel

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.389 
harder than this soft stainless steel
blade<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.750> claim<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:47.009> commonly

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
blade here I claim and it's commonly

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.069 
blade here I claim and it's commonly

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
believed that the laminated blades are

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.840 
believed that the laminated blades are
easier<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> sharpen<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> higher

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
easier to sharpen they have a higher

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.679 
easier to sharpen they have a higher
level<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.810> sharpen<00:01:52.320> ability<00:01:52.710> which<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
level of sharpen ability which is the

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.870 
level of sharpen ability which is the
prime<00:01:54.689> criteria<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.950> high<00:01:56.130> quality<00:01:56.189> cutlery

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
prime criteria for high quality cutlery

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.510 
prime criteria for high quality cutlery
and<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.200> even<00:01:58.409> though<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.890> steel

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and that is that even though the steel

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.050 
and that is that even though the steel
core<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.939> harder<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.920> step<00:02:01.920> four<00:02:02.369> when<00:02:03.030> you

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
core is harder in step four when you

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.440 
core is harder in step four when you
have<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.479> grind

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.150 

okay<00:02:07.200> when<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.470> have<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.650> grind<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.130> blade

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
okay when you have to grind the blade

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.390 
okay when you have to grind the blade
thin<00:02:08.819> again<00:02:09.240> so<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.110> it'll<00:02:10.289> eventually<00:02:10.890> cut

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
thin again so that it'll eventually cut

thin again so that it'll eventually cut
really<00:02:11.670> well<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.930> grind<00:02:13.110> up<00:02:13.260> blades

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
really well we have to grind up blades

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.080 
really well we have to grind up blades

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
thin again well in this case you're

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.750 
thin again well in this case you're
grinding<00:02:15.510> all<00:02:15.660> hardened<00:02:16.650> metal<00:02:17.099> even<00:02:17.280> though

grinding all hardened metal even though

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.940 
grinding all hardened metal even though
the<00:02:18.420> total<00:02:18.840> hardness<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.380> blade<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.770> less

the total hardness of the blade is less

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
laminated blade you have to grind all of

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.390 
laminated blade you have to grind all of
that<00:02:27.000> hardened<00:02:27.390> metal<00:02:27.569> away<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.400> hardened

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
that hardened metal away and hardened

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.860 
that hardened metal away and hardened
metal<00:02:29.550> takes<00:02:29.850> more<00:02:30.060> time<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.390> grind<00:02:30.540> away<00:02:30.690> than

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
metal takes more time to grind away than

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.490 
metal takes more time to grind away than
soft<00:02:31.140> metal<00:02:31.410> whereas<00:02:32.069> in<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.459> case<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
soft metal whereas in the case of a

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.380 
soft metal whereas in the case of a
laminated<00:02:34.500> blade<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.280> you're<00:02:35.760> grinding<00:02:36.209> that

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
laminated blade and you're grinding that

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.650 
laminated blade and you're grinding that
secondary<00:02:37.349> bevel<00:02:37.739> well<00:02:38.489> 80%<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.360> what<00:02:39.450> you're

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
secondary bevel well 80% of what you're

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.500 
secondary bevel well 80% of what you're
grinding<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.260> soft<00:02:40.680> metal<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.510> therefore

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
grinding is soft metal and therefore

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.199 
grinding is soft metal and therefore
that<00:02:42.930> whole<00:02:43.290> grinding<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.400> blade<00:02:44.640> thin

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
that whole grinding the blade thin

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.979 
that whole grinding the blade thin
procedure<00:02:45.750> proceeds<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:47.160> much<00:02:47.430> quicker

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
procedure proceeds that much quicker

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.220 
procedure proceeds that much quicker
that's<00:02:48.989> why<00:02:49.610> we<00:02:50.610> consider<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.720> laminated

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
that's why we consider the laminated

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.220 
that's why we consider the laminated
blades<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.489> superior<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:54.209> terms<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.660> sharp

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
blades to be superior in terms of sharp

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.769 
blades to be superior in terms of sharp
and<00:02:55.350> ability
