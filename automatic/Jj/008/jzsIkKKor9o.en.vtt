bistro i don't know about you guys but I
really<00:02:09.300> don't<00:02:09.450> think<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.720> eggs

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
really don't think of eggs

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
think of bistros I mean I think of

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.350 
think of bistros I mean I think of
sandwiches<00:02:13.709> or<00:02:14.220> neat

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
sandwiches or neat

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.350 
sandwiches or neat
maybe<00:02:15.810> soup<00:02:16.230> but<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.010> don't<00:02:17.189> think<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.579> eggs<00:02:17.909> so

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
maybe soup but I don't think of eggs so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.380 
maybe soup but I don't think of eggs so
to<00:02:19.019> me<00:02:19.439> that<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.829> an<00:02:19.950> obvious<00:02:20.189> clue<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.060> the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
to me that is an obvious clue that the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.069 
to me that is an obvious clue that the
egg<00:02:21.689> is<00:02:22.849> probably<00:02:23.849> linked<00:02:24.239> up<00:02:24.390> with<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.659> Sun

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
egg is probably linked up with the Sun

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.280 
egg is probably linked up with the Sun
itself<00:02:25.769> Easter<00:02:26.610> egg<00:02:26.790> has<00:02:27.480> something<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.109> do

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
itself Easter egg has something to do

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.740 
itself Easter egg has something to do
with<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.040> praise<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.640> Sun<00:02:29.909> clue<00:02:30.359> that<00:02:30.569> we've

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
with the praise the Sun clue that we've

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.839 
with the praise the Sun clue that we've
been<00:02:30.959> given<00:02:31.319> there<00:02:31.470> at<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.829> altruist<00:02:32.340> camp<00:02:32.640> I

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
been given there at the altruist camp I

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.440 
been given there at the altruist camp I
really<00:02:33.390> don't<00:02:33.540> think<00:02:33.599> there's<00:02:33.900> anything<00:02:34.290> else

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
really don't think there's anything else

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.420 
really don't think there's anything else
suspicious<00:02:36.450> here<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.439> will<00:02:37.950> point<00:02:38.159> out<00:02:38.370> that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
suspicious here I will point out that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.759 
suspicious here I will point out that
this<00:02:38.790> building<00:02:39.239> does<00:02:39.840> use<00:02:40.430> solar<00:02:41.690> energy<00:02:42.769> and

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
this building does use solar energy and

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.379 
this building does use solar energy and
I<00:02:43.920> really<00:02:44.280> can't<00:02:44.670> think<00:02:44.879> of<00:02:45.060> any<00:02:45.299> other

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
I really can't think of any other

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.349 
I really can't think of any other
buildings<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.829> have<00:02:47.069> solar<00:02:47.430> panels<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.209> it

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
buildings that have solar panels on it

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.819 
buildings that have solar panels on it
now<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.510> haven't<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:49.049> been<00:02:49.200> looking<00:02:49.560> for

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
now I haven't really been looking for

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.550 
now I haven't really been looking for
any<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.209> really<00:02:51.629> sticks<00:02:52.049> out<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.379> me<00:02:52.409> in

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
any but that really sticks out to me in

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.649 
any but that really sticks out to me in
the<00:02:52.620> fact<00:02:52.829> that<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.609> is<00:02:53.790> just<00:02:53.819> another<00:02:54.120> link

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
the fact that this is just another link

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.440 
the fact that this is just another link
to<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.989> Sun<00:02:55.319> in<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:56.010> building<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.700> it's

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
to the Sun in this building and it's

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.080 
to the Sun in this building and it's
probably<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:58.049> trying<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.799> point<00:02:59.099> us<00:02:59.280> you

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
probably just trying to point us you

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.460 
probably just trying to point us you
know<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.480> fact<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.019> Sun<00:03:01.260> has

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
know to the fact that the Sun has

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.259 
know to the fact that the Sun has
something<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.950> do<00:03:02.250> with<00:03:02.280> these<00:03:02.579> Easter<00:03:03.090> eggs

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
a.m. which is of course a time where we

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.309 
a.m. which is of course a time where we
can't<00:03:20.040> see<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.370> Sun<00:03:20.579> at<00:03:20.639> all<00:03:20.849> so<00:03:21.660> how<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:22.109> the

Sun involved we definitely have to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.619 
Sun involved we definitely have to
figure<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.599> out<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.489> these<00:03:26.489> solar<00:03:26.849> panels<00:03:26.970> are

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
figure it out and these solar panels are

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.580 
figure it out and these solar panels are
just<00:03:28.169> another<00:03:28.609> clue<00:03:29.609> that<00:03:30.239> points<00:03:30.690> us<00:03:30.840> towards

different areas in the map so look out

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.610 
different areas in the map so look out
for<00:05:26.340> that<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:26.550> will<00:05:26.759> be<00:05:27.000> uploading<00:05:27.690> that<00:05:28.319> very

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
for that I will be uploading that very

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.189 
for that I will be uploading that very
shortly<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.340> maybe<00:05:30.120> we<00:05:30.330> do<00:05:30.479> have<00:05:30.659> to<00:05:30.810> link<00:05:31.020> up

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
shortly and maybe we do have to link up

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.010 
shortly and maybe we do have to link up
the<00:05:31.349> Sun<00:05:31.620> with<00:05:31.889> something<00:05:32.370> else<00:05:32.719> that's<00:05:33.719> a

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
the Sun with something else that's a

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.689 
the Sun with something else that's a
pretty<00:05:34.349> good<00:05:34.560> theory<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:34.979> that's<00:05:35.129> definitely

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
pretty good theory and that's definitely

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.350 
pretty good theory and that's definitely
a<00:05:35.879> good<00:05:36.750> chance<00:05:37.080> so<00:05:37.289> if<00:05:37.379> you<00:05:37.469> guys<00:05:37.589> see<00:05:37.919> any

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
a good chance so if you guys see any

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.149 
a good chance so if you guys see any
interesting<00:05:39.500> structures<00:05:40.500> that<00:05:40.680> we<00:05:40.800> can<00:05:40.949> point

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
interesting structures that we can point

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.519 
interesting structures that we can point
the<00:05:41.339> Sun<00:05:41.610> at<00:05:41.839> definitely<00:05:42.839> let<00:05:43.169> me<00:05:43.199> know<00:05:43.319> the

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
the Sun at definitely let me know the

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.189 
the Sun at definitely let me know the
one<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:43.710> immediately<00:05:44.009> thought<00:05:44.460> of<00:05:44.520> is<00:05:44.819> that

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
one I immediately thought of is that

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.829 
one I immediately thought of is that
structure<00:05:46.199> there<00:05:46.500> at<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:47.029> observatory<00:05:48.029> in

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:48.839 
structure there at the observatory in
