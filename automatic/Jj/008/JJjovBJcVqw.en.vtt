00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
modern warfare two sort of like was the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.069 
modern warfare two sort of like was the
best<00:00:53.160> gameplay<00:00:53.430> how<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> go<00:00:54.360> about<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.629> sort<00:00:55.050> of

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
best gameplay how to go about it sort of

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.630 
best gameplay how to go about it sort of
best<00:00:55.260> guns<00:00:55.530> use<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.949> i'll<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.250> light<00:00:56.399> through

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
best guns use and i'll see light through

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.790 
best guns use and i'll see light through
this<00:00:57.420> video<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.899> matches<00:00:58.230> I'm<00:00:58.320> non-lead<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
this video the matches I'm non-lead in a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200 
this video the matches I'm non-lead in a
demolition<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.460> think<00:00:59.640> some<00:00:59.910> might<00:01:00.059> actually

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
demolition I think some might actually

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.360 
demolition I think some might actually
on<00:01:00.480> domination<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.440> most<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.859> demolition

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
on domination but most of demolition

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.189 
on domination but most of demolition
that's<00:01:02.969> what<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.270> find<00:01:03.629> easiest<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.110> get

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that's what I do find easiest to get

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.649 
that's what I do find easiest to get
tactical<00:01:04.530> nukes<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.460> obviously<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
tactical nukes on and obviously then the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.289 
tactical nukes on and obviously then the
idea<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.110> video<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> sort<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> train

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
idea of this video is to sort of train

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.200 
idea of this video is to sort of train
pinpoint<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.810> guys<00:01:10.020> watching<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:11.640> best

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
pinpoint for you guys watching the best

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.609 
pinpoint for you guys watching the best
gun<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.689> use<00:01:12.840> maybe<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.260> attacked<00:01:13.500> from

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
gun to use maybe to get attacked from

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.870 
gun to use maybe to get attacked from
the<00:01:13.740> obviously<00:01:14.100> I've<00:01:14.189> attached<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.610> meet<00:01:14.760> with

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the obviously I've attached to meet with

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149 
the obviously I've attached to meet with
every<00:01:15.119> gun<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> challenge<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.439> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
every gun to do the challenge so you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.920 
every gun to do the challenge so you
know<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:18.479> guess<00:01:18.659> source

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
know so up to you and they guess source

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.630 
know so up to you and they guess source
or<00:01:19.080> personal<00:01:19.619> preference<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.490> you

or personal preference and what you
enjoy<00:01:20.759> doing<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.509> maybe<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.470> idea<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.830> you

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
enjoy doing but maybe the idea is you

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.350 
enjoy doing but maybe the idea is you
can<00:01:23.070> sort<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.310> watch<00:01:23.460> my<00:01:23.640> videos<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.150> pick<00:01:24.240> up

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
can sort of watch my videos and pick up

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.120 
can sort of watch my videos and pick up
some<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.659> tactics<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.409> will<00:01:25.530> help<00:01:25.770> you

guys in a row there you see here the
benefits<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.080> being<00:03:22.620> behind<00:03:22.770> this<00:03:23.100> will

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
benefits of being behind this will

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.949 
benefits of being behind this will
normally<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.670> have<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> claim<00:03:24.000> or<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
stairs which covers it a bit obviously

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.340 
stairs which covers it a bit obviously
because<00:03:27.030> they're<00:03:27.270> attacking<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:27.959> much<00:03:28.170> you

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
know it's not really worth running an

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.820 
know it's not really worth running an
edge<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.690> put<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> claim<00:03:31.170> or<00:03:31.320> down<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.560> can<00:03:31.800> see

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
edge to put a claim or down you can see

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.830 
edge to put a claim or down you can see
the<00:03:32.130> benefits<00:03:32.580> of<00:03:32.730> behind<00:03:33.300> this<00:03:33.420> wall<00:03:33.630> you

think i may put to claim or down the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.590 
think i may put to claim or down the
