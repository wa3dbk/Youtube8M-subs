graphics<00:00:25.000> this<00:00:26.000> is<00:00:26.210> gonna<00:00:26.810> be<00:00:26.990> a<00:00:27.019> good

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
graphics this is gonna be a good

processor<00:00:28.010> for<00:00:28.250> basic<00:00:29.060> computing<00:00:30.039> pretty

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
processor for basic computing pretty

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.500 
processor for basic computing pretty
good<00:00:31.160> gaming<00:00:31.400> actually<00:00:31.849> cheaper<00:00:32.119> this<00:00:32.300> was<00:00:32.449> a

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
good gaming actually cheaper this was a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.270 
good gaming actually cheaper this was a
good<00:00:32.660> video<00:00:32.930> card<00:00:33.199> it<00:00:33.590> wouldn't<00:00:33.920> I<00:00:34.129> wouldn't

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
good video card it wouldn't I wouldn't

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.639 
good video card it wouldn't I wouldn't
necessarily<00:00:34.730> put<00:00:35.000> it<00:00:35.480> in<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.899> high-end<00:00:36.170> gaming

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
necessarily put it in a high-end gaming

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.220 
necessarily put it in a high-end gaming
but<00:00:37.010> um<00:00:37.520> it<00:00:38.000> would<00:00:38.450> be<00:00:38.540> pretty<00:00:38.719> good<00:00:38.899> with<00:00:38.960> it

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
but um it would be pretty good with it

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.260 
but um it would be pretty good with it
if<00:00:39.380> that's<00:00:39.590> what<00:00:39.710> you're<00:00:39.829> all<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:40.880> want<00:00:41.090> and

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
if that's what you're all you want and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.369 
if that's what you're all you want and
definitely<00:00:41.750> you'd<00:00:41.840> have<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.050> other<00:00:42.230> great

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
definitely you'd have the other great

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.780 
definitely you'd have the other great
path<00:00:42.649> because<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.520> socket<00:00:44.270> LGA<00:00:44.690> 1150<00:00:45.790> you

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
path because the socket LGA 1150 you

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.290 
path because the socket LGA 1150 you
know<00:00:46.910> goes<00:00:47.120> all<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.510> way<00:00:47.690> up<00:00:47.899> to<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.170> i7<00:00:48.590> 4770k

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
know goes all the way up to the i7 4770k

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.630 
know goes all the way up to the i7 4770k
so<00:00:50.300> definitely<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:50.989> good<00:00:51.039> stopgap<00:00:52.039> upgrade

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
so definitely a good stopgap upgrade

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.029 
so definitely a good stopgap upgrade
path<00:00:52.850> for<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:53.440> just<00:00:54.440> into<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.739> quick<00:00:54.890> unboxing

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
path for you just into a quick unboxing

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.150 
path for you just into a quick unboxing
show<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:55.699> what's<00:00:55.940> included<00:00:56.270> in<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.690> box

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
show you what's included in the box

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.400 
show you what's included in the box
nothing<00:00:58.160> fancy<00:00:58.489> here<00:00:58.520> but<00:00:58.820> I<00:00:58.850> will<00:00:59.149> also<00:00:59.410> just

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
nothing fancy here but I will also just

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.450 
nothing fancy here but I will also just
a<00:01:00.469> minute<00:01:00.710> you'll<00:01:00.890> be<00:01:01.010> able<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.219> see<00:01:01.309> some

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
a minute you'll be able to see some

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.500 
a minute you'll be able to see some
benchmarks<00:01:02.000> so<00:01:02.180> I'm<00:01:02.270> going<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.420> be

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
benchmarks so I'm going to be

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.139 
benchmarks so I'm going to be
benchmarking<00:01:03.079> this<00:01:03.230> processor<00:01:03.800> ok<00:01:04.430> I'll<00:01:04.670> just

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
benchmarking this processor ok I'll just

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.180 
benchmarking this processor ok I'll just
go<00:01:05.600> over<00:01:05.750> what's<00:01:05.930> inside<00:01:06.289> of<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.500> box<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:07.009> let

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
go over what's inside of the box and let

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.090 
go over what's inside of the box and let
you<00:01:07.310> see<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:09.470> up<00:01:09.680> here<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:12.409> course<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:12.860> main

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
you see it up here of course the main

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.359 
you see it up here of course the main
thing<00:01:13.130> in<00:01:13.820> this<00:01:13.939> box<00:01:14.180> will<00:01:14.479> be<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.869> core<00:01:15.619> the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
thing in this box will be the core the

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.399 
thing in this box will be the core the
stock<00:01:16.610> cooler<00:01:17.710> sitting<00:01:18.710> here<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:19.159> have<00:01:19.369> the

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
stock cooler sitting here you have the

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.109 
stock cooler sitting here you have the
authorized<00:01:21.409> Intel<00:01:21.890> use<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.490> Intel<00:01:22.790> logo

want with the Intel logo on your case
this<00:01:27.799> authorizes<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.820> do<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.150> if<00:01:29.240> you're

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
this authorizes you to do it if you're

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.260 
this authorizes you to do it if you're
selling<00:01:29.720> this<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.020> third<00:01:30.229> party<00:01:30.790> or<00:01:31.790> I'm<00:01:32.090> do

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
selling this to a third party or I'm do

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.179 
selling this to a third party or I'm do
it<00:01:32.360> yourself<00:01:32.689> but<00:01:33.530> I've<00:01:33.710> basically<00:01:33.890> got<00:01:34.159> a

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
it yourself but I've basically got a

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.980 
it yourself but I've basically got a
nice<00:01:34.430> little<00:01:34.610> very<00:01:35.030> thick<00:01:35.299> booklet<00:01:35.720> here<00:01:35.869> I'm

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
nice little very thick booklet here I'm

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.539 
nice little very thick booklet here I'm
sure<00:01:36.170> it's<00:01:36.320> in<00:01:36.380> multiple<00:01:36.650> languages<00:01:37.250> it's

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
sure it's in multiple languages it's

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.030 
sure it's in multiple languages it's
actually<00:01:37.880> sealed<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:38.930> I<00:01:39.259> guess<00:01:39.710> they'll<00:01:39.860> want

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
actually sealed so I guess they'll want

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.200 
actually sealed so I guess they'll want
to<00:01:40.100> get<00:01:40.220> all<00:01:40.280> my<00:01:40.400> stuff<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:40.759> just<00:01:40.850> basic

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
to get all my stuff but just basic
