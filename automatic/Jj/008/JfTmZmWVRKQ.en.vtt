00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
diamond block is also in the out in in

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.009 
diamond block is also in the out in in
the<00:02:43.890> earth<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.340> world<00:02:44.549> behind<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.629> actual

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
the earth in the world behind the actual

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.690 
the earth in the world behind the actual
bookcase<00:02:46.500> there<00:02:46.680> as<00:02:46.980> well<00:02:47.159> so<00:02:47.189> I<00:02:47.400> think<00:02:47.489> that

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
bookcase there as well so I think that

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.069 
bookcase there as well so I think that
was<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.819> great<00:02:48.030> feature<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.420> they<00:02:48.540> added<00:02:48.569> a

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
was a great feature that they added a

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.960 
was a great feature that they added a
little<00:02:50.010> check<00:02:50.129> out<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.370> other<00:02:50.489> features<00:02:50.819> as

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
little check out the other features as

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.309 
little check out the other features as
well<00:02:51.000> because<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.689> whole<00:02:51.870> part<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.230> this

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
well because the whole part of this

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.349 
well because the whole part of this
house<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.829> done<00:02:53.040> from<00:02:53.370> scratch<00:02:53.549> exactly<00:02:54.239> the
