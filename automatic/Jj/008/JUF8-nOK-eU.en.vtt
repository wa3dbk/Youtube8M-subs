00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
available here but more importantly we

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.369

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
to do that for in doing the cases you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.550 
to do that for in doing the cases you
know<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> doctors<00:01:12.780> around<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.409> we

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
know we have the doctors around and we

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.730 
know we have the doctors around and we
you<00:01:13.890> know<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.159> teach<00:01:14.430> them<00:01:14.700> how<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.229> these

you know we teach them how to do these
cases<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.810> think<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.920> was<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> short

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
cases and I think this this was a short

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.960 
cases and I think this this was a short
trip<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.220> definitely<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:23.939> are

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970

because<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.330> doctors<00:02:11.720> are<00:02:11.870> not<00:02:11.990> here<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.530> so

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
because the doctors are not here and so

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.280 
because the doctors are not here and so
there<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:13.940> be<00:02:15.130> multi<00:02:16.360> national<00:02:17.360> arrangements

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
there can be multi national arrangements

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.030 
there can be multi national arrangements
for<00:02:18.950> patients<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.760> be<00:02:20.510> treated<00:02:20.960> for<00:02:21.680> example

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
for patients to be treated for example

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.300 
for patients to be treated for example
in<00:02:22.130> Ghana<00:02:22.430> or<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.660> know<00:02:23.860> nigeria<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.130> other

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
in Ghana or in you know nigeria in other

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.660 
in Ghana or in you know nigeria in other
places<00:02:25.550> where<00:02:25.940> there<00:02:26.180> there<00:02:27.170> are<00:02:27.670> specialists

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
places where there there are specialists

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.150 
places where there there are specialists
there<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.660> think<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.440> other<00:02:30.590> thing<00:02:30.710> that<00:02:30.890> I've

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
there I think the other thing that I've

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.920 
there I think the other thing that I've
been<00:02:32.060> told<00:02:32.330> about<00:02:32.600> is<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.500> fact<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.830> D<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
been told about is the fact that D the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.660 
been told about is the fact that D the
Liberian<00:02:36.470> government<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.920> actually<00:02:37.070> thinking

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
Liberian government is actually thinking

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.160 
Liberian government is actually thinking
about<00:02:37.880> setting<00:02:38.210> up<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.540> national<00:02:38.960> post

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
about setting up and national post

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.680 
about setting up and national post
graduate<00:02:39.530> college<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:40.880> they<00:02:41.120> sent<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.480> team

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
graduate college and so they sent a team

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.000 
graduate college and so they sent a team
to<00:02:41.720> Ghana<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:43.510> learn<00:02:44.510> from<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.380> system<00:02:45.950> so

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
to Ghana to learn from the I system so

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.910 
to Ghana to learn from the I system so
they<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:46.940> implement<00:02:47.300> it<00:02:47.570> here<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.050> will

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
they can implement it here that will

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.960 
they can implement it here that will
help<00:02:49.190> them<00:02:49.460> train<00:02:49.910> more<00:02:50.570> doctors<00:02:51.190> locally<00:02:52.190> you

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
help them train more doctors locally you

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.630 
help them train more doctors locally you
know<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.150> help<00:02:54.040> take<00:02:55.040> care<00:02:55.100> of<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.460> people

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
know to help take care of the people

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.370 
know to help take care of the people
here<00:02:56.060> because<00:02:56.390> right<00:02:56.630> now<00:02:56.660> there's<00:02:57.020> nothing

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
here because right now there's nothing

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.530 
here because right now there's nothing
like<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.740> and<00:02:57.980> but<00:02:58.490> from<00:02:58.700> your<00:02:58.850> assessment

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
like that and but from your assessment

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.650 
like that and but from your assessment
of<00:02:59.630> things<00:02:59.960> do<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.380> think<00:03:00.970> resources<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.180> the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
of things do you think resources in the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.620 
of things do you think resources in the
sub-region<00:03:02.960> I<00:03:03.530> really<00:03:04.370> been<00:03:04.520> directed<00:03:05.150> at

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
sub-region I really been directed at

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.710 
sub-region I really been directed at
addressing<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.650> heaven<00:03:07.100> needs<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.720> its

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
addressing the heaven needs of its

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.620 
addressing the heaven needs of its
people<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:10.100> think<00:03:10.730> that's<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:11.030> very<00:03:11.180> tricky

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
people I think that's a very tricky

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.170 
people I think that's a very tricky
question<00:03:12.050> and<00:03:12.680> difficult<00:03:13.610> question<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:13.970> ask

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
question and difficult question to ask

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.500 
question and difficult question to ask
again<00:03:14.720> when<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.320> look<00:03:15.560> at<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.820> sub-region

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
again when you look at the sub-region

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.990 
again when you look at the sub-region
you<00:03:18.140> know<00:03:18.260> there<00:03:18.440> are<00:03:18.560> very<00:03:19.220> many<00:03:19.310> competing

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
you know there are very many competing

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.080 
you know there are very many competing
needs<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:22.190> government's<00:03:22.760> will<00:03:22.910> have

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
needs and so the government's will have

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.690 
needs and so the government's will have
to<00:03:23.270> you<00:03:24.140> know<00:03:24.260> make<00:03:24.500> very<00:03:25.190> difficult

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
to you know make very difficult

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.140 
to you know make very difficult
decisions<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:27.680> terms<00:03:27.740> of<00:03:28.310> how<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.850> allocate

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
decisions in terms of how to allocate

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.620 
decisions in terms of how to allocate
resources<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:31.130> because<00:03:31.760> there<00:03:32.030> are<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:32.180> many

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
resources and because there are so many

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.170 
resources and because there are so many
competing<00:03:33.080> needs<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:34.310> problems<00:03:34.790> are<00:03:34.970> so

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
competing needs the problems are so

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.650 
competing needs the problems are so
enormous<00:03:35.510> that<00:03:36.100> even<00:03:37.300> allocating<00:03:38.300> a<00:03:38.390> big

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
enormous that even allocating a big

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.870 
enormous that even allocating a big
chunk<00:03:39.020> of<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.290> gdp<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.340> health<00:03:40.580> sector

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
chunk of the gdp to the health sector

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.590 
chunk of the gdp to the health sector
will<00:03:41.840> still<00:03:42.170> be<00:03:42.650> only<00:03:43.160> cracking<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.150> surface

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
will still be only cracking the surface

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.930 
will still be only cracking the surface
of<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:45.050> problem<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.709> so<00:03:45.890> it's<00:03:46.459> just<00:03:46.640> going<00:03:46.880> to

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
of the problem and so it's just going to

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.920 
of the problem and so it's just going to
take<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.300> lot<00:03:47.420> of<00:03:47.480> political<00:03:47.840> will<00:03:48.140> and

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
take a lot of political will and

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.740 
take a lot of political will and
planning<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:52.580> know<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.760> get<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.360> problem

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
planning to you know to get the problem

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.500 
planning to you know to get the problem
so
