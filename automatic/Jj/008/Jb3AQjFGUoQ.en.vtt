00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.730
 I'm here today to show you a new one 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.530
 clip there were ris da laughs anyway 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.570
 you understand what the map is talking about 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.880
 the new dlc revolution map for the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.739
 zombie mode this judge a lot 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.720
 simple it is a confused 10 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.879
 a bit like the last one if you haven't seen it 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.910
 you can't find in my channel is 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.879
 practically what we should do we can 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.230
 do even more than one player 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.210
 what we will have to do will be to achieve 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.940
 the buddha room the room with the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.620
 overturned suit with the floor on the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.050
 ceiling the ceiling on the floor with 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.480
 we will have to go down in this one 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.220
 room and approach this column 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.630
 us practically destroyed 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.369
 we approach this pillar there 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.369
 we position more or less at this point 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.100
 I started standing is indifferent and 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.660
 as you will see it is done correctly is 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.190
 very easy to try some 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.259
 time it was done correctly to all 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.970
 the zombies will gather in front of you 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.649
 and they won't be able to hit me or anyway you 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.830
 I recommend using a jagger the 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.880
 juggernaut garden drink in the case 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.159
 some zombies still manage to pass 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.290
 he wo n't be able to kill me a place 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.909
 strategic what is if you play more than one 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.950
 person is a strategic compound in which 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.840
 you can leave the second player or 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.670
 however your partner is at the top 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.350
 to the colon to the column in front of the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.700
 which you have put you will take it in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.920
 from there to the summit succeed in hitting 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.540
 easily all the zombies and therefore 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.460
 all the zombies will gather recently 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.299
 thinking indifferently of one 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.799
 other 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.360
