00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
and I have really couple of things this

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.120 
and I have really couple of things this
month<00:03:20.480> but<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:21.049> might<00:03:21.230> be<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.380> while<00:03:21.470> before<00:03:21.860> I

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
month but it might be a while before I

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.289 
month but it might be a while before I

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.150 
have enough for an update video and I
just<00:03:26.299> find<00:03:26.660> resin<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:27.380> much<00:03:27.530> easier<00:03:27.769> because

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
just find resin so much easier because

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.130 
just find resin so much easier because
you<00:03:28.370> don't<00:03:28.700> eat<00:03:28.940> ideas<00:03:29.450> all<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.840> need<00:03:29.989> is

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
you don't eat ideas all you need is

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.170 
you don't eat ideas all you need is
stickers<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.860> stick<00:03:31.220> them<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.489> their<00:03:31.670> present

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
stickers and stick them in their present

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.080 
stickers and stick them in their present
mold<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.690> that's<00:03:33.079> it<00:03:33.290> really<00:03:33.500> eat<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.670> for

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
mold and that's it really eat the for

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.060 
mold and that's it really eat the for
clay<00:03:35.299> it's<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.630> lot<00:03:35.780> harder<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.350> make<00:03:36.530> things<00:03:36.799> I

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
clay it's a lot harder to make things I

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.030 
clay it's a lot harder to make things I
think<00:03:37.130> because<00:03:37.579> you<00:03:37.730> need<00:03:37.940> ideas<00:03:38.329> first

go<00:07:25.630> but<00:07:25.900> the<00:07:25.990> story<00:07:26.230> of<00:07:26.290> a<00:07:26.410> seller<00:07:26.650> had<00:07:26.830> been

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.040

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.060 
go but the story of a seller had been
shut<00:07:27.250> down<00:07:27.280> I<00:07:27.460> think<00:07:27.640> and<00:07:28.470> the<00:07:29.470> ebay<00:07:29.770> seller

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.070 
shut down I think and the ebay seller

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.590 
shut down I think and the ebay seller
was<00:07:30.250> stripped<00:07:30.490> down<00:07:30.580> as<00:07:30.790> well<00:07:30.910> so<00:07:31.210> you<00:07:31.270> don't

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:31.600 
was stripped down as well so you don't

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.020 
was stripped down as well so you don't
have<00:07:31.660> to<00:07:31.810> worry<00:07:31.960> about<00:07:32.050> those<00:07:32.760> so<00:07:33.760> that's<00:07:33.880> it

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.030 
have to worry about those so that's it

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.250 
have to worry about those so that's it
for<00:07:34.060> the<00:07:34.210> questions<00:07:34.570> I<00:07:34.720> chose<00:07:34.960> for<00:07:35.170> this
