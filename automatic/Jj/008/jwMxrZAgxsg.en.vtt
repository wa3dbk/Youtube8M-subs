this<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> little<00:00:56.699> bit<00:00:56.850> overhyped<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.719> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
this was a little bit overhyped and to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.939 
this was a little bit overhyped and to
me<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.449> disappointing<00:01:00.949> why

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
me it was a little disappointing why

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.609 
me it was a little disappointing why
disappointing<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.789> asked<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.199> because

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
disappointing you asked it's not because

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.800

because it seems like it's too little to
me<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.659> disappointing<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.530> hand

information<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.780> still<00:01:46.289> seems<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.710> me<00:01:46.920> like

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
information it still seems to me like

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.719 
information it still seems to me like
it's<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.700> bit<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.270> too<00:01:49.159> little<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.700> I

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
it's a little bit just too little so I

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.889 
it's a little bit just too little so I
guess<00:01:50.880> I'll<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> keep<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.750> eye<00:01:51.780> out
