00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.430 

I'm<00:00:13.059> think<00:00:13.269> they<00:00:13.330> took<00:00:13.480> fundamental<00:00:14.080> fairness

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
I'm think they took fundamental fairness

with your food and new range of 2013
Smart<00:00:17.349> TVs<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:19.119> used<00:00:19.360> a<00:00:19.539> lot<00:00:19.779> of<00:00:19.810> what<00:00:19.960> we've

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:20.079 
Smart TVs we used a lot of what we've

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.350 
Smart TVs we used a lot of what we've
done<00:00:20.200> from<00:00:20.410> last<00:00:20.650> year<00:00:20.890> we've<00:00:21.279> implanted<00:00:22.090> the

done from last year we've implanted the

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.880 
done from last year we've implanted the
platform<00:00:22.779> for<00:00:22.930> Smarties<00:00:23.349> they've<00:00:23.590> made<00:00:23.770> it

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
platform for Smarties they've made it

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.249 
platform for Smarties they've made it
easier<00:00:24.189> to<00:00:24.250> use<00:00:24.489> is<00:00:24.759> to<00:00:24.970> control<00:00:25.329> and<00:00:25.960> give<00:00:26.110> you

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
easier to use is to control and give you

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.950 
easier to use is to control and give you
more<00:00:26.439> bomb<00:00:26.680> tip<00:00:26.919> as<00:00:27.130> well<00:00:27.160> so<00:00:27.880> first<00:00:28.630> up<00:00:28.779> is<00:00:28.869> a

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
more bomb tip as well so first up is a

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.959 
more bomb tip as well so first up is a
new<00:00:29.140> magic<00:00:29.439> remote<00:00:29.680> control<00:00:30.070> it's<00:00:30.700> a<00:00:30.759> lot

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:30.969 
new magic remote control it's a lot

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.410 
new magic remote control it's a lot
easier<00:00:31.119> to<00:00:31.360> use<00:00:31.509> the<00:00:31.660> Smart<00:00:31.899> TVs<00:00:32.290> this<00:00:32.469> year

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
easier to use the Smart TVs this year

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.250 
easier to use the Smart TVs this year
you<00:00:34.420> can<00:00:34.570> see<00:00:34.660> it's<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.809> lot<00:00:34.930> smaller<00:00:35.200> than

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
you can see it's a lot smaller than

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.529 
you can see it's a lot smaller than
previous<00:00:35.500> magic<00:00:35.950> remote<00:00:36.190> controls<00:00:36.610> gives<00:00:37.450> you

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
previous magic remote controls gives you

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:38.940 
previous magic remote controls gives you
the<00:00:37.629> ability<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:38.020> navigate<00:00:38.590> around<00:00:38.710> the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
the ability to navigate around the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.440 
the ability to navigate around the
screen<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:39.219> lot<00:00:39.370> easier<00:00:39.730> so<00:00:39.910> you've<00:00:40.090> got<00:00:40.270> a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
screen a lot easier so you've got a

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.430 
screen a lot easier so you've got a
number<00:00:40.629> of<00:00:40.780> different<00:00:40.870> modes

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
number of different modes

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.590 
number of different modes
firstly<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.340> point<00:00:42.640> mode<00:00:42.850> where<00:00:43.149> you<00:00:43.239> can<00:00:43.390> see

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
firstly the point mode where you can see

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.110 
firstly the point mode where you can see
as<00:00:43.839> you<00:00:43.870> move<00:00:44.140> it<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:45.249> curse<00:00:45.489> goes<00:00:45.789> along<00:00:46.030> the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
as you move it the curse goes along the

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.849 
as you move it the curse goes along the
swing<00:00:46.359> so<00:00:46.570> very<00:00:46.780> intuitive<00:00:47.350> as<00:00:47.530> if<00:00:47.649> you<00:00:47.769> as

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
swing so very intuitive as if you as

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.770 
swing so very intuitive as if you as
point<00:00:48.129> onto<00:00:48.339> the<00:00:48.429> TV<00:00:48.640> just<00:00:49.449> point<00:00:49.659> to<00:00:49.719> the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
point onto the TV just point to the

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.329 
point onto the TV just point to the
section<00:00:50.170> you<00:00:50.350> want<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.399> clay<00:00:53.190> within<00:00:54.190> that

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
section you want so clay within that

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.669 
section you want so clay within that
we've<00:00:54.489> also<00:00:54.640> got<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.999> squall<00:00:55.449> it's<00:00:56.019> in<00:00:56.109> a<00:00:56.199> teak

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
we've also got a squall it's in a teak

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.259 
we've also got a squall it's in a teak
so<00:00:56.890> you<00:00:56.979> can<00:00:57.100> scroll<00:00:57.399> through<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.789> cards<00:00:58.120> that

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
so you can scroll through the cards that

00:00:58.269 --> 00:00:59.549 
so you can scroll through the cards that
are<00:00:58.329> on<00:00:58.359> the<00:00:58.510> screen<00:00:58.569> to<00:00:58.899> make<00:00:58.929> it<00:00:59.170> easier<00:00:59.469> to

down the website so very similar to
compute<00:01:05.110> amounts<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.920> how<00:01:06.070> you<00:01:06.250> use<00:01:06.520> it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
compute amounts and how you use it

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.660 
compute amounts and how you use it
the<00:01:08.409> books<00:01:08.590> I<00:01:08.710> did<00:01:08.920> this<00:01:09.010> year<00:01:09.190> gesture

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
the books I did this year gesture

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.300 
the books I did this year gesture
control<00:01:10.090> which<00:01:10.840> enables<00:01:11.290> you<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.409> not<00:01:11.920> only

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
control which enables you to not only

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.730 
control which enables you to not only
jump<00:01:12.729> between<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:14.020> you<00:01:14.110> previously<00:01:14.350> been

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
jump between what you previously been

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.780 
jump between what you previously been
watching<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.250> what<00:01:15.400> you're<00:01:15.520> now<00:01:15.640> watching

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.670 
watching and what you're now watching
more<00:01:16.600> importantly<00:01:16.960> you<00:01:17.050> can<00:01:17.080> actually<00:01:17.440> wipe

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
more importantly you can actually wipe

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
the TV channel number on the screen so

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.149 
the TV channel number on the screen so
one<00:01:19.720> channel<00:01:20.020> one<00:01:20.170> two<00:01:20.320> three<00:01:20.560> for<00:01:20.710> example

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
one channel one two three for example

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.740 
one channel one two three for example
you<00:01:21.520> just<00:01:21.729> go<00:01:21.820> up<00:01:21.940> one<00:01:22.119> two<00:01:22.330> three<00:01:22.600> on<00:01:22.630> the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
you just go up one two three on the

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.300 
you just go up one two three on the
screen<00:01:22.990> using<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.350> magic<00:01:23.590> remote<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.130> go

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
screen using the magic remote and you go

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.160 
screen using the magic remote and you go
straight<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.790> it<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.420> lot<00:01:25.630> more<00:01:25.659> intuitive

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
straight to it so a lot more intuitive

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.030 
straight to it so a lot more intuitive
again<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.619> lot<00:01:26.860> more<00:01:27.070> easy<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.399> control<00:01:29.040> we've

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
again a lot more easy to control we've

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.560 
again a lot more easy to control we've
also<00:01:30.220> got<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.490> voice<00:01:30.640> control<00:01:31.119> which<00:01:31.270> we<00:01:31.420> had

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
also got the voice control which we had

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.330 
also got the voice control which we had
