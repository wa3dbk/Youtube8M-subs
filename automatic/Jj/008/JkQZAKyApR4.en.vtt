00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.980 

what<00:05:17.390> was<00:05:17.540> that<00:05:17.590> you<00:05:18.590> totally<00:05:18.950> ruined<00:05:19.190> it<00:05:19.990> no

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
what was that you totally ruined it no

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.230 
what was that you totally ruined it no
have<00:05:21.290> you<00:05:21.410> scared<00:05:21.710> him<00:05:21.860> in<00:05:22.010> behind<00:05:25.060> he's<00:05:26.060> in

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
have you scared him in behind he's in

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.280 
have you scared him in behind he's in
behind<00:05:26.510> here<00:05:26.780> now

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
behind here now

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.870 
behind here now
maybe<00:05:27.890> he'll<00:05:28.070> actually<00:05:28.220> get<00:05:28.460> out<00:05:28.580> that<00:05:28.730> way<00:05:28.850> so

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
maybe he'll actually get out that way so

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.280 
maybe he'll actually get out that way so
that's<00:05:29.240> good<00:05:29.419> I<00:05:29.450> think<00:05:29.510> there's<00:05:29.840> a<00:05:29.900> hole<00:05:30.050> that

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
that's good I think there's a hole that

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.970 
that's good I think there's a hole that
way<00:05:30.440> so<00:05:30.500> hopefully<00:05:30.800> we<00:05:31.370> get<00:05:31.460> out<00:05:32.380> but<00:05:33.380> as<00:05:33.500> at

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
way so hopefully we get out but as at

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.880 
way so hopefully we get out but as at
this<00:05:34.220> point<00:05:34.490> I<00:05:34.610> think<00:05:35.229> Kayla's<00:05:36.229> no<00:05:36.590> longer
