00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.290
 disturbing news came from that royal 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.160
 power and Satars 50 sheep wolves bite 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.139
 7 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.540
 such cases in areas bordering 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.849
 estonia happens every year but how 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.480
 rule no more than one or two attacks 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.520
 on sheep 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.920
 and this year the wolves have clearly stripped 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.800
 say foresters in limb in Osh region 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.949
 4 such cases have already been noted 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.449
 even that the limit on shooting wolves 150 m 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:36.059
 year engineer when the skin of the Omsk region 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:39.840
 after shelling these 150 wolves gave 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.800
 let me hunt 25 past 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.070
 year, too, they say specifically our area 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.250
 generally wolves 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:54.329
 hunters killed such a well 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.149
 lunge this year in honor of the authorities already 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.190
 about 600 wolves live and the purpose of the hunt is not 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.050
 give the predator populations grow 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.180
 beyond measure when wolves begin 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.460
 pose a real danger to others 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.619
 types of animals including domestic 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.110
 although according to foresters wolf attacks 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.090
 on livestock not starving just 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.220
 the hunting instinct works 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.049
 we are in such remote forests without swamps and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.119
 wolves love to inhabit the beast he is very 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.490
 careful with good scent and rumors 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.619
 good weather can smell a person 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.180
 kilometer before and runs no worse than any 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.700
 another car at 60 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.180
 kilometers per hour but more dangerous for humans 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.549
 Total 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.619
 injured or rabid animal a 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.259
 here for sheep the wolf is a real threat 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.270
 whereby the hunter of gambling killing one 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.240
 two sheep sometimes fall into such a rage that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.340
 can bite and a whole herd and I mistress 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.380
 one of the hamlets near limbo on his own 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.390
 experience convinced and cunning gray 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.090
 predator fortunately by the farmers themselves 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.649
 I managed to avoid him, but I already 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.320
 five years family lives here 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.210
 but saw the wolf only in the zoo and here 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.549
 a case that happened before last 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.890
 In the summer I remembered well, but it was so 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.380
 in the early morning the sheep returned to pasture 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.689
 then we had about 70 heads and we 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.420
 saw that some veils are bitten about 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.510
 some we were not counted at all 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.280
 this year there were no such cases 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.470
 we have already installed fences with 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.709
 electrocute and hope it will be 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.480
 somehow jump wolves from burenka 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.439
 sometimes other predators also drop in 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.390
 foxes 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.159
 nibble at death big animal they 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.620
 of course they can not but bite and 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.079
 infect rabies it is likely 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.340
 so this forest beast is more of a threat 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.099
 for livestock 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.440
 man should not be afraid of attack though 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:43.220
 wanders through our rice not only foxes yes 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.690
 people do not need to be afraid of wolf 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.480
 I think bears 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:52.700
 more dangerous than him because he is in winter and autumn 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.739
 must go to sleep and winter trowel if 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.379
 he and here our body is warm as 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.450
 now walk dressed so he is more dangerous 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.609
 much wolf but no tales about 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.769
 forest predators do not scare residents of the area 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.470
 places here are fertile mushrooms and 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.569
 berry foresters until a special alarm is not 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.000
 beat and therefore uses with might and main local 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.250
 population last similar days 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.019
