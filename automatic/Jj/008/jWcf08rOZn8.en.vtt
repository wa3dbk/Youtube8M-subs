00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello dear friends with you I am 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.480
 max and today we will analyze 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.790
 firing pistol-93 counter 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.410
 global strike offencive purchase this 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.929
 submachine gun great can both 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.250
 terrorists and counter-terrorists and now 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.520
 we'll talk about damage 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.670
 if the enemy is without armor, then in his head 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.689
 break it up with two shots to the body with 4 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.449
 feet of 5 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.160
 if the opponent is in armor in the head again 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.859
 twice stand in the body 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.110
 5 legs six times thats arms 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.370
 equal then he and if to make up in hands from 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.719
 beginning of the elbow crease and closer to the palm 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.760
 I will quickly say two at night now 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.829
 words about the tactics of the game because from 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.980
 tactics will depend on the mechanics of that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.989
 how do we shoot so why this gun 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.629
 he is not meant to be squeezed 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.910
 the distances are completely and absolutely not 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.610
 designed to play like shooting with 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.820
 opponent on some sort of skill on 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.129
 some kind is our gun with to just 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.520
 good night to play do not need to be 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.760
 by someone 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.570
 mega fumes with the key fob super-duper need 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.520
 just be able to push the enemy moral 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.070
 therefore, we proceed from this that 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.229
 the gun will be completely completely when 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.520
 meaning to share would be on the run let's 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.250
 let's see how it happens see what 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.360
 almost all the bullets are flying 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.280
 aesthetic center will fly away so that 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.729
 considering the size of the body our work let's 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.689
 one more time this is it like this 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.189
 lays into the body of the enemy all the bullets 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.600
 in full view is also worth 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.670
 submachine gun can shoot at 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.110
 jumping 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.689
 like that you see for all the bullets practically 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.360
 fly where but in a certain such 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.250
 small radius again this 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.780
 distance jumping i advise for this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.700
 at what distance that is no further 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.399
 further jumping in the willows 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.880
 It is the same no frost on the run 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.149
 shoot even such a distance 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.619
 for jumping off the shackles u for running such 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.989
 Russians for jumping in what 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.970
 shooting at strafe he just 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.680
 shoot against the enemy who 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.269
 worth far by setting them sith 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.970
 submachine gun I would not advise 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.790
 because it is necessary to rashit 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.080
 you can shoot but if you carry some 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.349
 protection because of her like this 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.750
 shoot the enemy settings then 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.580
 You can eat on I would not advise to sit and 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.950
 clamp always machine guns I would 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.890
 never hung up at all 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.170
 if you allow your chemistry times here 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.660
 or here dal stand in alpha state in 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.760
 opponents what are you doing yourself 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.120
 under the feet from here or here 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.519
 Centre 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.650
 sit down and start like this 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:54.049
 nenko and sweep it all 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.769
 distance to kill opponents a tax 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:01.180
 you can't sit at all like that now about 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.890
 a little jumping mechanics 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.239
 never if you jump don't pinch 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.800
 Fully make the button higher by 455 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.670
 vyserov that is 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.670
 like this 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.470
 in one flight lay out make two sprays 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.520
 Well, let's say you should the more 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.200
 will play the more you will 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.790
 feel that your jump as he 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.850
 will last until 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.050
 such a jump is this or this 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.360
 horse jump or is it you jump 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.530
 let's say here from the bench 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.030
 you have to make two better 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.540
 buildings one such spray cook 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.480
 showed here i should be two 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.500
 small spray which eventually 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.840
 such a pattern I her that one of 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.860
 bullets in any spray one spray it 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.570
 perhaps such a pseudo-brand there 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.900
 no experience submachine gun what 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.750
 each jump 1 field almost always 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.390
 for each spray flies almost at all 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.270
 that's where you aim it to us 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.610
 will give that two bullets for our jump exactly 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.770
 fall into the body of an opponent this is exactly 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.870
 a secret that you will not tell anywhere 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.970
 here I tell you it because 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.060
 that he found him here so jumped 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:23.860
 that is, the caretaker all the time so 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:27.070
 remember this one jump and 2 one bullet 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.830
 yes but there is a igloo door but 1 is just 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.820
 Random 1 is just these pseudo some 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.630
 incomprehensible random now just love on 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.890
 running like shooting on the run 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.470
 never run one way because 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.930
 What is an experienced opponent topic with him 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.760
 more crown chips I am talking about 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.070
 I will continue to talk tactics or 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.370
 games in general that is not saplina arming 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.470
 how to trick the opponent and 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.570
 let's say when i see a person with 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.500
 a rooster who runs just let's say 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:02.560
 here runs here from here ridges and also 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.510
 doing what i do literally for but see 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.720
 that he runs for half a second you understand 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.450
 we will run further aiming 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.550
 especially on horizontally on his 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.440
 head and more often further and as soon as he 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.490
 he gets food shot a little further 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.740
 shot in the end what turns out you run 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.140
 get very unpleasant such foghat 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.810
 start to fear and die right away 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.639
 so how do you shoot him 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.460
 always run left-right again 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.439
 it will give some such small 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.180
 narrowing the halo of your shots what 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.189
 will more accurately deal with 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.560
 your opponents that is, we run 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.479
 left right left right very well 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.029
 hide behind whales order it if 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:47.710
 the opponent here is worth you keep not from here 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:49.479
 here what we do you water 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.659
 must constantly disappear from view 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.550
 the enemy for at least a couple of seconds so that he 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.409
 lost your sight lead if it 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.029
 about that he can't just take 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:00.340
 hold yes may it be on you 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:02.229
 more effectively he should try you 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.810
 aim it in the head or in the body there 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:09.340
 exactly shot grew disappeared once disappeared 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:13.509
 and that is your bullets will clog here in 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.689
 this piece of wood and its not that is, he grew up 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:19.000
 he only use this disappeared and you 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.009
 already shoot in advance that is prefacer 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.610
 i.e. I donâ€™t shoot your bullets 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:27.819
 do not fly away Here's a trick 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.740
 firing perhaps this is probably all with 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:32.039
 you were gadzhinsky hope you very much 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.050
 liked this video because i 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.550
 tried to find a couple as usual 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.409
 secrets for this weapon that is here 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.080
 like with these jumps I hope you this 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:42.460
 help you like it like put like 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.050
 subscribe to the channel if you are not 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.669
 subscribe call your friends 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.560
 that called for more comment on this 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.560
 video until next meetings
