00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
how my first gen nexus 7 looks like and

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.270 
how my first gen nexus 7 looks like and
then<00:03:11.730> holding<00:03:12.269> this<00:03:12.450> one<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.049> my<00:03:13.500> 2nd<00:03:14.040> gen

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
then holding this one this is my 2nd gen

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.330 
then holding this one this is my 2nd gen
it<00:03:14.849> just<00:03:15.090> feels<00:03:15.359> so<00:03:16.230> much<00:03:16.440> lighter<00:03:16.829> it's<00:03:17.129> as

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
it just feels so much lighter it's as

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.460 
it just feels so much lighter it's as
you<00:03:17.459> see<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:17.819> bezel<00:03:18.269> because<00:03:18.870> much<00:03:19.139> smaller

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
you see the bezel because much smaller

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.770 
you see the bezel because much smaller
it<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:20.069> smaller<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.819> it<00:03:21.269> does<00:03:21.510> do<00:03:21.750> a

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
it is that smaller so it does do a

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.569 
it is that smaller so it does do a
little<00:03:22.019> margin<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.680> how<00:03:22.739> much<00:03:22.919> smaller<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.489> is

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
little margin of how much smaller it is

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
for sure on that and if i set this

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.030 
for sure on that and if i set this
little<00:03:27.000> thing<00:03:27.209> there<00:03:27.419> you<00:03:27.690> see<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:28.829> actually

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
little thing there you see it actually

hits and it's way lower full brightness
and<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:33.569> supposed<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.900> be<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.079> lot<00:03:34.500> brighter

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
and this supposed to be a lot brighter

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.250
