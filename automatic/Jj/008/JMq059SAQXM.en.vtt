00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
together to set prices high so they can

can confess to the crime this means that

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.030 
can confess to the crime this means that
there's<00:02:16.540> only<00:02:16.660> four<00:02:16.989> possible<00:02:17.470> outcomes<00:02:17.920> that

there's only four possible outcomes that

there's only four possible outcomes that

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
can occur if they both deny there's

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.170 
can occur if they both deny there's
enough<00:02:20.290> evidence<00:02:20.470> put<00:02:21.040> them<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.280> jail<00:02:21.459> for<00:02:21.730> 10

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
years each when reading these things the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.789 
the numbers on the right our prisoner 2
I<00:02:28.329> color-coded<00:02:29.230> them<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.440> help<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.709> better

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
I color-coded them to help you better

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.130 
I color-coded them to help you better
see<00:02:30.099> this<00:02:30.280> if<00:02:30.519> they<00:02:31.000> both<00:02:31.239> confess<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.019> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
see this if they both confess to the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.780 
see this if they both confess to the
crime<00:02:32.380> they're<00:02:32.860> both<00:02:33.099> going<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.400> go<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.549> jail

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
crime they're both going to go to jail

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.900 
crime they're both going to go to jail
for<00:02:34.090> 20<00:02:34.269> years<00:02:34.660> but<00:02:35.290> if<00:02:35.560> prisoner<00:02:36.099> 1<00:02:36.310> confesses

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
for 20 years but if prisoner 1 confesses

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.750 
for 20 years but if prisoner 1 confesses
and<00:02:37.060> prisoner<00:02:37.810> 2<00:02:37.989> denies<00:02:38.440> prisoner<00:02:39.370> 1<00:02:39.549> is

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
and prisoner 2 denies prisoner 1 is

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.460 
and prisoner 2 denies prisoner 1 is
basically<00:02:40.030> going<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.239> rat<00:02:40.480> out<00:02:40.510> prisoner<00:02:41.290> 2

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
basically going to rat out prisoner 2

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.470 
basically going to rat out prisoner 2
and<00:02:41.739> so<00:02:42.130> prisoner<00:02:42.519> 1<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.880> going<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.060> go<00:02:43.180> free

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
and so prisoner 1 is going to go free

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.599 
and so prisoner 1 is going to go free
and<00:02:43.720> prisoner<00:02:44.500> 2<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.950> going<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.190> go<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.370> jail

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
and prisoner 2 is going to go to jail

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.240 
and prisoner 2 is going to go to jail
for<00:02:45.850> 30<00:02:46.120> years<00:02:46.510> now<00:02:46.870> over<00:02:47.140> here<00:02:47.170> if<00:02:47.590> prisoner<00:02:48.040> 1

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
for 30 years now over here if prisoner 1

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.240 
for 30 years now over here if prisoner 1
denies<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.180> prisoner<00:02:49.630> 2<00:02:49.840> confesses<00:02:50.440> prisoner

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
denies and prisoner 2 confesses prisoner

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.270 
denies and prisoner 2 confesses prisoner
2<00:02:51.459> goes<00:02:51.850> home<00:02:52.090> free<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.630> prisoner<00:02:53.440> 1<00:02:53.709> goes<00:02:54.160> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
2 goes home free and prisoner 1 goes to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.099 
2 goes home free and prisoner 1 goes to
jail<00:02:54.459> for<00:02:54.730> 30<00:02:54.940> years<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:55.540> what<00:02:55.870> are<00:02:55.959> they<00:02:56.019> going

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
jail for 30 years so what are they going

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.440 
jail for 30 years so what are they going
to<00:02:56.200> choose<00:02:56.410> well<00:02:57.100> that's<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.819> point<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.209> game

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
to choose well that's the point of game

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.330 
to choose well that's the point of game
theory<00:02:58.690> before<00:02:59.139> you<00:02:59.470> can<00:02:59.590> make<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.739> choice<00:03:00.010> you

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
theory before you can make a choice you

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.650 
theory before you can make a choice you
have<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.549> keep<00:03:00.700> in<00:03:00.910> mind<00:03:01.150> what<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.450> other

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
have to keep in mind what the other

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.180 
have to keep in mind what the other
person's<00:03:01.989> going<00:03:02.109> to<00:03:02.200> do<00:03:02.319> now<00:03:02.620> this<00:03:02.769> is<00:03:02.889> a<00:03:02.920> good

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
person's going to do now this is a good

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.920 
person's going to do now this is a good
way<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.370> introduce<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:04.090> idea<00:03:04.359> of<00:03:04.420> game<00:03:04.660> theory

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
way to introduce the idea of game theory

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.750 
way to introduce the idea of game theory
but<00:03:05.380> let's<00:03:05.620> look<00:03:05.739> at<00:03:05.829> a<00:03:05.859> better<00:03:06.100> example<00:03:06.430> that

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
but let's look at a better example that

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.910

you can read the chart let's talk about
something<00:04:56.990> called<00:04:57.229> a<00:04:57.470> dominant<00:04:57.979> strategy<00:04:58.460> if

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
something called a dominant strategy if

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
you have a dominant strategy that means

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.110

what<00:05:02.510> in<00:05:02.690> other<00:05:02.810> words<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.380> doesn't<00:05:03.620> matter

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
what in other words it doesn't matter

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.050 
what in other words it doesn't matter
what<00:05:04.099> the<00:05:04.159> other<00:05:04.190> person<00:05:04.580> does<00:05:04.729> you<00:05:05.030> should

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
what the other person does you should

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.210 
what the other person does you should
definitely<00:05:05.690> choose<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:06.139> option<00:05:06.409> so<00:05:07.010> let's

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
definitely choose that option so let's

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.000 
definitely choose that option so let's
see<00:05:07.490> if<00:05:07.729> DC<00:05:08.030> has<00:05:08.510> a<00:05:08.539> dominant<00:05:09.020> strategy<00:05:09.500> now<00:05:09.770> if

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010

if Marvel chooses the Mandarin again DC
would<00:05:26.630> choose<00:05:26.900> to<00:05:27.080> do<00:05:27.169> a<00:05:27.199> comic<00:05:27.530> book<00:05:27.680> about

the Joker that means that that option is

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.870 
the Joker that means that that option is
their<00:05:30.320> dominant<00:05:30.889> strategy<00:05:31.370> with<00:05:31.639> these

their dominant strategy with these

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.490 
their dominant strategy with these
numbers<00:05:32.270> there's<00:05:32.510> no<00:05:32.690> reason<00:05:33.080> for<00:05:33.110> them<00:05:33.320> ever

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
numbers there's no reason for them ever

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.589 
numbers there's no reason for them ever
to<00:05:33.620> make<00:05:33.740> a<00:05:33.770> comic<00:05:34.130> book<00:05:34.280> about<00:05:34.460> Alfred<00:05:34.909> sorry

and getting $300 they would choose the

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.930 
and getting $300 they would choose the
Mandarin<00:06:00.139> so<00:06:00.469> depending<00:06:00.919> on<00:06:01.010> what<00:06:01.159> DC<00:06:01.610> to

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
Mandarin so depending on what DC to

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.570 
Mandarin so depending on what DC to
is<00:06:02.150> marvel<00:06:02.960> might<00:06:03.200> choose<00:06:03.530> Jarvis<00:06:04.040> or<00:06:04.220> they

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
is marvel might choose Jarvis or they

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.640 
is marvel might choose Jarvis or they
might<00:06:04.820> choose<00:06:05.030> the<00:06:05.240> Mandarin<00:06:05.660> this<00:06:06.320> means

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
might choose the Mandarin this means

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.220 
might choose the Mandarin this means
they<00:06:06.830> do<00:06:06.890> not<00:06:07.040> have<00:06:07.670> a<00:06:07.940> dominant<00:06:08.510> strategy<00:06:08.630> now

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
they do not have a dominant strategy now

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.080 
they do not have a dominant strategy now
if<00:06:09.320> this<00:06:09.440> was<00:06:09.710> realistic<00:06:10.130> and<00:06:10.460> the<00:06:10.580> firms<00:06:10.820> did

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
if this was realistic and the firms did

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.390 
if this was realistic and the firms did
have<00:06:11.270> all<00:06:11.540> this<00:06:11.780> perfect<00:06:12.200> information<00:06:12.440> where

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
have all this perfect information where

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.580 
have all this perfect information where
were<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.640> firm's<00:06:13.910> end<00:06:14.120> up<00:06:14.300> well<00:06:14.780> DC<00:06:15.500> would

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
were the firm's end up well DC would

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.110 
were the firm's end up well DC would
obviously<00:06:15.860> choose<00:06:16.190> the<00:06:16.430> Joker<00:06:16.700> because

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
obviously choose the Joker because

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.780 
obviously choose the Joker because
that's<00:06:17.300> their<00:06:17.510> dominant<00:06:17.930> strategy<00:06:18.320> and

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
that's their dominant strategy and

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.920 
that's their dominant strategy and
Marvel<00:06:19.790> would<00:06:19.910> choose<00:06:20.180> to<00:06:20.270> do<00:06:20.390> the<00:06:20.510> Mandarin

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
Marvel would choose to do the Mandarin

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
Marvel would choose to do the Mandarin
because<00:06:21.080> that<00:06:21.380> will<00:06:21.530> give<00:06:21.650> them<00:06:21.710> the<00:06:21.800> most

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
because that will give them the most

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.040 
because that will give them the most
profit<00:06:22.400> this<00:06:22.820> is<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.180> idea<00:06:23.540> of<00:06:23.750> something

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
profit this is the idea of something

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.470 
profit this is the idea of something
called<00:06:24.380> a<00:06:24.560> Nash<00:06:24.890> equilibrium<00:06:25.150> it's<00:06:26.150> the<00:06:26.330> end

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
called a Nash equilibrium it's the end

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.240 
called a Nash equilibrium it's the end
result<00:06:26.870> there<00:06:26.990> will<00:06:27.110> be<00:06:27.140> at<00:06:27.470> when<00:06:27.740> each<00:06:27.950> firm

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
result there will be at when each firm

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.980 
result there will be at when each firm
makes<00:06:28.580> choices<00:06:28.880> to<00:06:29.240> maximize<00:06:29.720> their<00:06:29.960> own

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
makes choices to maximize their own

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.350 
makes choices to maximize their own
profit<00:06:30.560> but<00:06:30.980> also<00:06:31.040> keeps<00:06:31.730> in<00:06:31.880> mind<00:06:31.910> what<00:06:32.270> the

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
profit but also keeps in mind what the

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.330 
profit but also keeps in mind what the
other<00:06:32.540> firm<00:06:32.870> is<00:06:32.900> going<00:06:33.170> to<00:06:33.230> do<00:06:33.380> reading<00:06:34.070> a<00:06:34.130> game

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
other firm is going to do reading a game

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.100 
other firm is going to do reading a game
theory<00:06:34.610> matrix<00:06:35.030> and<00:06:35.210> finding<00:06:35.630> the<00:06:35.750> different

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
theory matrix and finding the different

theory matrix and finding the different
dominant<00:06:36.560> strategies<00:06:36.980> will<00:06:37.220> take<00:06:37.430> time<00:06:37.700> and

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
dominant strategies will take time and

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.060 
dominant strategies will take time and
practice<00:06:38.240> so<00:06:38.900> be<00:06:39.080> patient<00:06:39.590> dominus

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
practice so be patient dominus

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.480 
practice so be patient dominus
strategies<00:06:40.430> are<00:06:40.550> not<00:06:40.670> that<00:06:40.880> hard<00:06:41.000> to<00:06:41.120> find

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
strategies are not that hard to find

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.890 
strategies are not that hard to find
seriously<00:06:43.490> just<00:06:43.670> calm<00:06:43.910> down<00:06:43.940> look<00:06:44.690> at<00:06:44.780> the

seriously just calm down look at the
game<00:06:45.050> 3<00:06:45.290> matrix<00:06:45.680> and<00:06:45.770> you'll<00:06:45.950> figure<00:06:46.130> it<00:06:46.250> out

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
game 3 matrix and you'll figure it out

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.730 
game 3 matrix and you'll figure it out
seriously<00:06:48.320> dude<00:06:48.470> just<00:06:48.620> relax<00:06:49.990> we<00:06:50.990> are<00:06:51.290> going
