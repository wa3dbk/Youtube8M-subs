00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.970
 hello how 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.990
 I am are one again today I bring you in this meeting a richer review 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.169
 as if from one 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.429
 the ETA have brought two of the most popular transformations of the time 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.919
 after the season g1 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.679
 where we can see now are dureta 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.089
 that is here 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.669
 and also to 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.050
 shaun plaza 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.180
 buenos aires 11 na precedes acquisitions both 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.819
 both are from the collection attack 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.449
 that opened 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.480
 and that you can really like I mentioned to you on other occasions of the best 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.340
 of the best reviews that have gone even better than the review 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.740
 It is incorrect 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.700
 and then here we have these two 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.470
 really is the same figure really just want to paint in this case yes 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.280
 changes 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.060
 what should be 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.720
 in the case to store the landlords 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.770
 since as we can see in the case of fonplata implode becatoros the 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.950
 they could notice 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.380
 this data also has the capacity to have two houses of the place only 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.250
 one as it commonly happened as 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.040
 Good güell consonant, this one on this occasion, let's see what it is 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.970
 slow the way we're going to do a review of one practically for 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.530
 what 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.549
 let's see then it has a king shaka that supposedly is like paying its been 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.830
 decrease the volume 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.890
 the ajaccio come back but well it does not really have much use because it's not 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.500
 electronic or nothing 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.570
 and also by box office to the sides game of bioware 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.750
 the teresitas 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.330
 that the one that serves to 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.609
 how to pay it 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:29.910
 the recorder 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.910
 and because this is the last and also in this process 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.390
 another thing that we had is that some parts like for example 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.870
 weapons weight 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.829
 they came here 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.969
 in 1 glass pepper as if it were a really good spiral that of your block 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.390
 that appear to be 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.500
 and what is it that the recorder take because that's what they represent 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.380
 and here I do not see why we have a stack 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.550
 and then this one should 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.310
 despite the tone they brought to the back and it was as part of their 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.090
 in its mechanical conformation and even 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.730
 in case we wanted to take it everywhere I had to 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.799
 a small clip that we can put our pants to take us 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.709
 because it can be really is a recorder 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.320
 and has most of the 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.539
 the accessories 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.319
 that a recorder 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.099
 ordinary good has 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.069
 what I never liked about the caricature is that it suddenly appeared 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.180
 the size as I'm holding it and today and suddenly it was bigger than ever and 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.599
 other transports 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.680
 largest or in one of the 25 small inheritances of 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.529
 what it is 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.229
 the entity first generation but then 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:38.929
 the part its magic 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:42.499
 good has been conceived we are going to conform we are going to transform what 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.239
 I know is that they are good 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.759
 cypress as I told you previously the time honduras tepetlán that transformation 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.599
 but can continue 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.859
 to some extent extra ticking to which he charged that there was something 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:55.959
 the more possible 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.649
 differences between these two figures 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:01.739
 but I hope they are always a pretext to have the tics 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.369
 and have a little more variety of our collection 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:10.299
 the difference of the two missiles is that this missile is practically 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.799
 that we can see that this circuit around 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.999
 this Friday and it may be that he's always going fifth 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.379
 and the other we would have and we could 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.409
 put them a 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.149
 your missile 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:25.449
 comes down 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.219
 of xuanwei 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:29.599
 and then it was done we have shapes 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.989
 in how can you see I'm not considering or putting in this review 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.879
 between the cases that accompanied these decisions actually 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:43.069
 percent the case transformer that they brought in this case these blasted has 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.089
 demonstrated 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.769
 basagoiti 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.079
 abás 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.939
 which are models are the best known 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.779
 i the case of him 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:54.199
 sowell to reelection 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.199
 each collection the idea of ​​what is happy 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:01.559
 storl brought one that was inserted 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.519
 and then I do not put it because doorman mentioned the revision of all 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:05.229
 cassettes 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:06.879
 what do I have 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.929
 and then there I will introduce you 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:11.389
 the parties that were going 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.599
 with this transport 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.549
 ikeda fundamental part of 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.539
 all the roads that accepted and attracted alekhine from wheelbarrows that 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:21.599
 they went well 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:22.819
 and is that he is reading 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.659
 let's hope that encore 19 already brought us 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:30.569
 By blind protests of Cáceres to complete the house collection assured 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.229
 and then here by government 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.219
 aa the two defectors 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:36.770
 they are excellent pieces, I really like it a lot 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.169
 neither transformed like 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.559
 as expected, love 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.249
 and they are excellent nash 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:46.229
 and I recommend it a lot 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.379
 I hope you liked it until villeta video review 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.960

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.020
 blue suit took I got you all
