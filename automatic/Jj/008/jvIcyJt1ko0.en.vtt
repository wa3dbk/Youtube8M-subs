 Good Morning 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.520
 I have the pleasure of presenting you with the following processes for the elaboration 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.600
 of the fermented orders the inegi the highest 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.960
 in the first instance we will talk about the highest a drink made from the 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.300
 corn 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.860
 its preparation in the udc center region located north of colombia starts 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.780
 with the corn harvest 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.670
 later the ear is shelled and then the grains are crushed in a 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.400
 reef 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.070
 this is cooked and then they move and the dough is poured into banana leaves 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.000
 they are tied and then raised to the fire 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.300
 After a while it is removed from the fire and we go to crush it again 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.700
 then we let it cool 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.890
 When this is added at a considerable temperature, a liquid composed of 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.070
 sweet potato and born 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.140
 The function of the sweet potato is to cut or increase the viscosity of the drink and the 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.500
 born consists of germinated corn that has been ground and cooked 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.290
 then it is stored and left to rest for a day 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.290
 with this we will have a drink ready to consume 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.320
 another fermented drink that is made inside the zenú ethnic group for the 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.530
 consumption that its members make in meetings and celebrations 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.180
 religious is the day that 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.640
 its components are sugar water and yeast 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.320
 the components are mixed according to the proportions that are made 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.490
 depending on the amount of people you want to prepare 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.750
 the mixture is prepared in fermentation boilers 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.090
 after a time about a month is filtered and subjected to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.650
 heating until the vapors pass through a zacatín 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.550
 the zacatín consists of a rudimentary distillate through which the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.530
 vapors that then condense and reach a storage tank 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.390
 the product obtained is a rectified rondo that the descendants of the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.459
 zenú ethnicity called enrique 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.220
 We thank the friends of the tuchín community in the department 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.840
 of Córdoba and the tutor marco tulio rodríguez for orientation
