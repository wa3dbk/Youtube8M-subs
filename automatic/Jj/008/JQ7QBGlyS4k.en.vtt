you<00:03:02.390> want<00:03:02.569> to<00:03:02.630> make<00:03:02.720> an<00:03:02.840> offensive<00:03:03.290> with<00:03:03.500> tanks

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
you want to make an offensive with tanks

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.940 
you want to make an offensive with tanks
have<00:03:05.000> also<00:03:05.330> some<00:03:05.569> artillery<00:03:05.930> unit<00:03:06.410> in<00:03:06.680> order

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
have also some artillery unit in order

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.160 
have also some artillery unit in order
to<00:03:07.100> destroy<00:03:07.430> those<00:03:07.670> units<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.660> doesn't<00:03:08.989> have

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
to destroy those units that doesn't have

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:18.130 
to destroy those units that doesn't have
any<00:03:09.290> armor<00:03:10.190> on<00:03:10.430> them

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.760 

but<00:03:18.920> also<00:03:19.270> an<00:03:20.270> issue<00:03:20.450> acts<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:20.960> each<00:03:21.170> factions

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
but also an issue acts in each factions

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.580 
but also an issue acts in each factions
what<00:03:22.160> you<00:03:22.280> will<00:03:22.430> find<00:03:22.459> is<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:24.140> have<00:03:24.380> a

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
what you will find is that you have a

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.930 
what you will find is that you have a
different<00:03:24.830> way<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:27.400> unit<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:28.700> can

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
different way of unit that you can

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.680 
different way of unit that you can
produce<00:03:30.069> in<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.250> different<00:03:31.580> categories<00:03:31.700> for

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
produce in the different categories for

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.350 
produce in the different categories for
example<00:03:33.200> in<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:34.040> French<00:03:34.310> faction<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:35.240> will

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
example in the French faction you will

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.080 
example in the French faction you will
be<00:03:35.510> able<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.930> produce<00:03:36.110> some<00:03:36.500> tanks<00:03:37.340> in<00:03:37.550> the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
be able to produce some tanks in the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.050 
be able to produce some tanks in the
barracks<00:03:38.390> while<00:03:39.260> which<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.590> well<00:03:40.340> it<00:03:40.580> will<00:03:40.790> not

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
barracks while which is well it will not

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.660 
barracks while which is well it will not
be<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.330> case<00:03:41.510> for<00:03:41.570> example<00:03:41.870> for<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:43.070> US<00:03:43.400> will

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
be the case for example for the US will

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.200 
be the case for example for the US will
only<00:03:43.910> have<00:03:44.209> infantry<00:03:44.750> units

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.930 

so<00:03:50.800> master<00:03:51.800> raising<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.280> factions<00:03:52.730> is

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
so master raising the factions is

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.840 
so master raising the factions is
knowing<00:03:53.750> exactly<00:03:54.050> what<00:03:54.950> are<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.400> asset<00:03:55.820> that

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
knowing exactly what are the asset that

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.620 
knowing exactly what are the asset that
you<00:03:56.150> have<00:03:56.360> but<00:03:56.660> also<00:03:56.950> without<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.220> flows<00:03:59.030> that

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
you have but also without the flows that

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.960 
you have but also without the flows that
the<00:03:59.750> nation<00:04:00.080> has<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:01.190> from<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.550> start<00:04:01.820> you

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
the nation has so from the start you

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.270 
the nation has so from the start you
have<00:04:02.150> different<00:04:02.480> strategies<00:04:03.470> depending<00:04:03.890> on

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
have different strategies depending on

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.890 
have different strategies depending on
the<00:04:04.400> faction<00:04:04.760> some<00:04:05.060> are<00:04:05.180> more<00:04:05.330> powerful<00:04:05.570> in

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
the faction some are more powerful in

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.680 
the faction some are more powerful in
one<00:04:06.320> field<00:04:06.530> in<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:06.890> start<00:04:07.160> some<00:04:07.400> others

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
one field in the start some others

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.810 
one field in the start some others
exactly<00:04:08.690> okay<00:04:09.380> I<00:04:09.590> suppose<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.430> have<00:04:10.580> played

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
exactly okay I suppose you have played

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.360 
exactly okay I suppose you have played
multiple<00:04:11.120> matches<00:04:11.480> even<00:04:12.080> in<00:04:12.410> teams<00:04:12.710> possibly

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
multiple matches even in teams possibly

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.850 
multiple matches even in teams possibly
but<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.420> game<00:04:14.600> also<00:04:14.630> incorporates<00:04:15.410> lots<00:04:15.710> of

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
but the game also incorporates lots of

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.289 
but the game also incorporates lots of
options<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.609> change<00:04:16.790> your<00:04:17.000> multiplayer

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
options to change your multiplayer

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.050 
options to change your multiplayer
experience<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:18.799> Alexi<00:04:19.340> can<00:04:19.519> you<00:04:19.609> explain<00:04:19.850> what

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
experience so Alexi can you explain what

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.699 
experience so Alexi can you explain what
are<00:04:20.269> these<00:04:20.420> options<00:04:20.930> on<00:04:21.080> how<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:21.260> can<00:04:21.530> make<00:04:21.650> a

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
are these options on how you can make a

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.070 
are these options on how you can make a
different<00:04:22.100> experience<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:23.720> have<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:23.870> lot<00:04:24.050> of

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
different experience you have a lot of

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.590 
different experience you have a lot of
options<00:04:24.530> but<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.310> most<00:04:25.460> important<00:04:26.210> options

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
options but the most important options

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.580 
options but the most important options
you<00:04:26.750> have<00:04:26.780> is<00:04:27.290> by<00:04:27.860> selecting<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:29.510> time<00:04:29.990> of<00:04:30.230> the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
you have is by selecting the time of the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.430 
you have is by selecting the time of the
battle<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:31.550> can<00:04:31.790> play<00:04:31.970> a<00:04:32.000> match<00:04:32.240> in<00:04:32.600> 1939

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
battle so you can play a match in 1939

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.800 
battle so you can play a match in 1939
or<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:34.160> match<00:04:34.340> in<00:04:34.610> nineteen<00:04:35.090> forty<00:04:35.390> nine<00:04:35.420> to

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
or a match in nineteen forty nine to

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.620 
or a match in nineteen forty nine to
nineteen<00:04:36.050> forty-two<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:38.180> classical

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
nineteen forty-two and the classical

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.540 
nineteen forty-two and the classical
match<00:04:38.840> where<00:04:39.200> you<00:04:39.320> have<00:04:39.500> units<00:04:40.010> from<00:04:40.190> nineteen

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
match where you have units from nineteen

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.430 
match where you have units from nineteen
thirty<00:04:40.730> nine<00:04:40.790> to<00:04:41.150> nineteen<00:04:41.330> forty-five<00:04:41.900> each

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
thirty nine to nineteen forty-five each

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.790 
thirty nine to nineteen forty-five each
of<00:04:42.800> this<00:04:42.950> time<00:04:43.940> period<00:04:44.150> will<00:04:44.690> allow<00:04:45.290> you<00:04:45.350> or

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
of this time period will allow you or

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.480 
of this time period will allow you or
prevent<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.430> from<00:04:47.230> making<00:04:48.230> research<00:04:48.830> for<00:04:49.310> new

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
prevent you from making research for new

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.090 
prevent you from making research for new
units<00:04:49.990> for<00:04:50.990> example<00:04:51.410> when<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:51.710> will<00:04:51.860> play

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
units for example when you will play

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.260 
units for example when you will play
1939<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.450> will<00:04:53.600> have<00:04:53.780> no<00:04:54.200> research<00:04:54.650> available

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
1939 you will have no research available

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.590 
1939 you will have no research available
which<00:04:56.270> means<00:04:56.510> you<00:04:56.720> will<00:04:56.870> have<00:04:56.900> very<00:04:57.460> short

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
which means you will have very short

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.290 
which means you will have very short
amount<00:04:59.600> of<00:04:59.930> you<00:05:00.050> need<00:05:00.230> to<00:05:00.380> play<00:05:00.530> with

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.880 

so<00:05:06.300> basically<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:06.840> can<00:05:06.990> have<00:05:07.110> a<00:05:07.140> completely

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
so basically you can have a completely

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.860 
so basically you can have a completely
different<00:05:08.280> experience<00:05:08.400> while<00:05:09.360> trying<00:05:09.660> a

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
different experience while trying a

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.110 
different experience while trying a
faction<00:05:10.320> in<00:05:10.440> 1939<00:05:11.190> as<00:05:11.370> opposed<00:05:11.640> to<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:11.880> full

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
faction in 1939 as opposed to the full

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.080 
faction in 1939 as opposed to the full
time<00:05:12.900> period<00:05:13.200> exactly<00:05:13.890> and<00:05:14.070> that's<00:05:14.250> that<00:05:14.940> is

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
time period exactly and that's that is

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.450 
time period exactly and that's that is
it<00:05:15.270> that<00:05:15.600> is<00:05:15.630> why<00:05:16.110> it's<00:05:16.380> interesting<00:05:16.950> to<00:05:17.310> give

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
it that is why it's interesting to give

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.090 
it that is why it's interesting to give
those<00:05:17.670> three<00:05:18.000> different<00:05:18.960> time<00:05:19.140> period<00:05:19.530> the

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
those three different time period the

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.700 
those three different time period the
second<00:05:20.430> point<00:05:20.610> is<00:05:20.840> you<00:05:21.840> can<00:05:22.080> select<00:05:22.470> the

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
second point is you can select the
