00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
problem is is that you have intonation

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.100 
problem is is that you have intonation
issues<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:35.180> it's<00:01:35.330> fine<00:01:35.540> if<00:01:35.720> you're<00:01:35.869> playing

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
issues so it's fine if you're playing

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.469 
issues so it's fine if you're playing
just<00:01:36.680> your<00:01:36.830> normal<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.550> know<00:01:37.610> first<00:01:37.940> position

just your normal you know first position

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.450 
just your normal you know first position
chords<00:01:38.930> but<00:01:39.440> anytime<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:39.860> start<00:01:40.070> moving<00:01:40.190> up

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
chords but anytime you start moving up

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.550 
chords but anytime you start moving up
the<00:01:40.610> neck<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.450> have<00:01:41.720> out<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.229> tune

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560

the neck you you have out of tune
problems<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:44.180> guitar<00:01:44.509> is<00:01:44.660> embraced

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
problems and the guitar is embraced

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.109 
problems and the guitar is embraced
light<00:01:45.350> enough<00:01:45.680> so<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:46.340> lot<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.670> times<00:01:46.880> they're

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
light enough so a lot of times they're

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.940 
light enough so a lot of times they're
really<00:01:47.330> soft<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:48.050> they<00:01:48.200> don't<00:01:48.380> sound<00:01:48.560> quite

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
really soft and they don't sound quite

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.999 
really soft and they don't sound quite
as<00:01:48.979> good<00:01:49.600> when<00:01:50.600> when<00:01:51.140> Wagner<00:01:51.500> came<00:01:51.710> out<00:01:51.860> with

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
as good when when Wagner came out with

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.620 
as good when when Wagner came out with
this<00:01:52.100> what<00:01:52.310> they<00:01:52.429> really<00:01:52.850> designed<00:01:53.210> this<00:01:53.420> for

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
this what they really designed this for

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.529 
this what they really designed this for
is<00:01:53.929> specifically<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:55.039> kind<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.369> tuning<00:01:55.640> so

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
is specifically this kind of tuning so

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:57.930 
is specifically this kind of tuning so
you<00:01:56.600> have<00:01:57.080> a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
you have a

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.020 
you have a

so<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.090> have<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.600> that<00:02:01.869> same<00:02:02.380> same<00:02:03.189> tuning

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
so you have that that same same tuning

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.429 
so you have that that same same tuning
as<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:03.820> standard<00:02:04.240> guitar<00:02:04.390> but<00:02:04.960> those<00:02:05.140> higher

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
as a standard guitar but those higher

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.040 
as a standard guitar but those higher
registers<00:02:06.090> Dave<00:02:07.090> once<00:02:07.360> you<00:02:07.450> just<00:02:07.630> play<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.810> G

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
registers Dave once you just play a G

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.740 
registers Dave once you just play a G
chord<00:02:08.080> give<00:02:08.619> them<00:02:08.739> an<00:02:08.830> idea

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
chord give them an idea

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.380 
chord give them an idea
so<00:02:10.750> that's<00:02:10.959> your<00:02:11.140> standard<00:02:11.500> G<00:02:12.340> chord<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.940> with

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
so that's your standard G chord and with

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.570 
so that's your standard G chord and with
one<00:02:13.599> of<00:02:13.720> these<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.690> have<00:02:17.019> that<00:02:17.580> that

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
one of these so you have that that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.820 
one of these so you have that that
really<00:02:19.180> nice<00:02:19.360> compliment<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.230> six<00:02:20.560> string

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830
