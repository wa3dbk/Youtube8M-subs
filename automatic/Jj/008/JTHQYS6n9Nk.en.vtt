00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.370
 So if you got that out of the closet 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.910
 take out 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.840
 then it is the same with us now 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.700
 to judge again 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:23.160
 release the button and the round shield 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:28.279
 then really on the table and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.949
 take the left side and fold it 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.020
 over the sign over to the 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.140
 opposite so diagonally then 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.679
 Take the other side and do it 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:46.670
 exactly the same so then we only have 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:49.620
 Here we are from birth 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:54.719
 then almost like at the beginning 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:00.199
 is there and now you have to that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.119
 Knobloch finds and make the button 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:07.190
 so then in the test best here in the 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:11.930
 corner surgeons a bit and 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:18.750
 done so now go to wear 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:23.250
 that's best for that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.710
 the seam shows to him then they go along 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.100
 hands on each side of the button 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.130
 once through and grasp that here around how 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.660
 a collar 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:44.610
 Now you go through the head here 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:46.740
 directed by and then measure precisely 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.480
 Here someone can help them or 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.260
 they make the mirror work 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.260
 you're fine with me 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.070
 then they have to be spotted behind 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:11.430
 look best over the shoulders 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:13.970
 Again I just wanted dogs and 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.970
 from the front
