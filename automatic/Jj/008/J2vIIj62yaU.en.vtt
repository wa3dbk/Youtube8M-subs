yeah and he went to a John David Jackson

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.839 
yeah and he went to a John David Jackson
so<00:05:53.650> only<00:05:53.830> so<00:05:54.220> on<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:54.520> so<00:05:54.639> on

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
so only so on and so on

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.180 
so only so on and so on
you<00:05:55.780> know<00:05:56.669> you<00:05:57.669> know<00:05:58.110> but<00:05:59.110> but<00:05:59.590> I<00:05:59.620> think<00:05:59.979> I

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
you know you know but but I think I

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.070 
you know you know but but I think I
think<00:06:00.490> agent<00:06:00.760> Brona<00:06:01.150> situation<00:06:01.720> is<00:06:01.840> more

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
think agent Brona situation is more

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.050 
think agent Brona situation is more
deeper<00:06:02.380> than<00:06:02.530> the<00:06:02.590> training<00:06:02.979> though<00:06:03.070> I<00:06:03.430> think

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
deeper than the training though I think

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.719 
deeper than the training though I think
it's<00:06:04.360> more<00:06:04.510> spirit<00:06:05.080> I<00:06:05.320> think<00:06:05.860> I<00:06:06.130> think<00:06:06.490> the

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
it's more spirit I think I think the

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.410 
it's more spirit I think I think the
Train<00:06:07.000> of<00:06:07.030> all<00:06:07.300> the<00:06:07.450> training
