your secondary colored LED and then you

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.330 
your secondary colored LED and then you
also<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.430> these<00:01:23.610> two<00:01:24.170> auxiliary<00:01:25.170> LEDs<00:01:25.979> on

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
also have these two auxiliary LEDs on

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.469 
also have these two auxiliary LEDs on
the<00:01:26.400> end<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.880> I'll<00:01:26.970> show<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.360> all<00:01:27.450> of

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the end and I'll show you what all of

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.060 
the end and I'll show you what all of
those<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.900> here<00:01:28.590> I'll<00:01:28.740> throw<00:01:28.770> 18<00:01:29.400> 650<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:34.070> so

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
those do here I'll throw 18 650 in so

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.460 
those do here I'll throw 18 650 in so
use<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.579> tail<00:01:36.060> cap<00:01:36.329> switch<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.049> tail<00:01:37.200> switch

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
use the tail cap switch the tail switch

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.609 
use the tail cap switch the tail switch
to<00:01:37.710> power<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:40.079> got<00:01:40.290> our<00:01:40.409> white

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
to power it on and that's got our white

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.039 
to power it on and that's got our white
LED<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.520> we've<00:01:41.670> got<00:01:41.820> two<00:01:42.090> side<00:01:42.450> switches

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
LED here so we've got two side switches

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.270 
LED here so we've got two side switches
one<00:01:43.259> says<00:01:43.500> white<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.520> says<00:01:44.790> color<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.040> pop

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
one says white one says color so you pop

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.090 
one says white one says color so you pop
it<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.759> white<00:01:47.939> side<00:01:48.840> switch<00:01:49.140> will<00:01:49.409> cycle

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
it on the white side switch will cycle

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.959 
it on the white side switch will cycle
through<00:01:50.310> modes<00:01:50.990> low<00:01:53.299> medium<00:01:54.299> high<00:01:54.840> turbo<00:01:55.969> up

switch this color side switch press
to<00:02:12.409> get<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.830> your<00:02:13.180> blue<00:02:14.180> LED<00:02:14.780> mode<00:02:14.989> so<00:02:15.650> you'll

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
to get to your blue LED mode so you'll

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.580 
to get to your blue LED mode so you'll
see<00:02:16.580> if<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.730> can<00:02:16.879> see<00:02:17.290> that's<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:19.129> other<00:02:20.590> big

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
see if you can see that's the other big

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.160 
see if you can see that's the other big
LEDs<00:02:22.310> between<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> two<00:02:23.269> big<00:02:23.510> LEDs<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.049> then

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
LEDs between the two big LEDs and then

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.550 
LEDs between the two big LEDs and then
I'll<00:02:24.290> switch<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.650> white<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.989> can<00:02:27.110> see<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.409> just

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
I'll switch to white you can see it just

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.610 
I'll switch to white you can see it just
kind<00:02:27.769> of<00:02:28.090> bounces<00:02:29.090> back<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.510> forth<00:02:29.720> there<00:02:32.620> so

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
kind of bounces back and forth there so

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.619 
kind of bounces back and forth there so
this<00:02:33.769> is<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.040> blue<00:02:34.640> LED<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:35.090> don't<00:02:35.360> know<00:02:35.450> if<00:02:35.510> the

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
this is the blue LED I don't know if the

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.210 
this is the blue LED I don't know if the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
camera is kind of tinting in a little

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.039 
camera is kind of tinting in a little
bit<00:02:37.370> but<00:02:38.090> there's<00:02:38.299> your<00:02:38.540> blue<00:02:39.110> LED<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.810> that

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
bit but there's your blue LED and that
