00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
 beyond the moment 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.570
 we certainly do not 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.570
 andré santos 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.159
 in one of his best performances 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.299
 there 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:15.279
 - hope not 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.279
 usually appeals to the technical quality that has 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.249
 but we are working more and more 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.249
 read more consensus on positioning 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.039
 yes the player 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.779
 the samba band on the river 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.330
 coping but if you have 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.620
 excited 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.290
 the opponent of the organism 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.720
 played there 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.470
 and so end 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.770
 we understand that he 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.500
 if you keep growing that way 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.740
 one of these details 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.900
 require a little more 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.900
 because playing there on the offensive is great, right? 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.080
 and we 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.420
 at Soccer 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.830
 would be higher 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.610
 You completed the player. 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.640
 I can ball as we're having and a quality player of the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420
 technician andré has to pass this support 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.030
 he will always draw logical attention that scores so many goals comments marking 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.200
 really above average 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.090
 he is very happy and asked me that conclusion was by his granddaughter and kirk 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.510
 you know why 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.900
 lately 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.300
 the attackers on the same line 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.810
 to start on the drive with team offensives 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.740
 in the UN a player more ahead like the majority 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.740
 the team grew in the best game with eight 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.180
 coming a little over 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.180
 they still represent 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.850
 the brand agency are 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.850
 of the opponent with the most easily 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 has more strength 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.109
 the arrival team 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.069
 it's really 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.829
 the question of the globe 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.849
 the present world 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.889
 will need to repeat a little more training for the game 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.249
 do not get used to it anymore 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.359
 look things are working well they worked well 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.319
 very difficult opponents crime that was how much black and bragantino 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.889
 common law as I went forward 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.719
 since the jones games 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.009
 - of the bragantino and even spoke to consider the bragantino 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.009
 momentarily the toughest opponent for the Corinthians 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.790
 collor de mello leaving the bragantino retracted respecting other 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.709
 sale so far 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.239
 I understand that we should and needed the result 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.989
 if I think that in part when dialing 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.510
 this from now on the series b wants the opponents mainly in the pacaembu 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.510
 respect to other teams the corinthians team 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.549
 respected because I like to respect 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:17.230
 in respect to the nursery port you are facing in fist 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.639
 the respect 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.199
 other opponents here and we can not 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.719
 we impose 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.719
 as the team as we are getting in the last games 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.439
 what we're getting to do 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.439
 in the resource it marks more behind 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.759
 the opponent behind 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.499
 that's it 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.649
 I felt nothing says that some issues back also goes for others 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.259
 carla 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.689
 the marcelo came and wanted his 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.689
 he plays himself more offensively he needs the victory 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.809
 just get in the g4 of the breakfast was very good 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:03.319
 so she was also very good for the bragantino who is trying to get in 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.259
 at these hours 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.959
 This is good to forego these issues. 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.209
 just because 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.649
 let's respect the corinthians before the game 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.329
 they have managed for example recently to play with the caetano 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.370
 in the house and do 30 minutes that are caetano could not get out of 

00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:21.090
 back 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.259
 and made 2 to 0 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:24.379
 and you're caetano 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.680
 or goal against peers 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.110
 from Brazil cup 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.279
 the qualified people are not 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.919
 this is circumstance 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.550
 fear that you do well what you set out to do 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.449
 because you can not fit as well as was the first part of the game and 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.520
 had difficulty boarding 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.039
 we move well 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.219
 always left a year late 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:55.650
 This makes it difficult for any team 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.509
 in the interval 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.089
 we talk with some ease
