00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.730
 hello friends with you again vladimir 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.519
 Chaikin we are again in the campaign this time we are in 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.250
 the mountains of northern tien shan and today 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.310
 will be release specifically for lovers 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.070
 survival and similar subjects 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.160
 answer the question that if you are in 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.279
 some difficult situation and you don't have 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.930
 containers to boil water in 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.089
 areas with cold climates from rivers often 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.309
 you can drink boiled water but here 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:39.230
 Kazakhstan is better not to do otherwise 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.010
 you can catch some infection 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.489
 it is better to boil water here well suppose 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.680
 that I turned out to be Kazakhstan and without anything 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.010
 in since i have the only thing that 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.800
 i have this fire fire and what's on 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.360
 I'll put on a few for a start 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.420
 pebbles small pebbles 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.670
 and let them down by accepting a bonfire and leaving them 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.160
 I do not know there to lie there for 40 minutes or better 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.080
 for a whole hour 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.450
 now we get to the water source in 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.840
 our case is a mountain river which 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.910
 It called Zhenishke and from it we chirp him 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.950
 some water and one use your 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.990
 of those so we at the expense of m year 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.020
 of course through the vent holes 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.740
 part of the water is poured out but part of the water and 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.290
 remains 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.000
 Well, here is such a water level in principle 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.070
 stays in my cap after out 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.570
 she leaked excess water through 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.690
 vent now 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.490
 move back to the fire I have an hour 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:43.130
 I threw back some small ones back there. 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.550
 pebbles remove too much this pebble 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.250
 will be good 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.750
 I will use a spoon if you have 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.820
 there is no spoon, just use 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.240
 forked stick or you can either 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.910
 hearts wand take and move 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.160
 cap move cap and gently 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:06.870
 drop there stone you see that 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.870
 around the stone the water starts to boil 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:16.570
 and so we continue to throw another pebble 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.570
 it was cold yet 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:26.459
 this hot will we see that water 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.459
 boils 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.890
 but all 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.890
 our water boils 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.750
 and we get pure boiled water 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.859
 for reliability you need another one like this 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.859
 I'll put it on top 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.530
 but you see that water never stops 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.610
 boil you can so boil some water 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.440
 minutes even for better disinfection but plus 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.340
 another ash from the fire he will 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.040
 additional disinfecting force 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.650
 which will protect your water from all sorts 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.780
 germs and other infections 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.230
 in the same way you can cook yourself 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.370
 some food to cook the mushrooms of the murdered 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.190
 elk 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.100
 I do not know in general, this method is very 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.890
 ancient it was used by the Indians they are not 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.800
 knew iron and did not stretch bison 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.260
 the skin on the poles poured water there 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.570
 threw stones there and cooked like that 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.540
 the meat they mostly cooked the meat 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.770
 grilled like this is such an ancient way 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.810
 can serve us mid in our day but 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.950
 I think explained everything in detail told 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.400
 now show that cap cap like you 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.230
 you see she is not burned 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.970
 iv everything is fine with her 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.919
 fun extreme way 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.460
 boiling water with you was vladimir 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.930
