00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.900
 Good day today I want to introduce more 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.019
 a new product from the company is lucky craft 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.719
 all known by enter only now in 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.199
 the USSR version which means in translation 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.410
 more precisely in deciphering means shala uranium 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.769
 translate this wobbler for melikov it 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.300
 maximum depth is 05 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:34.700
 it weighs 17 grams I took it myself 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.200
 This pike size because the lamprey 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.120
 I have enough of this kind 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.460
 some kind of form attracted me 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.870
 exactly the form if you see it enough 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.230
 thick and fat what form of a shed is not 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.410
 classic lamprey and closer to the shape of the shed 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.969
 wobbler this made it pop up fast 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.280
 and 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.770
 it is very easy to carry it on 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.840
 especially over the thickets of grass is exhausted 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.859
 he, too, in principle, with two three points 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.890
 easy 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.549
 no problems arise add 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.729
 with him when carrying through the grass 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:15.030
 wiring for this wobbler in my opinion 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.180
 better to use with single 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.450
 handles because the wobbler is not strong 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.470
 big troop and movement but here 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.950
 wiggle 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.659
 water it makes at attenuation three or 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.070
 four maybe even 5 so hard 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.400
 count of course so I chose for 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.579
 I consider his postings to be optimal. 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.549
 two three small fisherman and pause 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.350
 or a series of small short jerks 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.649
 it all depends of course on the activity 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.110
 fish and on how overgrown 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.509
 Now I will try to show you the game 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.700
 this wobbler so that you at least about 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.909
 imagined how he behaves but in 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.969
 Overall I like him I think that 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.030
 certain conditions he will play 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.130
 do not leave a decisive role without fish 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.429
 today again got on the breakdown of the weather and 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.950
 so do not know expect bite pike 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.290
 fish is not very active and not yet a 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.200
 not at the depth of bite here sailed in 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.489
 end of the pond to experience this 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.500
 I use the novelty for the first time but 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.319
 hope as I said I lay on her 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.130
 I want to say a little big enough 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.400
 about my future reviews of them i believe that 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.150
 will not always be able to show 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.390
 catching fish for a specific wobbler due to 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.250
 there is no specifics where I catch all the fishing 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.080
 which I ride is labor fishing 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.840
 that is, I do not have unfortunately such 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.610
 places where you can throw a glass cutter 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.819
 even a tube of a drop for the nose and on it 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.209
 will peck mostly i have to 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.519
 look for fish rarely get on 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.239
 good activity but anyway 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:08.200
 I will try to show you how to wobbler 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.720
 tuck one or another fish Well 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.930
 let's try to see how he is 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:20.739
 behaves in the water for this I will throw it 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:26.260
 not very far we will see from this 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:32.459
 will be obtained and so if you can see 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:35.470
 Here is a wobbler quickly enough 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:39.700
 shakes intensely with these makes 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:43.530
 small tacks hand this is now 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.530
 cute and wiggle me personally 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:51.950
 very pleased with the owner that she will please 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:57.080
 not only me but also paradise 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.290
 so let's try again here not 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.290
 highly 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.210
 no these how to shake intensely 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:24.650
 In general, I think a wobbler for melikov just 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:27.380
 the bomb is not sitting with a little say 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.840
 so not a large casting magnetic system 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.020
 the ball rolls wear back 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.830
 so throw him no problems 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.070
 is up 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:46.820
 they are flying very far now you can 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:49.220
 principle check how you see i 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.600
 a little hold that he did not fly away 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:56.390
 too far but casting does not deliver with 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.850
 she has no problems with that 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.160
 I will say goodbye all the information 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.720
 theoretical on wobbler I will give 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.610
 I will continue to experience it 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.640
 accordingly, if someone shares 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.710
 experience of its use is also interesting 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.919
 how does he behave in combat conditions 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.919
 thank you bye
