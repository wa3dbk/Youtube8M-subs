00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
anyway so there's really no point

keeping going with them but he keeps
going<00:02:37.630> thinking<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.019> maybe<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.560> one<00:02:38.769> will

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
going thinking that maybe this one will

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.849 
going thinking that maybe this one will
hit<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.100> big<00:02:39.280> which<00:02:39.549> is<00:02:39.700> stupid<00:02:40.500> that's<00:02:41.500> that's

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
hit it big which is stupid that's that's

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.380 
hit it big which is stupid that's that's
a<00:02:42.040> totally<00:02:42.340> different<00:02:42.640> random<00:02:42.820> ye<00:02:43.180> that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
a totally different random ye that

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.630 
a totally different random ye that
number<00:02:43.690> two<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.620> reason<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.070> number<00:02:45.400> two

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
number two the reason is that number two

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.479 
number two the reason is that number two
is<00:02:45.850> because<00:02:46.209> he<00:02:46.540> did<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.530> let's<00:02:47.799> play<00:02:48.040> video<00:02:48.310> the

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
is because he did a let's play video the

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.470 
is because he did a let's play video the
game<00:02:48.700> he<00:02:48.820> hadn't<00:02:49.150> finished<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:51.250> he<00:02:51.640> also<00:02:51.790> did
