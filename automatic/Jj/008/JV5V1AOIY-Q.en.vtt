00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.030
 we are all well, tuma said that he will talk about the Brazilian team in 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.029
 american cup 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:20.449
 the palm trees wasted another great loss for the Venezuelan 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.869
 Brazil and Paraguay and Brazil and Ecuador 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.390
 I think you understand. 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.349
 but already with the parana 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.589
 how can we keep a part 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.159
 I was afraid to enter or not playing well 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.020
 is that from tomorrow 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.440
 against the Paraguayan again we will play against the Paraguayan 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.710
 the arrival of the first in the first group g 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.720
 It's complicated, right? 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.780
 It's so close to the heart but we got through. 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.340
 after the harsh bid nothing pointing out that the risk of being greatly improved 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.240
 the day today to pick up the Paraguayan team again 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.020
 I wanted them to be verified themselves 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.750
 let's wait for a political decision 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.410
 of the pieces do not have these last three games 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.239
 mainly in the previous year 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.880
 he who in the game against the Paraguayan 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.120
 on the planet the obelisk of the square fun 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.780
 Can I say that Brazil? 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.320
 Brazil is a leader in growth 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.560
 every game 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.910
 the car stolen and will be presented the best 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.030
 so come on what 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.270
 Basque needed 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.850
 of Brazilian television 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.000
 I'll show you the biorhythm we made 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.810
 dark last match of the contract 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.610
 Paraguay lost 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.530
 This is my goal for Paraguay. 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.740
 of the eight matches tied today in 2 to 2 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.360
 note that it is red or 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.100
 the organ that will take milk 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 we are at a negative player pace 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.220
 this was the worst at risk 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.650
 remembered Paraguay 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.440
 on July 9, 2011 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.690
 where level of 2 to 2 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.790
 after the game against the equator york said that we would play better attack 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.940
 the variation 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.770
 of brazil from the equator leaving the team diminished a lot of pride 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.649
 then it means that players 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.789
 she 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.209
 with belletti moment at least average defense weight 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.799
 here you only have to thank 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.619
 I realized that they are Brazil. 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.419
 we take the Olympic legacy 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.879
 stay for the match against the Paraguayan 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.229
 the victim herself every test 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:28.729
 and its pioneering 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.259
 of Brazil 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.309
 against Paraguay for tomorrow's match 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:35.129
 I can help 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.469
 that Brazil 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.479
 win this match 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:41.579
 Brazil has everything to gain in terms of rhythm 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.499
 It will be a good presentation too. 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.399
 I still only want 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.609
 ask the 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.119
 lol to our dear technical hand menezes 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:55.229
 the entry of the cold it grounds the freight is in a condition of the rhythm one 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:56.089
 little 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:00.059
 you can even analyze our website the biorhythms of each player 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:04.519
 during all the competition you go there riquelme not the one of agreement with envy 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.809
 avarice 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.299
 this is the worst of everything 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.319
 Brazil for tomorrow's game 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.699
 I consider 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.659
 What did Brazil win? 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.949
 have a victory over 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.079
 My only fear is seeing 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.539
 up to 15% less 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.159
 critical India 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.449
 when the ti team players for 27 days pt-pi we can do it can 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.089
 do not play well then 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:31.389
 be the first 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.929
 typical of each player in the city 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:37.309
 the 20 years of work because people analyze 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:40.309
 as is the behavior of each player who sees 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:42.279
 one of the questions I got was 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:44.639
 I do not know what to say 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.409
 with the person with the same date of birth keith richards 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.209
 brazil the bionic disk 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.859
 bandits 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.939
 there are some differences because of the quality you 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.929
 if you lose 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:00.939
 Do you take controlled medicine? 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.790
 you do hormone replacement because all this messes with your body betty 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.489
 constituted by ten 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.059
 and then you have to make the diagnosis 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.940
 differentiate 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.940
 even you having marten that rhythm 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.709
 romario and drink the billionaire of water 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.419
 2 on specific days with bigger basketball players to overcome many 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.319
 times 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.759
 laughter in the audience penalty is the 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.900
 no use saying what kind of skin do not hit here 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.879
 90% chance to defend the title 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.990
 I already posted the nasdaq on the 29th because I 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:39.800
 it is from each 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.439
 the poorest variation 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:43.189
 is optimistic 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:46.189
 so I asked her 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:50.489
 China and Brazil presented a better football than the small parties 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.710
 detected a high 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.059
 with condition 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:58.969
 counting on the Paraguayan 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:00.199
 I do not think so 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.830
 no, I do not know 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.550
 no use 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.509
 but we'll talk again at the next 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.740
 any doubt was so 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.349
 to celebrate child masses 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.619
 that people trained the same day showing the concept of the mythical the new 

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:17.270
 lesion 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.610
 no wonder 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.210
 but a teacher assessment 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.430
 to determine 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.129
 the hit rate 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.059
 19-year balance sheets 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:28.490
 on departure 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.400
 of tomorrow against the right Paraguayan 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.779
 talking on the bike victory act 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.330
 a hug d until the next
