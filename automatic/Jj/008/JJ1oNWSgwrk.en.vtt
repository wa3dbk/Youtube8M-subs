00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
lineup and what I guess what is the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.140 
lineup and what I guess what is the
reason<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.460> they<00:00:17.580> decided<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.000> make<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
reason that they decided to make a
