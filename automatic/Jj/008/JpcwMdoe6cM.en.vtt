 understand finding more yes but really 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.610
 really think they understand the uses 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.829
 the usual standard version I looked 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.410
 the child tried again to understand what 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.090
 she tried to make him go 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.730
 do not like well

 naturally qatar wednesday well yes and his 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.610
 took two hours 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.010
 yes this exercise like me suddenly 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.160
 again well some pain approach 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.690
 conceptually they look all the same 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.720
 exercises as a sequence of these 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.600
 exercises you appear conceptualism 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.400
 I do not have the game in the 17 consequences of gaining 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.250
 several immediately with an exercise here 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.610
 take turns to give but in fact all 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.400
 okay all the same inexpensive moment yes 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.280
 well when we have here for an hour 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.240
 people who have been involved with us already 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.220
 be exposed here when come on 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.700
 school you somehow heat six groups one 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.830
 girlfriend 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.710
 let us reveal this secret today 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.480
 the Koran and the compass are actually all very 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.730
 simply 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.670
 all exercises are divided and I like this 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.790
 three categories 1 9 saying this is pure 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.010
 power those who are on to work some 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.200
 not very technical moves this 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.020
 no matter how and what they have going on 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.790
 there their accuracy there performance is not much 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.000
 globally your how important is the most 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.430
 sign on the company of dad birth these which 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.500
 power you are technically power that is there and 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.100
 technique is she like to 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.150
 and the third is a purely technical exercise 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.040
 on how no matter what trade there more than once 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.930
 it seems to us as if somehow not that 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.380
 there I am there 300 times it did something like 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.240
 receive 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.789
 technical failure is characterized by the fact that 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.479
 they are better suis pas kill yes first 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.729
 at this corner 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.500
 accuracy of performance is important precisely in them 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.739
 don't get it important don't wait what exactly 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.920
 quite a precise tracking of your 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.470
 sensations when performing because they 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.330
 directed we just felt these 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.150
 correct movements remembered it 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.440
 feeling and could then apply to the spotlight 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.630
 cleaned 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.480
 often this situation does not happen thought 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.000
 such a dimple arrived now some 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.790
 Red wanted to jumping on the residual and 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.939
 then calmly work out all faces 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.269
 i.e. also 1 bar well claimant mach k0 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.750
 first, of course, because you 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.969
 you come 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.640
 do you like the word exercise mochish 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:56.709
 you roll your muscles 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:59.379
 little legs and streams get tired give them them 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.379
 te sensor is erased further like 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.150
 soft and when then you go out you 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.670
 technical amazes are still heard 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.010
 they seem like you're just a guru 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.650
 config last did general jacquard 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.159
 you just exercise fell such that you 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.109
 there are more points to find life better 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.549
 do my lands on terek still quality 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.129
 turns off that muscle is nothing 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.019
 It feels still not work but we also 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.269
 started so wanted to go well 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.269
 I see, no, I 'm going to take it already 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.189
 some kind of fence strategy i'm just there 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.859
 where fresh muscles need fresh feeling 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.510
 sensations 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.670
 that is technically not always have been the case 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.580
 in our 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.590
 always doing something breaks there 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.720
 never too dare to go there you 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.400
 now broadcasts at the station minutes between 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.470
 exercises yes in general, then everything is not an alibi 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.390
 there was an office managers some kind of office 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.300
 form at all to why some 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.340
 a native kicked right away on the belly that's not 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.670
 come and rightly so in fact 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.890
 project 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.959
 I agree with you for yes, but these are all 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.180
 power to the service acceleration that 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.600
 the exercises there clean urine wind in 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.239
 ugly 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.130
 they should be left here for you and the end 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.019
 adopted by applying what is technically only 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.459
 that the groundwork given the technical work 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.799
 immediately drove in and here he came down to poke 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.359
 I'm looking good 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.090
 so open technologie she is very 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.940
 but just do not forget that at the same time 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.250
 on the website we will sign to the exercises 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.070
 group they belong to us need already 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.020
 dad times. 100 cattle that is another 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.150
 moment in technically generating force 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.770
 they work on different muscle groups but 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.650
 try to combine so that all 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.470
 muscles within one take you 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.150
 Were engaged not to kill having taken birth 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.280
 take fly away on legs there and there still 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.310
 on something pub hands us in minutes 3 on 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.630
 what is above beauty 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.539
 do you do any exercises 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.350
 just see this technically this 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.720
 and do 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.680
 and to you you can mean for 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.680
 you technical 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.810
 decide what that is so here but 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.840
 In principle, everything is such a training plan 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.400
 make sowing correctly understood sasha 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.400
 we shoot you about birth then 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.130
 bullet him based on the smell of sweat with you when 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.620
 and roll a glass of water but never 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.940
 did and took off his shoes took off her 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.850
 accumulate as more 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.510
 and technically rolls on heads or 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.980
 rolled into the liver I will write out 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.940
 subscribe here so we went more important 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.520
 shoot bye or sign language interpreter 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.850
 may simply not have time to translate schA and 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.850
 out in frame.
