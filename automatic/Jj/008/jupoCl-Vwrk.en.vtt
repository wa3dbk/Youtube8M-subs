fast car I'm recommending this car I'm

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.140 
fast car I'm recommending this car I'm
not<00:00:22.320> sure<00:00:22.380> what<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:22.949> called<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:23.550> it's

not sure what it's called but it's
really<00:00:24.390> fast<00:00:24.660> i<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:26.039> i<00:00:26.189> found<00:00:26.519> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
really fast i like it and i found it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.609 
really fast i like it and i found it
just<00:00:26.939> by<00:00:27.180> driving<00:00:27.449> about<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.170> free<00:00:28.320> easy<00:00:28.349> to

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
just by driving about it's free easy to

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.060 
just by driving about it's free easy to
find<00:00:28.769> now<00:00:29.630> once<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:30.869> find<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> fast<00:00:31.349> car<00:00:31.590> all

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
find now once you do find a fast car all

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.310 
find now once you do find a fast car all
you<00:00:32.369> need<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.550> do<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.969> drive<00:00:33.899> around<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.260> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
you need to do is drive around in a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.889 
you need to do is drive around in a
circle<00:00:34.730> non-stop<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.210> doing<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.540> now

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
circle non-stop like I'm doing right now

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.220 
circle non-stop like I'm doing right now
so<00:00:37.530> all<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.730> i'm<00:00:39.030> doing<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.600> i'm<00:00:39.629> falling

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
so all that i'm doing is i'm falling

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.100 
so all that i'm doing is i'm falling
down<00:00:40.379> right<00:00:40.680> trigger<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.309> i<00:00:42.210> move<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.930> left

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
down right trigger and i move the left

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.709 
down right trigger and i move the left
stick<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:44.040> whenever<00:00:44.520> i'm<00:00:44.850> starting<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
stick in a bit whenever i'm starting to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.549 
stick in a bit whenever i'm starting to
lean<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.410> my<00:00:46.559> car<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.690> his<00:00:48.690> attack<00:00:48.989> try

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
lean out with my car so his attack try

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.700 
lean out with my car so his attack try
to<00:00:49.620> keep<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.550> two<00:00:51.390> left<00:00:51.690> wheels<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> left

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
to keep the two left wheels on the left

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.020 
to keep the two left wheels on the left
side<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.250> car<00:00:54.440> with<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.890> middle<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
side of your car with in the middle of a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.670 
side of your car with in the middle of a
white<00:00:57.239> light<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.719> left<00:00:57.930> side<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.469> that

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
white light on the left side if that

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.069 
white light on the left side if that
makes<00:00:58.859> sense<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:00.120> other<00:01:00.270> words<00:01:00.539> try<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
makes sense so in other words try to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.280 
makes sense so in other words try to
keep<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.770> car<00:01:02.359> towards<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.359> left<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:04.110> as

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
keep the car towards the left as much as

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.870 
keep the car towards the left as much as
possible<00:01:04.470> because<00:01:04.979> you'd<00:01:05.220> rather<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
possible because you'd rather be on the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.410 
possible because you'd rather be on the
left<00:01:06.180> then<00:01:06.840> be<00:01:07.290> too<00:01:07.590> far<00:01:07.830> out<00:01:08.070> wide<00:01:08.760> because

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
left then be too far out wide because

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.330 
left then be too far out wide because
it's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> lot<00:01:09.960> easier<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.590> recover<00:01:10.860> when<00:01:11.159> you're

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it's a lot easier to recover when you're

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.410 
it's a lot easier to recover when you're
in<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.640> two<00:01:14.670> minutes<00:01:15.060> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
in that so do this in two minutes you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.880 
in that so do this in two minutes you
should<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.110> first<00:01:16.320> try<00:01:16.650> it's

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
should have to do this first try it's

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.360 
should have to do this first try it's
really<00:01:17.220> easy<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.790> lot

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
really easy it's a lot

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.190 
really easy it's a lot
the<00:01:18.520> government<00:01:19.000> and<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.540> other<00:01:19.690> methods<00:01:20.110> on

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
the government and the other methods on

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.400 
the government and the other methods on
YouTube<00:01:20.590> which<00:01:20.860> is<00:01:21.040> to<00:01:21.190> just<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.840> slow<00:01:23.110> car

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
YouTube which is to just get a slow car

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.610 
YouTube which is to just get a slow car
and<00:01:23.740> just<00:01:23.980> go<00:01:24.160> around<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.700> highway<00:01:25.630> with<00:01:26.380> your

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
and just go around the highway with your

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.370 
and just go around the highway with your
foot<00:01:27.190> against<00:01:27.550> your<00:01:27.700> pedals<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.930> way<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.170> lot

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
foot against your pedals this way is lot

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.330 
foot against your pedals this way is lot
easier<00:01:29.590> because<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.040> pretty<00:01:30.250> much

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
easier because you pretty much

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.790 
easier because you pretty much
guaranteed<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.910> do<00:01:31.120> it<00:01:31.240> as<00:01:31.360> no<00:01:31.570> cars<00:01:31.870> come<00:01:32.650> in

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
guaranteed to do it as no cars come in

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.280 
guaranteed to do it as no cars come in
here<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:33.280> it's<00:01:33.970> very<00:01:34.300> unlikely<00:01:34.720> but<00:01:35.140> you'll

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
here and it's very unlikely but you'll

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.410 
here and it's very unlikely but you'll
meet<00:01:35.500> somebody<00:01:35.740> crossing<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.310> road<00:01:36.520> I<00:01:36.820> did

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
meet somebody crossing the road I did

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.090 
meet somebody crossing the road I did
and<00:01:37.660> that's<00:01:37.840> why<00:01:37.930> I<00:01:38.050> fares<00:01:38.380> my<00:01:38.440> first<00:01:38.740> attempt

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
and that's why I fares my first attempt

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.790 
and that's why I fares my first attempt
but<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.990> shouldn't<00:01:41.260> really<00:01:41.410> get<00:01:41.650> any

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
but you shouldn't really get any

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.530 
but you shouldn't really get any
problems<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.460> just<00:01:42.580> need<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:43.030> keep<00:01:43.180> going

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
problems you just need to keep going

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.870 
problems you just need to keep going
round<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:43.990> round<00:01:44.050> in<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.620> circle<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:45.640> only

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
round and round in a circle the only

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.550 
round and round in a circle the only
problem<00:01:46.120> with<00:01:46.390> this<00:01:46.510> method<00:01:46.570> is<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.230> you

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
problem with this method is that you

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.710 
problem with this method is that you
might<00:01:47.740> get<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.920> bit<00:01:48.100> dizzy<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.580> saw<00:01:48.910> I<00:01:49.120> started<00:01:49.660> to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
might get a bit dizzy I saw I started to

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.810 
might get a bit dizzy I saw I started to
get<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.960> bit<00:01:50.140> busy<00:01:50.320> when<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.340> was<00:01:51.460> making<00:01:51.610> this

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
get a bit busy when I was making this

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.780 
get a bit busy when I was making this
video<00:01:51.970> because<00:01:52.180> this<00:01:52.990> was<00:01:53.200> my<00:01:53.230> third<00:01:53.650> go<00:01:54.610> at

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
video because this was my third go at

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.870 
video because this was my third go at
doing<00:01:54.940> this<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:55.770> when<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:56.980> do<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.550> that<00:01:57.730> much

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
doing this and when you do it that much

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.510 
doing this and when you do it that much
everybody<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.480> become<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.780> blur<00:01:59.110> so<00:02:00.040> I'm<00:02:00.370> up

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
everybody to become the blur so I'm up

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.790 
everybody to become the blur so I'm up
to<00:02:00.700> 1<00:02:00.880> minute<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.270> 20<00:02:01.720> seconds<00:02:02.080> now<00:02:02.260> it's

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
to 1 minute and 20 seconds now it's

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.300 
to 1 minute and 20 seconds now it's
pretty<00:02:03.190> close<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.730> 2<00:02:04.120> minutes<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:06.130> get<00:02:06.280> a

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
pretty close to 2 minutes and you get a

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.620 
pretty close to 2 minutes and you get a
nice<00:02:06.490> achievement<00:02:06.640> out<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.300> or<00:02:07.480> what<00:02:07.600> a

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
nice achievement out of it or what a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.170 
nice achievement out of it or what a
nice<00:02:07.780> trophy<00:02:08.020> defendant

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
nice trophy defendant

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.520 
nice trophy defendant
cut<00:02:10.180> so<00:02:10.360> you're<00:02:10.570> on

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.949 

but<00:02:15.980> here<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.190> am<00:02:16.310> just<00:02:16.670> trying<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.060> keep<00:02:17.360> within

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
but here I am just trying to keep within

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.949 
but here I am just trying to keep within
the<00:02:18.170> lines<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:19.520> white<00:02:19.970> line<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.660> easier

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
the lines the white line so it's easier

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.809 
the lines the white line so it's easier
and<00:02:21.620> obviously<00:02:21.890> when<00:02:22.190> you're<00:02:22.340> too<00:02:22.490> close<00:02:22.760> to

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
and obviously when you're too close to

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.199 
and obviously when you're too close to
the<00:02:23.209> wall<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.560> little<00:02:24.800> fence<00:02:25.040> braiding<00:02:25.970> thing

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
the wall the little fence braiding thing

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.900 
the wall the little fence braiding thing
you<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:26.780> let<00:02:27.350> go<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.680> your<00:02:27.800> left<00:02:28.190> stick<00:02:28.490> on

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
you just let go of your left stick on

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.710 
you just let go of your left stick on
your<00:02:29.180> gamepad<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.590> should<00:02:30.860> just<00:02:31.670> move<00:02:32.420> out

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
your gamepad and it should just move out

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.010 
your gamepad and it should just move out
a<00:02:32.780> bit<00:02:33.200> but<00:02:34.100> keep<00:02:34.400> your<00:02:34.610> bum<00:02:35.209> on<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.569> left

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
a bit but keep your bum on the left

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.630 
a bit but keep your bum on the left
stick<00:02:36.260> just<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:36.680> case<00:02:36.830> if<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.040> does<00:02:37.220> go<00:02:37.400> out<00:02:37.489> to

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
stick just in case if it does go out to

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.780 
stick just in case if it does go out to
you<00:02:37.730> widen<00:02:37.910> quickly<00:02:38.450> save<00:02:38.660> yourself<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:40.550> here

you widen quickly save yourself and here

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.790 
you widen quickly save yourself and here
we<00:02:40.910> are<00:02:41.060> coming<00:02:41.330> up<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.450> two<00:02:41.750> minute<00:02:41.959> mark<00:02:41.989> and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
we are coming up to two minute mark and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.500 
we are coming up to two minute mark and
there<00:02:42.980> we<00:02:43.069> go<00:02:43.220> I've<00:02:43.580> already<00:02:43.940> done<00:02:44.360> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
there we go I've already done the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.790 
there we go I've already done the
achievement<00:02:44.930> that's<00:02:45.140> why<00:02:45.319> it<00:02:45.380> hadn't<00:02:45.680> popped

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
achievement that's why it hadn't popped

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.670 
achievement that's why it hadn't popped
up<00:02:46.010> again<00:02:46.160> but<00:02:46.610> obviously<00:02:47.330> if<00:02:47.630> you've<00:02:47.810> done<00:02:48.050> if
