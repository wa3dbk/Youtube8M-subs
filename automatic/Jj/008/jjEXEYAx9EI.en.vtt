00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
this time you're going to hit disk hope

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.240 
this time you're going to hit disk hope
they're<00:02:53.769> this<00:02:53.950> just<00:02:54.310> clean<00:02:54.610> up<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.980> know<00:02:57.040> let

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
they're this just clean up you know let

they're this just clean up you know let
it<00:02:57.280> blow<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.579> up<00:02:57.670> if<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.420> does<00:03:00.239> marinus<00:03:03.209> now

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
it blow it up if it does marinus now

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.500 
it blow it up if it does marinus now
while<00:03:04.630> we<00:03:04.840> do<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:04.989> we're<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.380> going<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:06.510> do

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
while we do that we're just going to do

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.120 
while we do that we're just going to do
this<00:03:07.660> also<00:03:07.930> just<00:03:08.620> be<00:03:08.980> tight<00:03:09.959> run<00:03:11.130> untie

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
this also just be tight run untie

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.789 
this also just be tight run untie
prefetch<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:14.140> we're<00:03:14.290> just<00:03:14.350> going<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.620> wait<00:03:14.769> for

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
prefetch so we're just going to wait for

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.150 
prefetch so we're just going to wait for
this

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160

this<00:03:26.210> is<00:03:26.360> going<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.540> be<00:03:26.660> like<00:03:26.780> I<00:03:26.900> said<00:03:27.080> maybe<00:03:27.290> a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
this is going to be like I said maybe a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.550 
this is going to be like I said maybe a
ten-part<00:03:27.890> series<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:28.490> have<00:03:29.240> a<00:03:29.570> bunch<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:32.560> little

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
ten-part series I have a bunch of little

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.770 
ten-part series I have a bunch of little
tips<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.130> tricks<00:03:34.370> but<00:03:34.730> these<00:03:35.030> are<00:03:35.240> about<00:03:35.510> the

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
tips and tricks but these are about the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.560 
tips and tricks but these are about the
top<00:03:36.110> three<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:36.800> will<00:03:37.010> delete<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:38.030> bunch<00:03:38.330> of

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
top three that will delete a bunch of

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.650 
top three that will delete a bunch of
space<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.080> will<00:03:39.530> make<00:03:39.740> a<00:03:39.770> computer<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.660> little

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
space that will make a computer a little

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.390 
space that will make a computer a little
bit<00:03:41.780> more<00:03:41.930> faster<00:03:42.380> than<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.650> should<00:03:42.890> be<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:43.370> uh

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
bit more faster than it should be so uh

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.320 
bit more faster than it should be so uh
yeah<00:03:44.270> now<00:03:45.230> this<00:03:45.410> is<00:03:45.470> taking<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:45.980> little<00:03:46.160> bit<00:03:46.430> so

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
yeah now this is taking a little bit so

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.790 
yeah now this is taking a little bit so
I<00:03:47.360> don't<00:03:47.720> know<00:03:47.780> what's<00:03:47.960> going<00:03:48.290> on<00:03:48.410> here<00:03:48.470> is

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
I don't know what's going on here is

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.490 
I don't know what's going on here is
just<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.160> mare<00:03:49.370> memory<00:03:49.640> dump<00:03:50.000> files<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.900> soon

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
just the mare memory dump files and soon

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.800 
just the mare memory dump files and soon
um<00:03:51.830> I<00:03:52.250> think<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:53.030> second<00:03:53.360> or<00:03:53.450> third<00:03:53.480> video

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
um I think the second or third video

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.380 
um I think the second or third video
i'll<00:03:54.230> be<00:03:54.500> giving<00:03:54.920> like<00:03:55.370> teaching<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:56.330> guys

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
i'll be giving like teaching you guys

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.020 
i'll be giving like teaching you guys
how<00:03:56.570> to<00:03:56.810> run<00:03:57.260> these<00:03:57.440> codes<00:03:57.980> where<00:03:58.490> all<00:03:58.880> you

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
how to run these codes where all you

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.150 
how to run these codes where all you
have<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.210> do<00:03:59.330> is<00:03:59.510> click<00:03:59.810> on<00:04:00.020> this<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.470> it

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
have to do is click on this and it

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.100 
have to do is click on this and it
cleans<00:04:01.550> always<00:04:02.300> probably<00:04:02.690> not<00:04:02.780> going<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:02.930> let

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
cleans always probably not going to let

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.660 
cleans always probably not going to let
me<00:04:03.230> because<00:04:03.530> I'm<00:04:03.740> already<00:04:03.890> running<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.490> disk

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
me because I'm already running and disk

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.150 
me because I'm already running and disk
cleanup<00:04:04.970> well<00:04:05.600> basically<00:04:05.840> you're<00:04:06.830> just<00:04:06.860> going

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
cleanup well basically you're just going

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.120 
cleanup well basically you're just going
to<00:04:07.280> have<00:04:07.310> this<00:04:08.110> click<00:04:09.110> this<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:09.650> make<00:04:09.800> it<00:04:09.830> run

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
to have this click this to make it run

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.810 
to have this click this to make it run
this<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:10.640> then<00:04:11.600> another<00:04:12.560> clear<00:04:12.950> space<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.580> a

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
this and then another clear space and a

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.009 
this and then another clear space and a
ram<00:04:14.150> helper<00:04:15.220> well<00:04:16.220> yeah<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.480> guys<00:04:17.660> get<00:04:17.930> the

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
ram helper well yeah you guys get the

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.440 
ram helper well yeah you guys get the
point<00:04:18.260> for<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.160> disk<00:04:19.459> cleanup<00:04:19.790> you<00:04:19.970> just<00:04:20.180> let

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
point for the disk cleanup you just let

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.990 
point for the disk cleanup you just let
this<00:04:20.630> cleanup<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:22.570> after<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:24.230> should

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
this cleanup and after that it should

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.580 
this cleanup and after that it should
might<00:04:26.000> possibly<00:04:26.300> tell<00:04:26.720> you<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:26.960> restart<00:04:27.500> your

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
might possibly tell you to restart your

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.590 
might possibly tell you to restart your
computer<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.370> if<00:04:28.670> it<00:04:28.790> does<00:04:28.940> just<00:04:29.180> do<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.450> and
