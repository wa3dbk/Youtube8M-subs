00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.389
 h 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.790
 race has been hard all day 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.960
 Rain still rained 8 hours in the 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.610
 row appears quite heavy 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.050
 to have 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.510
 yes what should we expect i start 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.250
 from a place 16th she 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.110
 yes i hope my points can grab and 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.470
 that I can get to the first 10 but 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.820
 so I expect little visibility 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.820
 bit of a mess that I definitely do 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.370
 africa de you choose for my son and guts 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.700
 the peter sheep 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.700
 all right 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.050
 do you also lose privately 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.289
 ok who are three men 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.020
 potential to trust which minima 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.429
 for among others 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.329
 no you need blood and you still b 9 yes 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.470
 that is hoped 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.659
 points this was really bad 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.610
 you just don't see anything and in front of you 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.369
 the front wheel drive and softer really 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.780
 the ones that had much more traction were what 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.610
 little grip if I just watched the gas 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.770
 then the thing immediately began to drift 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.840
 so that was very difficult at all 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.069
 start with no vision for the end 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.750
 I think quite satisfied 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.030
 you can see that we just grabbed a point 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.009
 and constant have been smart I think 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.009
 guess it did the maximum 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.010
 name of the man who is angry with who they are so 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.010
 within 8 days 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.840
 hello to 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.450
 well 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:46.840
 also a corpse in the beginning special 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:48.460
 a lot harder than the first race 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.320
 well straits cleans him and more 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.100
 mistakes so I have some more presents 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.780
 hole 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.060
 racing stripes just not a gift hole 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.320
 are a bit faster than that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.640
 andreessen good one and a half seconds 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.280
 faster than racing duck wants to break 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.300
 wet wash car gets a little better 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.950
 but two points that I just hope 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.390
 problems came to well so diego then 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.830
 I fumbled for a moment 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.510
 i thought i dare not go there easily 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.680
 I only made tracer fishing 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.900
 to touring 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.000
 it is clear me to catch up with the ginger 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.760
 a trimmer apart and the er 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.850
 was equally nice but no no points this 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.850
 already doing really for nothing
