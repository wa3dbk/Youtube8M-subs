capacity so we're gonna talk to a couple

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.780 
capacity so we're gonna talk to a couple
of<00:00:13.469> experts<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.980> see<00:00:14.130> what's<00:00:14.400> being<00:00:14.580> done

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
of experts to see what's being done

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.310 
of experts to see what's being done
about<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.240> drought<00:00:15.420> situation<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.139> how

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
about the drought situation and how

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.830 
about the drought situation and how
people<00:00:16.650> are<00:00:16.740> saving<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.369> getting<00:00:17.880> water<00:00:18.090> most

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
people are saving and getting water most

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.330 
people are saving and getting water most
people<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.230> very<00:00:19.289> little<00:00:19.770> idea<00:00:19.980> where

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
people have a very little idea where

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.859 
people have a very little idea where
their<00:00:20.520> water<00:00:20.640> comes<00:00:20.910> from<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.510> year<00:00:21.689> we've

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
their water comes from this year we've

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.750 
their water comes from this year we've
received<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.470> 10<00:00:22.740> inches<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.189> rain<00:00:23.220> here<00:00:23.550> we

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
received like 10 inches of rain here we

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.540 
received like 10 inches of rain here we
usually<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.529> particularly<00:00:25.529> about<00:00:25.830> 30<00:00:26.099> inches

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
usually get particularly about 30 inches

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.540 
usually get particularly about 30 inches
when<00:00:27.150> we've<00:00:27.269> gotten<00:00:27.480> 10<00:00:28.140> inches<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.250> last

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
when we've gotten 10 inches for the last

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.959 
when we've gotten 10 inches for the last
four<00:00:29.789> years<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.960> that's<00:00:31.590> what's<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:31.980> made

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
four years so that's what's really made

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.090 
four years so that's what's really made
it<00:00:33.120> kind<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.360> challenging<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.739> when<00:00:35.010> you

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
it kind of challenging but when you

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.680 
it kind of challenging but when you
really<00:00:35.370> look<00:00:35.489> at<00:00:35.610> where<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.149> majority<00:00:36.450> of

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
really look at where the majority of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.450 
really look at where the majority of
water<00:00:36.989> comes<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.440> California<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.010> Sierras

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
water comes in California the Sierras

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.639 
water comes in California the Sierras
are<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.420> largest<00:00:39.809> reservoir<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.410> have

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
are just the largest reservoir we have

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.650 
are just the largest reservoir we have
and<00:00:41.129> there's<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.579> nothing<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.210> right<00:00:42.450> now

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and there's just nothing there right now

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.930 
and there's just nothing there right now
the<00:00:43.230> major<00:00:43.440> sources<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.309> water<00:00:44.520> in

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
the major sources for water in

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.790 
the major sources for water in
California<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:45.690> rain<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.140> snowmelt<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
California are rain and snowmelt in the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.160 
California are rain and snowmelt in the
Sierras<00:00:47.219> groundwater<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.879> then<00:00:48.390> imported

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
Sierras groundwater and then imported

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.959 
Sierras groundwater and then imported
water<00:00:49.320> from<00:00:49.739> outside<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.340> California<00:00:50.879> in

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
water from outside of California in

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.670 
water from outside of California in
particular<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.570> Colorado<00:00:51.960> River<00:00:52.230> Basin

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
particular the Colorado River Basin

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.590 
particular the Colorado River Basin
groundwater<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.910> water<00:00:54.090> that's<00:00:54.270> stored

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
groundwater is the water that's stored

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.299 
groundwater is the water that's stored
under<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> ground<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.829> takes<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.129> long

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
under the ground and it takes a long

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
under the ground and it takes a long
time<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.210> water<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.750> build<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
time for that water to build up a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.279 
time for that water to build up a
reasonable<00:00:58.859> supply<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.420> worth<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
reasonable supply so that it's worth the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.869 
reasonable supply so that it's worth the
cost<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.770> drilling<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> well<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
cost of drilling the well and the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.820 
cost of drilling the well and the
electrical<00:01:03.329> cost<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.780> pumping<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.559> water<00:01:04.589> out

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
electrical cost of pumping the water out

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.310 
electrical cost of pumping the water out
so<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.640> future<00:01:05.939> looks<00:01:06.150> bleak<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> couple

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
so the future looks bleak for a couple

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.429 
so the future looks bleak for a couple
of<00:01:07.409> reasons<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.610> climate<00:01:08.970> change<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
of reasons one is climate change and the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560 
of reasons one is climate change and the
decreasing<00:01:11.130> amount<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.610> snow<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.390> rainfall

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
decreasing amount of snow and rainfall

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.149 
decreasing amount of snow and rainfall
that<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.049> will<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.320> receiving<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that that will be receiving and the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.460 
that that will be receiving and the
continued<00:01:14.610> groundwater<00:01:15.000> use<00:01:15.470> California's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
continued groundwater use California's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
continued groundwater use California's
just<00:01:16.619> kind<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.890> Olly<00:01:17.220> Olly<00:01:17.400> oxen-free<00:01:17.850> when<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
just kind of Olly Olly oxen-free when it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.820 
just kind of Olly Olly oxen-free when it
comes<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.600> groundwater<00:01:19.020> bases<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.619> people

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
comes to groundwater bases and people

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.800 
comes to groundwater bases and people
just<00:01:19.950> pump<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.369> much<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.700> they<00:01:20.820> want<00:01:21.060> there's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
just pump as much as they want there's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.340 
just pump as much as they want there's
no<00:01:22.049> control<00:01:22.799> there's<00:01:23.130> no<00:01:23.369> oversight<00:01:24.350> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
no control there's no oversight and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.020 
no control there's no oversight and
unfortunately

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
unfortunately

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.840 
unfortunately
it's<00:01:27.510> gotten<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> lot<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.050> basins<00:01:28.440> into<00:01:28.590> trouble

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it's gotten a lot of basins into trouble

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.150 
it's gotten a lot of basins into trouble
the<00:01:30.330> biggest<00:01:30.660> thing<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:30.930> homeowners<00:01:31.800> can<00:01:31.890> do

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
the biggest thing that homeowners can do

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.350 
the biggest thing that homeowners can do
is<00:01:32.750> forget<00:01:33.750> about<00:01:33.950> having<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.280> grass<00:01:35.520> lawn<00:01:36.090> if

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
is forget about having a grass lawn if

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.460 
is forget about having a grass lawn if
we<00:01:36.720> ditched<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.650> grass<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.250> move<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.470> native

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
we ditched the grass and move to native

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.470 
we ditched the grass and move to native
landscaping<00:01:41.010> which<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.730> we<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.300> know

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
landscaping which you know we all know

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.450 
landscaping which you know we all know
is<00:01:42.600> beautiful<00:01:43.080> we<00:01:43.350> would<00:01:43.530> save<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> lot<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.010> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
is beautiful we would save a lot of a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.430 
is beautiful we would save a lot of a
lot<00:01:45.120> of<00:01:45.270> water<00:01:45.510> over<00:01:46.100> 50%<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.930> home<00:01:48.930> water<00:01:49.200> use

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
lot of water over 50% of home water use

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.920 
lot of water over 50% of home water use
is<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:50.670> watering<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.090> grass<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.630> huge

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
is for watering the grass so huge

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.270 
is for watering the grass so huge
savings<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:52.710> there

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
savings right there

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.060 
savings right there
so<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.090> garden<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.110> Association<00:01:55.979> of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
so this garden is the Association of

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.340 
so this garden is the Association of
Realtors<00:01:56.220> garden<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:57.510> used<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:57.900> be<00:01:58.050> here

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
Realtors garden and what used to be here

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.770 
Realtors garden and what used to be here
was<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.590> lawn<00:01:59.010> and<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.910> what<00:02:00.060> they<00:02:00.180> identified

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
was a lawn and so what they identified

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.840 
was a lawn and so what they identified
was<00:02:01.110> let's<00:02:01.560> use<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.160> space<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.640> create

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
was let's use this space to create

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.340 
was let's use this space to create
something<00:02:03.300> that's<00:02:03.450> beautiful<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.050> also

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
something that's beautiful but also

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.530 
something that's beautiful but also
sustainable<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.820> does<00:02:05.970> not<00:02:06.000> require<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
sustainable and that does not require a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.080 
sustainable and that does not require a
lot<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.780> water<00:02:07.110> or<00:02:07.259> maintenance<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.820> a<00:02:08.940> lot

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
lot of water or maintenance it's a lot

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.070 
lot of water or maintenance it's a lot
more<00:02:09.240> visually<00:02:09.899> pleasing<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:12.390> lot<00:02:12.930> more

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
more visually pleasing a lot more

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.430 
more visually pleasing a lot more
texture<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.490> also<00:02:14.670> has<00:02:15.630> an<00:02:15.780> added<00:02:15.900> benefit

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
texture and it also has an added benefit

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.640 
texture and it also has an added benefit
of<00:02:16.590> capturing<00:02:17.160> rainwater<00:02:17.690> from<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> roof<00:02:19.230> and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
of capturing rainwater from the roof and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.680 
of capturing rainwater from the roof and
bringing<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.520> into<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.760> garden<00:02:21.300> and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
bringing it here into the garden and

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.540 
bringing it here into the garden and
then<00:02:21.870> into<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.200> groundwater<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:23.100> terms<00:02:23.340> of

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
then into the groundwater in terms of

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.729 
then into the groundwater in terms of
water<00:02:23.820> use<00:02:24.000> it's<00:02:24.450> probably<00:02:24.989> decreased<00:02:25.470> by

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
water use it's probably decreased by

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.890 
water use it's probably decreased by
about<00:02:26.090> 90%<00:02:27.709> we<00:02:28.709> showed<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:28.980> for<00:02:29.330> 2014<00:02:30.330> we
