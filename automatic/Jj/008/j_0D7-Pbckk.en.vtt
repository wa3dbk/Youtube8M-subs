00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
you can see some upper and lower control

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.679 
you can see some upper and lower control
arms<00:00:18.670> for<00:00:19.390> 63<00:00:20.170> to<00:00:20.289> 82<00:00:20.679> Corvettes<00:00:21.220> and<00:00:21.689> you'll

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
arms for 63 to 82 Corvettes and you'll

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.089 
arms for 63 to 82 Corvettes and you'll
notice<00:00:23.019> that<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.380> first<00:00:23.560> one<00:00:23.800> we<00:00:23.890> have<00:00:24.070> is

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
notice that the first one we have is

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.060 
notice that the first one we have is
setting<00:00:24.519> up<00:00:24.640> here<00:00:24.880> is<00:00:25.390> just<00:00:26.259> to<00:00:26.349> use<00:00:26.560> a<00:00:26.830> arm

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
setting up here is just to use a arm

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.109 
setting up here is just to use a arm
lower<00:00:27.759> and<00:00:28.679> it's<00:00:29.679> rusty<00:00:30.189> dirty<00:00:30.490> grimy<00:00:30.910> and

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
lower and it's rusty dirty grimy and

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.510 
lower and it's rusty dirty grimy and
stuff<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.439> what<00:00:32.590> we<00:00:32.740> do<00:00:32.890> is<00:00:33.040> we<00:00:33.190> take<00:00:33.340> when<00:00:33.490> we

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
stuff so what we do is we take when we

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.700 
stuff so what we do is we take when we
send<00:00:33.790> them<00:00:33.880> out<00:00:33.970> we'll<00:00:34.120> have<00:00:34.150> them<00:00:34.710> chemically

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
send them out we'll have them chemically
