00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
happy Memorial Day weekend this is the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.310 
happy Memorial Day weekend this is the
time<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.359> year<00:00:18.570> when<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:18.869> break<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
time of year when we break out the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.800 
time of year when we break out the
grills<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.369> enjoy<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.060> coming<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.570> summer

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
grills and we enjoy the coming of summer

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.410 
grills and we enjoy the coming of summer
but<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> new<00:00:22.439> theory<00:00:22.830> tells<00:00:23.250> us<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:24.180> there<00:00:24.330> may

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
but a new theory tells us that there may

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.910 
but a new theory tells us that there may
have<00:00:24.449> been<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.660> time<00:00:24.930> when<00:00:25.500> we're<00:00:25.710> barbecuing

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
have been a time when we're barbecuing

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.730 
have been a time when we're barbecuing
our<00:00:26.369> own<00:00:26.460> cousins<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.599> Neanderthal<00:00:28.289> yeah<00:00:29.660> YUM

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
our own cousins the Neanderthal yeah YUM

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.630 
our own cousins the Neanderthal yeah YUM
neanderthal<00:00:31.740> we're<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> family<00:00:32.250> dominant

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
neanderthal we're a family dominant

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
neanderthal we're a family dominant
species<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.090> much<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.390> Europe<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.899> historians

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
species in much of Europe and historians

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
species in much of Europe and historians
are<00:00:34.739> pretty<00:00:35.100> confident<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.850> even

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
are pretty confident that we even

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.020 
are pretty confident that we even
interbred<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.020> these<00:00:37.500> Neanderthals<00:00:38.030> we're

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
interbred with these Neanderthals we're

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.030 
interbred with these Neanderthals we're
so<00:00:39.180> similar<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.600> them<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:40.140> even<00:00:40.350> share<00:00:40.590> DNA

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
so similar to them we even share DNA

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.440 
so similar to them we even share DNA
but<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.370> Homo<00:00:41.520> sapiens<00:00:42.000> spread<00:00:42.210> from<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
but as Homo sapiens spread from the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.209 
but as Homo sapiens spread from the
African<00:00:42.809> cradle<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.200> began<00:00:43.379> their<00:00:43.530> push<00:00:43.860> into

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
African cradle and began their push into

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.330 
African cradle and began their push into
their<00:00:44.910> space<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.719> Europe<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.980> became<00:00:47.250> an

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
their space in Europe we became an

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.920 
their space in Europe we became an
invasive<00:00:47.579> species<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.480> new<00:00:48.629> theory

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
invasive species and this new theory

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.270 
invasive species and this new theory
says<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.170> instead<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.620> outperforming<00:00:50.190> them

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
says that instead of outperforming them

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.340 
says that instead of outperforming them
for<00:00:50.430> food<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:50.940> resources<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.600> Asian<00:00:52.020> carp<00:00:52.260> or

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
for food or resources like Asian carp or

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.260 
for food or resources like Asian carp or
nutria<00:00:52.739> des<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> States<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.120> ate

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
nutria des in the States we just ate

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.319 
nutria des in the States we just ate
them<00:00:54.660> into<00:00:55.199> extinction

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
them into extinction

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.939 
them into extinction
what<00:00:57.329> gives<00:00:57.629> ancient<00:00:58.050> humans<00:00:58.379> love<00:00:58.649> them<00:00:58.829> or

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
what gives ancient humans love them or

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.040 
what gives ancient humans love them or
eat<00:00:59.070> them<00:00:59.190> jeez<00:00:59.550> man<00:00:59.850> gosh<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.539> where

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
eat them jeez man gosh what where

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.709 
eat them jeez man gosh what where
exactly<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.370> line<00:01:02.699> where<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.690> humans

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
exactly is the line where do humans

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.740 
exactly is the line where do humans
decide<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.760> eat<00:01:05.939> something<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:06.540> more

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
