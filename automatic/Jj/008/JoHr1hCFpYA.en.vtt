streams<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.230> found<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.680> had<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> whole<00:01:02.129> bunch<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
streams I found I had a whole bunch of

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
streams I found I had a whole bunch of
projects<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.420> none<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.690> them<00:01:03.840> created<00:01:04.140> any

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
projects but none of them created any

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.039 
projects but none of them created any
revenue<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:06.210> wasn't<00:01:06.570> really<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.780> good<00:01:06.990> idea

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
revenue so it wasn't really a good idea

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.520 
revenue so it wasn't really a good idea
right<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.640> took<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.510> was<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:09.840> heart<00:01:10.229> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
right so I took what was in my heart and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.679 
right so I took what was in my heart and
my<00:01:10.710> head<00:01:10.950> space<00:01:11.310> from<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.060> course<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
my head space from that course and the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
tools that I learned and leveraged it i

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.940 
tools that I learned and leveraged it i
leveraged<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.759> actually<00:01:18.270> create<00:01:18.600> a
