00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
sure about that logic but I think it

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.090 
sure about that logic but I think it
bodes<00:01:18.930> well<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.619> team<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.070> have

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
bodes well for this team that you have

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.120 
bodes well for this team that you have
multiple<00:01:20.820> boroughs<00:01:21.210> vying<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.049> their<00:01:22.560> for

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
multiple boroughs vying for their for

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
multiple boroughs vying for their for
their<00:01:23.220> residency<00:01:23.790> remember<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.570> come<00:01:24.810> in

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
their residency remember they come in

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.539 
their residency remember they come in
less<00:01:25.170> than<00:01:25.290> 2015<00:01:25.650> they've<00:01:26.070> already<00:01:26.220> said

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
less than 2015 they've already said

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.520 
less than 2015 they've already said
probably<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> temporary<00:01:27.630> venue<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.170> two<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
probably a temporary venue for two to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.050 
probably a temporary venue for two to
three<00:01:28.740> years<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.430> we're<00:01:29.549> probably<00:01:29.670> looking<00:01:29.880> at

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
three years so we're probably looking at

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.160 
three years so we're probably looking at
a<00:01:30.119> little<00:01:30.240> time<00:01:30.479> before<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.869> really

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.660 
saying that this is the biggest
challenge<00:04:29.680> of<00:04:29.770> my<00:04:29.890> career<00:04:30.160> so<00:04:30.310> far<00:04:30.340> what<00:04:30.580> do

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
challenge of my career so far what do

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.740 
challenge of my career so far what do
you<00:04:30.730> think<00:04:30.910> these<00:04:31.000> gonna<00:04:31.240> turn<00:04:31.450> things<00:04:31.630> around

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
you think these gonna turn things around

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.600 
you think these gonna turn things around
well<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.230> think<00:04:32.410> specifically<00:04:33.070> said<00:04:33.370> it's<00:04:33.490> the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
well I think specifically said it's the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.980 
well I think specifically said it's the
most<00:04:33.790> important<00:04:34.270> challenge<00:04:34.600> in<00:04:34.690> my<00:04:34.780> career

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
most important challenge in my career

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.390 
most important challenge in my career
which<00:04:35.110> is<00:04:35.170> a<00:04:35.260> little<00:04:35.440> bit<00:04:35.560> shocking<00:04:35.860> for<00:04:36.280> those

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
which is a little bit shocking for those

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.830 
which is a little bit shocking for those
who<00:04:36.550> have<00:04:36.640> paid<00:04:36.820> attention<00:04:37.090> to<00:04:37.300> his<00:04:37.540> career

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
who have paid attention to his career

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.350 
who have paid attention to his career
obviously<00:04:38.230> like<00:04:38.850> Guadalajara<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:39.970> that<00:04:40.090> Copa

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
obviously like Guadalajara to that Copa

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.420 
obviously like Guadalajara to that Copa
Libertadores<00:04:40.500> final<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.650> is<00:04:41.800> huge<00:04:42.100> that<00:04:42.310> is

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
Libertadores final that is huge that is

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.740 
Libertadores final that is huge that is
the<00:04:42.580> biggest<00:04:42.880> tournament<00:04:43.480> in<00:04:43.570> this

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
the biggest tournament in this

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.020 
the biggest tournament in this
hemisphere<00:04:44.470> in<00:04:44.650> my<00:04:45.130> opinion<00:04:45.670> so<00:04:45.850> that's

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
hemisphere in my opinion so that's

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.540 
hemisphere in my opinion so that's
certainly<00:04:46.480> a<00:04:46.860> statement<00:04:47.860> of<00:04:48.040> intent<00:04:48.430> from

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
certainly a statement of intent from

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.830 
certainly a statement of intent from
