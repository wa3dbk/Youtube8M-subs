00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
 hey people today i show you like you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.389
 your nvidia drivers on your hackintosh 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.240
 can update and yes the videos 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.759
 of course only for him like you and user 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.890
 yes, if you have done to macintosh 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.550
 it is yours 3b likely 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.830
 have multiplied over a video 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.930
 of course also creates three times 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.570
 available nvidia web 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.119
 drivers i also rehearsed 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.530
 perpetrator here and now can the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.200
 improve performance a lot 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:41.820
 and yes, there are these drivers 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.670
 on toni max 68 you are the most 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.950
 things and yes the update happens 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.620
 own danger so here I pushed 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.870
 that goes from me 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.940
 with some it does not stop what 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.940
 maybe read for what all there 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.980
 are when I usually are the most 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.449
 supports you are we look 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.159
 are going for most nvidia cards 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.130
 if not do it anyway 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.930
 Time Machine backup is now 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.119
 to at your own risk and what very 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.979
 is important if you here of course the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.170
 downloaded and installed yet 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.830
 not even and is already quite 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.049
 important because you have to be in yours 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.689
 good is something to enter 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.460
 without them, you would grow little and 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.299
 You did not want that for you 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.430
 you stay on system back on extras 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:41.310
 So on your few tables goes up 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:48.360
 Extras and you have to open it with a 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:52.310
 text editor and yes have already 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.680
 and you have to flex in the line kernel 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.430
 Here you can see that here dax 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.670
 zero and a vga blank drv 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:08.310
 equal to one very important when the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.520
 forget growth and yes if so everything 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.180
 happened to her is just purely starts 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.430
 Euro 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.859
 in the pc and then he offers high 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.329
 you just have to - enter in yours 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.780
 bootloader and then we can, too 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.040
 not again if you forget that 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.540
 should 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.230
 if you installed the inside to us 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.260
 is and everything goes then you go your 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.409
 system settings because there you will find 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.239
 then here the nvidia driver manager and 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.260
 then you can update your updates 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.139
 Respectively 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.030
 it just works out easily 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.980
 Check update exactly and I have it now 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.790
 lured then you can come the rule 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.900
 it still on the table straight 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.370
 you could install there 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.370
 what you want to have then you also heard 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.810
 times of the castle on then you can 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.200
 I just want to say the nvidia 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.739
 have drivers and actions used the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.389
 nvidia drivers that you here and there 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.659
 There are still some extra things in some 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.579
 you can still special features 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.799
 To update 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.180
 and yes, of course, install synonymous 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.609
 Can I have it all the team 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.540
 Freiburg is also available in the 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:29.970
 to find internet 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:31.949
 So you just have to type in there 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.290
 then comes here even cool drives 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:36.060
 nvidia for mac os can too 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.120
 install is still synonymous again 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.470
 a lot of power and yes for 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.090
 you do not need this update 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.220
 Just install and set 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.009
 finished that works in any case without 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.299
 other attitudes and jan the link 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.519
 again to update you will find course 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.720
 in the description and I hope so 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.319
 I could help you again with 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.780
 this little tutorial and yes writes 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.879
 also the comments whether your success 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.379
 or maybe you have too 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.799
 a few ideas but what I learned 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.079
 his 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.989
 because the german community is now 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.810
 not so badly available on youtube 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.459
 yes so I hope you liked it 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.769
 and the side punches have been hit 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.769
 thanks for the job to protect
