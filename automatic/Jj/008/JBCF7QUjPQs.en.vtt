00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it's not always easy to do because one

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.869 
it's not always easy to do because one
of<00:00:49.109> the<00:00:49.289> most<00:00:49.500> difficult<00:00:50.010> things<00:00:50.280> about<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
of the most difficult things about the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.950 
of the most difficult things about the
electric<00:00:51.210> guitar<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:52.129> it<00:00:53.129> has<00:00:53.370> six<00:00:53.699> strings<00:00:53.969> so

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
electric guitar is it has six strings so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.520 
electric guitar is it has six strings so
if<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.230> play<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.829> note<00:00:57.109> especially<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.469> you

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
if you play one note especially if you

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.270 
if you play one note especially if you
play<00:00:58.679> it<00:00:58.769> hard<00:00:59.780> it<00:01:00.780> means<00:01:01.409> that<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.100> other

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
play it hard it means that the other

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.310 
play it hard it means that the other
five<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.570> control<00:01:03.929> them<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.110> they

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
five you have to control them so they

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.260 
five you have to control them so they
won't<00:01:04.440> make<00:01:04.620> noise<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.850> don't<00:01:06.000> control

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
won't make noise if you don't control

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.980 
won't make noise if you don't control
them<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.510> sounds<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.810> ugly

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
them it sounds like this and that's ugly

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.250 
them it sounds like this and that's ugly
so<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.650> want<00:01:10.980> to<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.490> various<00:01:12.450> parts<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.140> your

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
so you want to use various parts of your

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.800 
so you want to use various parts of your
left<00:01:13.560> hand<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.790> mute<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.270> those<00:01:15.630> other

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
left hand to mute out those other

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.389 
left hand to mute out those other
strings<00:01:16.140> because<00:01:16.409> I'm<00:01:16.500> actually<00:01:16.649> picking<00:01:17.009> all

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
strings because I'm actually picking all

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.730 
strings because I'm actually picking all
six<00:01:18.180> notes<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:19.380> my<00:01:19.970> much<00:01:20.970> forces<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.600> can

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
six notes with my much forces I can

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.100 
six notes with my much forces I can
but<00:01:24.340> if<00:01:24.430> I<00:01:24.520> mute<00:01:24.759> properly<00:01:25.299> only<00:01:25.509> that<00:01:25.810> one<00:01:25.930> it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
but if I mute properly only that one it

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.679 
but if I mute properly only that one it
will<00:01:26.200> come<00:01:26.350> out<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.759> specifics<00:01:28.390> of<00:01:28.509> how

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
will come out so the specifics of how

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.569 
will come out so the specifics of how
I'm<00:01:28.750> doing<00:01:29.020> that<00:01:29.049> is<00:01:29.290> I'm<00:01:29.470> using<00:01:29.920> this<00:01:30.220> part<00:01:30.490> of

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
I'm doing that is I'm using this part of

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.080 
I'm doing that is I'm using this part of
my<00:01:30.670> hand<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.750> mute<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:33.340> treble<00:01:33.700> e<00:01:33.790> strings

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
my hand to mute the treble e strings

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.580 
my hand to mute the treble e strings
using<00:01:34.930> my<00:01:35.049> sum<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.869> mute<00:01:38.049> out<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.320> bottom

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
using my sum to mute out the bottom

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.289 
using my sum to mute out the bottom
string<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.070> this<00:01:39.579> probably<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:39.970> smallest

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
string and this probably the smallest

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.779 
string and this probably the smallest
motion<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:40.840> I'm<00:01:40.899> using<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.259> very<00:01:41.530> tip<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:42.130> my

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
motion and I'm using the very tip of my

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.130 
motion and I'm using the very tip of my
third<00:01:43.000> finger<00:01:43.240> which<00:01:43.509> is<00:01:43.539> playing<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.929> note

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
third finger which is playing the note

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.399 
third finger which is playing the note
on<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:45.310> D<00:01:45.429> string<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.850> it's<00:01:46.299> touching<00:01:46.720> just

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
on the D string and it's touching just

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.109 
on the D string and it's touching just
very<00:01:47.679> lightly<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.970> eighth<00:01:49.149> string<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:52.030> it

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
very lightly the eighth string so it

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:03.719 
very lightly the eighth string so it
doesn't<00:01:52.179> ring<00:01:52.990> out<00:01:53.229> so<00:01:53.770> that<00:01:53.920> way<00:02:02.670> there's<00:02:03.670> a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
doesn't ring out so that way there's a

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.240 
doesn't ring out so that way there's a
way<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:03.970> practice<00:02:04.179> scales<00:02:04.690> just<00:02:05.350> do<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.009> one

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
way to practice scales just do it one

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.320 
way to practice scales just do it one
note<00:02:06.399> at<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.549> time<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.850> pick<00:02:07.000> everything

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
note at a time and pick everything

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.509 
note at a time and pick everything
there's<00:02:07.990> great<00:02:08.319> technique<00:02:08.739> so<00:02:08.950> really<00:02:09.310> pay

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
there's great technique so really pay

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:10.590 
there's great technique so really pay

this<00:03:04.690> nice<00:03:04.900> muffle<00:03:05.350> e<00:03:05.440> sound<00:03:05.740> but<00:03:06.400> this<00:03:06.580> is

this nice muffle e sound but this is

this nice muffle e sound but this is
more<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.000> sharp<00:03:07.360> sound<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.700> way<00:03:12.730> it

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
more of a sharp sound and the way it

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.050 
more of a sharp sound and the way it
works<00:03:13.180> is<00:03:13.480> imagine<00:03:14.080> my<00:03:14.230> arm<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.820> the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
works is imagine my arm is the is the

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.280 
works is imagine my arm is the is the
string<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.660> if<00:03:17.440> I'm<00:03:17.560> picking<00:03:17.890> down<00:03:18.340> I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
string and if I'm picking down I

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.259 
string and if I'm picking down I
immediately<00:03:20.290> pick<00:03:20.530> up<00:03:20.709> again<00:03:21.160> except<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.880> stop

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
immediately pick up again except I stop

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.750 
immediately pick up again except I stop
and<00:03:22.570> just<00:03:22.630> hold<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.080> string<00:03:23.320> in<00:03:23.410> place<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:24.610> it

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
and just hold the string in place so it

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.940 
and just hold the string in place so it
if<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.420> makes<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.810> note<00:03:26.019> and<00:03:26.290> this<00:03:26.470> stops<00:03:26.739> it

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
if this makes the note and this stops it

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.650 
if this makes the note and this stops it
you<00:03:27.489> can<00:03:27.640> do<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:27.880> other<00:03:27.910> way<00:03:28.120> as<00:03:28.360> well<00:03:28.390> you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
you can do it the other way as well you

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.479 
you can do it the other way as well you
can<00:03:28.810> pick<00:03:28.989> up<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.350> then<00:03:29.800> you<00:03:29.920> can<00:03:30.010> stop<00:03:30.310> it

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
can pick up and then you can stop it

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.130 
can pick up and then you can stop it
with<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.820> down<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.690> don't<00:03:31.780> know<00:03:31.959> if<00:03:32.080> you

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
with the down so I don't know if you

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.470 
with the down so I don't know if you
I'll<00:03:32.709> try<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:32.950> do<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.670> just<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.060> bunch<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:34.300> times

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
I'll try to do it just a bunch of times

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.830 
I'll try to do it just a bunch of times
so<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.660> can<00:03:34.720> see<00:03:36.420> I'm<00:03:37.420> actually<00:03:37.570> doing

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
so you can see I'm actually doing

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.780 
so you can see I'm actually doing
alternate<00:03:38.380> picking<00:03:38.530> I'm<00:03:38.709> doing<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.070> down<00:03:39.250> and

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
alternate picking I'm doing it down and

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.640 
alternate picking I'm doing it down and
stopping<00:03:40.330> it<00:03:40.510> with<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.660> up<00:03:40.780> then<00:03:41.350> I'm<00:03:41.470> doing

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
stopping it with the up then I'm doing

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.259 
stopping it with the up then I'm doing
it<00:03:41.709> up<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:42.220> stopping<00:03:42.550> with<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.700> down<00:03:47.579> now<00:03:48.579> my

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
it up and stopping with the down now my

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.759 
it up and stopping with the down now my
palm<00:03:49.510> is<00:03:49.540> actually<00:03:49.989> muting<00:03:50.290> out<00:03:50.410> some<00:03:50.680> of

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
palm is actually muting out some of

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:51.840 
palm is actually muting out some of
these<00:03:50.860> strings<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.370> they<00:03:51.459> don't<00:03:51.610> make<00:03:51.700> any

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
these strings so they don't make any

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.970 
these strings so they don't make any
noise<00:03:52.120> but<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.930> string<00:03:53.170> that<00:03:53.290> I'm<00:03:53.410> playing<00:03:53.680> is

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
noise but the string that I'm playing is

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.800 
noise but the string that I'm playing is
not<00:03:54.250> being<00:03:54.459> mooted<00:03:54.730> by<00:03:54.790> my<00:03:55.000> palm<00:03:55.239> it's<00:03:55.540> purely

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
not being mooted by my palm it's purely

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.380 
not being mooted by my palm it's purely
being<00:03:56.019> muted<00:03:56.290> by<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.470> pick<00:03:59.579> and<00:04:00.579> I<00:04:01.060> really

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
being muted by the pick and I really

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.449 
being muted by the pick and I really
like<00:04:01.630> this<00:04:01.870> sound<00:04:02.170> you<00:04:02.350> can<00:04:02.500> make<00:04:02.530> really

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
like this sound you can make really

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.840 
like this sound you can make really
interesting<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.120> very<00:04:04.269> aggressive<00:04:04.810> sounding

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
interesting and very aggressive sounding

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:39.900 
interesting and very aggressive sounding
licks<00:04:06.850> by<00:04:07.120> going

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.300 

so<00:04:40.910> it's<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.240> great<00:04:41.510> technique<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.979> of<00:04:43.130> course

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
so it's a great technique and of course

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.650 
so it's a great technique and of course
there's<00:04:43.580> regular<00:04:43.970> old<00:04:44.150> meeting<00:04:44.389> with<00:04:44.570> your

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
there's regular old meeting with your

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.120 
there's regular old meeting with your
palm<00:04:44.900> again<00:04:45.680> very<00:04:45.949> useful<00:04:46.010> just<00:04:48.040> gives<00:04:49.040> you

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
palm again very useful just gives you

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.530 
palm again very useful just gives you
that<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.580> makes<00:04:49.699> you<00:04:49.820> make<00:04:49.970> this<00:04:50.060> kind<00:04:50.300> of<00:04:50.360> face

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
that it makes you make this kind of face

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.960 
that it makes you make this kind of face
it

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.270 

that's<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.030> very<00:04:57.180> metal<00:04:57.660> it's<00:04:57.840> very

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
that's a very metal it's very

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.330 
that's a very metal it's very
chug-chug-chug<00:05:00.620> especially<00:05:01.620> if<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:01.830> do<00:05:02.039> one

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
chug-chug-chug especially if you do one

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.270 
chug-chug-chug especially if you do one
big<00:05:02.639> upstroke<00:05:03.330> on<00:05:04.199> all<00:05:04.410> six<00:05:04.680> strings<00:05:04.860> before

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
big upstroke on all six strings before

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:14.210 
big upstroke on all six strings before
you<00:05:05.340> hit<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.520> chord

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.029 

so<00:05:15.220> that's<00:05:15.460> some<00:05:15.759> ways<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:16.419> control<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:17.770> notes

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
so that's some ways to control the notes
