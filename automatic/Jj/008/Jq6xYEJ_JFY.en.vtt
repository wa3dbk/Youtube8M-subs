see<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.940> think<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.240> start<00:00:18.539> off<00:00:18.660> as<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.949> c-minus

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
see I think you start off as a c-minus

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.279 
see I think you start off as a c-minus
so<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.090> levelled<00:00:21.449> up<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.689> little<00:00:21.930> bit<00:00:22.109> but

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
so we have levelled up a little bit but

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.980 
so we have levelled up a little bit but
not<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:22.800> enough<00:00:23.039> yet<00:00:23.670> that's<00:00:24.449> actually

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
really fun it's obviously on both battle

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.209 
really fun it's obviously on both battle
modes<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.020> I'll<00:00:43.350> definitely<00:00:43.739> show<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:43.980> it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
modes and I'll definitely show you it

other<00:00:44.610> than<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> think<00:00:45.420> there<00:00:45.539> was<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> gun

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
other than that I think there was a gun

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.479 
other than that I think there was a gun
and<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> few<00:00:46.379> little<00:00:46.620> tweaks<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.039> nothing's

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and a few little tweaks but nothing's

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.180 
and a few little tweaks but nothing's
too<00:00:47.820> different<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.600> honest<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.710> today

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
too different to be honest and today

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.770 
too different to be honest and today
we're<00:00:50.399> also<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.850> using<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.420> which

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
we're also going to be using this which

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
never kill them but the difference in

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.859 
never kill them but the difference in
ranked<00:01:26.340> battles<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> brand<00:01:27.689> new<00:01:27.750> game

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
which is insane we got no kills but we

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.600 
which is insane we got no kills but we
did<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.079> quite<00:01:55.259> good<00:01:55.500> coverage<00:01:55.920> which<00:01:56.430> I'm

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
did get quite good coverage which I'm

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.920 
did get quite good coverage which I'm
quite<00:01:56.820> happy<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.540> more<00:01:57.899> about

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
quite happy with so this is more about

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.200 
quite happy with so this is more about
I'd<00:01:58.530> say<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.009> mode<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.460> more<00:01:59.670> about<00:01:59.820> killing

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
I'd say this mode is more about killing

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.700 
I'd say this mode is more about killing
people<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.630> making<00:02:00.780> sure<00:02:00.990> they<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:01.380> cover

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
people and making sure they don't cover

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.039 
people and making sure they don't cover
that<00:02:01.799> area<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:03.420> actually<00:02:03.840> really

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
that area and it's actually really

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:04.880 
that area and it's actually really
really<00:02:04.469> fun

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
really fun

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.469 
really fun

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
can see there in the stages down below

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.570 
can see there in the stages down below
in<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.630> bottom<00:02:29.990> left<00:02:30.230> there<00:02:30.740> is<00:02:30.920> kelp<00:02:31.280> dome

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
in the bottom left there is kelp dome

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.260 
in the bottom left there is kelp dome
that<00:02:32.240> is<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.020> new<00:02:33.230> stage<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.070> hopefully<00:02:34.670> this

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
that is the new stage and hopefully this

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.670 
that is the new stage and hopefully this
round<00:02:35.600> we're<00:02:35.780> going<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.960> be<00:02:36.020> able<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.260> get<00:02:36.440> on

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
round we're going to be able to get on

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.230 
round we're going to be able to get on
to<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.520> can<00:02:37.640> see<00:02:37.760> as<00:02:37.880> well<00:02:38.060> our

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
to it and you can see as well our

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.050 
to it and you can see as well our
multiplier<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.320> plus<00:02:39.650> 1<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.280> says<00:02:40.490> toasty

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
multiplier is on plus 1 it says toasty

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.240 
multiplier is on plus 1 it says toasty
which<00:02:41.540> basically<00:02:41.900> gives<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.440> more<00:02:42.920> coins

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
which basically gives you more coins

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.280 
which basically gives you more coins
every<00:02:43.670> time<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:44.030> battle<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.020> more<00:02:45.170> you

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
every time you battle so the more you

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.530 
every time you battle so the more you
battle<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:46.130> higher<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:46.760> goes<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.210> think<00:02:47.270> goes

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
battle the higher that goes I think goes

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.350 
battle the higher that goes I think goes
up<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.780> 3.5<00:02:48.530> or<00:02:48.800> something<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:49.970> get<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> lot

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
up to 3.5 or something so you get a lot

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.380 
up to 3.5 or something so you get a lot
more<00:02:50.390> coins<00:02:50.750> here<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.590> kelp<00:02:52.460> dome<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:53.150> one

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
more coins here it is kelp dome the one

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.770 
more coins here it is kelp dome the one
the<00:02:53.630> only<00:02:53.660> kelp<00:02:54.380> dome<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:54.710> should<00:02:55.100> say<00:02:55.780> the

brand new map we green again and I'll
see<00:02:59.270> we're<00:02:59.390> gonna<00:02:59.480> be<00:02:59.630> using<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.900> crack<00:03:00.140> on

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
see we're gonna be using the crack on

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.040 
see we're gonna be using the crack on
splat<00:03:01.460> roller<00:03:01.700> let's<00:03:02.210> see<00:03:02.420> how<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.660> does<00:03:02.690> so

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
splat roller let's see how it does so

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.930 
splat roller let's see how it does so
first<00:03:03.320> off<00:03:03.590> I'm<00:03:04.100> gonna<00:03:04.250> let<00:03:04.400> my<00:03:04.520> team<00:03:04.760> go

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
first off I'm gonna let my team go

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.940 
first off I'm gonna let my team go
forward<00:03:05.390> we're<00:03:05.540> gonna<00:03:05.630> cover<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.230> rear<00:03:06.500> area

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
forward we're gonna cover this rear area

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.380 
forward we're gonna cover this rear area
just<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.310> that<00:03:07.460> hopefully<00:03:07.850> we<00:03:07.970> can<00:03:08.090> get<00:03:08.240> our

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
just so that hopefully we can get our

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.660 
just so that hopefully we can get our
Kraken<00:03:08.900> pretty<00:03:09.500> nice<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.040> early<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.400> pretty

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
Kraken pretty nice and early and pretty

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.940 
Kraken pretty nice and early and pretty
quickly<00:03:10.940> actually<00:03:11.230> which<00:03:12.230> we<00:03:12.380> should<00:03:12.440> be<00:03:12.710> able

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
quickly actually which we should be able

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.590 
quickly actually which we should be able
to<00:03:13.160> do<00:03:13.370> we're<00:03:13.580> already<00:03:13.760> pretty<00:03:14.030> much<00:03:14.270> got<00:03:14.480> him

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
to do we're already pretty much got him

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.690 
to do we're already pretty much got him
so<00:03:14.720> we<00:03:14.840> can<00:03:15.020> go<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:15.590> like<00:03:16.100> destroy

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
so we can go in and just like destroy

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.780 
so we can go in and just like destroy
that<00:03:17.000> area<00:03:17.390> once<00:03:17.600> we<00:03:17.750> get<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.020> crack<00:03:18.230> on<00:03:18.790> let's

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
that area once we get the crack on let's

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.260 
that area once we get the crack on let's
keep<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.150> going<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.720> fill<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.560> up<00:03:21.710> so<00:03:22.610> it's<00:03:22.910> the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
keep it going and fill it up so it's the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.020 
keep it going and fill it up so it's the
place<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:23.870> always<00:03:24.170> in<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.620> center<00:03:24.890> on<00:03:25.370> some<00:03:25.880> of

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
place is always in the center on some of

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.730 
place is always in the center on some of
the<00:03:26.150> maps<00:03:26.360> though<00:03:26.570> there<00:03:26.780> are<00:03:26.960> actually<00:03:27.470> two

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
the maps though there are actually two

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.040 
the maps though there are actually two
crap<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.280> two<00:03:28.460> Krakens<00:03:28.820> there<00:03:29.030> are<00:03:29.150> two<00:03:29.450> areas

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
crap and two Krakens there are two areas

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.320 
crap and two Krakens there are two areas
to<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.890> get<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.340> once<00:03:31.520> you<00:03:31.640> get<00:03:31.760> both<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.150> them

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
destroy people but we might even oh we

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.610 
destroy people but we might even oh we
couldn't<00:05:06.000> possibly<00:05:06.180> if<00:05:06.630> we<00:05:06.780> win<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.080> next<00:05:07.260> one

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620

rank<00:05:10.140> which<00:05:10.380> is<00:05:10.530> exciting<00:05:11.240> so<00:05:12.240> I<00:05:12.570> don't<00:05:13.200> think

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
rank which is exciting so I don't think

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.290 
rank which is exciting so I don't think
you<00:05:13.530> we<00:05:14.010> might<00:05:14.280> unlock<00:05:14.640> something<00:05:14.940> when<00:05:15.210> you

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300

go up to be I'm not 100% sure but we'll
definitely<00:05:17.550> see<00:05:18.030> if<00:05:18.900> that<00:05:19.260> is<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.680> case<00:05:19.890> but

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
enemy right there - okay right does he

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.430 
enemy right there - okay right does he
know<00:06:00.210> I'm<00:06:00.330> here<00:06:00.360> or<00:06:00.780> what<00:06:02.180> boom<00:06:03.180> baby<00:06:03.600> no<00:06:04.200> he

know I'm here or what boom baby no he

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.810 
know I'm here or what boom baby no he
did<00:06:04.590> not<00:06:04.620> know<00:06:05.070> we<00:06:05.220> were<00:06:05.340> there

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
did not know we were there

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.300 
did not know we were there
that<00:06:06.270> was<00:06:06.540> that<00:06:06.750> was<00:06:06.900> edgy<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:07.200> nice<00:06:07.410> kill<00:06:07.680> we

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
that was that was edgy a nice kill we

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.390 
that was that was edgy a nice kill we
kind<00:06:08.760> of<00:06:08.820> snuck<00:06:09.150> up<00:06:09.270> on<00:06:09.419> that<00:06:09.600> guy<00:06:09.810> and<00:06:10.280> we<00:06:11.280> can

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
kind of snuck up on that guy and we can

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.400 
kind of snuck up on that guy and we can
start<00:06:11.640> covering<00:06:12.120> so<00:06:12.270> I<00:06:12.300> think<00:06:12.390> the<00:06:12.750> enemy<00:06:13.230> have

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
start covering so I think the enemy have

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.050 
start covering so I think the enemy have
actually<00:06:13.710> got<00:06:13.890> more<00:06:14.040> coverage<00:06:14.490> so<00:06:14.730> far

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
actually got more coverage so far

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.480 
actually got more coverage so far
I<00:06:15.570> need<00:06:16.080> eight<00:06:16.260> oh<00:06:16.500> my<00:06:16.710> god<00:06:16.919> yeah<00:06:17.190> I<00:06:17.220> need<00:06:17.460> to
