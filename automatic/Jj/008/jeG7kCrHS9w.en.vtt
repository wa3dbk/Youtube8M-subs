00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
in a different video we're hoping two

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.940 
in a different video we're hoping two
packs<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> same<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.590> showing<00:00:40.860> or

packs of the same one showing or
something<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.840> see<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.230> get<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> same

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
something and see if we get the same

something and see if we get the same
hidden<00:00:43.770> one<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.100> what<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> case<00:00:44.579> may<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.730> there

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
hidden one or what the case may be there

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.410 
hidden one or what the case may be there
if<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.260> already<00:00:46.440> know<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.610> set<00:00:47.940> size<00:00:48.180> for<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
if you already know the set size for the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.930 
if you already know the set size for the
u.s.<00:00:48.600> ones<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.079> half<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> size<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.430> United

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
u.s. ones is half the size as the United

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.729 
u.s. ones is half the size as the United
Kingdom<00:00:50.969> ones<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.989> ones<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.230> get<00:00:52.320> from<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> UK

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
Kingdom ones the ones I get from the UK

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.560 
Kingdom ones the ones I get from the UK
with<00:00:52.949> two<00:00:53.520> per<00:00:53.730> pack<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.180> both<00:00:54.300> hidden

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
with two per pack that are both hidden

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.380 
with two per pack that are both hidden
the<00:00:55.260> checklist<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.489> 48<00:00:57.030> different

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the checklist as I think 48 different

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.900 
the checklist as I think 48 different
this<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.570> 24<00:00:58.140> different<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.070> only<00:00:59.399> half<00:00:59.640> them

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
this is 24 different so only half them

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.910 
this is 24 different so only half them
are<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> u.s.<00:01:00.300> set<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> guess<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> rest

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
are in the u.s. set so I guess the rest

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920 
are in the u.s. set so I guess the rest
will<00:01:02.039> come<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> series<00:01:02.760> ii<00:01:03.000> don't<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.660> when

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
will come in a series ii don't know when

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.710 
will come in a series ii don't know when
that's<00:01:04.650> happening<00:01:05.040> assuming<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.700> does<00:01:05.909> but

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that's happening assuming it does but

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840

I've<00:06:48.599> only<00:06:48.659> open<00:06:48.930> five<00:06:49.110> packs<00:06:49.349> so<00:06:49.560> far<00:06:49.830> but

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
I've only open five packs so far but

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.529 
I've only open five packs so far but
figure<00:06:50.819> it<00:06:50.879> one<00:06:50.969> of<00:06:51.029> the<00:06:51.090> purple<00:06:51.300> glittery

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
figure it one of the purple glittery

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:54.769 
figure it one of the purple glittery
ones<00:06:51.690> at<00:06:51.810> least<00:06:51.840> I<00:06:52.370> kind<00:06:53.370> of<00:06:53.490> if<00:06:54.360> I<00:06:54.509> had<00:06:54.690> to

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:54.779 
ones at least I kind of if I had to

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:57.050 
ones at least I kind of if I had to
guess<00:06:54.990> I'd<00:06:55.259> say<00:06:55.319> ultra<00:06:56.190> rares<00:06:56.400> are<00:06:56.789> wearing

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
guess I'd say ultra rares are wearing

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.550 
guess I'd say ultra rares are wearing
six<00:06:57.240> packs<00:06:57.479> and<00:06:57.779> glittery<00:06:58.110> ones<00:06:58.319> are<00:06:58.409> wearing

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
six packs and glittery ones are wearing

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.260 
six packs and glittery ones are wearing
six<00:06:58.710> packs<00:06:58.949> so<00:06:59.250> you<00:06:59.339> get<00:06:59.430> one<00:06:59.639> for<00:06:59.849> three<00:07:00.029> packs

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
six packs so you get one for three packs

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.450 
six packs so you get one for three packs
between<00:07:00.960> the<00:07:01.050> two<00:07:01.229> on<00:07:01.379> average<00:07:01.770> I<00:07:02.009> think

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
between the two on average I think

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.999 
between the two on average I think
that'd<00:07:02.819> be<00:07:02.849> kind<00:07:03.449> of<00:07:03.479> fair<00:07:03.690> but<00:07:04.409> again<00:07:04.770> I<00:07:04.830> have

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:05.009 
that'd be kind of fair but again I have

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:07.010 
that'd be kind of fair but again I have
no<00:07:05.400> clue<00:07:05.639> of<00:07:05.819> what<00:07:06.150> the<00:07:06.360> distribution<00:07:06.690> of

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
no clue of what the distribution of

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.779 
no clue of what the distribution of
rarity<00:07:07.289> of<00:07:07.379> them<00:07:07.469> may<00:07:07.589> actually<00:07:07.620> be<00:07:08.069> so<00:07:10.789> make

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:11.789 
rarity of them may actually be so make

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:13.790 
rarity of them may actually be so make
