they've learned with their track time
here<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.949> how<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:05.640> hope<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.850> innovate<00:01:06.330> for

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
here and how they hope to innovate for

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.580 
here and how they hope to innovate for
upcoming<00:01:06.810> seasons

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.690 

we<00:01:11.590> are<00:01:11.650> learning<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.980> lot<00:01:12.130> because<00:01:12.490> we're

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
we are learning a lot because we're

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.760 
we are learning a lot because we're
starting<00:01:13.000> from<00:01:13.150> scratch<00:01:13.210> we<00:01:13.930> know<00:01:14.440> how<00:01:14.590> race

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
starting from scratch we know how race

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.830 
starting from scratch we know how race
cars<00:01:15.040> great<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.120> you<00:01:16.180> know<00:01:16.300> how<00:01:16.360> to<00:01:16.420> set<00:01:16.690> them

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
cars great and you know how to set them

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.210 
cars great and you know how to set them
up<00:01:16.960> with<00:01:16.990> these<00:01:17.230> cars<00:01:17.500> are<00:01:17.620> brand<00:01:17.920> new<00:01:18.010> to<00:01:18.160> it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
up with these cars are brand new to it

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.180 
up with these cars are brand new to it
and<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.840> we<00:01:20.140> have<00:01:20.260> to<00:01:20.440> learn<00:01:20.590> about<00:01:20.650> the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
and so we have to learn about the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.770 
and so we have to learn about the
chassis<00:01:21.460> on<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.670> car<00:01:21.910> itself<00:01:22.150> in<00:01:22.420> terms<00:01:22.570> of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
chassis on the car itself in terms of

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.870 
chassis on the car itself in terms of
Iroh<00:01:23.290> package<00:01:23.680> and<00:01:23.950> downforce<00:01:24.580> and

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
Iroh package and downforce and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.060 
Iroh package and downforce and
mechanical<00:01:25.390> grip<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.840> all<00:01:25.930> these<00:01:26.050> things<00:01:26.110> but

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
mechanical grip and all these things but

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.800 
mechanical grip and all these things but
most<00:01:27.370> importantly<00:01:27.790> we<00:01:27.970> have<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.360> learn<00:01:28.540> about

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
most importantly we have to learn about

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.590 
most importantly we have to learn about
the<00:01:28.990> electric<00:01:29.380> car<00:01:29.560> train<00:01:30.150> power<00:01:31.150> into<00:01:31.570> the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
the electric car train power into the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.990 
the electric car train power into the
DVD<00:01:32.320> in<00:01:32.470> terms<00:01:32.710> of<00:01:32.830> power<00:01:33.040> consumption<00:01:33.460> in

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
DVD in terms of power consumption in

DVD in terms of power consumption in
terms<00:01:34.270> of<00:01:34.390> all<00:01:34.570> these<00:01:34.720> things<00:01:35.020> that<00:01:35.200> we<00:01:35.350> need

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
terms of all these things that we need

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.840 
terms of all these things that we need
to<00:01:35.620> understand<00:01:35.979> all<00:01:36.070> these<00:01:36.190> data<00:01:36.460> that<00:01:36.729> we

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
to understand all these data that we

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.960 
to understand all these data that we
need<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.030> gather<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.810> analyze<00:01:38.440> in<00:01:39.430> order<00:01:39.729> to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
need to gather and analyze in order to

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:48.120 
need to gather and analyze in order to
go<00:01:40.600> racing<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:46.180> focused<00:01:46.690> a<00:01:46.810> lot<00:01:46.960> on<00:01:47.130> learning

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
go racing we focused a lot on learning

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.590 
go racing we focused a lot on learning
about<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.490> battery<00:01:48.910> learning<00:01:49.270> about<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
about the battery learning about the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.150 
about the battery learning about the
regen<00:01:50.080> paddle<00:01:50.500> learning<00:01:51.250> about<00:01:51.430> how<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.750> life

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
regen paddle learning about how the life

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.510 
regen paddle learning about how the life
span<00:01:54.160> of<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.030> battery<00:01:55.330> decreases<00:01:55.869> and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
span of the of the battery decreases and

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.770 
span of the of the battery decreases and
obviously<00:01:57.520> then<00:01:57.729> doing<00:01:57.940> some<00:01:58.119> fast<00:01:58.330> laps<00:01:58.630> as

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
obviously then doing some fast laps as

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.050 
obviously then doing some fast laps as
well<00:01:58.960> we<00:01:59.410> are<00:01:59.560> doing<00:01:59.860> a<00:02:00.009> lot<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.190> short<00:02:00.850> runs

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
well we are doing a lot of short runs

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.090 
well we are doing a lot of short runs
full<00:02:01.360> power<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:02.290> really<00:02:02.500> set<00:02:02.650> up<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.890> car<00:02:03.070> and
