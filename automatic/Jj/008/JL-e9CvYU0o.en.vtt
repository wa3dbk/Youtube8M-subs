00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
video what is it I noticed that I'm

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.050 
video what is it I noticed that I'm
going<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> hold<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> pistol<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:29.670> cause

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
going to hold the pistol out cause

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.279 
going to hold the pistol out cause
there's<00:00:30.240> some<00:00:30.420> hard<00:00:30.630> enemies<00:00:30.929> around<00:00:31.050> here

there's some hard enemies around here

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.860 
there's some hard enemies around here
I'm<00:00:31.859> guessing<00:00:32.219> anyway<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> know<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
I'm guessing anyway I know is that the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.630 
I'm guessing anyway I know is that the
thing<00:00:34.050> was<00:00:34.140> really<00:00:34.440> bright<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.309> window

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
thing was really bright but in window

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
thing was really bright but in window
mode<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.000> brightness<00:00:36.360> didn't<00:00:36.600> had<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.840> change

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
mode the brightness didn't had to change

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.889 
mode the brightness didn't had to change
so<00:00:37.680> yeah<00:00:38.040> sort<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.000> change<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.870> up

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
so yeah sort of like change that up
