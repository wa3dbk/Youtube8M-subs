00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:03.510
 about 200 years ago 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.279
 the new science called mental medicine 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.529
 an early version of psychology 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.630
 captivated medical philosophers and educators 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.170
 that speculated about the true essence of the human being and about the 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.170
 differences between people and animals 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.199
 On the one hand, the French philosopher was already on a russo set 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.759
 who thought that people are born with all the abilities and qualities that 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.030
 they are characterized as major 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.790
 for russo is nature 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.510
 what we bring to the world when we are born the one that most affects our 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.530
 developing 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.019
 at birth we are noble wild 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.019
 that contact with society will corrupt 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.130
 on the other side of the debate was the English philosopher I did not 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.190
 for the oce a baby is a simple blank table without any kind of 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.310
 knowledge skills 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.260
 only through experience 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.190
 that we learn through contact with society we become who 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.570
 we will be 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.869
 this debate came to be known with the name of the altitude read versus culture 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.190
 in 1800 the debate was heightened with the discovery of a wild boy of 12 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.000
 year old 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.150
 who apparently had lived alone in the forest of aveyron france 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.250
 there they were a circus with no experience of society just from the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.340
 nature 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.830
 A young doctor call edit 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.150
 I try to educate and civilize the boy he called VICTOR 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.750
 at the beginning his intensive program seemed to work 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.750
 learned victim avoid danger and follow directions 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.100
 but after five years of experiences, progress stagnated 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.850
 collapsed pitarch resigned from the training program 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.460
 Victor died at 40 years of age unable to speak and behave like a 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.930
 running man 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.470
 look for many the case of aveyron's wild child was proof that 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.120
 nature more than culture affects human development 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.280
 the new environment could not overcome the basic imperfections of vÃ­ctor j without 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.260
 But others argued that we are more with products from our environment than 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.330
 blind followers of our natural genetic inheritance but who has 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.850
 reason in knowledge and skills accompany us from birth to see 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.850
 what do we learn from others 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.969
 have ever wondered who sees a baby when they are born 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.479
 -community the world 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.689
 what he likes and what he does not like 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.939
 and helpless to be 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.569
 according to cui angelines the American psychologist pioneer of the end of the century a 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.569
 baby was a totally helpless and confused organism 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.879
 yen was convinced that babies feel overwhelmed by 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.639
 overflowing sensations 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.240
 in his words a huge confusion of blurred silhouettes and buzzes 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.240
 that contrasts with the tranquility of life authority 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.169
 at the end of the 20s 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.959
 yong watson the founder of behaviorism 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.519
 described the baby as a piece of living flesh that twists capable of giving 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.729
 a few simple answers 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.609
 in 1964 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.599
 a medical manual will announce that newborns are not able to 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.619
 Focus your eyes well by responding to sounds 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:54.989
 and still today many doctors believe that babies are able to feel pain 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.989
 but they are all wrong 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.310
 in the last 20 years 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.310
 the investigations have reached an opposite conclusion 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.889
 Babies come to the world prepared to perform all kinds of feats 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.889
 amazing 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.569
 a few minutes after birth a baby is able to roll his eyes in the 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:23.210
 address where a voice comes from 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.210
 looking for the origin of the sounds you prefer 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.190
 You can stretch your hand looking for contact and turn your head to follow 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.190
 the movement of a face 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.249
 purist of the latest research also show that babies are born 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:45.400
 with certain preferences with only 12 hours of life they show their pleasure to the 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.020
 try the vanilla and smile when they smell bananas however they 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.660
 dislike the taste of the cameras 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.100
 your hearing and works from before birth this way the 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.540
 babies are ready to respond to certain sounds from the same moment 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.900
 in that they abandon the pineau profit they prefer the female voices are 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.150
 relax to sleep with a heartbeat 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
 they immediately recognize the voice of their mother 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.420
 however the view is not so developed 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.650
 Babies at birth are almost blind with only one capacity 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.189
 visual of 20 out of 500 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:25.289
 this is due to a double motive they do not have enough with or without functioning in 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.599
 the retina nor have enough connections been established between 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.680
 neurons of the visual cortex of the brain 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.680
 but both develop quickly 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:38.590
 a one month old baby 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.590
 can perceive the contour of a head at close range 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.129
 at seven weeks he smiles when he sees his mother's face 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.939
 after two months he distinguishes the colors 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:50.480
 and a three-month-old baby 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.810
 You can focus on distant objects with almost the same perfection as an adult 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.580
 at three months a baby is also able to perceive the different 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.860
 facial expressions 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.610
 reacting differently to faces that seem happy surprised 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.610
 sad to put other 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.800
 from all this it follows that babies are not as helpless as was thought 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:16.599
 actually 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.860
 are prepared to carry out the three basic tasks of childhood 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:23.710
 get the support they need 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.479
 defend against stimuli that can harm them and establish relationships 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:27.849
 social
