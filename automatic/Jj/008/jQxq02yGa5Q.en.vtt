00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.640 

we<00:01:24.550> need<00:01:24.760> to<00:01:24.910> get<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.330> bridge<00:01:25.540> from<00:01:26.320> there

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
we need to get to the bridge from there

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.950 
we need to get to the bridge from there
we<00:01:27.040> can<00:01:27.190> use<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.580> captain's<00:01:28.000> neural<00:01:28.360> implants

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
we can use the captain's neural implants

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.960 
we can use the captain's neural implants
to<00:01:29.110> initiate<00:01:29.590> an<00:01:29.770> overload<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.370> the<00:01:30.670> ship's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
to initiate an overload of the ship's

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.740 
fusion engines the explosion should
damaged<00:01:33.640> enough<00:01:33.880> systems<00:01:34.270> below<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.720> to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
damaged enough systems below it to

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.160 
damaged enough systems below it to
destroy<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.290> ring<00:01:36.660> so<00:01:37.660> you<00:01:37.720> just<00:01:37.900> want<00:01:38.110> to

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
destroy the ring so you just want to

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.840 
destroy the ring so you just want to
make<00:01:38.290> sure<00:01:38.320> you've<00:01:38.740> allowed<00:01:38.980> enough<00:01:39.280> time<00:01:39.520> for

make sure you've allowed enough time for
all<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.090> carrier<00:01:40.390> form<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:40.870> be<00:01:40.930> blown<00:01:41.110> up

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
all the carrier form to be blown up

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.789 
all the carrier form to be blown up
before<00:01:42.040> you<00:01:42.100> go<00:01:42.220> down

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.830 

let's<00:01:48.399> go<00:01:48.579> down<00:01:48.789> this<00:01:48.969> is<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.119> good<00:01:49.299> hold<00:01:49.509> spot

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
let's go down this is a good hold spot

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.209 
let's go down this is a good hold spot
you<00:01:50.049> could<00:01:50.200> take<00:01:50.380> down<00:01:50.560> all<00:01:50.710> these<00:01:50.859> sentinels

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
you could take down all these sentinels

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.580 
you could take down all these sentinels
pretty<00:01:51.520> quickly

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.709 

I<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:03.310> throw<00:02:03.490> one<00:02:03.670> grenade<00:02:03.969> here<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.539> the

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
I just throw one grenade here and the

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.179 
I just throw one grenade here and the
rest<00:02:04.869> of<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.079> walk<00:02:05.259> towards<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:06.009> blows

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
rest of the walk towards it and it blows

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:19.920 
rest of the walk towards it and it blows
most<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.640> them<00:02:06.789> up

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.690 

now<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:20.990> can<00:02:21.230> get<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.380> shotgun<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.310> pistol

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
now you can get a shotgun and a pistol

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.720 
now you can get a shotgun and a pistol
or<00:02:22.940> whatever<00:02:23.900> weapons<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.350> prefer<00:02:24.740> sometimes

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
or whatever weapons you prefer sometimes

or whatever weapons you prefer sometimes
they're<00:02:25.910> hard<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.090> find<00:02:26.180> though<00:02:26.540> because

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
they're hard to find though because

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.730 
they're hard to find though because
they're<00:02:26.870> not<00:02:26.990> always<00:02:27.170> right<00:02:27.440> out<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.680> open

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
they're not always right out in the open

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.700 
they're not always right out in the open
I<00:02:28.180> just<00:02:29.180> move<00:02:29.540> up<00:02:29.690> trigger<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.230> door<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.620> then

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
I just move up trigger the door and then

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.600 
I just move up trigger the door and then
I<00:02:30.800> step<00:02:31.040> back

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
I step back

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.080 
I step back
that's<00:02:32.330> row<00:02:32.570> grenade<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:37.730> can<00:02:37.880> throw

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
that's row grenade you can throw

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.640 
that's row grenade you can throw
grenades<00:02:38.450> around<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.840> corners<00:02:39.200> here<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.470> you

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
grenades around the corners here and you

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.610 
grenades around the corners here and you
don't<00:02:39.800> even<00:02:39.950> have<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.160> fight<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.490> flood<00:02:41.620> it

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
don't even have to fight the flood it

00:02:42.620 --> 00:03:04.210 
don't even have to fight the flood it
makes<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:42.890> pretty<00:02:42.950> easy

now here as in a lot of places on this

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.930 
now here as in a lot of places on this
level<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.740> kind<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:07.980> come<00:03:08.190> out<00:03:08.310> make<00:03:08.910> a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
gets the flight going and once I have

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.240 
gets the flight going and once I have
all<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.450> infection<00:03:15.900> form<00:03:16.170> gone<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.680> come<00:03:17.100> back

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
have infection form on them they tend to

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.590 
have infection form on them they tend to
spin<00:03:23.610> around<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.060> then<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.240> just<00:03:24.420> wait<00:03:24.540> for

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
spin around and then you just wait for

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:52.630 
spin around and then you just wait for
them<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.930> give<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.200> their<00:03:25.530> back

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.860

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
now first I'll take out some of the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.080 
now first I'll take out some of the
grunts<00:03:55.170> with<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.350> pistol<00:03:55.740> but<00:03:56.060> eventually<00:03:57.060> I

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
grunts with a pistol but eventually I

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.730 
grunts with a pistol but eventually I
want<00:03:57.240> to<00:03:57.330> look<00:03:57.480> for<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.690> plasma<00:03:58.110> pistol<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:58.680> I

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
want to look for the plasma pistol so I

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:17.420
