because<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.850> pull<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> gun<00:00:45.420> sights

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
because you pull up the gun sights

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.630 
because you pull up the gun sights
faster<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.070> feel<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.280> when<00:00:47.520> you're

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
faster and I feel like when you're

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.950 
faster and I feel like when you're
rushing<00:00:48.120> which<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.420> usually<00:00:48.690> we're<00:00:48.780> going<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
rushing which is usually we're going to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
rushing which is usually we're going to
do<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.260> an<00:00:49.350> SMG<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.739> mean<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> think<00:00:50.730> of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
do with an SMG I mean when you think of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.369 
do with an SMG I mean when you think of
submachine<00:00:51.480> gun<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> don't<00:00:51.870> think<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.170> long

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
submachine gun you don't think of long

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.970 
submachine gun you don't think of long
range<00:00:52.410> at<00:00:52.860> least<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.309> my<00:00:53.340> opinion<00:00:53.719> I<00:00:54.980> use

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
range at least not in my opinion I use

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.860 
range at least not in my opinion I use
them<00:00:56.129> at<00:00:56.219> least<00:00:56.309> four<00:00:56.520> short-range<00:00:56.870> probably

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
them at least four short-range probably

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.330 
them at least four short-range probably
which<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.320> probably<00:00:58.469> what<00:00:58.620> most<00:00:58.800> other<00:00:58.980> people

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
which is probably what most other people

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.670 
which is probably what most other people
do<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> would<00:00:59.670> think<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.210> um<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.690> find<00:01:01.140> studying

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
do I would think but um I find studying

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.990 
do I would think but um I find studying
probably<00:01:01.980> much<00:01:02.100> more<00:01:02.129> helpful<00:01:02.430> because<00:01:02.699> when

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
probably much more helpful because when

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.280 
probably much more helpful because when
you're<00:01:03.120> rushing<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.840> poke<00:01:03.989> your<00:01:04.140> gun

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
as fast you can when you're running

as fast you can when you're running
around<00:01:05.700> corners<00:01:06.150> someone<00:01:06.479> might<00:01:06.659> surprise

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
around corners someone might surprise

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.179 
around corners someone might surprise
you<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.439> want<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> pull<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:07.860> your<00:01:07.979> gun

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
sights fast as possible and studying pro

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.320 
sights fast as possible and studying pro
allows<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> pull<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.700> faster<00:01:12.180> than

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.020 
allows you to pull it up faster than
normal<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.380> found<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.310> felt<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:14.850> that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
normal so I found that I felt like that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.820 
normal so I found that I felt like that
would<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.270> more<00:01:15.479> important<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.200> since<00:01:16.680> I'm

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
would be more important and since I'm

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.219 
would be more important and since I'm
using<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.549> specialist<00:01:18.330> killstreaks<00:01:18.840> I'm

history<00:05:06.610> but<00:05:07.050> ump45<00:05:08.050> is<00:05:08.470> a<00:05:08.530> very<00:05:08.800> good<00:05:08.919> gun

history but ump45 is a very good gun
that<00:05:09.729> I<00:05:09.759> would<00:05:10.030> definitely<00:05:10.210> suggest<00:05:10.479> I<00:05:10.870> think

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
that I would definitely suggest I think

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.620 
that I would definitely suggest I think
it's<00:05:11.169> best<00:05:11.560> in<00:05:11.979> such<00:05:12.880> as<00:05:13.000> mission<00:05:13.270> worth<00:05:13.389> very

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
it's best in such as mission worth very

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.600 
it's best in such as mission worth very
tight<00:05:13.900> corners<00:05:14.289> definitely<00:05:14.919> one<00:05:15.460> of<00:05:15.490> my

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
tight corners definitely one of my

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.040 
tight corners definitely one of my
favorite<00:05:15.940> maps<00:05:16.120> obviously<00:05:16.539> I<00:05:16.570> said<00:05:16.750> then<00:05:16.870> like

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
favorite maps obviously I said then like

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.420 
favorite maps obviously I said then like
chroma<00:05:17.259> pretty<00:05:17.710> much<00:05:17.830> almost<00:05:17.979> every<00:05:18.250> video

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
chroma pretty much almost every video

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.300 
chroma pretty much almost every video
but<00:05:19.120> I<00:05:19.150> feel<00:05:19.419> like<00:05:19.449> this<00:05:19.720> gun<00:05:19.960> it<00:05:20.530> doesn't<00:05:21.070> work

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
but I feel like this gun it doesn't work

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.770 
but I feel like this gun it doesn't work
with<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.669> assault<00:05:22.000> killstreaks<00:05:22.389> as<00:05:22.509> well<00:05:22.690> as

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
with the assault killstreaks as well as

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.029 
with the assault killstreaks as well as
I<00:05:22.810> would<00:05:22.960> hope<00:05:23.169> it<00:05:23.380> would<00:05:23.560> but<00:05:23.740> I<00:05:23.770> think<00:05:23.949> it

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
I would hope it would but I think it

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.010 
I would hope it would but I think it
works<00:05:24.190> perfect<00:05:24.669> this<00:05:24.909> the<00:05:25.659> specialist

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
works perfect this the specialist

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.040 
works perfect this the specialist
killstreaks<00:05:26.440> because<00:05:26.849> SMGs<00:05:28.050> probably

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
killstreaks because SMGs probably

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.140 
killstreaks because SMGs probably
dominate<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.860> most<00:05:30.159> when<00:05:30.550> it<00:05:30.669> has<00:05:30.789> all<00:05:31.120> the

dominate the most when it has all the

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.969 
dominate the most when it has all the
perks<00:05:31.570> in<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.810> game<00:05:32.020> because<00:05:32.409> not<00:05:32.560> only<00:05:32.590> now

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
perks in the game because not only now

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.560 
perks in the game because not only now
do<00:05:33.039> you<00:05:33.340> avoid<00:05:33.669> the<00:05:33.729> radar<00:05:34.150> you<00:05:34.330> can<00:05:34.479> move

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
do you avoid the radar you can move

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.240 
do you avoid the radar you can move
faster<00:05:34.780> blaming<00:05:35.289> down<00:05:35.380> sights<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:35.800> still

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
faster blaming down sights and still

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.610 
faster blaming down sights and still
hope<00:05:36.849> your<00:05:37.030> gun<00:05:37.180> faster<00:05:37.659> and<00:05:37.930> you<00:05:38.259> can<00:05:38.409> have

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.279 
hope your gun faster and you can have
you<00:05:39.370> don't<00:05:39.550> you<00:05:39.849> won't<00:05:40.180> have<00:05:40.389> you<00:05:40.840> have<00:05:40.960> silent

footsteps<00:05:41.380> I<00:05:41.650> think<00:05:41.889> the<00:05:42.039> SMGs<00:05:42.580> better<00:05:42.789> just

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
footsteps I think the SMGs better just

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.370 
footsteps I think the SMGs better just
