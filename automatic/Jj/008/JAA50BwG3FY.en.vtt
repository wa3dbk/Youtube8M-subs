that's<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:55.649> saying<00:01:55.890> I'm<00:01:56.189> just

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that's not what I'm saying I'm just

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.370 
that's not what I'm saying I'm just
saying<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.820> an<00:01:56.909> interesting<00:01:57.380> coincidence

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
saying it's an interesting coincidence

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.209 
saying it's an interesting coincidence
and<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:59.189> fact<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.759> beyond<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.299> it's

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
and in fact going beyond that it's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.090 
and in fact going beyond that it's
intriguing<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.700> delve<00:02:03.000> into<00:02:03.360> what<00:02:03.810> Carl<00:02:04.710> Jung

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
intriguing to delve into what Carl Jung

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.510 
intriguing to delve into what Carl Jung
called<00:02:06.170> synchronicity<00:02:07.170> which<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.069> defined<00:02:08.399> as

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
called synchronicity which is defined as

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.369 
called synchronicity which is defined as
the<00:02:08.640> experience<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.270> two<00:02:09.479> or<00:02:09.660> more<00:02:09.690> events

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the experience of two or more events

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.650 
the experience of two or more events
which<00:02:10.590> occur<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.129> meaningful<00:02:11.550> manner<00:02:11.760> but

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
which occur in a meaningful manner but

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.820 
which occur in a meaningful manner but
which<00:02:12.870> are<00:02:13.080> core

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
which are core

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.480 
which are core
easily<00:02:14.240> unrelated<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.830> was<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> idea

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
easily unrelated so this was the idea

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.550 
easily unrelated so this was the idea
which<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.060> obviously<00:02:18.480> being<00:02:18.750> challenged<00:02:19.350> by

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
which is obviously being challenged by

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.240 
which is obviously being challenged by

basically outlined the concept that

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.980

these kind of synchronicities are not

these kind of synchronicities are not

Guy before remember last year after the
Boston<00:03:37.560> bombings<00:03:38.040> an<00:03:38.489> episode<00:03:39.060> emerged<00:03:39.420> of

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
Boston bombings an episode emerged of

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.690 
Boston bombings an episode emerged of
FAMILY<00:03:40.230> GUY<00:03:40.260> which<00:03:40.590> had<00:03:40.709> been<00:03:40.890> broadcast<00:03:41.100> just

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
FAMILY GUY which had been broadcast just

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.630 
FAMILY GUY which had been broadcast just
before<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.300> Boston<00:03:43.110> Marathon<00:03:43.560> attack<00:03:43.860> which

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
before the Boston Marathon attack which

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.199 
before the Boston Marathon attack which
showed<00:03:45.030> people<00:03:45.600> being<00:03:46.260> killed<00:03:46.709> at<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.670> Boston

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
showed people being killed at the Boston

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.509 
showed people being killed at the Boston
Marathon<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.440> we've<00:03:49.680> seen<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.160> kind<00:03:50.220> of

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
Marathon so we've seen this kind of

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.810 
Marathon so we've seen this kind of
synchronicity<00:03:51.170> with<00:03:52.170> something<00:03:52.920> as<00:03:53.100> abstract

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
synchronicity with something as abstract

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.020 
synchronicity with something as abstract
as<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.330> Family<00:03:54.720> Guy<00:03:54.750> episode<00:03:55.110> beforehand<00:03:56.100> so

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
as a Family Guy episode beforehand so

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.729 
as a Family Guy episode beforehand so
again<00:03:57.269> it's<00:03:57.420> interesting<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:58.110> this<00:03:58.260> episode

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
again it's interesting that this episode

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.430 
again it's interesting that this episode
was<00:03:58.980> being<00:03:59.310> broadcast<00:03:59.810> minutes<00:04:00.810> before<00:04:01.260> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
was being broadcast minutes before the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.830 
was being broadcast minutes before the
actual<00:04:01.890> suicide<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.700> Robin<00:04:03.239> Williams<00:04:03.540> and

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
actual suicide of Robin Williams and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.650 
actual suicide of Robin Williams and
again<00:04:04.380> I'm<00:04:05.130> not<00:04:05.430> saying<00:04:05.760> it's<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.360> conspiracy

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660

lunatics<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.820> point<00:04:18.090> I'm<00:04:18.239> making<00:04:18.450> is<00:04:18.840> it's

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
lunatics the point I'm making is it's

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.500 
lunatics the point I'm making is it's
interesting<00:04:20.190> whether<00:04:20.669> these<00:04:21.000> kind<00:04:21.390> of
