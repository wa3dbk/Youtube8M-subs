00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.040 
stopping him while patting out the fire
you<00:03:00.959> see<00:03:01.110> these<00:03:01.379> are<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.879> barrel<00:03:03.120> traps<00:03:03.390> money

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
you see these are the barrel traps money

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.990 
you see these are the barrel traps money
well<00:03:04.319> spent<00:03:04.349> on<00:03:04.920> those<00:03:05.040> barrel<00:03:05.400> traps<00:03:05.640> on<00:03:05.849> this

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000

well spent on those barrel traps on this
way<00:03:06.150> yet<00:03:06.330> buying<00:03:06.569> those<00:03:06.810> really<00:03:07.110> helped<00:03:07.319> out

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
way yet buying those really helped out

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.960 
way yet buying those really helped out
here<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:08.340> can<00:03:08.459> see<00:03:08.549> why<00:03:08.670> they're<00:03:08.849> so

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
here you can see why they're so

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.020 
here you can see why they're so
important

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.920 

experience<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.090> night<00:03:16.240> wave<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.690> might<00:03:16.810> have<00:03:16.870> a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
experience a night wave you might have a

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.910 
experience a night wave you might have a
better<00:03:17.110> idea<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.470> where<00:03:17.650> they're<00:03:17.740> going<00:03:17.860> to

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
better idea of where they're going to

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.620 
better idea of where they're going to
come<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:18.700> with<00:03:18.850> every<00:03:19.180> evening<00:03:19.360> you're

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
come in so with every evening you're

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.680 
come in so with every evening you're
probably<00:03:19.810> gonna<00:03:19.990> get<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.140> little<00:03:20.380> bit<00:03:20.590> stronger

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
probably gonna get a little bit stronger

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.610 
probably gonna get a little bit stronger
hopefully<00:03:22.690> because<00:03:23.020> if<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.260> let<00:03:23.470> them

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
hopefully because if you let them

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.560 
hopefully because if you let them
through<00:03:23.890> they<00:03:24.100> will<00:03:24.130> bomb<00:03:24.640> your<00:03:24.670> base<00:03:25.090> and

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
through they will bomb your base and

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.080 
through they will bomb your base and
kill<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.500> yeah<00:03:27.280> that's<00:03:27.490> it<00:03:27.610> for<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.880> if<00:03:28.000> they

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
kill you yeah that's it for you if they

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.220 
kill you yeah that's it for you if they
get<00:03:28.210> past<00:03:28.740> night<00:03:29.740> survived<00:03:30.190> let's<00:03:30.880> move<00:03:31.120> on

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
get past night survived let's move on

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.460 
get past night survived let's move on
so<00:03:33.830> AJ<00:03:34.459> just<00:03:34.760> found<00:03:34.940> out<00:03:35.180> that<00:03:35.659> his<00:03:36.080> friends

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
so AJ just found out that his friends

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.170 
so AJ just found out that his friends
can't<00:03:36.680> reach<00:03:36.860> him<00:03:37.040> because<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.549> cultists<00:03:38.060> are

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
can't reach him because the cultists are

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.720 
can't reach him because the cultists are
jamming<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.049> signal<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:40.190> we're<00:03:40.549> going<00:03:40.610> to

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
jamming the signal so we're going to

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.240 
jamming the signal so we're going to
have<00:03:40.849> to<00:03:40.970> set<00:03:41.209> out<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:41.599> blow<00:03:42.290> up<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.769> three

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
have to set out and blow up the three

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:53.339 
have to set out and blow up the three
generators<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.150> are<00:03:44.390> being<00:03:44.569> used<00:03:44.629> to<00:03:45.200> Janice
