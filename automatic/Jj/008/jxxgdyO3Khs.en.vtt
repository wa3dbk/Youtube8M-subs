00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.889 

and<00:01:14.100> they<00:01:14.759> are<00:01:14.880> officially<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> member<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.840> the

Union<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.380> from<00:01:16.680> there<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.219> can<00:01:17.250> place<00:01:17.670> them

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
Union and from there we can place them

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.350 
Union and from there we can place them
in<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> game<00:01:18.360> now<00:01:18.770> if<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> goalie<00:01:20.399> is<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> backup

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
in the game now if a goalie is a backup

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.749 
in the game now if a goalie is a backup
for<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.380> game<00:01:22.939> he<00:01:23.939> will<00:01:24.119> also<00:01:24.539> be<00:01:24.899> in<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.100 
for one game he will also be in the
Union<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.270> they<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:27.479> necessarily<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
Union so they don't necessarily have to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.710 
Union so they don't necessarily have to
play<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.369> dressed<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.390> on

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
play they just have to be dressed and on

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.620 
play they just have to be dressed and on
the<00:01:30.929> bench<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:32.100> game<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> player<00:01:33.600> like

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the bench for one game so a player like

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
the bench for one game so a player like
Johan<00:01:34.140> Backlund<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.579> Philadelphia

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
Johan Backlund of the Philadelphia

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.660 
Johan Backlund of the Philadelphia
Flyers<00:01:36.500> he's<00:01:37.500> been<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> back<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> last

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
Flyers he's been in the back up the last

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.260 
Flyers he's been in the back up the last
three<00:01:39.000> days<00:01:39.179> or<00:01:39.569> three<00:01:39.840> games<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:41.210> Ray<00:01:42.210> Emery

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
three days or three games for Ray Emery

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.719 
three days or three games for Ray Emery
and<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.689> believe<00:01:42.929> he<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.170> sent<00:01:43.350> down<00:01:43.409> today<00:01:43.770> but

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
and I believe he was sent down today but

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.249 
and I believe he was sent down today but
because<00:01:45.119> he<00:01:45.210> sat<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> bench<00:01:45.810> during<00:01:46.110> an

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
because he sat on the bench during an

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.760 
because he sat on the bench during an
NHL<00:01:46.679> game<00:01:46.709> he's<00:01:47.640> also<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> update<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.929> he

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
NHL game he's also in the update and he

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.289 
NHL game he's also in the update and he
will<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:50.099> be<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:50.549> instead<00:01:50.849> of<00:01:50.909> having<00:01:51.179> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
will now be there instead of having to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:59.080 
will now be there instead of having to
wait<00:01:51.569> for<00:01:51.780> him<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.929> sign<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.560> form<00:01:53.459> so<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.720> goalie

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.200 

so<00:02:07.530> those<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.890> two<00:02:07.980> basic<00:02:08.340> rules<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.119> we

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
so those are the two basic rules that we

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.710 
so those are the two basic rules that we
follow<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> nhlpa<00:02:11.000> this<00:02:12.000> also<00:02:12.270> means

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
follow for the nhlpa this also means

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.910 
follow for the nhlpa this also means
that<00:02:13.020> certain<00:02:13.260> players<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:14.330> Tavares<00:02:15.330> and
