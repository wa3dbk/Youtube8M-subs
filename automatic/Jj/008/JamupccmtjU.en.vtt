a<00:00:10.070> ITF<00:00:11.070> has<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> fermentation<00:00:11.700> plant<00:00:12.179> which

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
a ITF has a fermentation plant which

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.379 
a ITF has a fermentation plant which
allow<00:00:13.019> us<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.259> grow<00:00:13.590> cells<00:00:13.910> for<00:00:14.910> various

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
allow us to grow cells for various

allow us to grow cells for various
biological<00:00:15.570> processes<00:00:16.320> we<00:00:17.190> also<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
biological processes we also have the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.000 
biological processes we also have the
equipment<00:00:18.150> which<00:00:18.420> allows<00:00:18.720> us<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.380> recover

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
equipment which allows us to recover

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.460 
equipment which allows us to recover
those<00:00:20.369> products<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.210> include<00:00:21.600> centrifuges

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
those products that include centrifuges

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.040 
those products that include centrifuges
filtration<00:00:23.279> equipment<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.050> associated

holding tanks and cell disruption

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.919 
holding tanks and cell disruption
equipment<00:00:28.550> we<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.359> only<00:00:30.599> type<00:00:30.900> of

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
equipment we are the only type of

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.900 
equipment we are the only type of
facility<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.830> western<00:00:32.309> Canada<00:00:32.730> at

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
facility like this in western Canada at

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.600 
facility like this in western Canada at
this<00:00:33.120> scale<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.660> think<00:00:34.530> both<00:00:34.800> fermentation

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
this scale I think both fermentation

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.520 
this scale I think both fermentation
halls<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:36.059> about<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.510> same<00:00:36.719> size<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
halls are about the same size as a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500 
halls are about the same size as a
football<00:00:37.950> field<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.090> amount<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
football field so we have that amount of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.010 
football field so we have that amount of
territory<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.050> work<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:42.210> unique

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
territory to work with this is a unique

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.819 
territory to work with this is a unique
