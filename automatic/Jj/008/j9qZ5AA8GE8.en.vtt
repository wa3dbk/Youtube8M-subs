00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.340
 Greetings to all readers giving it to 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.660
 this today I present an application to you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.060
 available in the play store is already from 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.439
 different time and that offer always if 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.050
 it is free both in the paid version 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.609
 I speak to you of screen of and lock 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.140
 screen of in loc 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.539
 one of those programs that once 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.099
 discovered it's hard to do without it 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.009
 and I tell you with a bit of irony that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.719
 an application that allows e 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.050
 above all it promises an operation 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.420
 without hesitation and perfect indeed as 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.149
 you have already got to understand from the name 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.469
 application this program vi 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.420
 allows you to turn off the displays of the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.430
 your smartphone in the way you have 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.219
 seen fast and fast application 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.890
 divided into two with and left icon 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.199
 unlock and sorry block the phone with 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.940
 the simple tap instead of the right icon 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.690
 allows you to access the configurator 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.399
 application 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.850
 we have a series of settings then from 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.950
 be able to set one of the first reported 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.330
 rather useless if we want to go ahead 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.220
 in the paid version 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.280
 application directly replay 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.720
 store then later we see that it is 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.670
 can enable the connection in 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.280
 Notification areas this setting 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.990
 ability a small area precisely in the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.090
 in the dropdown list of our notifications 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.860
 it is plugged will allow to switch off 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.540
 directly our phone the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.250
 our display we keep it 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.229
 disabled because we prefer to turn it off 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.750
 directly from the home screen 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.900
 therefore precisely we deactivate the lidar of the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.030
 block perhaps is a function one of the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.619
 more useful because it allows you to attach 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.689
 to block the phone then to 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.670
 display off a series of 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.549
 animation at the moment we do not 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.049
 so we can review it 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.850
 we will have the display off 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.070
 raw and bare if one can say so 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.680
 however we can set up a series of 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.430
 some very nice animations like ad 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.079
 example the flashing one there 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.079
 ensures a headache rather 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.700
 heavy if he used it continuously 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.880
 Seriously we have the possibility 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.000
 lurks towards there is the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.890
 the flickering flashing effect 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.069
 slightly different but equally 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.319
 annoying tv noise that reminds a little 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.300
 the televisions of a few years ago and then 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.220
 in addition to these there are some 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.739
 so many others that I show you one a 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.390
 case 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.480
 scrolling through the settings we can 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.489
 choose the random animation then the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.349
 appearance of one of these animations in 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.000
 totally managed way 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.310
 from the application itself then from 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.220
 screen of in loc 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.709
 scroll screen the ok sound and screen al 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.510
 lock sound you will have understood by doing one 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.510
 very simple translation can be tied 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.459
 a lock and unlock sound 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.920
 among the five present and more if he can 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.260
 customize another extra yes 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.549
 can also choose sound level 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.459
 of volume 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:02.690
 now try to make a select example 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.930
 a sound I do n't know if through the 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.970
 camera feel maybe I try to 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:14.239
 raise volume ok is more heard 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.470
 some block and unlock sound between 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.840
 them between Uruguay 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.010
 let's go down the possibility of activating the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.109
 vibration both classic and when it starts 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.079
 the animation itself then the phone 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.190
 will vibrate slightly small indeed from 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.859
 do regarding this 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.930
 application concerns the fact that if 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.370
 you will want to uninstall it and we hope to 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.530
 no because really very useful 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.770
 will have to be removed 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.750
 the mode will have to be removed 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.220
 administrator of which he is the subject 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.020
 this application when 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.970
 you install it so it won't be 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.860
 classic uninstall possible 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.690
 from the application menu but you will have to 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.730
 enter in the configurator of 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.290
 this application is remove it 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.280
 manually 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.750
 then here we find a series of 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.340
 settings that are dedicated to 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:04.819
 devices after the version 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.319
 4.0.4 and 4.1.2 of android then the 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.770
 vast majority of devices 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.540
 Android 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.790
 but honestly we never have 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.890
 noticed problems on phones that anyway 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.540
 were not the galaxy 3 then vi 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.910
 we advise against touching these settings 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.709
 if the application should 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.680
 therefore work very well 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.330
 a very useful application 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.830
 available I repeat both in version 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.630
 free that we have for a fee 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.970
 chose the free version because there is 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.970
 more than enough and that allows you to 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.729
 perform two functions fairly 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.650
 quite important the first life away 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.270
 just not going to stress in 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.280
 mechanically the access rate 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.160
 when your device is turned off and the 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.720
 second we say complementary vi 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.120
 especially allows in devices 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.490
 with large display then of 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.039
 large size to go to play 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.169
 make quite natural movements 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.510
 and sometimes dangerous if you use the 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.150
 device with one hand in order to 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.010
 lock the phone then through 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.960
 screen of law that through a 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.210
 simple tap want to turn off the 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.970
 your device quickly and 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.780
 immediate from giuseppe chiaromonte for 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.780
 android point it areas
