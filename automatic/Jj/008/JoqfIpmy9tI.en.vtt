central bankers printed a lot of money

central bankers printed a lot of money
and<00:02:02.340> that's<00:02:02.490> why<00:02:02.700> stocks<00:02:03.090> are<00:02:03.390> up<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.899> year

and that's why stocks are up this year

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.800 
and that's why stocks are up this year
that's<00:02:05.159> why<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> lot<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.700> assets<00:02:06.180> are<00:02:06.390> up<00:02:06.600> this

that's why a lot of assets are up this

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.199 
that's why a lot of assets are up this
year<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.530> bond<00:02:07.770> market<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.369> up<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.879> year

year but the bond market is up this year

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.089 
year but the bond market is up this year
because<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.899> central<00:02:10.319> bank's<00:02:10.619> keep<00:02:10.830> buying
