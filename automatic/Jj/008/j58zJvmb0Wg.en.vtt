00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 I'm okay, fine, we're here. 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.940
 in the hypothetical gallery today with Victor 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.500
 Luca does everything well here we have 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:16.710
 his pages 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:18.750
 he is here today to present 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.460
 A project for you, one is from my friend. 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.890
 Fable of my friend Paulo who is the Fábio 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.300
 already knows the same fable of the meetings of 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.220
 all right 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.240
 Sao Paulo presents to us or you 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.840
 head 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.820
 the idea is that so there is the idea of ​​doing 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.670
 the one that came on the day of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.380
 gallery that I know is fable was 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.430
 awaited the event of thousands in all 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.770
 the state 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.170
 and then when I started putting put 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.270
 the fanzine in the events about the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.260
 It was a fable that showed and took 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.340
 ourselves then 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.320
 so when we see it at launch 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.610
 here in the gallery I'm talking right now 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.640
 to leave, we thought about making a 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.620
 attack to put a digital page 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.719
 per week just as there is a 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.039
 multiverse now the idea that I gave to 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.129
 Please, guys, do a version. 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.870
 printed from hq for its launch and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.979
 We then worked on the character. 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.170
 one page per week 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.659
 the sensational idea people are one is a 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.210
 hunter of imaginary beings is 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.590
 just then there are things that start 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.840
 to appear in the world maybe actually 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.799
 some scut consider normal to be 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.509
 imaginary 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.310
 but as imaginary things do not 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.680
 entering the world if they are taking 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.780
 many accounts this world could 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.610
 become completely imaginary and 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.200
 that there must be a real world 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.079
 underneath the imagination 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.759
 if not all the partnership then this 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.590
 dilemma sometimes this person this guy is 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.659
 a hunter who will identify these 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.850
 imaginary things he has the mission of 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.799
 take their place because there is no 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.909
 balance can not be left over there 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.590
 What else? 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.439
 and even so and can not be 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.909
 generate all the imagination because type being 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.250
 human, he needs imagination to 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.590
 improve his life to grow 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.340
 Meals do not go ahead nor am I the guy 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.079
 does not advance in a search for the best, and I do not 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.969
 I know about you but they got me to 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.200
 serious idea, I really am 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.820
 interested in law being more than the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.600
 Parents are already amazing. Congratulations. 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.380
 Congratulations to a promotion in which 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.510

 imagine everything imagine everything low and 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.350
 dollar down 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.280
 so I have a character that 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.610
 main character of the first 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.050
 story that is a multi-flying is a 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.970
 music is flying by the city 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.080
 character was to capture him this mammoth 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.730
 do not have a name 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.440
 then the idea of promotion what is the 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.980
 People who talk and put the name more 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.100
 cool will win an original print as 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.100
 make a character that only one page 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.100
 but I'll see that I'm very fit and 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.550
 than the original brands and will win a 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.650
 a print edition of HQ there on the day and 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.170
 one night can be boy girl saying 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.170
 You are absurd in everything. 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.020
 for the delegation can not be offensive 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.240
 But let's keep talking about the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.970
 internet that can everything is kaka 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.490
 but so the imagination is to roll face 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.120
 best name is going to be chosen and we 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.450
 will hand in hand the name one night 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.400
 The galera was a pleasure and we 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.560
 we see in the multiverse, surely I will 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.190
 to acquire the one you are 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.190
