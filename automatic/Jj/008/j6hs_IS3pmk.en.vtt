00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.189
 congratulations on winning a full 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.929
 debut for the first time came out in the starting 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.849
 part but at the last moment was 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.530
 made this decision as far as was ready 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.800
 besides that you take the minutes you start in 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.180
 Basically always ready to train 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.830
 somewhere when not playing extra already 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.070
 in the gym myself doing this 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.310
 rats and ready waiting for chances well yes games 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.769
 coaches still at breakfast asked where these 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.269
 It’s more convenient to play on the left or on the right, then everything 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.080
 even then I thought that maybe this 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.960
 there will be a chance 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.059
 Well , plus but the installation said that Vanya 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.390
 rams i damage two days and 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.370
 trained if he can't 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.290
 continue the game then I will have to quit 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
 so I warm up like all players 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.590
 again so when its ready today 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.590
 match with a very loud quieter for fnl as it were 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.440
 you rated him battle for six points 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.690
 probably banal it is so good that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.839
 won good support was very 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.640
 but it didn’t help that in the second 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.030
 time to and happened or this game 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.040
 all the same, the moments went away; 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.890
 As such, I do n’t remember even though the team 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.259
 really good that's what's on purpose 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.720
 this can be attributed to the fact that physically 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.580
 tired or rival added or may 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.690
 still wanted to be very save 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.460
 mined advantage 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.200
 I think all the aggregate wanted 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.259
 save result plus rival 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 added the burnt worsened because 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.020
 all the same, the rain went to this dirt 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 all set 1 well something difficult 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.670
 see today what are all the wings 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.100
 occurred opponent due to succeeded 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.570
 win first 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.780
 dedication must have killed for each other 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.520
 tried the most important but given 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.560
 moment because scorching is not the best 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.600
 qualities 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.180
 the role goes character and the ability to fight 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.649
 to the very 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.570
 got a secret if in the head what if 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.130
 today there will be no victory 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.560
 direct exit there you can forget and 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.869
 I do not know how to prepare for the joint 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.659
 naturally and the team are discussing who like 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.579
 play teams 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.450
 to think about what we lose 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.750
 this did not go out to play to win I 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.050
 delayed so the array in the game thanks 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.050
 to all
