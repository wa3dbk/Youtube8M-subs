00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
for a world again this large with that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.730 
for a world again this large with that
this<00:01:14.480> much<00:01:14.690> character<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.170> hid<00:01:15.440> this<00:01:15.530> much

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
this much character and hid this much

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.520 
this much character and hid this much
color<00:01:16.010> in<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:18.160> it's<00:01:19.160> really<00:01:19.880> really<00:01:20.150> pretty

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
color in it it's really really pretty

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.780 
color in it it's really really pretty
now<00:01:21.530> if<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.830> want<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:22.040> break<00:01:22.190> it<00:01:22.340> down<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:22.729> so

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
now if you want to break it down and so

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.000 
now if you want to break it down and so
character<00:01:23.479> models<00:01:23.840> facial<00:01:24.500> expressions

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
character models facial expressions

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.550 
character models facial expressions
animations<00:01:25.670> all<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:26.030> stuff<00:01:26.840> then<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:27.350> mean

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
animations all that stuff then I mean

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.080 
animations all that stuff then I mean
you<00:01:27.740> might<00:01:28.009> have<00:01:28.040> a<00:01:28.220> better<00:01:28.430> case<00:01:28.700> but<00:01:29.000> if

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
you might have a better case but if

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
you might have a better case but if
you're<00:01:29.210> talking<00:01:29.300> about<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.660> actual<00:01:29.900> world

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
you're talking about the actual world

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.030 
you're talking about the actual world
itself<00:01:30.530> then<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.720> might<00:01:32.720> not<00:01:32.960> have<00:01:33.320> such<00:01:33.800> a

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
itself then you might not have such a

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.640 
itself then you might not have such a
strong<00:01:34.580> case<00:01:34.790> because<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.990> game<00:01:36.170> just<00:01:36.470> looks

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
strong case because the game just looks

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.100 
strong case because the game just looks
it<00:01:37.490> looks<00:01:37.670> really<00:01:38.000> good<00:01:38.119> like<00:01:38.979> really<00:01:39.979> good

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
it looks really good like really good

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.850 
it looks really good like really good
let<00:01:42.110> me<00:01:42.140> just<00:01:42.320> look<00:01:42.410> at<00:01:42.500> that<00:01:42.590> look<00:01:42.710> at<00:01:42.800> the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
let me just look at that look at the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:54.580 
let me just look at that look at the
lighting<00:01:43.040> it

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.910 

so<00:01:55.189> this<00:01:55.340> is<00:01:55.460> obviously<00:01:55.640> more<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.740> from<00:01:57.740> what

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
so this is obviously more of from what

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:08.020 
so this is obviously more of from what
we<00:01:58.040> watched<00:01:58.250> at<00:01:59.030> e3<00:02:06.340> this<00:02:07.340> part<00:02:07.610> always<00:02:07.850> makes

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
we watched at e3 this part always makes

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:17.110 
we watched at e3 this part always makes
me<00:02:08.209> smile<00:02:14.950> you're<00:02:15.950> still<00:02:16.250> here<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.030> the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
me smile you're still here so the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.460 
me smile you're still here so the
difference<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.599> they're<00:02:17.750> not<00:02:17.840> talking<00:02:18.260> over

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
difference is they're not talking over

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:41.680 
difference is they're not talking over
it<00:02:35.110> yeah<00:02:36.110> sure<00:02:36.410> I<00:02:36.830> need<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:37.850> minute<00:02:38.090> thing

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.550 
first person shooter aspect of it I
remember<00:03:26.600> during<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.900> development<00:03:27.380> of

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
remember during the development of

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.440 
remember during the development of
Skyrim<00:03:28.010> they<00:03:28.490> talked<00:03:28.700> about<00:03:28.850> how<00:03:29.090> they<00:03:29.120> take<00:03:29.420> a

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
Skyrim they talked about how they take a

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.540 
Skyrim they talked about how they take a
lot<00:03:29.630> of<00:03:29.660> influences<00:03:30.260> from<00:03:30.410> from<00:03:31.130> other<00:03:31.250> games

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
lot of influences from from other games

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.090 
lot of influences from from other games
and<00:03:31.910> they<00:03:32.330> take<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:33.110> best<00:03:33.260> aspects<00:03:33.860> of<00:03:34.010> those

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
and they take the best aspects of those

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.240 
and they take the best aspects of those
other<00:03:34.340> games<00:03:34.520> so<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.120> don't<00:03:35.510> know<00:03:36.010> which<00:03:37.010> game

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
other games so I don't know which game

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.400 
other games so I don't know which game
they<00:03:37.400> focused<00:03:37.820> on<00:03:38.000> for<00:03:38.540> their<00:03:38.810> first<00:03:39.050> person

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
they focused on for their first person

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.840 
they focused on for their first person
shooter<00:03:39.650> mechanics<00:03:41.320> but<00:03:42.610> I'm<00:03:43.610> sure<00:03:43.820> that

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
shooter mechanics but I'm sure that

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.900 
shooter mechanics but I'm sure that
information<00:03:44.180> will<00:03:44.690> come<00:03:44.810> out<00:03:44.990> maybe<00:03:45.650> with

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
information will come out maybe with

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.400 
information will come out maybe with
some<00:03:46.910> interview<00:03:47.270> or<00:03:47.390> something<00:03:49.989> man<00:03:50.989> I<00:03:51.260> don't

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
some interview or something man I don't

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.930 
some interview or something man I don't
know<00:03:51.500> who<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:51.890> are<00:03:51.920> but<00:03:52.370> your<00:03:52.580> time<00:03:52.790> is

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
know who you are but your time is

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.600 
know who you are but your time is
impeccable<00:03:53.739> but<00:03:54.739> I'm<00:03:54.830> sure<00:03:55.010> every<00:03:55.310> studio

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
impeccable but I'm sure every studio

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.740 
impeccable but I'm sure every studio
does<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.150> mean<00:03:56.330> they're<00:03:56.450> not<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.660> only

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
does that I mean they're not the only

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.510 
does that I mean they're not the only

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:53.129 
interested in seeing in what you guys

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:55.040 
interested in seeing in what you guys
think<00:06:53.430> about<00:06:53.550> what<00:06:54.300> game<00:06:54.509> you're<00:06:54.689> actually

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
think about what game you're actually

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.629 
think about what game you're actually
gonna<00:06:55.139> play<00:06:55.319> first<00:06:55.680> obviously<00:06:56.310> the<00:06:56.459> easy

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
gonna play first obviously the easy

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.139 
gonna play first obviously the easy
answer<00:06:57.029> is<00:06:57.060> fallout<00:06:57.360> 4<00:06:58.009> but<00:06:59.009> rise<00:06:59.639> of<00:06:59.849> the<00:06:59.939> Tomb

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:00.149 
answer is fallout 4 but rise of the Tomb

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:03.019 
answer is fallout 4 but rise of the Tomb
Raider<00:07:00.240> is<00:07:00.629> a<00:07:00.659> very<00:07:01.249> short<00:07:02.249> experience<00:07:02.909> or

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:03.029 
Raider is a very short experience or

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:04.879 
Raider is a very short experience or
shorter<00:07:03.419> experience<00:07:04.050> so<00:07:04.259> I<00:07:04.289> mean<00:07:04.620> you<00:07:04.709> could

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
shorter experience so I mean you could

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:07.820 
shorter experience so I mean you could

technically bang that game out in two to
