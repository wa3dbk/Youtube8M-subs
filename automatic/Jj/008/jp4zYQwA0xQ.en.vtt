it did come with also directions but

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.310 
it did come with also directions but
since<00:03:07.580> I've<00:03:07.970> read<00:03:08.270> so<00:03:08.450> much<00:03:08.570> about<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.990> i<00:03:09.110> guess

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
since I've read so much about it i guess

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.970
