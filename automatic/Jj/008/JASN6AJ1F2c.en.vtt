00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
think the camera is quite zoomed in but

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.199 
think the camera is quite zoomed in but
yes<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:54.020> is<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.800> plain<00:02:55.250> blue<00:02:55.459> vest<00:02:55.640> top<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.090> then

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
yes it is a plain blue vest top and then

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.150 
yes it is a plain blue vest top and then
at<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.390> back<00:02:56.569> it's<00:02:56.930> got<00:02:57.050> this<00:02:57.350> kind<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.739> cutout

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
at the back it's got this kind of cutout

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.000 
at the back it's got this kind of cutout
and<00:02:58.690> crochet<00:02:59.690> back<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.350> so<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.800> would<00:03:00.890> be

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
and crochet back to it so it would be

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.830 
and crochet back to it so it would be
quite<00:03:01.190> nice<00:03:01.370> if<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.330> put<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.510> bikini

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
quite nice if you put a bikini

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.240 
quite nice if you put a bikini
underneath<00:03:03.170> or<00:03:03.410> something<00:03:03.680> like<00:03:03.770> that

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
underneath or something like that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.309 
underneath or something like that
the<00:03:04.610> primary<00:03:05.450> have<00:03:05.600> these<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.110> lot<00:03:06.290> of

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.660 
them and I think these were about 2
pounds<00:05:00.710> 50
