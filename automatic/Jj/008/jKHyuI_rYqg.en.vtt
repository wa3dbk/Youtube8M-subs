00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
think I've got about 20 but there I

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.590 
think I've got about 20 but there I
think<00:05:07.419> a<00:05:07.660> couple<00:05:07.690> years<00:05:08.080> ago<00:05:08.140> I<00:05:08.289> had<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.470> couple

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
think a couple years ago I had a couple

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.070 
think a couple years ago I had a couple
but<00:05:11.580> for<00:05:12.580> some<00:05:12.789> reason<00:05:13.210> like<00:05:13.390> it's<00:05:13.600> been<00:05:13.750> 80

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
but for some reason like it's been 80

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.800 
but for some reason like it's been 80
for<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.440> last<00:05:14.620> couple<00:05:14.800> of<00:05:15.010> weeks<00:05:15.479> but<00:05:18.810> it's

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
for the last couple of weeks but it's

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.140
