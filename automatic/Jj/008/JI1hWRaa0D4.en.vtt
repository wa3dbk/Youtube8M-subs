so<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.110> are<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.560> guys<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.159> would<00:02:05.460> try<00:02:05.880> really

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
so if are you guys I would try really

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.340 
so if are you guys I would try really
hard<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.630> go<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:06.960> recruitment

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
hard to go for this recruitment

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.729 
hard to go for this recruitment
challenge<00:02:08.149> basically<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.929> most<00:02:10.080> motivation

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
challenge basically the most motivation

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.100 
challenge basically the most motivation
you<00:02:10.830> guys<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.610> from<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.569> exposure<00:02:12.989> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
you guys have is from the exposure that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.670 
you guys have is from the exposure that
you're<00:02:13.410> gay

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
you're gay

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.619 
you're gay
so<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.159> hit<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> shot<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.060> get<00:02:15.299> a<00:02:15.329> lot

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
so if you hit a shot and you get a lot

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.089 
so if you hit a shot and you get a lot
of<00:02:15.659> exposure<00:02:16.019> off<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.439> it<00:02:16.590> it'll<00:02:16.799> probably

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
of exposure off of it it'll probably

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.220 
of exposure off of it it'll probably
give<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.400> more<00:02:17.760> motivation<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.659> even<00:02:19.049> if<00:02:19.140> you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
give you more motivation so even if you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.050 
give you more motivation so even if you
haven't<00:02:19.469> had<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.590> shot<00:02:19.799> yet<00:02:19.980> once<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.879> kill
