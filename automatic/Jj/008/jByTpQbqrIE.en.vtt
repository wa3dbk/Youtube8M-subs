oh<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:40.909> by<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.060> way<00:01:41.180> I<00:01:41.830> realized<00:01:42.830> something

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
oh and by the way I realized something

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.240 
oh and by the way I realized something
you<00:01:44.540> know<00:01:44.659> how<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:44.869> said<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.710> Mickey<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.159> the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
you know how I said that Mickey and the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.120 
you know how I said that Mickey and the
Beanstalk<00:01:46.790> sounds<00:01:47.299> a<00:01:47.390> bit<00:01:47.509> like<00:01:48.100> like<00:01:49.100> a

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
Beanstalk sounds a bit like like a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.050 
Beanstalk sounds a bit like like a
foreign<00:01:49.520> movie<00:01:49.840> but<00:01:50.840> then<00:01:51.020> again<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:52.060> realized

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
foreign movie but then again I realized

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.920 
foreign movie but then again I realized
that<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:53.869> does<00:01:54.080> Mickey<00:01:54.500> is<00:01:54.590> wild<00:01:54.920> adventures

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
that so does Mickey is wild adventures

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.060 
that so does Mickey is wild adventures
or<00:01:56.930> well<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:57.770> guess<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.070> kind<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.369> depends<00:01:58.700> on

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
or well I guess it kind of depends on

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.270 
or well I guess it kind of depends on
what's<00:02:01.070> your<00:02:01.159> definition<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.880> wild<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:03.280> mean
