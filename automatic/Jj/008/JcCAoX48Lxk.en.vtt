00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.920
 hello very good to all mechanics and 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.220
 Welcome to the fourth episode of 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.929
 tutorial in which I will show you how 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.219
 attack the earth how to do how 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.379
 perform ground attacks and how 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.059
 defend you from land if you are 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.440
 fixing whatever and well let's 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.320
 start with the basic attack that is 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.520
 makes a tank and well I recommend the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.860
 my fought because it's the best there 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.050
 now and you see this as good as 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.550
 is you launch the same guided and you finish 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.670
 with a machine gun loader in case 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.960
 you want to finish it or whatever since 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.630
 now after the update then 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.000
 well they are not very strong 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.260
 the missiles guided the pods do not you the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.750
 I recommend because they are useless 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.060
 absolutely nothing has very little 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.800
 force and only serves for objects that 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.329
 beiges or that have marked you with the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.430
 guide emission although you do not kill them so 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.440
 least you can set the objectives as 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.320
 you are watching and this also serves to 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.920
 infantry and that and well now I'm going to 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.809
 show how 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.120
 if they are setting you like this for the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.429
 surroundings of what the tank is and so 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.649
 what you can use is attacks 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.629
 quick as lightning attacks that are 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.430
 they usually call or they do not sound wind 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.530
 they made lightning attack that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.299
 just fixed launch missile and you go 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.250
 running because if they are fixing you like this 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.020
 it is quite dangerous and if necessary 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.539
 the flares and you leave the map and 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.789
 it is no longer needed more nothing 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.560
 the missile goes only you set spear and 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.630
 if you leave the place and it is already not us 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.009
 risk jsa to hit him with the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.479
 machine gun because if it's not going to give us 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.940
 time to escape and they will throw you another 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.240
 stinger and then they will disable you 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.340
 and they are going to kill you 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.960
 let's see another another occasion if the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.370
 tank is at its base or in an area 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.140
 where there are many enemies for the best 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.960
 is what I have done now that is 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.490
 basically leave but good if you are 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.680
 coming from the enemy base or so what 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.950
 better is a quick attack your daughter and 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.420
 fast missile guided maximum speed 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.190
 you are going to give to another point of the ball map 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.930
 it is very very low as low as possible for 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.050
 the low radar so that they fix us and already 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.260
 is that is a basic attack on this 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.510
 well now let's see what would happen if 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.670
 they are fixing with soflamas in the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.740
 third position of the tank are 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.870
 arriving with stingers or if you are 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.880
 firing the base aerial anti 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.050
 enemy because warns caught the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.150
 enemies in their base and they can not get out 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.680
 so that we kill the antiaircraft 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.890
 Well, what you can do is simply 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.050
 at the maximum height then imagine another 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.330
 is at the maximum but without staying 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.940
 caught in the sky very carefully 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.590
 you just set bomb and follow 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.800
 flying high because at that height we are going 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.850
 to be able to fix with stinger or anything 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.650
 so that 's what the only thing that 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.330
 you can do if you have everything against 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.490
 your in the game of that is the only thing 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.680
 what can you do to catch me is the guided 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.920
 dedicated but from a great height 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.020
 fix fix and shoot and you're done and good 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.090
 here I am going to show you this is an example 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.620
 of what you do not have to do I repeat 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.720
 you have to do that is to fly very very 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.640
 low at very low speed and managers 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.350
 in front against a tank or against a 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.040
 Soldier because maybe he hits you 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.720
 cannon shot you a rpg or whatever and 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.180
 it destroys you completely in an instant 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.650
 then I recommend an average height 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.110
 very high or very low and that and you attack 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.460
 well here we are going to see cars cars 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.900
 they are quite weak but now with 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.280
 update with a missile do not kill them 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.680
 so what you have to do is 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.810
 launch a missile and hit some shots 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.700
 with the machine gun and I 'll kill him 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.110
 because with a missile the only thing that you are going 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.340
 to do is disable it, I know that 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.710
 It seems stupid because they have no 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.200
 doors or windows but good is this way the 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.480
 battlefield is super realistic so 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.879
 Now here I'll show you how 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.530
 attack infantry as I said before 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.300
 in my guides the most useful because you have 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.550
 the camera is there and although you will not have 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.700
 no missile at least serves you to 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.170
 sight enemies and then here I have 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.090
 seen my partner a great friend who 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.519
 is helping me in this tutorial and 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.260
 Well he killed it but it does not come out because 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.630
 the game is still running and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.310
 there I kill him and he throws me a style and 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.200
 The best you can do is go a little 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.549
 down to dodge it and throw 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.349
 flares and oh you see and you go here if you 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.269
 they are fixing and you do not know where it is 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.769
 where is the soldier what can you 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.480
 do is several passes for different 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.610
 map points for more or less 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.110
 visit him because here in maintains a 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.000
 extinguish but for example if here step 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.430
 in the middle of the map and they are not 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.900
 fixing or anything then I already know that the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.160
 uncle will not be in the middle of the map 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.430
 because now he can not fix me 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.169
 then and now I pass imagine that 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.269
 you do not see it with the same day or whatever 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.919
 if now I pass through the enemy base and I 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.570
 are fixing that means that the 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.639
 enemy is in the enemy base with the 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.220
 stinger then do not pass by there 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.289
 avoid going through there already and if 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.180
 You see then kill him try to kill him 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.759
 and good in the last case we have 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.539
 here this is like turning on a blow 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.279
 good and a use flan they usually put in 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.469
 the mountains or in the buildings in the 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:47.340
 roofs like this in obvious positions but 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:49.530
 good if you do not see it fly very low 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.630
 for the low radar and all that and if you see 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.949
 a red light that is the soft land or in the 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.720
 third position of a tank gives me 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.340
 Like what you see what to do is fly very 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.470
 high to a very high height so that the 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.020
 soplán angle does not give and if sometimes 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.610
 you can destroy him with him 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.560
 day of the show flan but as if you can not 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.810
 you kill the sniper who will be near 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.570
 they are usually close by, kill him and 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.910
 is already there and so when it reappears 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.530
 disappears the blow and all that and good 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.070
 up to here the tutorial until the 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.070
 next video
