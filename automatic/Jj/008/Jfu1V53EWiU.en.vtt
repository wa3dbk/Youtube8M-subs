scx10 you need to buy the they're like
the<00:00:22.560> little<00:00:22.650> conversion<00:00:23.130> kits<00:00:23.570> so<00:00:24.570> again<00:00:25.140> this

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260

these right here you got to put these on
oh<00:00:36.270> my<00:00:36.300> lighting<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.930> probably<00:00:37.200> bad<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.590> but

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
oh my lighting is probably bad here but

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.380 
oh my lighting is probably bad here but
let's<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:39.090> get<00:00:39.239> like

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
let's see if you can see it you get like

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.660 
let's see if you can see it you get like
these<00:00:39.570> new<00:00:40.200> axle<00:00:40.739> housings<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.550> see

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
these new axle housings here you can see

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.430 
these new axle housings here you can see
they're<00:00:41.820> quite<00:00:41.910> different<00:00:42.210> let<00:00:43.170> me<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
they're quite different let me know the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.510 
they're quite different let me know the
sort<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.710> same<00:00:43.860> thing<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.370> this

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
sort of the same thing but have this

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.360 
sort of the same thing but have this
sort<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.940> lip<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.840> right<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.370> comparison

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
sort of lip on it right here comparison

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.369 
sort of lip on it right here comparison
to<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> old<00:00:47.700> ones<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.960> pretty<00:00:49.050> easy<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
to the old ones so it's pretty easy to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.369 
to the old ones so it's pretty easy to
slide<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.920> off<00:00:50.100> take<00:00:50.309> these<00:00:50.489> off<00:00:51.379> recommend

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
slide that off take these off recommend

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.569 
slide that off take these off recommend
maybe<00:00:52.500> changing<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> bearings<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
maybe changing the bearings on the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.270 
maybe changing the bearings on the
inside<00:00:53.879> mine<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.210> pretty<00:00:54.390> shot<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.469> yeah<00:00:56.039> so

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
inside mine are pretty shot so yeah so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.970 
inside mine are pretty shot so yeah so
put<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.690> then<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.620> course<00:00:58.829> you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
put that on there then of course you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.529 
put that on there then of course you
throw<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.930> they<00:01:00.930> supply<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.890> bigger<00:01:02.449> it<00:01:03.449> up

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
like the axle there comparison to the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.350 
like the axle there comparison to the
stock<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.400> which<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.180> probably

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
stock one which is you know probably

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.590 
stock one which is you know probably
about<00:01:12.510> half<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.020> size<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.740> put

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
about half the size here so if you put

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.990 
about half the size here so if you put
that<00:01:15.600> there<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.409> quite<00:01:16.530> larger

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
that there you can see it's quite larger

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.429 
that there you can see it's quite larger
and<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:19.500> oh<00:01:20.810> trying<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:21.990> one<00:01:22.229> hand

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and the oh trying to do this one hand

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.469 
and the oh trying to do this one hand
here<00:01:22.619> these<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.369> pretty<00:01:23.549> easy<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.000> put<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.210> so

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
