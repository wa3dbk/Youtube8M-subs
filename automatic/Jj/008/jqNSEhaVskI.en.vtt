00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.480
 hello everyone welcome to this new 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.640
 video where I will explain how 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.830
 hide the virtual buttons of your 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.900
 cellular in this case is a motorola 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.730
 razer of 3 can work in any 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.340
 another device that has buttons 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.410
 virtual and want to hide in me 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.970
 particular case I like to hide them 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.060
 it's only when I'm going to play 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.570
 from the rest these buttons do not 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.240
 cause any hindrance I do not like 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.710
 buttons only when I'm going to play 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.439
 well then I'm going to show you the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.150
 applications that we are going to use and it is 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.879
 necessary to be super user ie 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.400
 have good root access the first 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.199
 application that I use is called 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.000
 full screen I recommend this 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.190
 application because I tried with many 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.320
 other applications and in particular in my 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.199
 device will not work did not hide 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.540
 the bars and it was a disaster to get a 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.460
 point where I was already testing a 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.680
 last application I already found a 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.830
 application in the place thor was 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.260
 trying and good to install it 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.119
 restart and I do not hide the buttons 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.490
 then I left it again as was the 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.610
 Once installed and when to restart 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.280
 I realized that my cell phone 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.189
 it started that it stayed in the logo of 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.380
 motorola and then I made web data web 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.049
 cache and I did everything to be able 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.479
 return it in factory mode and nothing worked 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.920
 then I had to reinstall the rom 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.510
 flashing the good stuff that was a mess 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.610
 so 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.730
 if I recommend you use this 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.130
 application is approved by me has not 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.840
 caused any inconvenience of 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.550
 no damage to cell phone the others 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.770
 applications did not work for me came a 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.040
 that this year my device touched me 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.040
 see it to restart install the rom and 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.710
 everything then I recommend this the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.230
 another application is the m &amp; t lounge 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.600
 so I 'll explain initially 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.240
 with full screen the link is left in 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.070
 the description of the video and here it is already 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.130
 the application is going to give to who says 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.400
 ivonne passada automatic automatically 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.940
 to enable and seen here is the port of 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.330
 Fabol well 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.820
 in this way here area was lent 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.670
 because what was here I think it was the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.490
 left button from behind I wanted it you can 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.069
 activate it also well here the other one that 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.420
 comes the home 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:26.420
 the home button where this is 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.420
 but I'm going to put it 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.240
 this here is the go to home button and 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.310
 this engine to go back when I 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.770
 I have pressed appear other options 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.960
 If I configured the house I removed everything 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.930
 it's because I do not like these buttons there 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.220
 what I did was here in disable in the 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.960
 tier also disable and ready 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.880
 It is important 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.290
 good 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.820
 moved first you have to configure the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.800
 another because obviously we 're not going to have 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.690
 button back and as you can see then no 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.660
 we can stay in nothing we're going 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.080
 without anything then it was here and here 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.270
 is and what they do is in mushrooms service 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.550
 mode what they do is configure it as 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.340
 stand and go here in the part where it says 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.080
 stand up and configure it that they want it 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.210
 top down on the left where 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.010
 want I have it side by side 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.050
 right side here the colors like what 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.000
 want to configure and that's it 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.020
 basic and then you'll see and then you 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.900
 want to configure more what is going to start 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.810
 here is already starting and here are the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.720
 buttons then what you're going to do is go 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:41.570
 back and I will start the full screen 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.710
 disabled enable ready moved back very 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.070
 Grace 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.740
 home and as you can see already I hid my 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.510
 bar virtual buttons change us by 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.380
 others who are up here very elegant 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.880
 because of itself and good here you have all 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.170
 We configure the functionalities 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.360
 you can also configure them 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.120
 they want me to appear in this bar in my 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.110
 case I use these commands 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.690
 only and already good then I hope 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.940
 that you liked later for 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.330
 deactivate it obviously 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.930
 turn them off 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.160
 the applications here says bolt comes back 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.780

 ready then I hope you serve them the 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.420
 tutorial that takes it out of some rivers 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.760
 because in some tutorials there are 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.710
 in the network many times in some 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.030
