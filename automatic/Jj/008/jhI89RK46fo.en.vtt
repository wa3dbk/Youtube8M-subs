second<00:00:05.850> video<00:00:06.120> about<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.600> overlays<00:00:07.109> as<00:00:07.410> this

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
second video about the overlays as this

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.100 
second video about the overlays as this
time<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.490> will<00:00:08.790> be<00:00:08.970> showing<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.330> animated

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
time I will be showing you animated

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.860 
time I will be showing you animated
overlays<00:00:10.650> if<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.910> actually<00:00:12.300> thought<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
overlays if you actually thought the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.839 
overlays if you actually thought the
pop-up<00:00:13.230> was<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> YouTube<00:00:13.830> ad<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.309> got<00:00:14.700> you

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
pop-up was a YouTube ad I got you

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.970 
pop-up was a YouTube ad I got you
because<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.299> not<00:00:15.480> it's<00:00:16.080> just<00:00:16.230> an<00:00:16.500> animated

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
because it's not it's just an animated

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.029 
because it's not it's just an animated
overlay<00:00:17.420> so<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.600> works<00:00:18.900> very<00:00:19.109> much<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.680> same

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
overlay so this works very much the same

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.460 
overlay so this works very much the same
as<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.520> custom<00:00:20.850> overlay<00:00:21.359> did<00:00:21.570> only<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.199> time

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
as the custom overlay did only this time

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.679 
as the custom overlay did only this time
I'm<00:00:22.680> using<00:00:22.859> animated<00:00:23.400> textures<00:00:23.760> they've<00:00:24.449> been

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
I'm using animated textures they've been

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.179 
I'm using animated textures they've been
around<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.170> some<00:00:25.320> time<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
around for some time but this is the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.130 
around for some time but this is the
first<00:00:26.550> exciting<00:00:27.180> news<00:00:27.359> I've<00:00:27.599> actually<00:00:27.779> found

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the nonsense and show you how easy it is

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.670 
the nonsense and show you how easy it is
to<00:00:33.000> make<00:00:33.180> one<00:00:33.390> yourself<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.380> are<00:00:34.469> once

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
to make one yourself so we are once

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.090 
to make one yourself so we are once
again<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.399> tool<00:00:35.790> website<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.100> there

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
again on the tool website and there

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.240 
again on the tool website and there
hasn't<00:00:38.399> really<00:00:38.610> been<00:00:39.200> much<00:00:40.200> changed<00:00:40.950> since

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
hasn't really been much changed since

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.299 
hasn't really been much changed since
the<00:00:41.940> last<00:00:41.969> video<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.260> added<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.739> new<00:00:43.980> button

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the last video I have added a new button

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.360 
the last video I have added a new button
which<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.239> use<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.420> quickly<00:00:46.379> Center<00:00:47.039> your

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
which you can use to quickly Center your

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.940 
which you can use to quickly Center your
overlay<00:00:48.180> horizontally<00:00:48.899> or<00:00:49.079> vertically<00:00:49.590> so

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
overlay horizontally or vertically so

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
overlay horizontally or vertically so
that<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.340> nice<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.730> guess<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.529 
want to upload a gift that is animated
and<00:00:56.640> I'm<00:00:57.539> gonna<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.850> gift

and I'm gonna do that as I have a gift
of<00:01:00.809> nine<00:01:01.140> gets<00:01:01.530> saved<00:01:01.859> which<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.940> found<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.300> very

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
of nine gets saved which I found is very

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.230 
of nine gets saved which I found is very
suitable<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.159> once<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.580> click<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
suitable for this so once you click the

suitable for this so once you click the
upload<00:01:06.750> button<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.439> gonna<00:01:07.680> say<00:01:07.950> decoding

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
upload button it's gonna say decoding

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
upload button it's gonna say decoding
gif<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.210> which<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.720> take<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.990> while

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
gif here which can take a while

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.890 
gif here which can take a while
depending<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> size<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.909> your<00:01:11.939> gift<00:01:12.299> but

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
depending on the size of your gift but

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690 
depending on the size of your gift but
there<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.200> go<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.590> me<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.130> very<00:01:14.159> quickly

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
there we go for me it is very quickly

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.719 
there we go for me it is very quickly
and<00:01:15.290> once<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.470> done<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.890> will<00:01:16.920> spit<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
and once it is done it will spit out a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.120 
and once it is done it will spit out a
sequence<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.509> images<00:01:18.750> which<00:01:19.229> are<00:01:19.409> pretty<00:01:20.040> much

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
sequence of images which are pretty much

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.020 
sequence of images which are pretty much
just<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.670> individual<00:01:21.420> frames<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.200> gift

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
just the individual frames of the gift

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.510 
just the individual frames of the gift
so<00:01:24.030> once<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.479> done<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.049> actually

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
so once that is done you can actually

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.310 
so once that is done you can actually
continue<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> whole<00:01:27.540> process<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.229> I'm

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
continue with the whole process so I'm

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.520 
continue with the whole process so I'm
gonna<00:01:28.530> Center<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.369> image<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:31.020> am<00:01:31.290> going

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
gonna Center this image and I am going

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.010 
gonna Center this image and I am going
to<00:01:31.770> use<00:01:31.979> diamond<00:01:32.579> sort<00:01:32.880> once<00:01:33.150> again<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to use diamond sort once again as the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.850 
to use diamond sort once again as the
texture<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.740> want<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.100> override<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.590> is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
texture I want to override and that is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.310 
texture I want to override and that is
pretty<00:01:38.400> much<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.360> I'm<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.900> click<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
pretty much it so I'm going to click the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.249 
pretty much it so I'm going to click the
get<00:01:40.710> resource<00:01:41.159> back<00:01:41.369> button<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.329> you

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
get resource back button here and you

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.020 
get resource back button here and you
will<00:01:43.439> be<00:01:43.619> redirected<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.640> download<00:01:44.670> page

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
will be redirected to the download page

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.780 
will be redirected to the download page
and<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:45.990> added<00:01:46.290> an<00:01:46.649> add<00:01:47.009> more<00:01:47.310> button

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and I have added an add more button

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.760 
and I have added an add more button
which<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.509> click<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.560> can

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
which you can click and then you can

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.039 
which you can click and then you can
just<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> same<00:01:50.850> thing<00:01:51.090> over<00:01:51.299> again<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:52.020> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
just do the same thing over again for a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.530 
just do the same thing over again for a
different<00:01:52.590> texture<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.670> get<00:01:53.850> multiple

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
different texture to get multiple
