my<00:02:14.230> speculation<00:02:15.000> money<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.709> think<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.830> boils

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
my speculation money I think it boils

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.860 
my speculation money I think it boils
down<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.370> money<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.970> mean<00:02:19.180> obviously<00:02:19.330> that's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
down to money I mean obviously that's

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.449 
down to money I mean obviously that's
kind<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.230> cause<00:02:20.379> for<00:02:20.409> most<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.010> but<00:02:21.280> I

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
kind of a cause for most of this but I

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.339 
kind of a cause for most of this but I
mean<00:02:21.760> more<00:02:21.940> specifically<00:02:22.450> than<00:02:22.659> just<00:02:22.870> money<00:02:23.110> I

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
mean more specifically than just money I

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.339 
mean more specifically than just money I
think<00:02:24.159> it's<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.310> Fox<00:02:24.610> engine<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.780> Fox<00:02:26.049> engine

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
think it's the Fox engine the Fox engine

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.740 
think it's the Fox engine the Fox engine
costs<00:02:27.010> over<00:02:27.250> 20<00:02:27.670> million<00:02:27.940> dollars<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.599> make

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
costs over 20 million dollars to make

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.199 
costs over 20 million dollars to make
right<00:02:29.379> they<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.769> cost<00:02:30.190> them<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:30.670> much<00:02:30.819> money<00:02:31.060> to

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
right they it cost them so much money to

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.630 
right they it cost them so much money to
develop<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.720> right<00:02:32.170> now<00:02:32.319> only<00:02:32.590> two<00:02:33.069> games<00:02:33.280> are

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
develop and right now only two games are

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.009 
develop and right now only two games are
utilizing<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.569> mgs5<00:02:35.379> and<00:02:36.000> silent<00:02:37.000> Hills<00:02:37.299> now

is it about the Fox engine that probably

feel into his games and as a result of

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.910 
feel into his games and as a result of
that<00:03:11.410> set<00:03:12.190> pieces<00:03:12.459> are<00:03:12.879> huge<00:03:13.680> mechanics<00:03:14.680> are

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
that set pieces are huge mechanics are

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.550 
that set pieces are huge mechanics are
really<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.549> depth<00:03:15.849> he<00:03:16.209> really<00:03:16.720> brings<00:03:17.170> the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
really in depth he really brings the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.979 
really in depth he really brings the
Thunder<00:03:17.829> if<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.609> will<00:03:18.819> when<00:03:19.090> he<00:03:19.269> makes<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.780> game

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
Thunder if you will when he makes a game

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.140 
Thunder if you will when he makes a game
and<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.799> think<00:03:21.099> that<00:03:21.310> probably<00:03:21.549> got<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.030> be<00:03:22.120> a

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
and I think that probably got to be a

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150 
and I think that probably got to be a
little<00:03:22.389> bit<00:03:22.569> too<00:03:22.720> much<00:03:22.870> for<00:03:23.169> Konami

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
little bit too much for Konami

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.759 
little bit too much for Konami
pocketbook<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.030> i'm<00:03:25.630> pretty<00:03:25.870> sure<00:03:26.169> that<00:03:26.530> they

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
pocketbook and i'm pretty sure that they

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.460 
pocketbook and i'm pretty sure that they
warned<00:03:27.549> him<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:28.000> cut<00:03:28.630> back<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.139> spending

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
warned him to cut back on the spending

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.409 
warned him to cut back on the spending
and<00:03:29.650> i'm<00:03:29.739> sure<00:03:29.919> that<00:03:30.069> they<00:03:30.190> warned<00:03:30.549> him<00:03:30.700> about

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
and i'm sure that they warned him about

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.539 
and i'm sure that they warned him about
this<00:03:31.810> sort<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.079> thing<00:03:32.139> because<00:03:32.380> them<00:03:33.010> doing

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
this sort of thing because them doing

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.250 
this sort of thing because them doing
what<00:03:33.579> they<00:03:33.760> did<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:34.359> not<00:03:34.780> something<00:03:35.109> that

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
what they did is not something that

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.470 
what they did is not something that
would<00:03:35.470> happen<00:03:35.590> overnight<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.940> know<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:37.329> not

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
would happen overnight you know it's not

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.870 
would happen overnight you know it's not
like<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:38.260> president<00:03:38.769> of<00:03:38.919> Konami<00:03:39.280> walked<00:03:39.639> in

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
like the president of Konami walked in

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.120 
like the president of Konami walked in
and<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.660> know<00:03:40.840> there's<00:03:41.139> Kojima<00:03:41.650> straight

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
and you know there's Kojima straight

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.759 
and you know there's Kojima straight
going<00:03:42.430> balls<00:03:42.669> deep<00:03:42.819> and<00:03:43.120> his<00:03:43.269> daughter<00:03:43.480> it

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
going balls deep and his daughter it

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.559 
going balls deep and his daughter it
probably<00:03:44.769> never<00:03:44.950> happened<00:03:45.430> like<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:45.700> but

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
probably never happened like that but

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.020 
probably never happened like that but
this<00:03:46.690> is<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.900> long-term<00:03:47.380> event<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:48.549> like<00:03:48.760> I

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
this is a long-term event it's like I

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.240

the<00:06:28.949> powerhouse<00:06:29.430> that<00:06:29.639> they<00:06:29.819> were<00:06:29.880> and<00:06:30.560> I

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
the powerhouse that they were and I

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.020 
the powerhouse that they were and I
think<00:06:31.949> they<00:06:32.099> need<00:06:32.340> this<00:06:32.490> game<00:06:32.729> to<00:06:32.880> be<00:06:32.909> a

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
think they need this game to be a

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.450 
think they need this game to be a
success<00:06:33.449> and<00:06:33.659> I<00:06:33.750> think<00:06:33.960> given<00:06:34.440> the<00:06:34.680> current

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
success and I think given the current

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.830 
success and I think given the current
state<00:06:35.729> of<00:06:35.909> the<00:06:36.120> gaming<00:06:36.479> industry

they're<00:06:38.560> afraid<00:06:38.830> and<00:06:39.160> I<00:06:39.580> think<00:06:39.820> that's<00:06:40.000> one<00:06:40.240> of

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
they're afraid and I think that's one of
