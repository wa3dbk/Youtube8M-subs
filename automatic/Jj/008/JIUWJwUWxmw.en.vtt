00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.109
 in the interactive control simulator 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.759
 of the train's engines are 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.280
 present problems similar to those 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.050
 that he would find in real life the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.970
 work orders will detail the 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.590
 flaws in a control system 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.150
 engines and it is expected that you 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.820
 diagnosis and repair the system 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.380
 returning it to its normal condition it 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 will monitor your work and measure the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.980
 time and you will be given a summary of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.980
 your work when the task is finished 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.149
 the system controls the fluid level 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.379
 sent to a tank by pipes from 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.379
 three separate sources 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.580
 two fluid level switches 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.560
 they automatically control the operation 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.260
 of two pumps that extract the fluid from 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.300
 tank the bottom switch ensures 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.850
 that the fluid never decreases below 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.410
 of the pump intakes while the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.650
 upper switch ensures that the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.750
 fluid never rise too much when the 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.119
 lower switch is closed there
