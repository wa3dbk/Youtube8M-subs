00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello this video is a video of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.309
 a different kind of thing you are so on one 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.019
 channel normally do not have it but it 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.219
 was still important to me this video too 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.139
 do and I hope you can 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 understand why I have this video 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.880
 1990 has a mother of two 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.859
 daughters and wife a very 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.350
 devastating diagnosis will cause leukemia 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.789
 blood cancer and although therapy here 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.859
 and she got radiation 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.960
 a few months later had a relapse 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.330
 and for the doctors was clear the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 Cancer cells are not destroying theirs 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.030
 last hope was one 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.410
 stem cell donation and that was to the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.210
 Time in Germany a very very 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.590
 Difficult undertaking because only a few 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.480
 people had registered and 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.250
 Hello here if someone says mine 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.410
 I would donate stem cells 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.420
 So that began the search for one 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.890
 suitable donor from the family and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.480
 it also has a long way to the doctors 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.950
 But at some point you have to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.379
 a young student found herself 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.399
 has agreed to donate and that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.219
 she did too 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.510
 Unfortunately this came too late to donate the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.710
 i do not know backgrounds i know 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.719
 not if the woman maybe easy 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.129
 already too weak and the body was too 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.059
 the rescue was no longer possible 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.129
 also to accept 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.900
 But she is at the end of her cancer 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.130
 died her death was the occasion for 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.409
 her husband and also the treating 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.180
 doctor to say that will not continue 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.310
 we need one in one form 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.780
 database for people who say i would 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.340
 donate stem cells and for people who 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 say hello i need it stem 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.540
 so they founded the dkms the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.830
 German bone marrow donation there you have 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.119
 ever guaranteed some shape 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.180
 the advertising seen with these funny ones 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.130
 cotton swabs and the registered up 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.780
 today, potential donors and brings the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.210
 together with people who are suffering from leukemia 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.740
 are sick with family with 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.810
 mothers with cousins ​​with friends with 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.299
 first big love with grandmas and grandpa 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.070
 just give people a donation 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.270
 need to live on as you are 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.740
 probably think I can tell 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.750
 not to entertain you 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.700
 a story but to you on it 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.530
 to draw attention to is the dkms 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.420
 that there is this problem with 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.829
 there are many spenders and that it is the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.250
 Possibility to register 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.689
 to let 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.860
 but I definitely do not 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.600
 to do this video is to say 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.340
 you have to register so you are 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.630
 bad people i hope so 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.890
 such a little bit that you are 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.110
 maybe the little moment 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.399
 I take and think about it 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.960
 Maybe I would like to be a donor 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.489
 It's not easy for you in the head 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.810
 decision fell more I want to do 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.160
 not and if you are not a donor 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.060
 I just wanted to do that 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.470
 if you maybe one 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.900
 wanted to be and he did not know that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.530
 the option is there's the link in 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.660
 the infobox 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.489
 Everyone can donate between 18 and 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.140
 55 years and you can 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.640
 just register to dkms 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.500
 go directly and give you a blood test 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.239
 load decrease and registered to you so 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.560
 or you can donate a letter 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.030
 there is a little to send 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.709
 This is what we have in the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.849
 have seen the advertising that you pack 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.140
 you in the mouth wobbles a bit 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.760
 there is also a guide there as 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.380
 Doing that exactly does it back into that 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.790
 glass tube clever back and forth 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.650
 registered and could in case of doubt 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.940
 save a life for me completely 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.230
 Personally, I really do speak 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.660
 this is the only one for me 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.670
 biggest heroic act you can do anyone 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.959
 give life to others and I only 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.970
 the one we donate to 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.319
 but all around him all 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.370
 people who love him all people 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.739
 who hope he gets well again 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.239
 and I think that's crazy 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.830
 valuable and there is a small hook 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.290
 at registration I tell myself 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.280
 not to scare her 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.590
 Of course, your samples must be hers 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.360
 be evaluated by people who are evaluated 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.280
 It means working people who are paid 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.890
 must be and therefore costs one 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.480
 registration 50 euros and it is for 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.130
 some people not much i would do that 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.510
 I paid it but pay for it 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.040
 other people is that awful lot 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.359
 money if you say now I would 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.370
 Donate but I do not have the money 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.900
 please do not hesitate to contact the dkms 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.120
 because there are also people who say okay 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.470
 I have the 100 euro I 'm just 100 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.970
 euro for my registration then can 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.739
 to register even more occasion with 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.390
 let or there are people who say 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.650
 So I would not like me so much 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.510
 register it's kind of funny 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.160
 but I will give you a small donation 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.900
 so that people can do it 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.190
 I think it's great that it's something like that 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.780
 the thicker and there are and I think so 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.489
 great that there are people to it 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.930
 agree to donate that is so 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.280
 great if you are a bit pure 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.720
 It also reads in this whole thing 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.400
 totally exciting these stories around 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.230
 to hear this whole organization 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.790
 After five years you can donate and 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.440
 receiver for example, both decide 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.269
 I want to contact each other 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.850
 or I do not want that and it is 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.530
 Touching to read without end like this 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.880
 stories run from the people who 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.049
 decide they want to get to know each other 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.000
 because of course, through this whole 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.310
 donations are almost like siblings 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.690
 or the best friends for years 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.980
 completely different life led 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.630
 have the had no idea of 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.859
 existence of the other and then 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.239
 suddenly at that point like that 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.489
 be welded together because they are 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.630
 Save each other life or one 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.940

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.130
