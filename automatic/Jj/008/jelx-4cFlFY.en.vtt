00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
I just thought I'd show you as this is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.040 
I just thought I'd show you as this is
starting<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.000> grow<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.720> know<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.020> can

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
starting to grow out and I know it can

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.109 
starting to grow out and I know it can
get<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.650> little<00:00:22.980> bit<00:00:23.189> boring<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> same

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
get a little bit boring to have the same

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.169 
get a little bit boring to have the same
color<00:00:24.419> on<00:00:24.509> so<00:00:25.320> here's<00:00:25.859> how<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.339> it<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.970> can

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
color on so here's how to do it you can

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.749 
color on so here's how to do it you can
also<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.749> it<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:27.990> normal<00:00:28.560> polish<00:00:28.919> so<00:00:29.519> if<00:00:29.669> you

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
also do it with normal polish so if you

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.210 
also do it with normal polish so if you
haven't<00:00:29.999> got<00:00:30.359> actual<00:00:30.990> mock<00:00:31.349> polishes<00:00:31.949> or<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
haven't got actual mock polishes or a

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.490 
haven't got actual mock polishes or a
matte<00:00:33.030> topcoat<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.380> an

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
matte topcoat then this is an

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500 
matte topcoat then this is an
alternative<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.220> you<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.760> well<00:00:35.940> but

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
I'm using a Sun turtle which is actually

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.160 
I'm using a Sun turtle which is actually
just<00:01:01.350> more<00:01:02.160> long-lasting<00:01:02.539> version<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
just more long-lasting version of the

sometimes these come in white but as

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.790 
sometimes these come in white but as
they're<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.670> inexpensive<00:01:09.080> easy<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.560> hold

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
they're so inexpensive easy to get hold

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.440

tutorial and all you literally need to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.850 
tutorial and all you literally need to
do<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:16.979> edge<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.970> surface<00:01:18.860> wick

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
do is to just edge the surface wick

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.859 
do is to just edge the surface wick
backwards<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.579> forwards<00:01:21.060> make<00:01:21.390> sure<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.720> get

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
backwards and forwards make sure you get

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.219 
backwards and forwards make sure you get
all<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> sides<00:01:23.689> now<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.899> want<00:01:25.079> to<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
all the sides now you do want to be

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.170 
all the sides now you do want to be
careful<00:01:25.649> not<00:01:25.829> to<00:01:25.890> make<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.520> Polish<00:01:27.000> or

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
careful not to make the Polish or

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.630 
careful not to make the Polish or
shellac<00:01:27.509> thinner<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.259> certain<00:01:29.009> areas<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
shellac thinner in certain areas as it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.969 
shellac thinner in certain areas as it
will<00:01:29.909> certainly<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.560> once<00:01:31.829> you've

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
will certainly do that so once you've

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.620 
will certainly do that so once you've
gone<00:01:32.130> over<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> area<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.119> keep<00:01:33.360> stopping

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
gone over the area just keep stopping

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.030 
gone over the area just keep stopping
and<00:01:33.899> checking<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.350> carry<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.740> until

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and checking and just carry on until

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.459 
and checking and just carry on until
it's<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.549> done<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:39.659> probably<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:40.140> need<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
it's all done you probably will need to

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.170 
it's all done you probably will need to
maybe<00:01:40.649> wash<00:01:40.950> your<00:01:41.159> hands<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> dust<00:01:41.909> as

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
maybe wash your hands of the dust as

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.450 
maybe wash your hands of the dust as
well<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.229> see<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> popper<00:01:43.829> effect<00:01:44.189> at

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
well so you can see the popper effect at

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.709 
well so you can see the popper effect at
the<00:01:44.549> end<00:01:46.369> but<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.759> literally<00:01:48.149> all<00:01:48.270> that's

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
the end but this is literally all that's

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.969 
the end but this is literally all that's
required<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.469> it<00:01:51.380> but<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.469> won't<00:01:52.680> damage

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
required for it but this won't damage

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.800 
required for it but this won't damage
your<00:01:53.280> nail<00:01:53.430> underneath<00:01:53.820> as<00:01:54.420> you're<00:01:54.689> only

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
your nail underneath as you're only

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.600 
your nail underneath as you're only
literally<00:01:55.200> acting<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.860> surface<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
literally acting the surface of the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.190 
literally acting the surface of the
shellac<00:01:59.390> but<00:02:00.390> once<00:02:00.600> you've<00:02:00.780> got<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.200> done

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
shellac but once you've got it all done

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.539 
shellac but once you've got it all done
you've<00:02:04.200> basically<00:02:04.439> got<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.009> finish<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
you've basically got the finish that

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.730 
you've basically got the finish that
you're<00:02:05.670> after<00:02:05.869> there<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.109> there<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:07.619> I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
compare against this nail you can see on

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.330 
compare against this nail you can see on
the<00:02:12.330> left<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.870> got<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.110> matte<00:02:13.290> finish<00:02:13.680> and
