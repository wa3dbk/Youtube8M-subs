picking<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:57.470> should<00:01:57.650> write<00:01:57.800> in<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.220> use

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
picking so you should write in and use

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.700 
picking so you should write in and use
the<00:01:58.610> flesh<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:59.060> your<00:01:59.330> right<00:01:59.479> hand<00:01:59.720> to<00:02:00.500> just

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
the flesh of your right hand to just

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.500 
the flesh of your right hand to just
mute<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.190> strings<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.210> when<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.420> hit

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510

mute the strings so that when you hit
them<00:02:03.400> it<00:02:04.400> doesn't<00:02:04.580> really<00:02:04.760> make<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.210> lot<00:02:05.300> of

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479

hmm<00:02:24.810> okay<00:02:25.610> now<00:02:26.610> practice<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.590> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
hmm okay now practice that and do that a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.940 
hmm okay now practice that and do that a
lot<00:02:29.820> of<00:02:29.910> times<00:02:30.120> get<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:30.750> really<00:02:31.200> ingrain<00:02:31.560> with

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
lot of times get up really ingrain with

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.980 
lot of times get up really ingrain with
just<00:02:32.220> your<00:02:32.310> left<00:02:32.460> hand<00:02:32.730> because<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.840> more

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
just your left hand because the more

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.500 
just your left hand because the more
muscle<00:02:34.260> memory<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:35.270> easier<00:02:36.270> and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
muscle memory you have the easier and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.050 
muscle memory you have the easier and
faster<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.960> be<00:02:37.050> able<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.230> pick<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.440> up<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:41.060> what

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
faster you be able to pick it up so what

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.130 
faster you be able to pick it up so what
I<00:02:42.270> would<00:02:42.510> recommend<00:02:43.440> doing<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.810> practicing<00:02:45.810> it

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
I would recommend doing is practicing it

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.720 
I would recommend doing is practicing it
very<00:02:46.380> evenly<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.280> very<00:02:47.670> slow<00:02:48.500> because

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
very evenly and very slow because

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.370 
very evenly and very slow because
they're<00:02:50.730> more<00:02:50.880> evenly<00:02:51.300> you're<00:02:51.840> able<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.140> play

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
they're more evenly you're able to play

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.550 
they're more evenly you're able to play
it<00:02:52.820> D<00:02:53.820> greater<00:02:54.060> accuracy<00:02:54.420> you'll<00:02:54.780> have<00:02:55.080> when

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
it D greater accuracy you'll have when

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.290 
it D greater accuracy you'll have when
you're<00:02:55.680> trying<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.920> play<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.100> faster<00:02:56.640> because

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
you're trying to play it faster because

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.400 
you're trying to play it faster because
what<00:02:57.600> most<00:02:57.780> people<00:02:58.020> do<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:59.000> they'll<00:03:00.410> play

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
what most people do is they'll play

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.240 
what most people do is they'll play
something<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:01.920> when<00:03:02.130> they're

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
something like this when they're

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.280 
something like this when they're
practicing<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:08.340> it'll<00:03:09.150> be<00:03:09.270> at<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.750> time<00:03:10.020> and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
practicing and it'll be at a time and

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.900 
practicing and it'll be at a time and
the<00:03:10.440> notes<00:03:10.620> won't<00:03:10.830> be<00:03:10.920> even<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.400> they'll<00:03:11.790> make

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
the notes won't be even and they'll make

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.580 
the notes won't be even and they'll make
mistakes<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:13.020> what<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.200> want<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.350> do<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.530> you

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
mistakes so what you want to do is you

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.380 
mistakes so what you want to do is you
want<00:03:13.710> to<00:03:13.740> practice<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.100> nice<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.340> evenly<00:03:14.790> so

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
want to practice it nice and evenly so

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.130 
want to practice it nice and evenly so
nice<00:03:15.780> even<00:03:16.260> spaces<00:03:16.650> between<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:17.040> notes

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
nice even spaces between the notes

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.220 
nice even spaces between the notes

to actually swinging the only real thing
to<00:03:54.070> do<00:03:54.250> is<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:57.340> practice<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:57.970> guess<00:03:58.060> could<00:03:58.960> you

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
to do is just practice I guess could you

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.570 
to do is just practice I guess could you
have<00:03:59.140> your<00:03:59.260> left<00:03:59.440> hand<00:03:59.650> down<00:03:59.770> then<00:04:00.370> it's<00:04:00.490> all

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
have your left hand down then it's all

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.740 
have your left hand down then it's all
about<00:04:00.730> just<00:04:00.850> getting<00:04:01.060> your<00:04:01.210> right<00:04:01.390> hand<00:04:01.600> down

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
about just getting your right hand down

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.930 
about just getting your right hand down
so<00:04:01.990> what<00:04:02.470> I<00:04:02.500> recommend<00:04:02.890> doing<00:04:02.920> is<00:04:03.280> just<00:04:03.580> nice

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
so what I recommend doing is just nice

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.150 
so what I recommend doing is just nice
and<00:04:04.120> evenly<00:04:04.420> picking<00:04:05.050> down<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.320> strings<00:04:05.590> in<00:04:05.830> a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
and evenly picking down the strings in a

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.270 
and evenly picking down the strings in a
sweeping<00:04:06.430> motion<00:04:06.550> so<00:04:07.420> you're<00:04:07.600> not<00:04:07.750> picking

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
sweeping motion so you're not picking

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.550 
sweeping motion so you're not picking
it's<00:04:09.280> just<00:04:09.490> a<00:04:09.580> sweep<00:04:09.910> down<00:04:10.330> and<00:04:10.690> up<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.080> keep

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
it's just a sweep down and up and keep

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.480 
it's just a sweep down and up and keep
your<00:04:11.650> fingers<00:04:11.770> nice<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.280> relaxed<00:04:12.880> okay<00:04:13.630> so

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
metronome as well because when you're
