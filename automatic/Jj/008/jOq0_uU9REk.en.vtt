 Raids on drivers who were on the go by the perpetrators 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.860

 Audi has then been left behind by the perpetrators here in Recklinghausen 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.420
 in a parking lot we know that the culprits had a firearm are great 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.890

 hereof that this is the stolen goods from times 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.090
 but that also has to be reconciled 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.039
 The perpetrators obviously fled on foot 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.329
