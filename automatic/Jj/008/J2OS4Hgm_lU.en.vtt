00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
finish now what makes these little

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060 
finish now what makes these little
lockdown<00:01:18.119> backrests<00:01:18.630> unique<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.590> soft

you<00:01:46.170> want<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.479> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.630> tighten<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you want it and then you can tighten it

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.740 
you want it and then you can tighten it
up<00:01:49.200> with<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.439> smaller<00:01:49.770> section<00:01:50.450> now<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.509> great

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
up with a smaller section now the great

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.960 
up with a smaller section now the great
thing<00:01:51.960> about<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:53.100> tightly<00:01:53.430> eradicate

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
thing about that is it tightly eradicate

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.480 
thing about that is it tightly eradicate
the<00:01:54.149> need<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.630> any<00:01:54.990> o-rings<00:01:55.649> rubbers

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the need for any o-rings rubbers

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.190 
the need for any o-rings rubbers
anything<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.600> you're<00:01:57.750> putting

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
anything like that that you're putting

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.410 
anything like that that you're putting
in<00:01:58.320> there<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.680> try<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.040> align<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.610> straight

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
in there to try and align this straight

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.600 
in there to try and align this straight
so<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> ensure<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:01.829> totally<00:02:01.979> straight

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
so I ensure that it's totally straight

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.459 
so I ensure that it's totally straight
and<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:03.240> because<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.020> completely

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
and then because that is completely

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.620 
and then because that is completely
tightened<00:02:04.979> down<00:02:05.119> that<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.450> going

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
tightened down that is not going

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.399 
tightened down that is not going
anywhere

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
anywhere

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.249 
anywhere
lovely<00:02:08.160> then<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:09.030> far<00:02:09.239> as<00:02:09.509> getting<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> insert

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
lovely then as far as getting the insert

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.650 
lovely then as far as getting the insert
in<00:02:10.679> there<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.129> concerned<00:02:11.580> all<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.300> do<00:02:12.510> is

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
in there is concerned all you do is

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.820 
in there is concerned all you do is
simply<00:02:12.870> moisten

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
simply moisten

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.090 
simply moisten
these<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.280> grommet<00:02:15.090> bits<00:02:15.270> at<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.600> here

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
these little grommet bits at the in here

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.220 
these little grommet bits at the in here
so<00:02:17.100> once<00:02:17.400> moisten<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:18.270> simply<00:02:18.630> pop<00:02:19.050> them

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
so once moisten just simply pop them

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.220 
so once moisten just simply pop them
into<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.650> holes<00:02:20.000> either<00:02:21.000> side<00:02:23.720> that's<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:24.930> and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
into the holes either side that's so and

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.740 
into the holes either side that's so and
then<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.520> just<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.760> case<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:26.970> twisting<00:02:27.570> this

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
then it's just a case of twisting this

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.810 
then it's just a case of twisting this
round<00:02:29.690> sitting<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:31.200> place<00:02:33.440> lovely<00:02:34.820> now

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820

tighter grip than that and the great
