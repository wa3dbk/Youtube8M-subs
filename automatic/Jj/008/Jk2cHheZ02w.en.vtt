00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.230
 then my daily regiment starts it 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.580
 by gathering in the morning or the 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.130
 general partner gives us orders for the 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.830
 day so usually it's going on the 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.769
 morning sport physical activity followed 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.390
 usually drill on activities 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.519
 more technical where we train in 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.579
 our area of ​​specialty in the regiment 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.319
 every day we train physically 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.519
 I am an officer apc ie 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.800
 that I'm basically taking care of 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.720
 arming the company to do in 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.710
 so that it is available for 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.489
 the company's workforce for the 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.240
 different operations 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.500
 then between the different instructions 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 training and my deployment in 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.530
 afghanistan 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.440
 I do not have time to be bored 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.730
 and with the preparation of my competition 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.360
 to join the military school 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.290
 Joint 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.850
 I'm focusing on a rather busy future 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.740
 a job so in the morning we gather 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.650
 around 8 am starts with 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.720
 two hours of sport then so to 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.900
 from 10am these various instructions 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.670
 so as well tactical technique that 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.520
 can go from the firing simulator to the armed 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.960
 light or so firing simulators 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.420
 vbc y that we currently have at the level of 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.979
 regiment which allows us to keep 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.539
 the frames in what we acquired everything 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.909
 throughout our career and driver 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.289
 of not not losing the habit of doing 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.630
 contact or contactless 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.700
 no i have not seen the time pass i have that 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.990
 is linked quickly enough and it is true that 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.189
 when I look I do not think there is 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.969
 13 years back I was trying 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.319
 tiémoko hatch 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.119
 I have not seen the time pass this is a 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.350
 year to 2 then I got engaged not from 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.759
 all found the long time on the contrary 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.490
 I do not think it's really 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.850
 super fast between the formations the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.780
 field my senegal mission happened 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.639
 really too fast I do not see the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.799
 years past in fact so the first 

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:44.709
 bonus July 14th it will be the permissions 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.100
 vacation these free ground exercises 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.479
 in September and will mostly put in 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.459
 application what I learned at the 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.139
 last training then the day 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.789
 daily is not there really 

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:56.139
 a typical day now the day 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.420
 a soldier is often sport 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:59.920
 morning work in the job or 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.700
 preparation of various missions 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.820
 are 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.409
 which is lost in anticipation but there is 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.479
 not really an alarmed type day 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.709
 will circulate it's really very varied there 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.009
 there is no day 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.009
 identical 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.289
