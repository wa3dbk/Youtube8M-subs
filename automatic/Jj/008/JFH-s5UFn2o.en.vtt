nylons<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.409> using<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.100> think

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
nylons are using here but I do think

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.289

it's an interesting choice to go to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.880 
it's an interesting choice to go to
neoprene<00:01:15.750> because<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.259> creates<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.560> form

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
neoprene because it creates that form
