00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.330
 coach you have none this week 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.950
 midweek game must finish that 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.190
 was a while ago 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.630
 yes that is very strange because you are 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.160
 of course used to just three times in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.100
 the week the play it on the other side 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.109
 after the match against Anderlecht 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.430
 but we reached the final 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.080
 was that sometimes nice to the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.029
 boys anyway is one or two days 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.170
 extra so train how is the atmosphere in the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.340
 group actually achieving that 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.720
 final place 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.610
 yes you can understand that of course 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.100
 it was great and that it was huge 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.239
 have also had a lot of fun 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.129
 the fact that we of course the whole 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.500
 difficult trajectories we must follow with 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.360
 with standard waregem and and hands 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.370
 ultimately so it is also again 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.890
 but it was one of the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.809
 objectives that we like 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.460
 saw accomplished this year and that is 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.129
 playing the final 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.350
 but we have a third position inside 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.059
 the playoffs so that is also a very 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.800
 positive but we still have two 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.469
 competitions to go we start tomorrow 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.750
 with agent and then and mountains 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.400
 yes the to so our to the the gap to the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.470
 number one and two are small model too 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.110
 with effect from the play or so 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.260
 no I think the atmosphere is very good 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.720
 the fitness of the group is extraordinary 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.490
 21 fit players, well, that's me 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.810
 For that to make those choices 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.110
 act channel you for the fourth 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.729
 times in a row behind the zero that is 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.070
 been different this season 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.850
 yes there is a lot of hammer and phil to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.380
 looked at 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.140
 so that also indicates something about the way 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.520
 of playing and maybe defending 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.650
 so yes that is nice though 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.159
 in the end it still concerns me 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.079
 to win 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.540
 and whether that is with a 0 or with 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.130
 three two there I never lift like that 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.409
 tough on it but it is a given 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.329
 that often and the new audio and you 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.189
 Saturday night the agent what do you expect 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.360
 of that match 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.770
 agent has his goal within or 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.210
 at least she dropped from group of 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.680
 advance course not for all t I 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.240
 find haag and still a team that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.430
 also for play or one should play 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.259
 but that is good due to circumstances 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.310
 failed to have the play or two 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.450
 within 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.490
 there there nothing can do anymore 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.229
 change yes i don't know what for 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.430
 you see mindset coming 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.659
 i think we shouldn't go to it 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.369
 opponent we have to watch 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.630
 look at ourselves 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.850
 as we with the same attitude 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.410
 play as if against Anderlecht then 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.670
 We have sufficient quality to this 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.710
 to win a competition 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.520
 well a magpie to games are the 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.100
 competition can not the sex points 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.770
 gary good starting point and ceiling 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.950
 yes coaches did that they anger 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.080
 ching here because we don't allow focus here 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.800
 in this took him to crochet pdf 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.750
 I prefer kim everything fnv to which this so 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.700
 I still spot in this to games 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.830
 he 10 million with the live from digicar 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.900
 the bottle is in place which I lip 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.880
 team the teams that count 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.320
 that's what your hand nuts 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.730
 when I added the clinch with tomatoes plus 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.620
 the tub and eh 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.530
 the shorter straw way to you print football 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.720
 is the hood that the a love for possible 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.480
 sad in the camps between 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.900
 yes this is it is know tattoo it 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.180
 imposing tub and less of wax 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.790
 one does not appear to be the most beautiful 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.730
 pot is the lying expression dps that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.160
 shortened this is in fashion pendant 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.200
 not because it was in the neighborhood 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.299
 pleasure to play diet declining me 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.280
 it takes you in her very moment 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.920
 man divorcing so drawings sonor 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.320
 the video old language that text how in that 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.630
 league and then and that he crawls 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.070
 sound shop for retina 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.049
 but exercises agent become you 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:36.360
 expect us point now is just what i wanted here 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.989
 we never allow yes 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.730
 then home app what so cordial and that 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.180
 you are the reason that to be playing and the 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.190
 tomorrow's he would think i 'd just do 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.060
 I have this report we are just mine 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.700
 the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.260
 the rest who would 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.760
 in terms of competition it would be nice 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
 if you still get six points for the 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.580
 start of colors 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.250
 well then we must be our endeavor 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.239
 so we try to do a little bit 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.519
 walk on the 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.230
 in the places for us and that is possible 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.819
 only by yourself our points within 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.920
 so let's start with 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.519
 the agent of very difficult competition 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.590
 will be 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.480
 okay with the confidence that on this 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.860
 quality and the ground 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.269
 I have one that we have 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.519
 yes i think we should be sure 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.019
 to handle it you go with it 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.459
 a good feeling towards that 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.780
 game against gent 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.160
 we also and sit and positive flow them 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.870
 also won the two last matches 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.780
 no that is also so it certainly won't 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.979
 be easy i find no way 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.690
 on which a very different team as a city 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.000
 for new year they give me a few 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.590
 but made very good purchases and yes 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.060
 new trainer also suggested his are 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.130
 to rely on the group 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.720
 so that makes them to be or the 20 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.280
 results are even better last eating and 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.750
 yes, as certainly must be on our guard 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.550
 and they have strengthened him midfield 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.550
 with david uber 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.960
 yes absolutely he could do excellent there 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.850
 only positive comments about 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.000
 him so I am very happy for that 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.250
 will naturally during the match 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.600
 we are enemies and after the game will 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.310
 it will be laughed again back 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.260
 as friends but then again as someone 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.030
 again i like it incredibly fast going 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.310
 someone who always processes it hard 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.020
 And he just deserves to get somewhere 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.150
 back in the basic team so off 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.110
 Absolutely quite deliver you 2 clamping 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.639
 there might be a few more 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.810
 up and down text messages also go for the 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.450
 contest 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.610
 yes that has already happened is no I said think 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.169
 i am very good friends with david that 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.340
 will always remain that way 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.620
 ok he does so that they can do well 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.960
 for gent i do that for genk so that 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.810
 is only logical and it gets through 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.650
 certainly not to chad a match but 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.370
 of course we both go 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.370
 us think the best
