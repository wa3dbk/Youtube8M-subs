is on the cover the suitcase suit

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.630 
is on the cover the suitcase suit
because<00:03:52.990> he's<00:03:53.140> not<00:03:53.320> really<00:03:53.560> in<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:54.070> movie<00:03:54.370> for

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
because he's not really in the movie for

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.520 
because he's not really in the movie for
that<00:03:54.760> long<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.300> mean<00:03:55.840> they<00:03:55.960> show<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.200> suitcase

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
that long I mean they show the suitcase

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.840 
that long I mean they show the suitcase
a<00:03:56.560> couple<00:03:56.890> times<00:03:57.070> but<00:03:57.310> when<00:03:57.400> he<00:03:57.490> puts<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:57.790> on

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
a couple times but when he puts it on

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.570 
a couple times but when he puts it on
he's<00:03:58.090> only<00:03:58.270> in<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.630> for<00:03:59.040> like<00:04:00.040> three<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.460> a

he's only in it for like three and a
half<00:04:00.700> minutes<00:04:01.180> so<00:04:02.400> I'm<00:04:03.400> glad<00:04:03.700> they<00:04:03.820> put<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.150> on

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
half minutes so I'm glad they put it on

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.420 
half minutes so I'm glad they put it on
the<00:04:04.300> cover<00:04:04.510> but<00:04:04.840> it's<00:04:05.800> not<00:04:05.950> really<00:04:06.190> big<00:04:06.400> enough

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
the cover but it's not really big enough

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.490 
the cover but it's not really big enough
part<00:04:06.910> of<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.120> movie<00:04:07.420> might<00:04:08.140> have<00:04:08.230> been<00:04:08.350> more

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
part of the movie might have been more

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.540 
part of the movie might have been more
suitable<00:04:08.890> they<00:04:09.160> put<00:04:09.870> mark<00:04:10.870> six<00:04:11.140> on<00:04:11.320> it<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:11.860> I'm

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
suitable they put mark six on it but I'm

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.250
