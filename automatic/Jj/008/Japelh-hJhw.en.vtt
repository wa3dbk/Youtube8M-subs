simple single end of them and that it

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.439 
simple single end of them and that it
uses<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:22.230> 12ax7<00:00:22.650> power<00:00:23.310> tube<00:00:23.640> or<00:00:24.119> sorry

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
uses a one 12ax7 power tube or sorry

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
preamp tube and in the old 34 power tube

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.170 
preamp tube and in the old 34 power tube
and<00:00:27.869> that's<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:29.179> got<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.289> tone<00:00:31.289> control

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
and that's it got a tone control

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.350 
and that's it got a tone control
consisting<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.329> treble<00:00:33.780> mid<00:00:34.200> range<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.800> bass

consisting of treble mid range and bass
and<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:37.620> has<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.160> preamp<00:00:38.940> gain<00:00:39.149> control<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and it has a preamp gain control and a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.150 
and it has a preamp gain control and a
master<00:00:41.190> volume<00:00:41.370> control<00:00:42.590> I'll<00:00:43.590> run<00:00:44.010> through

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
master volume control I'll run through

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.830 
master volume control I'll run through
some<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> cleaner<00:00:44.730> tones<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.329> then<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
some of the cleaner tones and then and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:01:06.940 
some of the cleaner tones and then and
then<00:00:46.110> show<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:47.149> how<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.329> thing<00:00:48.600> over<00:00:49.050> dreads

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.100 

it's<00:01:07.280> only<00:01:07.430> got<00:01:07.610> one<00:01:07.640> input<00:01:07.970> this<00:01:08.390> is<00:01:08.630> sort<00:01:08.990> of

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
it's only got one input this is sort of

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.530 
it's only got one input this is sort of
I<00:01:09.440> guess<00:01:10.130> sort<00:01:10.370> of<00:01:10.520> like<00:01:10.730> a<00:01:10.760> Tube<00:01:11.030> channel<00:01:11.450> in

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
I guess sort of like a Tube channel in

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.960 
I guess sort of like a Tube channel in
that<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:11.900> does<00:01:12.110> have<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:12.350> bright<00:01:12.710> tap<00:01:13.040> on<00:01:13.340> it<00:01:13.490> I

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
that it does have a bright tap on it I

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.700 
that it does have a bright tap on it I
switched<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.340> so<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:16.700> it's<00:01:17.120> on<00:01:17.270> the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
switched it so that it's on the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.110 
switched it so that it's on the
push/pull<00:01:18.710> pot<00:01:18.920> in<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.220> first<00:01:19.430> game<00:01:19.670> control

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
push/pull pot in the first game control

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.600 
push/pull pot in the first game control
so<00:01:20.360> if<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:20.630> pull<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.680> out<00:01:21.740> then<00:01:22.130> next<00:01:22.340> week's

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
so if you pull that out then next week's

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.200 
so if you pull that out then next week's
breakdown

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
breakdown

00:01:23.210 --> 00:02:01.740 
breakdown
you<00:01:23.390> get<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:23.570> sparkly<00:01:24.170> overtone

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:31.600 

so<00:02:02.750> it's<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.410> very<00:02:03.740> nice<00:02:03.920> plane

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.640 

and<00:02:32.610> we<00:02:32.819> turn<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> master<00:02:33.329> down<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.930> bit<00:02:34.260> you

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
and we turn the master down a bit you

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.190 
and we turn the master down a bit you
turn<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.900> game<00:02:37.909> and<00:02:38.909> see<00:02:39.420> how<00:02:39.629> our<00:02:39.659> drives

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
turn up the game and see how our drives

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:57.099 
turn up the game and see how our drives
a<00:02:40.379> bit

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.199 

they<00:02:58.109> get<00:02:58.290> some<00:02:58.500> great<00:02:58.859> decent<00:02:59.280> over<00:02:59.849> Durban

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
they get some great decent over Durban

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.830 
they get some great decent over Durban
tones<00:03:00.420> at<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:00.719> lower<00:03:00.870> volume<00:03:01.349> as<00:03:02.280> we<00:03:02.659> turn<00:03:03.659> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
tones at the lower volume as we turn the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:13.839 
tones at the lower volume as we turn the
preamp<00:03:04.140> gain<00:03:04.230> all<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.680> way<00:03:04.769> up

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.420 

get<00:03:14.849> pretty<00:03:15.090> heavy<00:03:15.330> saturation<00:03:16.099> for<00:03:17.099> an<00:03:17.250> old

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
get pretty heavy saturation for an old

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:42.760 
get pretty heavy saturation for an old
if<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.880> you're<00:03:18.090> too<00:03:18.239> too<00:03:18.450> bad

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.580 

and<00:03:43.770> then<00:03:43.950> if<00:03:44.040> we<00:03:44.160> turn<00:03:44.640> up<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.850> master<00:03:45.360> so<00:03:45.690> now

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
and then if we turn up the master so now

00:03:46.590 --> 00:04:13.380 
and then if we turn up the master so now
I'm<00:03:46.709> right<00:03:46.890> about<00:03:47.040> two-thirds<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.910> way<00:03:48.120> up

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.960 

now<00:04:14.390> we'll<00:04:14.690> turn<00:04:14.900> everything<00:04:15.230> up<00:04:15.440> all<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.800> way

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
now we'll turn everything up all the way

00:04:15.970 --> 00:05:10.070 
now we'll turn everything up all the way
and<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.480> is<00:04:17.540> pretty<00:04:18.380> much

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.080 

and
