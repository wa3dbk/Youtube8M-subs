00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
Perrin this won't be like a real review

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.620 
Perrin this won't be like a real review
because<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.340> haven't<00:00:14.549> used<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.000> knife<00:00:15.150> yet<00:00:15.450> but

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
because I haven't used the knife yet but

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.970 
because I haven't used the knife yet but
we<00:00:15.750> are<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> put<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> knife<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.770> some

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
we are going to put the knife to some

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.040 
we are going to put the knife to some
use<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.730> will<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.300> some<00:00:18.480> dialogue<00:00:18.660> about

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
use so I will have some dialogue about

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.679 
use so I will have some dialogue about
the<00:00:19.260> knife<00:00:19.410> afterwards<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.640> just<00:00:21.390> from<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
the knife afterwards but just from a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.830 
the knife afterwards but just from a
review<00:00:22.109> standpoint<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.640> knife<00:00:24.330> did<00:00:24.660> not

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
review standpoint this knife did not

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.480 
review standpoint this knife did not
come<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> greatest<00:00:25.740> edge<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.369> is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
come with the greatest edge so it is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.660 
come with the greatest edge so it is
repro<00:00:27.000> filed<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.920> as<00:00:28.920> far<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.400> could<00:00:29.460> tell

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
repro filed but as far as I could tell

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.759 
repro filed but as far as I could tell
it's<00:00:29.970> awesome<00:00:30.510> knife<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.990> let's<00:00:31.380> see<00:00:31.529> what<00:00:31.679> it

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
it's awesome knife and let's see what it

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:53.810 
it's awesome knife and let's see what it
can<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.309> some<00:00:32.520> free<00:00:32.820> hanging<00:00:33.030> water<00:00:33.420> booze

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.920 

I<00:00:53.880> probably<00:00:54.630> should<00:00:54.900> stop<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:56.600> one<00:00:57.600> thing<00:00:57.810> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
I probably should stop there one thing I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.710 
I probably should stop there one thing I
noticed<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.910> did<00:01:00.090> glide<00:01:00.390> through<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
noticed is that it did glide through the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.710 
noticed is that it did glide through the
water<00:01:01.500> hose<00:01:02.040> pretty<00:01:02.400> easily<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:03.030> hung<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.600> in

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
water hose pretty easily I hung up in

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.780 
water hose pretty easily I hung up in
one<00:01:03.930> spot<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.589> mean<00:01:04.800> you<00:01:05.160> just<00:01:05.190> can't<00:01:05.550> have

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
one spot but I mean you just can't have

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.359 
one spot but I mean you just can't have
a<00:01:05.820> consistent<00:01:06.420> swing<00:01:06.540> all<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> time<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.530> this

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
a consistent swing all the time and this

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.670 
a consistent swing all the time and this
jumping<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.750> very<00:01:09.869> secure<00:01:10.470> when

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
jumping right here it's very secure when

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.590 
jumping right here it's very secure when
I'm<00:01:10.800> using<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.190> knife<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.940> feels<00:01:12.180> really<00:01:12.420> good

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
I'm using the knife it feels really good

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.310 
I'm using the knife it feels really good
in<00:01:12.750> my<00:01:12.780> hand

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
in my hand

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.830 
in my hand
but<00:01:13.650> after<00:01:13.950> probably<00:01:17.479> seven<00:01:18.479> cuts<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.280> I

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
but after probably seven cuts or so I

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.080 
but after probably seven cuts or so I
feel<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.990> are<00:01:22.080> braiding<00:01:22.440> my<00:01:22.619> thumb<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.310> it's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
feel it are braiding my thumb and it's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.969 
feel it are braiding my thumb and it's
not<00:01:24.270> bleeding<00:01:24.570> or<00:01:24.869> anything<00:01:25.050> but<00:01:25.410> I<00:01:25.470> did<00:01:25.740> feel

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
not bleeding or anything but I did feel

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.580 
not bleeding or anything but I did feel
a<00:01:26.550> lot<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.090> friction<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.780> thumb<00:01:28.020> which

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
a lot of friction on the thumb which

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.090 
a lot of friction on the thumb which
that's<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:28.920> jumping<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.890> if<00:01:31.890> you're

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
that's what jumping is for so if you're

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.469 
that's what jumping is for so if you're
going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.340> use<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.610> knife<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.300> long

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
going to use this knife for a long

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.840 
going to use this knife for a long
period<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.930> time<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.320> utility<00:01:34.920> tasks<00:01:35.190> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
period of time with utility tasks you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.320 
period of time with utility tasks you
might<00:01:36.060> wear<00:01:37.050> your<00:01:37.259> thumb<00:01:37.500> down<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> little<00:01:38.009> bit

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
might wear your thumb down a little bit

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.830 
might wear your thumb down a little bit
this<00:01:39.330> is<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.539> VG<00:01:39.960> ten<00:01:40.200> blade<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.660> see

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
this is a VG ten blade and it's to see

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.300 
this is a VG ten blade and it's to see
if<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.080> still<00:01:43.229> shaving<00:01:43.560> after<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.130> water

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
if it's still shaving after that water

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.109 
if it's still shaving after that water
hose<00:01:44.660> okay<00:01:45.660> I'll<00:01:45.810> hit<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.080> sharpen<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.560> up<00:01:47.119> but

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
hose okay I'll hit the sharpen it up but

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.630 
hose okay I'll hit the sharpen it up but
it<00:01:48.420> was<00:01:48.600> shaking<00:01:49.259> sharp<00:01:49.560> while<00:01:49.770> ago<00:01:50.039> and<00:01:50.520> I'm

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it was shaking sharp while ago and I'm

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.279 
it was shaking sharp while ago and I'm
sure<00:01:50.880> after<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.240> little<00:01:51.539> bit<00:01:51.660> of<00:01:51.780> touch-up

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
sure after a little bit of touch-up

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.529 
sure after a little bit of touch-up
it<00:01:52.560> will<00:01:52.740> work<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.039> just<00:01:53.100> fine<00:01:53.789> this<00:01:54.240> knife<00:01:54.509> is

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
it will work out just fine this knife is

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.389 
it will work out just fine this knife is
extremely<00:01:55.289> lightweight<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.800> don't<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
extremely lightweight I don't have the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.969 
extremely lightweight I don't have the
specs<00:01:56.700> all<00:01:56.940> pinned<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:58.530> know<00:01:58.619> really<00:01:58.950> I

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
specs all pinned and you know really I

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.320 
specs all pinned and you know really I
could<00:01:59.280> look<00:01:59.400> it<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.610> yourself<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.210> I'll

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
could look it up yourself but I'll

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.330 
could look it up yourself but I'll
probably<00:02:00.509> post<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.320> description<00:02:01.890> box

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
probably post it in the description box

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.490 
probably post it in the description box
but<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.759> amazing<00:02:03.270> how<00:02:03.360> light<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.990> knife<00:02:04.200> is

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
but it's amazing how light this knife is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.590 
but it's amazing how light this knife is
and<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.759> don't<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.030> why<00:02:06.180> I'm<00:02:06.299> holding<00:02:06.450> this

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and I don't know why I'm holding this

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.080 
and I don't know why I'm holding this
piece<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.990> garden<00:02:07.200> hose<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:08.310> toss<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.880> over

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
piece of garden hose just toss it over

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.509 
piece of garden hose just toss it over
to<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.329> side<00:02:09.540> but<00:02:10.350> it<00:02:10.590> feels<00:02:10.860> really<00:02:11.130> good<00:02:11.370> in

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
to the side but it feels really good in

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.990 
to the side but it feels really good in
the<00:02:11.579> hand<00:02:11.720> it's<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:12.959> light<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:14.010> don't<00:02:14.640> think

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
the hand it's so light I don't think

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.600 
the hand it's so light I don't think
it's<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.239> full<00:02:15.420> tang<00:02:15.690> construction<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:16.650> we

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
it's a full tang construction because we

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.580 
it's a full tang construction because we
were<00:02:17.730> comparing<00:02:18.120> another<00:02:18.570> blade<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.410> my

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
were comparing another blade that my

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.699 
were comparing another blade that my
brother<00:02:19.860> has<00:02:20.190> from<00:02:20.670> Basten<00:02:21.600> le<00:02:21.750> creations<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
brother has from Basten le creations and

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.620 
brother has from Basten le creations and
it's<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.280> full<00:02:23.489> tang<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.090> it's

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
it's a full tang and it's it's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.170 
it's a full tang and it's it's
approximately<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.769> same<00:02:25.950> size<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:26.940> there's

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
approximately the same size but there's

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.940 
approximately the same size but there's
a<00:02:27.239> lot<00:02:27.510> more<00:02:27.660> weight<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.170> blade<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.440> I'm

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
a lot more weight to the blade and I'm

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.800 
a lot more weight to the blade and I'm
sure<00:02:29.130> I'll<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.549> video<00:02:29.760> over<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.600> knife

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
sure I'll have a video over that knife

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.009 
sure I'll have a video over that knife
in<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.410> future<00:02:31.799> but<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.790> Fred<00:02:33.239> paring<00:02:33.660> he

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
in the future but a Fred paring he

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.390 
in the future but a Fred paring he
really<00:02:34.320> knows<00:02:34.500> what<00:02:34.530> he's<00:02:34.799> doing<00:02:35.190> when<00:02:35.340> he's

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
really knows what he's doing when he's

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.880 
really knows what he's doing when he's
making<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.850> knife<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.630> extremely<00:02:37.230> economic

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
making a knife it's extremely economic

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.340 
making a knife it's extremely economic
and<00:02:38.130> they<00:02:38.910> teamed<00:02:39.150> up<00:02:39.269> with<00:02:39.390> Spyderco<00:02:40.019> so<00:02:40.200> they

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
and they teamed up with Spyderco so they

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.590 
and they teamed up with Spyderco so they
had<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.680> really<00:02:41.310> cool<00:02:41.579> handle<00:02:42.000> that's<00:02:42.180> made

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
had this really cool handle that's made

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.410 
had this really cool handle that's made
out<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.780> Fr<00:02:43.260> end<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.769> kraton<00:02:44.220> feels<00:02:44.970> really

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
out of Fr end and kraton feels really

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.960 
out of Fr end and kraton feels really
nice<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.900> hand<00:02:46.130> really<00:02:47.130> secure<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.820> with

anywhere and to tell you the truth I'm
probably<00:02:58.530> not<00:02:58.829> going<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.070> use<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.310> knife<00:02:59.579> is

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
probably not going to use this knife is

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.060 
probably not going to use this knife is
like<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.209> know<00:03:00.390> its<00:03:01.079> intended<00:03:01.470> purpose<00:03:01.889> which

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
like you know its intended purpose which

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.280 
like you know its intended purpose which
is<00:03:02.100> like<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> combat<00:03:02.910> utility<00:03:03.090> knife<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.900> bought

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
is like a combat utility knife I bought

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.080 
is like a combat utility knife I bought
this<00:03:04.500> knife<00:03:04.680> with<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> intention

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
this knife with the intention

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.320 
this knife with the intention
of<00:03:06.379> using<00:03:07.379> it<00:03:07.500> for<00:03:07.680> utility<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:09.000> know<00:03:09.120> like

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
of using it for utility you know like

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.229 
of using it for utility you know like
maybe<00:03:09.810> an<00:03:09.959> EDC<00:03:10.230> carry<00:03:10.650> but<00:03:10.890> mainly<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.610> wanted

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
maybe an EDC carry but mainly I wanted

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.630 
maybe an EDC carry but mainly I wanted
to<00:03:12.360> put<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.930> test<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.250> kitchen

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
to put it to the test in the kitchen

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.000 
to put it to the test in the kitchen
because<00:03:15.150> it's<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.629> full<00:03:15.810> flat<00:03:16.050> grind<00:03:16.080> vg10

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
because it's a full flat grind vg10

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.850 
because it's a full flat grind vg10
blade<00:03:17.510> very<00:03:18.510> thin<00:03:18.840> grind<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:20.720> really<00:03:21.860> you're

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
blade very thin grind and really you're

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.580 
blade very thin grind and really you're
getting<00:03:23.129> about<00:03:23.310> five<00:03:23.849> inches<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.299> vg-10<00:03:25.019> for

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
getting about five inches of vg-10 for

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.280 
getting about five inches of vg-10 for
like<00:03:25.769> 85<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.580> 95<00:03:27.060> dollars<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.780> that's<00:03:28.080> a

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
like 85 to 95 dollars and that's a

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.589 
like 85 to 95 dollars and that's a
really<00:03:28.470> good<00:03:28.680> price<00:03:28.890> considering<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:30.480> know

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
really good price considering you know

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.330 
really good price considering you know
just<00:03:30.900> go<00:03:31.080> look<00:03:31.230> at<00:03:31.349> some<00:03:31.500> kitchen<00:03:31.830> knives<00:03:32.010> and

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
just go look at some kitchen knives and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.890 
just go look at some kitchen knives and
you'll<00:03:32.519> figure<00:03:32.760> out<00:03:32.879> that<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.330> is<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.510> really

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
you'll figure out that this is a really

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.729 
you'll figure out that this is a really
good<00:03:34.080> deal<00:03:34.819> with<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:35.940> blade<00:03:36.239> how<00:03:37.200> how<00:03:37.680> long

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
good deal with the blade how how long

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.670 
good deal with the blade how how long
the<00:03:38.069> blade<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:39.000> blade<00:03:39.239> material<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
the blade is the blade material the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.550 
the blade is the blade material the
ergonomics<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:42.150> now<00:03:43.019> we'll<00:03:43.170> get<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
ergonomics and now we'll get to the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.120 
ergonomics and now we'll get to the
sheath<00:03:43.769> which<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.549> like<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:45.739> alto<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:46.890> just<00:03:47.069> a

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
sheath which is like a alto it's just a

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.240 
sheath which is like a alto it's just a
polymer<00:03:47.579> thermal<00:03:48.510> plastic<00:03:48.780> sheath<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:50.010> not

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
polymer thermal plastic sheath it's not

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.850 
polymer thermal plastic sheath it's not
Kydex<00:03:50.730> but<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.090> very<00:03:51.209> similar<00:03:51.650> works<00:03:52.650> out

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
Kydex but it's very similar works out

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.440 
Kydex but it's very similar works out
really<00:03:53.099> nicely<00:03:53.400> it's<00:03:53.760> not<00:03:53.940> going<00:03:54.209> anywhere

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
really nicely it's not going anywhere

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.180 
really nicely it's not going anywhere
and<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.230> knife<00:03:55.379> didn't<00:03:55.769> come<00:03:55.920> with<00:03:56.099> the

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
and it the knife didn't come with the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.180 
and it the knife didn't come with the
slain<00:03:56.430> yurt<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.790> added<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.470> Fred<00:03:58.470> Peron<00:03:58.860> he<00:03:59.040> a

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
slain yurt I added that Fred Peron he a

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.339 
slain yurt I added that Fred Peron he a
lot<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.519> times<00:03:59.730> he'll<00:03:59.970> put<00:04:00.180> lanyards<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.140> his

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
lot of times he'll put lanyards on his

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.130 
lot of times he'll put lanyards on his
knives<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:02.010> he'll<00:04:02.250> just<00:04:02.430> use<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.790> little

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
knives and he'll just use that little

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.960 
knives and he'll just use that little
basic<00:04:04.140> greenie<00:04:04.560> night<00:04:04.829> and<00:04:05.099> it<00:04:05.370> looks<00:04:05.579> pretty

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
basic greenie night and it looks pretty

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.410
