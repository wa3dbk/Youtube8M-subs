00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.800
 Hello and welcome to the very first broadcast a year I am the 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.320
 they can hardly wait for a gallant 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.329
 the spring 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.759
 the first warmer sunbeams on the skin Dierbach at the nature juicy 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.609
 Green buds flowers 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.050
 this lightness and freshness I have captured for her and a girl 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.599
 Freck spring air created for her 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.900
 It is based on the coveted and at times absolutely trendy shades of purple 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.880
 Green and where from Rico 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.040
 This look is for every woman 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830
 and adapts to every age 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.830
 As you can easily see after bargain signs can be the same 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.149
 and she becomes so charming 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.080
 Do not be afraid of colors 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.660
 because they themselves determine their intensity 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.920
 depending on its name 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.800
 For the primer I can get a fantastic from roofs of Mac 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.550
 used 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.500
 An even skin texture is the basis for every look 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.120
 only then can the flags really be values 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.270
 the special thing about this rally is 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.840
 they can do it for face 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.210
 and use body 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.290
 It has a very natural and transparent effect on the skin 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.680
 a little z 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.850
 Dab the Meschkat with your fingertips 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.130
 also on arms and legs 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.050
 It connects better with the skin 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.400
 and of course that's giving support here 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.660
 then I have no irregularities and also in the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.540
 Shadow with the thriller Council r by Bobby Brown 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.190
 just disappear 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.450
 As a completion of the primer in Thale I use the loose powder of Bobby Brown 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.430
 continue to pull easy 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.510
 in the face 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.000
 from the center of the face to the outside 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.980
 They also go something or why close 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.560
 on the upper moving eyelid 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.980
 once low shadow bass 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.530
 so they can spread the color easier 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.380
 and he would be better too 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.909
 the canvas for the Locust of the 80 now they can with the actually ago 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.420
 of the spring sentence start the eyes 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.179
 our spring air sets a noble play of colors 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.679
 from purple and green well call center team again it looks class 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.400
 Mac I use because top-current purple gates 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.820
 Purple Haze 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.820
 and that's how it's done Decide evenings 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.489
 the hurt defended with a song had brush 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:16.469
 on the upper floors eyes 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.329
 from the inside to the outside 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.659
 work with this brush 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.450
 with the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.450
 They are given a very uniform 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.849
 the tenant dollar continues on the white Wiek 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.159
 very soft leakage 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.869
 I love that color 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.439
 because you are so beautiful with her 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.409
 Effects can achieve 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.409
 the same sign again 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.779
 continue to pull 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.159
 evenly with the brush the leases 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.469
 about the rents 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.469
 and if she gets hurt easily 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.249
 is purple 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.389
 currently an absolute must 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.299
 no matter he fake or similar area 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.790
 the SLAs are already this bright color today 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.980
 and please Hansi really not afraid of colors 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.599
 because they themselves determine their intensity 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.240
 today if they may have a bit more discreet 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.319
 and morning rather Schiller's stronger 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.489
 small accents with great impact their goal with complementary colors 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.310
 Zulehner fits very well 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.269
 modern culture and swimming of Merck 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.079
 I wear this trendy grass green with an applicator 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.819
 so they succeed in a more precise given 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.709
 I attach the Faber to the price 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.379
 lower eyelid 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.620
 then cleans the green 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.620
 also in the inner Oberon eye angle 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.929
 the program on the steering and its combination with purple 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.749
 her eyes skillfully in scene 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.429
 they have come 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:53.369
 Loads of light eyes i here 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:58.370
 even more intense rays and dark eyes get an incredible 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.019
 with her eyes 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.649
 to fall in love 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:05.269
 Of course, Chilli's door is also very much in vogue this spring 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:05.999
 can 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:09.019
 for that I use a great black mascara from Glarus 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.569
 so first move the upper lash line 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:15.609
 You're welcome 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.609
 make sure that they are from bottom to top 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.250
 and the best in April 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.499
 lead to the eye 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:26.800
 for the fresh spring air mighty the upper eyelash wreath 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.009
 emphasize particularly intense 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.169
 and of course, now it will be about damage 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.659
 I make sure that I like it 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.680
 Everyone learns evenly 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.150
 destroyed 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.800
 I just give it lightly 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.169
 Measure on the lower lash line 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.009
 the same already show in other eyes 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.009
 but I pull that slightly upwards 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.580
 Not all bodies are easier 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.729
 to reach 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.430
 Just shower them vigorously 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.670
 until you have achieved the desired result here, too 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.159
 that bursting is kept parallel to the eye 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.100
 from eyelashes approach to the tips of the showers 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.169
 for a stunning look 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.690
 Of course, the bottom row is as well 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.129
 but only very slightly 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.220
 please pay attention to it 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.800
 that's not too much 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.419
 Muscat we have to sit 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.930
 is not that a stunning look 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.280
 an intense look 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.080
 But everyone likes to look that way 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.469
 deep in the eyes 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.450
 as a perfect border of the eyes 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.430
 I still know the eyebrows in shape 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.909
 they may be missing this time 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.110
 no color used 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.570
 so giving them our spring lures a girlish ease and 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:42.770
 fresh 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.710
 while the Luxair is to be carried forward in everyday life 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.169
 Bet that or of course even if they have something special in mind 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.430
 she looked at 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.350
 The focus of the Spring Lux is clearly on the effective play of colors 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.070
 That's why I used the argument for the Latvians 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.070
 a more subtle color but no less refined 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.490
 Every Mac app as is loves this lip gloss 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.469
 the choice covers 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:07.469
 Tim FrÃ¼hling fits optimally a delicate position 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.610
 I give some gloss 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.900
 with the applicator on the last meters so i can do that 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.050
 distribute better 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.569

 Super stylish and gives her lips an incredible life lost 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.410
 I immediately reflect the spring freshness of her face 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.319

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:33.009

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.009
 this gives the look the finishing touch in an instant 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:42.759
 and here he is 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.880
 An annoying spring log with charming power 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.160
