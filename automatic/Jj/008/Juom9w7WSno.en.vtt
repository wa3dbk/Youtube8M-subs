00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.000 

as<00:00:37.329> I<00:00:37.390> remember<00:00:37.629> it<00:00:37.899> there's<00:00:38.559> a<00:00:38.649> high<00:00:38.800> Ridge

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
as I remember it there's a high Ridge

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.979 
as I remember it there's a high Ridge
over<00:00:39.190> there<00:00:39.460> just<00:00:39.820> covered<00:00:40.179> with<00:00:40.210> sage<00:00:40.780> and

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
over there just covered with sage and

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.079 
over there just covered with sage and
rabbit<00:00:41.289> brush<00:00:41.469> deer<00:00:42.250> should<00:00:42.460> be<00:00:42.609> all<00:00:42.730> over<00:00:42.760> at

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
rabbit brush deer should be all over at

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.540 
rabbit brush deer should be all over at
this<00:00:43.210> time<00:00:43.449> of<00:00:43.570> year<00:00:43.629> I<00:00:44.100> think<00:00:45.100> there's<00:00:45.460> a

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
this time of year I think there's a

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.009 
this time of year I think there's a
marsh<00:00:45.850> or<00:00:46.059> something<00:00:46.449> along<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.839> bottom

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
marsh or something along the bottom

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.649 
marsh or something along the bottom
where<00:00:47.679> they<00:00:47.769> bet<00:00:47.949> during<00:00:48.159> the<00:00:48.370> day<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:49.600> should

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
where they bet during the day we should

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.719 
where they bet during the day we should
be<00:00:49.899> able<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.170> set<00:00:50.679> those<00:00:50.800> blinds<00:00:51.159> up<00:00:51.399> so<00:00:51.519> we<00:00:51.610> can

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:51.729 
be able to set those blinds up so we can

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:52.680 
be able to set those blinds up so we can
catch<00:00:51.850> them<00:00:51.969> when<00:00:52.089> they<00:00:52.180> come<00:00:52.269> up<00:00:52.420> with<00:00:52.510> feet

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
catch them when they come up with feet

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:09.450 
catch them when they come up with feet
on<00:00:52.719> the<00:00:52.899> ridge

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:21.870 

I<00:01:19.530> don't<00:01:20.530> remember<00:01:20.680> this<00:01:20.920> wet<00:01:21.159> area<00:01:21.430> being<00:01:21.670> so

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
I don't remember this wet area being so

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.410 
I don't remember this wet area being so
big<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:23.400> don't<00:01:24.400> see<00:01:24.549> a<00:01:24.580> trail<00:01:24.909> we<00:01:25.090> may<00:01:25.210> have<00:01:25.270> to

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
big I don't see a trail we may have to

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.230 
big I don't see a trail we may have to
go<00:01:25.509> find<00:01:25.720> another<00:01:25.780> way<00:01:26.080> around<00:01:26.520> no<00:01:27.520> we're

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
think it's legal to leave the trail on

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.160 
think it's legal to leave the trail on

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
didn't know that I thought there were

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
that

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.990 
that
yeah<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:47.470> haven't<00:01:47.950> seen<00:01:48.070> it<00:01:48.280> written<00:01:48.460> down<00:01:48.580> but

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
yeah I haven't seen it written down but

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.790 
yeah I haven't seen it written down but
I'm<00:01:49.119> pretty<00:01:49.360> sure<00:01:49.660> you<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:50.320> go<00:01:50.470> anywhere<00:01:50.740> on

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
I'm pretty sure you can go anywhere on

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.850 
I'm pretty sure you can go anywhere on
state<00:01:51.160> forest<00:01:51.580> land<00:01:51.990> besides<00:01:52.990> there's<00:01:53.679> no

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
state forest land besides there's no

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.830 
state forest land besides there's no
sign<00:01:54.190> so<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.640> must<00:01:54.880> not<00:01:55.060> be<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.270> lie

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
sign so it must not be a lie

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.669 
sign so it must not be a lie
maybe<00:01:56.970> but<00:01:57.970> even<00:01:58.240> if<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.539> is<00:01:58.720> legal<00:01:58.960> we<00:01:59.470> could

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
maybe but even if it is legal we could

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.940 
maybe but even if it is legal we could
get<00:01:59.860> into<00:02:00.009> quite<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.340> mess<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:02.380> does<00:02:02.649> look<00:02:02.920> like

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
get into quite a mess it does look like

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.620 
get into quite a mess it does look like
we<00:02:03.369> can<00:02:03.490> get<00:02:03.610> around<00:02:03.880> on<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.179> high<00:02:04.390> ground

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
we can get around on this high ground

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.380 
we can get around on this high ground
around<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.050> edge<00:02:05.170> though<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:05.880> don't<00:02:06.880> know<00:02:07.090> I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
around the edge though I don't know I

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.910 
around the edge though I don't know I
think<00:02:07.899> it'd<00:02:08.140> be<00:02:08.229> better<00:02:08.380> if<00:02:08.470> we<00:02:08.590> found<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.890> way

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
think it'd be better if we found a way

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.600 
think it'd be better if we found a way
around

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
around

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.910 
around
no<00:02:09.970> you're<00:02:10.569> just<00:02:10.750> worried<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.200> old<00:02:11.500> machine

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
no you're just worried that old machine

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.890 
no you're just worried that old machine
yours<00:02:12.160> isn't<00:02:12.400> gonna<00:02:12.610> make<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.150> are<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.780> gonna

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
yours isn't gonna make it are you gonna

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.140 
yours isn't gonna make it are you gonna
let<00:02:14.079> a<00:02:14.140> little<00:02:14.410> mud<00:02:14.620> stop<00:02:14.950> us<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.760> could<00:02:15.970> take

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
let a little mud stop us it could take

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.199 
let a little mud stop us it could take
all<00:02:16.420> day<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.840> get<00:02:17.140> through<00:02:17.350> this<00:02:17.880> yeah<00:02:18.880> that's

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
all day to get through this yeah that's

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.840 
all day to get through this yeah that's
a<00:02:19.329> point<00:02:19.620> we<00:02:20.620> do<00:02:20.739> got<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.920> get<00:02:21.070> those<00:02:21.220> blinds<00:02:21.700> up

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
the problem is we'll leave a major trail

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.940 
the problem is we'll leave a major trail
if<00:02:24.700> we<00:02:24.790> go<00:02:24.940> through<00:02:25.150> here<00:02:25.530> kind<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.620> seems<00:02:26.829> a

if we go through here kind of seems a
