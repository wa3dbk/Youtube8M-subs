00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.780
 hello everyone we are at the mwc on the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.040
 stand sony introduce you the xperia are 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.820
 the brand has just announced 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.170
 so they made them 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.520
 particularities including 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.250
 improvements over aids a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.980
 alone among these sorry his screen 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.230
 which is now 5 2 inches 0.1 point 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.150
 more and who proposes an appointment of 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.460
 costs a color rendering really not 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.289
 bad at all I showed it with 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.880
 a small picture as could see 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.380
 the colors are very fast but very 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.000
 well done it's very faithful to the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.149
 reality and it's really very nice 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.219
 to watch 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.960
 so the z2 to an ip display slab 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.000
 is what means in two visions 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.129
 better I let you judge then under 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.050
 the hood of xperia z2 we will find a 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.820
 qualcomm a qualcomm processor 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.680
 snapdragon 801 clocked at 2.3 gigahertz 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.380
 so we're on a 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.580
 four hearts compared to aid to the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.860
 memory life goes from 2 gigabytes to 3 gigabytes 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.640
 battery it too is improved it 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.390
 goes to 3200 million loses anyway 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.740
 not bad for a slab of 5.2 chicks 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.030
 High stereo speakers also one passes 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.450
 with one here at the bottom and the top 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.270
 here the device is a bit finer 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.729
 terms of design and he's also a 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.790
 a little lighter it's about 70 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.490
 grams less to the device makes 7.1 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.170
 mm thick exactly the engineers 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.460
 have done a lot of work on omni design 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.710
 balance so always the same as 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.300
 you can see it but it is a small 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.420
 little narrower finally more end in 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.750
 width and it is ergonomic mans more 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.080
 succeeded in our 5 6 before moving on to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.280
 system features the camera 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.840
 20.7 megapixels for the sensor 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.670
 main for back of the device 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.140
 at the material level it's the same as the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.630
 z1 but we improved the game 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.060
 software the front camera has 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.680
 makes 2 megapixels that constitutes a 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.770
 small improvement over 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.280
 aids 1 also let's go now to 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.680
 software software features on 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.049
 strong point it's going to be obviously the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.780
 4k video capture which is brand new 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.560
 for a waterproof smartphone simply 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.570
 sony are the only ones doing that at 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.430
 no one else is doing yet 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.470
 the camera app and endowed 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.030
 of modes like for example times burst 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.590
 in clip that will allow to take some 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.780
 photos i prefer to show you for 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.160
 the moment unfortunately imagine 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.360
 someone doing acrobatics in 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.640
 do that give you an animated clip 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.590
 so that also includes a slow mode 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.060
 idle motion that allows you to take the 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.920
 video very playful but not only 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.290
 really very nice gold times imagined everything 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.970
 that combined with the 4k is a result 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.170
 almost to professionals we also 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.570
 a mode that allows flute and 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.440
 the background of a photo so the goal 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.450
 you will understand it is to add 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.040
 depth of field with focus 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.760
 that we have on the on the aids on 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.500
 reflex actually on the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.819
 the more expensive cameras it's by 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.849
 example we have a nice picture like this 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.159
 ci with a beautiful contrast between the fund 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.200
 and the foreground the back takes a 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.909
 foreground so I do not know if you 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.620
 can see the camera but my 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.140
 colleague here hidden behind a glass of 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.489
 sangria is blurred and it gives a 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.930
 result a little more professional 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.690
 in any case much more fun to 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.079
 look we're going to spend now a la 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.879
 famous four cases so I 'm going 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.650
 back in the gallery we'll see my 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.390
 colleague and his glass of sangria I could 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.510
 filming yesterday we went to the beach 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.549
 I filmed a few videos is 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.780
 will say then I will read it a little 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.250
 little for you to show you so 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.379
 you will not necessarily see the quality 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.569
 like that but what I'm going to do is 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.220
 that I'm going to actually pause and 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.849
 I'm going but that's possible 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.349
 also when the video continues and 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.970
 you will see the level of detail 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.280
 if you see in any case it's enough 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.139
 bluffing there we can see the sand all 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.430
 the details are impressive you 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.280
 show a little bit the fluidity of the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.349
 system in zoom into zooms into itself 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.510
 Strolling on the video while it 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.000
 in fact and in full reading and can 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.769
 go back to a general view and that's the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.120
 quality really makes it possible to take 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.099
 video buttes almost and 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.139
 use as is as you can 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:12.370
 imagine it if you connect this 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:15.040
 xperia z2 smartphone to a telly 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.099
 24 blow case you will have there videos in 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.079
 4k over quality so I'm going 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.210
 show you my augmented reality mode 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.410
 we had already seen with the z1 on 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.720
 pictures where he is a compact 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.729
 there we can put it also we can 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.250
 adapt it on videos actually there are 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.050
 some little dinosaurs see that's 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.810
 fun enough it's fun 1 also 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.419
 we can interact move their place in 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.430
 art move the dinosaur elements that 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.259
 alas we are on video 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.970
 well that's noisy here you hear 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.409
 probably not but there is sound 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.300
 pretty playful and nice I leave you 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.590
 appreciate 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.300
 go a little mode that I like who 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.979
 works very well with the front camera 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.400
 we will show the whole team one of 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.500
 shackles so that's okay 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.409
 analyzed the faces and we have beautiful 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.080
 briscoe hairstyles like that we'll even 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.629
 movie and the cameraman no it does not work 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.940
 sign with fear again 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.349
 it's a bit of a little gadget but with 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.610
 friends all that's nice we can 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.650
 really scary doing some 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.590
 nice enough thing i'll show you 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.250
 the app widget 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.289
 cameras photo 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.360
 then it's not just these four icons 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.650
 here to go directly to the on mode 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.949
 can simply add the 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.120
 shortcuts that we prefer to beat here 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.379
 also interesting this button 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.729
 cameras that pierced a 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.830
 physical trigger it's a button 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.449
 simply who can go for 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.979
 that's without touching the touch screen 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.840
 going active and the camera 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.849
 so these thoughts obviously for 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.259
 immersion when underwater the 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.150
 touch screens it does not work very well 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.340
 if we had a long time here we go 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.099
 activate the camera it allows to 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.210
 can use it on him but that's 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.979
 also useful in the open in 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.599
 normal use ie we 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.099
 support this a quick shortcut for 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.469
 access the camera 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.240
 ah yes so the xperia reminder z2 as 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:59.000
 its predecessors and waterproof it is 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.380
 protected against dust ip67 then 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.180
 we can change the mode 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.569
 also from here in the device 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.340
 Photo 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.479
 there are many other applications that 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.849
 are available and not able any 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.680
 obviously show you what I want 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.270
 to say is that the z2 comes in kit 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.039
 kat directly 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.000
 the storage space is that giga for 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.100
 those at 2 as usual at this name 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.650
 we at the small hatch that allows us to 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.040
 put our micro SD card up to 64 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.110
 giga to support on aa lépine connector 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.750
 to be able to recharge or connect 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.940
 just z on his station on 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.350
 its dock which makes it possible to avoid having 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.560
 to open the little typing here for 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.300
 connect the z2 to its charger here 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.630
 so I think I told you pretty much 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.470
 all about this xperia z2 i hope you 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.470
 enjoyed the video
