how<00:06:20.030> many<00:06:20.360> fibers<00:06:21.130> I'm<00:06:22.130> going<00:06:22.310> to<00:06:22.370> choose

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
how many fibers I'm going to choose

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:27.330 
how many fibers I'm going to choose
maybe<00:06:23.260> six<00:06:24.260> that's<00:06:25.100> too<00:06:25.400> many

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
maybe six that's too many

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.820 
maybe six that's too many
that's<00:06:28.340> too<00:06:28.640> many<00:06:29.290> this<00:06:30.290> count<00:06:30.590> one<00:06:30.800> two

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
that's too many this count one two

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.969 
that's too many this count one two
that's<00:06:31.250> that's<00:06:31.610> four<00:06:31.940> or<00:06:32.000> five<00:06:32.150> fibers<00:06:32.979> not

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
that's that's four or five fibers not

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.969 
that's that's four or five fibers not
much<00:06:34.280> but<00:06:34.970> this<00:06:35.270> is<00:06:35.540> really<00:06:36.380> going<00:06:36.770> to<00:06:36.860> be

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
much but this is really going to be

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.060 
much but this is really going to be
visible<00:06:37.430> and<00:06:38.419> because<00:06:39.260> I<00:06:39.290> chose<00:06:39.680> just<00:06:39.919> the

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
visible and because I chose just the

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.450 
visible and because I chose just the
right<00:06:40.250> amount<00:06:40.490> it<00:06:40.580> won't<00:06:40.760> be<00:06:40.940> too<00:06:41.330> flashy<00:06:42.460> just

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
right amount it won't be too flashy just

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.180 
right amount it won't be too flashy just
the<00:06:43.850> right<00:06:44.060> amount<00:06:44.330> of<00:06:44.390> flash<00:06:44.770> lined<00:06:45.770> this<00:06:45.950> on

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
the right amount of flash lined this on

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.830 
the right amount of flash lined this on
and<00:06:47.560> then<00:06:48.560> I'm<00:06:48.860> before<00:06:49.700> I<00:06:49.729> finish<00:06:50.240> the<00:06:50.419> head<00:06:50.630> I

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
and then I'm before I finish the head I

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.020 
and then I'm before I finish the head I
just<00:06:50.870> kind<00:06:51.320> of<00:06:51.380> hold<00:06:51.590> this<00:06:51.800> back<00:06:52.070> and<00:06:52.430> and<00:06:52.669> I'm

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
just kind of hold this back and and I'm

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.320 
just kind of hold this back and and I'm
going<00:06:53.240> to<00:06:53.300> make<00:06:53.450> this<00:06:53.660> just<00:06:54.530> about<00:06:55.090> the<00:06:56.090> length

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
going to make this just about the length

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.140 
going to make this just about the length
of<00:06:56.600> the<00:06:56.840> longest<00:06:57.200> fiber<00:06:57.740> if<00:06:58.490> I<00:06:58.669> want<00:06:58.910> to<00:06:59.000> use

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
of the longest fiber if I want to use

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:08.110 
of the longest fiber if I want to use
this<00:07:00.520> gather<00:07:01.520> it<00:07:03.220> lay<00:07:04.220> it<00:07:04.280> aside<00:07:06.820> I'm<00:07:07.820> going<00:07:07.880> to

slow<00:07:32.990> water<00:07:33.349> pockets<00:07:34.009> this<00:07:34.219> marabou<00:07:34.729> will

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:34.969 
slow water pockets this marabou will

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:39.219 
slow water pockets this marabou will
puff<00:07:35.210> out<00:07:35.449> in<00:07:35.719> swift<00:07:36.500> water<00:07:36.969> it<00:07:37.969> will<00:07:38.210> take<00:07:39.020> a

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:39.229 
puff out in swift water it will take a

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:45.490 
puff out in swift water it will take a
very<00:07:40.120> very<00:07:41.120> slim<00:07:41.810> profile<00:07:43.300> this<00:07:44.379> doesn't<00:07:45.379> look

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:45.500 
very very slim profile this doesn't look

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.610 
very very slim profile this doesn't look
like<00:07:45.560> much<00:07:45.979> flash<00:07:46.370> in<00:07:46.789> it<00:07:46.939> that<00:07:47.240> that's

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:47.620 
like much flash in it that that's

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.379 
like much flash in it that that's
approximately<00:07:48.620> four<00:07:49.280> or<00:07:49.400> fibers<00:07:49.849> of<00:07:50.060> Mirage

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:50.389 
approximately four or fibers of Mirage

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:53.350 
approximately four or fibers of Mirage
flash<00:07:50.780> abou<00:07:51.110> but<00:07:52.009> it's<00:07:52.189> very<00:07:52.520> visible<00:07:52.849> in<00:07:53.240> the
