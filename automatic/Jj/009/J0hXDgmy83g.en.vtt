in a way of that like oh you could just

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.200 
in a way of that like oh you could just
copy<00:01:46.200> anything<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:46.890> oh<00:01:47.009> no<00:01:47.310> can't<00:01:47.820> copy<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
copy anything but oh no can't copy the
