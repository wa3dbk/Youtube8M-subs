00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.639
 a channel and you want me to think that 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.080
 again a new video yes I have 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.670
 my device is somewhat restructured though 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.259
 this will be followed shortly by a video in 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.910
 I'll explain something on this soon 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.420
 channel to you and before 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.460
 all when 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.279
 For today I have only once 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 again brought a new cover and 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.800
 I will explain these to you here 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.800
 First, as always, the intro 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.500
 yes and for those you invited for that you go 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.300
 again on the mars and the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.820
 dimb a relikt iron we know 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.680
 they already know where we are going 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.180
 exactly in the same place and for that 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.070
 you drive easy from the sport 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.140
 straight through and if you are there 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.329
 arrived as you see first 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.030
 all opponents turn so league choice 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.040
 Once upon a time grows away and then 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.989
 you see this big one here in the middle 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.939
 stone blocks on the first you have to 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.270
 jump back and then does her 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:08.740
 you see this branch from here 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.659
 this tree in pretty grad already 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.150
 hardworking on the down at this asta's 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.890
 is quite right times over the 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.210
 you need to be at about this level 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.369
 bring hole and then catch on 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.350
 changeable already to the red 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.270
 shining eyes off the path when the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.130
 animals had come from this hell 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.780
 then turn around and do it right away 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.299
 the cabal broke down like on the other 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.299
 side can spawn either left or 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.520
 right front and when the place is 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.370
 Let's start from the beginning again 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.200
 high as they are right now 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.630
 even the gates are growing 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.820
 sometimes out of the cave are outside 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.250
 but usually catch it 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.920
 and yes, that's the whole thing 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.040
 repeat repeat repeat 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.380
 The pick up in Cramme falling 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.930
 between race ammo and sometime 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.630
 quite a lot around and yes the whole thing 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.159
 We rejoice and have advantages 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.350
 from this whole story is that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.479
 Not only very good 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.770
 strangely enough, the good ones hit 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.270
 Grammendorf mostly at the chambers 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.009
 I found not in the way 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.130
 and yes you have in between the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.540
 possibility of public events 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.239
 we'll start two right away 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.430
 or three even on a pile 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.050
 irregular way and yes he takes off 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.330
 and to be so without end in the box 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.540
 spawn the caves where you also the in 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.860
 Then grimma goes to collect 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.720
 However, there are own small ones 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.880
 disadvantage of the whole story and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.010
 we look now at times because 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.390
 the decisive criterion for this 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.160
 All history is you are unfortunately 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.660
 often not alone and if there 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.670
 someone with you around this 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.200
 trick does not know as you know him 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.709
 then you could have we wanted her 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.709
 See it does not happen then 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.330
 helps best only the good 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.790
 times to point out friendship 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.200
 in which you put a knife in the back 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.579
 he is out of place or he changes 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.260
 the server and do it all again 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.630
 from the front where we are alone since 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.440
 meanwhile enough possibilities where here 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.730
 no standing around 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.040
 and yes otherwise 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.299
 ludwig actually cool because we see 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.950
 a few minutes where I'm around here 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.450
 confessed to the video for you 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.040
 I already have some green ones to record 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.420
 and also found a blue one 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.980
 that really only has five to six 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.989
 A few minutes through where I am 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.269
 have tried and actually quite 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.290
 good yield for the short time and you 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.379
 Of course you can do that too in time 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.790
 again, klima boost stands for growing 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.790
 and kabbala is still worth a hit 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.530
 very good mica with it and yes I think 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.450
 The loupe is actually considered cool easy 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.079
 good to do solo what my 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.120
 advantage is 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.919
 and yes try it and write to me 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.419
 the comments what experiences with 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.609
 have made this cave and why 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.930
 place and yes otherwise as always 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.480
 I am glad for the video about it 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.040
 me very much and for you leave me an abo 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.870
 so you always know what as 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.340
 next here on a channel happens 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.329
 as soon as new is sealed off 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.709
 gets the automatic 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.389
 notification and always be as 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.919
 First there when it's something new from me 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.419
 otherwise I say bye bye 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.689
 next time and thanks for that 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.689
 look at
