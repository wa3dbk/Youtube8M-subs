couple of glasses that I've been doing
reviews<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.590> haven't<00:00:14.250> been<00:00:14.460> picking<00:00:14.730> them

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
reviews on I haven't been picking them

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.750 
reviews on I haven't been picking them
up<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.719> know<00:00:15.839> when<00:00:16.470> when<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.830> do<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.220> reviews<00:00:17.609> I

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
up you know when when I do the reviews I

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.250 
up you know when when I do the reviews I
actually<00:00:18.029> pick<00:00:18.359> up<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.539> majority<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:19.080> them

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
actually pick up the majority of them

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.349 
actually pick up the majority of them
throughout<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.340> Christmas<00:00:20.490> holidays<00:00:21.150> I

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
throughout the the Christmas holidays I

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.820 
throughout the the Christmas holidays I
just<00:00:21.810> didn't<00:00:22.020> want<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.170> kind<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.410> group<00:00:22.650> them

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
just didn't want to kind of group them

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.590 
just didn't want to kind of group them
all<00:00:22.920> together<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> figured<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.150> spread<00:00:24.449> them

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
all together so I figured I spread them

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.080 
all together so I figured I spread them
out<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.350> know<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.920> give<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> more

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
out to you know to give you a more

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.330 
out to you know to give you a more
in-depth<00:00:27.599> video<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.470> particular<00:00:28.769> pair

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
in-depth video on that particular pair

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.460 
in-depth video on that particular pair
so<00:00:29.580> obviously<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.830

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.380 
surprised that they didn't include a pin
with<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.470> particular<00:01:55.680> line<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:57.299> know

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
with this particular line you know

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.700 
with this particular line you know
they've<00:01:57.570> been<00:01:57.600> they've<00:01:58.170> been<00:01:58.229> doing<00:01:58.560> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
they've been they've been doing that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.410 
they've been they've been doing that
with<00:01:58.860> some<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> newer<00:01:59.490> styles<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
with some of the newer styles like the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.109 
with some of the newer styles like the
Jupiter<00:02:00.659> camo<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.159> infinite<00:02:02.579> hero<00:02:02.820> I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
Jupiter camo and the infinite hero I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.319 
Jupiter camo and the infinite hero I
thought<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.049> would<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.320> been<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.469> perfect

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
thought this would have been a perfect

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.080 
thought this would have been a perfect
line<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.750> actually<00:02:07.049> include<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.380> pin<00:02:08.250> with<00:02:08.459> just

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
line to actually include a pin with just

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.699 
line to actually include a pin with just
because<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> could<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.869> picture<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.229> maybe

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
because I could just picture like maybe

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.220 
because I could just picture like maybe
the<00:02:11.370> Olympic<00:02:11.790> symbol<00:02:12.030> or<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> American

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
the Olympic symbol or like the American

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.860 
the Olympic symbol or like the American
flag

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
flag

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.210 
flag
I<00:02:13.900> thought<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.260> then<00:02:14.349> maybe<00:02:14.560> making<00:02:14.950> one<00:02:15.190> of

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
I thought and then maybe making one of

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.619 
I thought and then maybe making one of
these<00:02:15.400> like<00:02:15.640> an<00:02:15.760> icon<00:02:16.209> or<00:02:16.360> something<00:02:16.569> like

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
these like an icon or something like

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:17.729 
these like an icon or something like
that<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.840> thought<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.349> would<00:02:17.470> have<00:02:17.620> been

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
that I thought that would have been

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.979 
that I thought that would have been
really<00:02:17.799> really<00:02:18.340> cool<00:02:18.610> idea<00:02:18.730> but<00:02:19.090> again<00:02:19.780> that's

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
really really cool idea but again that's

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.440 
really really cool idea but again that's
just<00:02:20.140> my<00:02:20.260> two<00:02:20.319> cents<00:02:20.680> on<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:21.010> one<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:21.390> let<00:02:22.390> me

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450

know<00:03:10.720> if<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.840> guys<00:03:10.959> can<00:03:11.019> make<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.319> out<00:03:11.560> but<00:03:11.590> let

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
know if you guys can make it out but let

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.589 
know if you guys can make it out but let
me<00:03:12.250> see<00:03:12.400> if<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.489> can<00:03:12.640> focus<00:03:12.819> this<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.180> little<00:03:13.390> bit

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
me see if I can focus this a little bit

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.809 
me see if I can focus this a little bit
so<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.810> guys<00:03:13.959> can<00:03:14.140> see<00:03:14.370> there's<00:03:15.370> actually<00:03:15.790> uh

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
so you guys can see there's actually uh

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.020 
so you guys can see there's actually uh
different<00:03:16.599> countries<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:18.099> know<00:03:18.130> in<00:03:18.489> between

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
different countries you know in between

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.789 
different countries you know in between
here<00:03:19.359> like<00:03:19.569> where<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.780> see<00:03:19.900> my<00:03:20.019> finger<00:03:20.349> at<00:03:20.500> and

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
here like where you see my finger at and

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.190 
here like where you see my finger at and
then<00:03:21.310> they<00:03:21.760> spaced<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.389> so<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.049> actually

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
then they spaced it so it actually

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.280 
then they spaced it so it actually
spells<00:03:23.829> out<00:03:24.130> USA<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.209> spacing<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:26.200> know

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
spells out USA in the spacing you know

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.870 
spells out USA in the spacing you know
so<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.829> thought<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.130> was<00:03:27.280> really<00:03:27.579> really

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
so that I thought that was really really

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.360 
so that I thought that was really really
cool<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:29.049> know<00:03:29.470> there's<00:03:29.739> here's<00:03:29.980> uh<00:03:30.040> some

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
cool you know there's here's uh some

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.089 
cool you know there's here's uh some
more<00:03:30.730> stuff<00:03:30.970> on<00:03:31.120> there<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.540> then<00:03:32.230> on<00:03:32.650> the

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
more stuff on there and then on the

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.220 
more stuff on there and then on the
other<00:03:33.129> side<00:03:33.579> as<00:03:33.760> well<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:34.540> know<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.780> they<00:03:34.930> you

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
other side as well you know and they you

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.470 
other side as well you know and they you
know<00:03:35.260> just<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.370> s<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.819> a<00:03:36.879> so<00:03:37.030> I

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
know just you the s and the a so I

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.180 
know just you the s and the a so I
thought<00:03:37.840> was<00:03:37.959> really<00:03:38.200> really<00:03:38.500> nice<00:03:38.680> now<00:03:38.919> also

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
thought was really really nice now also

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.180 
thought was really really nice now also
on<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.790> lens<00:03:39.970> itself<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:41.169> have<00:03:41.319> team<00:03:41.680> USA

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
on the lens itself you have team USA

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.530 
on the lens itself you have team USA
etched<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:42.760> there<00:03:42.940> I<00:03:42.970> don't<00:03:43.120> know<00:03:43.299> if<00:03:43.359> you<00:03:43.419> guys

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
etched in there I don't know if you guys

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.360 
etched in there I don't know if you guys
can<00:03:43.750> see<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:44.109> yeah<00:03:44.290> there<00:03:44.410> we<00:03:44.530> go<00:03:44.560> team<00:03:44.919> USA

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
can see that yeah there we go team USA

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.729 
can see that yeah there we go team USA
so<00:03:45.430> that's<00:03:46.299> really<00:03:46.449> cool<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:46.989> believe<00:03:47.620> the

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
so that's really cool I believe the

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.819 
so that's really cool I believe the
majority<00:03:47.859> of<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.930> glasses<00:03:50.379> in<00:03:50.500> this<00:03:50.620> line

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
majority of the the glasses in this line

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.530 
majority of the the glasses in this line
have<00:03:51.069> that<00:03:51.250> etching<00:03:51.549> on<00:03:51.699> the<00:03:51.730> more<00:03:52.030> all<00:03:52.150> of

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
have that etching on the more all of

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.759 
have that etching on the more all of
them<00:03:52.660> should<00:03:52.780> have<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.079> etching<00:03:53.349> on<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.590> so

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
them should have that etching on it so

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.009 
them should have that etching on it so
really<00:03:54.489> really<00:03:54.669> nice<00:03:54.940> obviously<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.900> guys

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
really really nice obviously you guys

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.539 
really really nice obviously you guys
have<00:03:56.199> seen<00:03:56.349> what<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.709> fuel<00:03:56.919> cell<00:03:57.099> looks<00:03:57.370> like

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
have seen what the fuel cell looks like

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.819 
have seen what the fuel cell looks like
and<00:03:58.090> what<00:03:58.299> not<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:59.019> thought<00:03:59.500> this<00:03:59.620> was<00:03:59.769> a

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
and what not but I thought this was a

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.670 
and what not but I thought this was a
really<00:04:00.190> really<00:04:00.459> cool<00:04:00.750> piece<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:02.049> DA<00:04:02.349> it

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
really really cool piece a DA it

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.240 
really really cool piece a DA it
definitely<00:04:03.660> it's<00:04:04.660> different<00:04:05.139> you<00:04:05.319> know<00:04:05.440> just

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
definitely it's different you know just

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.770 
definitely it's different you know just
like<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.579> way<00:04:06.699> that<00:04:06.879> they<00:04:07.030> did<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.449> different

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
like the way that they did the different

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.030 
like the way that they did the different
coloring<00:04:08.199> and<00:04:08.319> stuff<00:04:08.500> like<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:09.010> know

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
coloring and stuff like that you know

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.039 
coloring and stuff like that you know
you<00:04:09.190> got<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.430> dark<00:04:09.669> gray<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.840> lighter

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
you got the dark gray and the lighter

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.990 
you got the dark gray and the lighter
kind<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:11.379> sober<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:12.040> red<00:04:12.190> white<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.400> blue<00:04:12.669> so

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
kind of sober the red white and blue so

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.909 
kind of sober the red white and blue so
it<00:04:13.030> all<00:04:13.269> fits<00:04:13.299> in<00:04:13.810> together<00:04:14.169> really<00:04:14.590> nicely

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
it all fits in together really nicely

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.189 
it all fits in together really nicely
like<00:04:15.519> I<00:04:15.609> said<00:04:15.669> it<00:04:15.910> out<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.030> all<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.539> different

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
like I said it out of all the different

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.860 
like I said it out of all the different
styles<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:17.709> is<00:04:17.919> of<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.549> team<00:04:19.060> USA<00:04:19.209> line<00:04:19.660> this

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
styles this is of the team USA line this

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.500 
styles this is of the team USA line this
is<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.109> one<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.410> I<00:04:20.470> kind<00:04:20.769> of<00:04:20.849> felt<00:04:21.849> that<00:04:22.300> they

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
is the one that I kind of felt that they

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.380 
is the one that I kind of felt that they
put<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.620> most<00:04:23.890> thought<00:04:24.460> into<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:24.849> as<00:04:25.030> far<00:04:25.210> as

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
put the most thought into it as far as

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.010 
put the most thought into it as far as
like<00:04:25.539> not<00:04:25.780> just<00:04:25.990> making<00:04:26.080> it

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
like not just making it

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.839 
like not just making it
you<00:04:27.139> know<00:04:27.259> like<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.979> jawbone<00:04:28.370> is<00:04:28.430> really<00:04:28.669> cool

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
you know like the jawbone is really cool

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.460 
you know like the jawbone is really cool
but<00:04:29.120> it's<00:04:29.270> just<00:04:29.419> like<00:04:29.539> you<00:04:30.110> know<00:04:30.199> it's<00:04:30.379> like

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
but it's just like you know it's like

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.350 
but it's just like you know it's like
one<00:04:30.740> color<00:04:30.919> frame<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.699> then<00:04:31.789> they<00:04:31.970> just<00:04:32.000> added

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
one color frame and then they just added

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.089 
one color frame and then they just added
a<00:04:32.599> little<00:04:32.750> bit<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:32.990> red<00:04:33.259> and<00:04:33.470> white<00:04:33.680> on<00:04:33.860> and

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
a little bit of red and white on and

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.520 
a little bit of red and white on and
stuff<00:04:34.370> like<00:04:34.460> that<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:35.599> the<00:04:35.990> radars<00:04:36.349> are

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
stuff like that the the radars are

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.990 
stuff like that the the radars are
pretty<00:04:36.740> cool<00:04:36.949> one<00:04:37.190> of<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.370> colorways<00:04:37.759> on<00:04:37.909> the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
pretty cool one of the colorways on the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.909 
pretty cool one of the colorways on the
radar<00:04:38.150> is<00:04:38.300> really<00:04:38.750> nice<00:04:38.900> but<00:04:39.259> I<00:04:39.530> don't<00:04:39.830> really

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
radar is really nice but I don't really

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.290 
radar is really nice but I don't really
like<00:04:40.039> the<00:04:40.190> way<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.400> radar<00:04:40.669> spit<00:04:40.879> on<00:04:41.000> me<00:04:41.150> so

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
like the way the radar spit on me so

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.640 
like the way the radar spit on me so
that's<00:04:41.509> why<00:04:41.629> I<00:04:41.659> went<00:04:41.780> with<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:41.990> fuel<00:04:42.199> show<00:04:42.379> so

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
that's why I went with the fuel show so

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.010 
that's why I went with the fuel show so
again<00:04:43.490> here<00:04:43.819> is<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.120> glasses<00:04:44.900> themselves

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
again here is the glasses themselves

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.129 
again here is the glasses themselves
with<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.650> micro<00:04:45.979> bag<00:04:46.360> here's<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.479> box<00:04:47.690> and

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
with the micro bag here's the box and

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.589 
with the micro bag here's the box and
then<00:04:48.919> here's<00:04:49.220> that<00:04:49.400> card<00:04:49.759> that<00:04:50.000> comes<00:04:50.240> with<00:04:50.479> it

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
then here's that card that comes with it

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.990 
then here's that card that comes with it
again<00:04:51.440> I<00:04:51.590> thought<00:04:52.280> they<00:04:52.400> should<00:04:52.430> have<00:04:52.669> added<00:04:52.940> a

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
again I thought they should have added a

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.850 
again I thought they should have added a
pin<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.240> go<00:04:53.539> with<00:04:53.720> this<00:04:53.840> I<00:04:54.050> definitely<00:04:54.620> would

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
pin to go with this I definitely would

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.290 
pin to go with this I definitely would
think<00:04:55.099> it<00:04:55.220> would<00:04:55.310> have<00:04:55.400> been<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.550> really<00:04:55.909> nice

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
think it would have been a really nice

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.680 
think it would have been a really nice
addition<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:56.870> this<00:04:56.990> whole<00:04:57.229> package<00:04:58.129> here<00:04:58.490> and

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
addition to this whole package here and

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.550 
addition to this whole package here and
definitely<00:04:59.690> something<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.139> would<00:05:00.349> see<00:05:00.530> a
