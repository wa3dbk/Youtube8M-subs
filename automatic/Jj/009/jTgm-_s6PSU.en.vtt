00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.870
 some know what the repercussion of 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.430
 melting polar ice caps 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.500
 nowadays a lot is being talked about 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.419
 of climate change but I think that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.910
 we are not yet aware of what is 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.980
 We are coming upon us to begin 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.520
 all those people who live in the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.200
 coasts that live near the coasts do not 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.150
 they will be able to maintain their place of 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.010
 residence because because it's going to be 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.530
 flooded 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.450
 doing the precise calculations I have 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.610
 come to the conclusion well no 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.130
 only me but all the scientists 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.290
 that defend that you do not have to contaminate 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.420
 and that you have to try to reduce the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.160
 hole in the ozone layer because I've 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.970
 come to the conclusion that the level 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.150
 from sea 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.150
 would rise around 60 or 90 meters 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.100
 there are currently about 38 million 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.290
 cubic kilometers of ice in the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.360
 planet earth in the event that it is 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.330
 xiel in because the density is more 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.290
 low and would increase say the level of 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.650
 those of the ocean would be about 33 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.680
 millions of cubic kilometers of water 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.380
 more than we would have to add to the 360 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.080
 million cubic kilometers yes 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.270
 we add all this we have to do 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.710
 the precise calculations and other we have 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.840
 that the water level would rise 60 meters 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.780
 60 meters this would mean that great 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.490
 part of the coast would be flooded by 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.190
 example I live in Spain in the area of 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.410
 madrid here would not reach me but the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.710
 area where I vacation that is in alicante 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.649
 on the coast all that area would be devastated 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.509
 by the sea of course you also have to 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.000
 take into account the large amount of 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.160
 species that inhabit the north pole in 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.050
 the polar ice caps and they're going to 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.240
 disappear 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.640
 the temperature the temperature of 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.790
 planet is going to change is very unlikely 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.010
 that there are deserts after this almost 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.220
 all areas will be habitable on 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.440
 climate will be less dangerous 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.140
 of the usual in that sense favors 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.810
 but let's not forget that many species 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.720
 are going to be extinguished and that millions of 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.570
 square kilometers will disappear 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.870
 of the planet earth places overflowing with 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.060
 life coasts full of tourism cities 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.190
 that have emerged on these coasts that are going 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.370
 to be sunk as the city of the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.680
 atlantic 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.470
 if we do not take care of it in a matter of about 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.390
 few years we will see how the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.790
 residences that have some people 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.690
 on the beach they are burying themselves through 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.940
 of the water of the oceans 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.800
 luckily the volume of ice in 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.100
 comparison with the total volume of the sea 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.930
 it's only 6 or 7 percent what 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.210
 which will imply the disappearance of 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.830
 some species but only from 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.830
 some, the safest thing is that I do not know 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.840
 alter the natural cycle of the earth what 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.690
 that is going to cause is that a 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.460
 person who has to want to spend his 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.790
 vacation on the beach then directly 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.340
 will no longer have that place on the coast its 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.710
 country will be greatly reduced over 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.410
 all areas of america america the 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.410
 South North America where I live in 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.010
 Spain will eat much of that of the 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.260
 coast and good is worrying is not 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.170
 worrying and you can still put 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.690
 remedy we have to take care more the medium 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.120
 environment and prevent the hole from the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.120
 ozone layer continue to spread
