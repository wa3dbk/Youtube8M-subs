called<00:02:05.570> x10<00:02:06.050> made<00:02:06.380> by<00:02:06.560> side<00:02:06.860> vation<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:07.640> this

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
called x10 made by side vation so this

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.719 
called x10 made by side vation so this
is<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.149> new<00:02:08.330> formula<00:02:08.899> this<00:02:09.560> tastes<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.550> shit

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
is the new formula this tastes like shit

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.390 
is the new formula this tastes like shit
is<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.690> saltiest<00:02:12.200> shit<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:13.100> might<00:02:13.250> as<00:02:13.370> well

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
is the saltiest shit you might as well

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.700 
is the saltiest shit you might as well
be<00:02:13.640> drinking<00:02:13.970> seawater<00:02:14.210> okay<00:02:14.900> ocean<00:02:15.470> water

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
230 milligrams of sodium so you know I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.790 
230 milligrams of sodium so you know I
don't<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.600> this<00:02:23.780> shit<00:02:24.020> no<00:02:24.200> more<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.440> like<00:02:24.650> the

don't like this shit no more I like the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.230 
don't like this shit no more I like the
original<00:02:25.280> formula<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.820> they<00:02:25.910> use<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.090> have

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
original formula that they use to have

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.210 
original formula that they use to have
like<00:02:26.480> years<00:02:26.900> ago<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.650> didn't<00:02:27.860> have<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.010> lot<00:02:28.190> of

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
like years ago it didn't have a lot of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.210 
like years ago it didn't have a lot of
sodium<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.910> get<00:02:29.510> any<00:02:29.840> sodium<00:02:30.320> at<00:02:30.680> all<00:02:30.830> okay

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
sodium and get any sodium at all okay

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.100 
sodium and get any sodium at all okay

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
that's when I used to like least and

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.640 
that's when I used to like least and
back<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.270> those<00:03:08.360> days<00:03:08.540> when<00:03:08.870> little<00:03:09.350> gliders

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
back in those days when little gliders

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.830 
back in those days when little gliders
look<00:03:09.800> like<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:10.280> that's<00:03:11.090> when<00:03:11.270> I<00:03:11.300> used<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.630> pup

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
look like that that's when I used to pup

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.420 
look like that that's when I used to pup
would<00:03:11.959> extend<00:03:12.290> but<00:03:12.590> for<00:03:12.740> right<00:03:12.830> now<00:03:12.890> I<00:03:13.100> hide

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
would extend but for right now I hide

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.490 
would extend but for right now I hide
down<00:03:13.610> too<00:03:14.030> much<00:03:14.180> sodium<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:15.140> that's<00:03:15.320> one<00:03:15.470> the

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
down too much sodium so that's one the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.020 
down too much sodium so that's one the
main<00:03:15.800> thing<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.160> was<00:03:16.250> looking<00:03:16.340> for<00:03:16.760> was<00:03:16.940> to

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
main thing I was looking for was to

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.850 
main thing I was looking for was to
suddenly<00:03:17.420> man<00:03:17.570> that<00:03:18.200> was<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.350> branch<00:03:18.650> chain

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
suddenly man that was a branch chain

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.470 
suddenly man that was a branch chain
amino<00:03:18.890> acid<00:03:19.520> everything<00:03:19.790> didn't<00:03:20.000> have<00:03:20.150> any

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
amino acid everything didn't have any

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.840 
amino acid everything didn't have any
sodium<00:03:21.080> in<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.260> but<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:22.010> guys<00:03:22.160> can<00:03:22.459> see<00:03:22.640> right

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
sodium in it but you guys can see right

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.479 
sodium in it but you guys can see right
here<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:23.570> can<00:03:24.530> kind<00:03:24.709> of<00:03:24.770> read<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.100> label<00:03:25.400> a

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
here you can kind of read the label a

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.240 
here you can kind of read the label a
little<00:03:25.760> bit<00:03:25.940> if<00:03:26.180> my<00:03:26.420> camera<00:03:26.750> will<00:03:26.900> focus<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:28.160> I

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
little bit if my camera will focus so I

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.240 
little bit if my camera will focus so I
got<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.489> little<00:03:28.760> bit<00:03:28.850> of<00:03:28.970> everything<00:03:29.239> okay<00:03:29.840> so

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
got a little bit of everything okay so

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.800 
got a little bit of everything okay so
with<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.370> main<00:03:31.550> ingredient<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.239> has<00:03:32.420> is

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
with the main ingredient that it has is

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.009 
with the main ingredient that it has is
on<00:03:33.070> l-leucine<00:03:34.070> so<00:03:34.700> l-leucine<00:03:35.360> is<00:03:35.540> supposed<00:03:35.900> to

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
on l-leucine so l-leucine is supposed to

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.490 
on l-leucine so l-leucine is supposed to
be<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.970> prank<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.269> branched-chain<00:03:38.600> amino<00:03:38.780> acid

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
be a prank the branched-chain amino acid

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.949 
be a prank the branched-chain amino acid
that's<00:03:39.650> responsible<00:03:40.340> for<00:03:40.519> life<00:03:40.959> increasing

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
that's responsible for life increasing

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.020 
that's responsible for life increasing
on<00:03:42.140> protein<00:03:42.590> synthesis<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.610> don't<00:03:43.910> know

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
on protein synthesis so I don't know

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.759 
on protein synthesis so I don't know
about<00:03:44.120> all<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.390> but<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:44.959> do<00:03:45.080> like<00:03:45.560> this

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
about all that but I do like this

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.580 
about all that but I do like this

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
product this is the fruit punch flavor

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.800 
product this is the fruit punch flavor
so<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.310> went<00:03:49.610> together<00:03:49.970> real<00:03:50.480> well

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
so it went together real well

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.410 
so it went together real well

intra<00:04:07.459> workout<00:04:07.489> while<00:04:08.000> I'm<00:04:08.120> working<00:04:08.420> out

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
intra workout while I'm working out

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.720 
intra workout while I'm working out
between<00:04:09.079> each<00:04:09.470> one<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.769> my<00:04:09.860> sets<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.250> have<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.459> few

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
between each one of my sets I have a few

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.220 
between each one of my sets I have a few
sips<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.329> and<00:04:11.630> then<00:04:11.750> I'll<00:04:11.900> just<00:04:12.019> go<00:04:12.170> ahead

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
sips of it and then I'll just go ahead

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.470 
sips of it and then I'll just go ahead
and<00:04:12.470> keep<00:04:12.590> going<00:04:12.829> so<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.700> may<00:04:13.880> be<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:14.060> placebo

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
and keep going so it may be a placebo

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.120 
and keep going so it may be a placebo
effect<00:04:14.660> but<00:04:15.019> I<00:04:15.140> definitely<00:04:15.680> noticed<00:04:16.040> the
