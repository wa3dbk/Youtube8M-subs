places I'm Dan Johnson talking with Mark
Kettering<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.100> found<00:00:20.369> an<00:00:20.520> engine<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.850> we

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
Kettering and we found an engine that we

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.359 
Kettering and we found an engine that we
don't<00:00:21.270> know<00:00:21.390> enough<00:00:21.660> about<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.500> mark<00:00:22.800> what<00:00:23.250> is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
don't know enough about so mark what is

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.130 
don't know enough about so mark what is
it<00:00:23.519> we've<00:00:23.670> got<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.119> where<00:00:24.330> does<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.660> engine

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
it we've got here where does this engine

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.390 
it we've got here where does this engine
come<00:00:26.039> from<00:00:26.340> well<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.119> Suzuki<00:00:27.720> G<00:00:28.349> 13<00:00:28.859> BB

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
come from well it's a Suzuki G 13 BB

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.580 
come from well it's a Suzuki G 13 BB
then<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.210> buy<00:00:30.359> brand<00:00:30.750> new<00:00:30.869> truck<00:00:31.380> from<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
then we buy brand new truck from the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.970 
then we buy brand new truck from the
factory<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.399> those<00:00:33.239> as<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.600> promises<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.559> okay

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
here and our own mount system and we do

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.639 
here and our own mount system and we do

mode<00:00:49.950> which<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.370> very<00:00:50.579> notorious<00:00:51.570> problem

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
mode which is very notorious problem

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.689 
mode which is very notorious problem
with<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> lot<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> auto<00:00:53.129> conversion<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
with a lot of the auto conversion I

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.950 
with a lot of the auto conversion I
don't<00:00:53.879> know<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.270> means<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.809> that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
don't know what that means what is that

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.770 
don't know what that means what is that
mean<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.199> word<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:56.399> happens<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.390> auto

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
mean that word what happens is that auto

engines<00:00:58.320> when<00:00:58.620> they<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> fault

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
engines when they have a fault

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.209 
engines when they have a fault
like<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.789> overheats<00:01:00.449> they<00:01:01.079> reduce<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.920> power

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
like the overheats they reduce the power

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.539 
like the overheats they reduce the power
usually<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.270> about<00:01:03.510> 2,000<00:01:04.229> rpms<00:01:04.710> well<00:01:05.460> if

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
usually to about 2,000 rpms well if

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.620 
usually to about 2,000 rpms well if
you're<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.790> takeoff

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
you're on takeoff

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.179 
you're on takeoff
you<00:01:07.080> don't<00:01:07.229> would<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> good<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
you don't would not be a good so not a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.370 
you don't would not be a good so not a
good<00:01:08.520> thing<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.030> yank<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.780> part<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.229> or

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
good thing so you yank that part out or

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.410 
good thing so you yank that part out or
what<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:11.280> reprogram<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
what do you do we reprogram it so it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.030 
what do you do we reprogram it so it
does<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> said<00:01:13.560> electronic

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
does not have that you said electronic

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.399 
does not have that you said electronic
control<00:01:14.340> unit<00:01:14.700> yes<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.110> where<00:01:16.320> you

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
control unit yes and so that's where you

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.380 
control unit yes and so that's where you
do<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.710> adjustment<00:01:17.100> yes<00:01:17.460> okay<00:01:17.850> continue<00:01:18.240> on

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
do that adjustment yes okay continue on

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.249 
do that adjustment yes okay continue on
the<00:01:19.020> ECU<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.560> Bosch<00:01:20.009> they<00:01:20.970> claim<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> 20,000

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the ECU is Bosch they claim a 20,000

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.070 
the ECU is Bosch they claim a 20,000
hour<00:01:22.380> mean<00:01:22.830> time<00:01:23.070> between<00:01:23.100> failure<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.450> it's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
hour mean time between failure so it's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.280 
hour mean time between failure so it's
single<00:01:25.409> ignition<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.360> with<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.750> electronic

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
single ignition but with the electronic

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
single ignition but with the electronic
control<00:01:28.320> system<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.400> still<00:01:29.729> has<00:01:29.909> less<00:01:30.240> chance

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
control system it still has less chance

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.560 
control system it still has less chance
of<00:01:30.780> failing<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.409> any<00:01:32.250> given<00:01:32.640> half<00:01:32.820> hour<00:01:33.030> period

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
of failing in any given half hour period

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.210 
of failing in any given half hour period
than<00:01:33.720> both<00:01:33.960> Magneto's<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> same<00:01:35.189> time

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
than both Magneto's at the same time

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.890 
than both Magneto's at the same time
Wow<00:01:36.370> okay<00:01:36.880> that's<00:01:36.910> an<00:01:37.270> interesting<00:01:37.360> statement

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
Wow okay that's an interesting statement

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.140 
Wow okay that's an interesting statement
because<00:01:38.380> we're<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:38.800> used<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.250> in<00:01:39.760> aviation

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
because we're so used to in aviation

electronic control unit side of our
aspect<00:01:46.870> of<00:01:46.990> things<00:01:47.110> is<00:01:47.320> changing<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:47.830> game

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
aspect of things is changing that game

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.650 
aspect of things is changing that game
again<00:01:48.400> absolutely

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
again absolutely

again absolutely
the<00:01:49.990> legacy<00:01:50.560> Magneto's<00:01:51.190> are<00:01:51.340> fantastic<00:01:52.150> item

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
the legacy Magneto's are fantastic item

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.810 
the legacy Magneto's are fantastic item
the<00:01:53.200> most<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.950> certified<00:01:54.370> people<00:01:54.760> are

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
the most of the certified people are

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.810 
the most of the certified people are
replacing<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.450> today<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:57.070> redundancy<00:01:57.700> was

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
replacing it today the redundancy was

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.640 
replacing it today the redundancy was
necessary<00:01:58.360> back<00:01:58.660> then<00:01:58.990> or<00:01:59.200> would<00:01:59.380> used

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
necessary back then or would used

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.470 
necessary back then or would used
mechanical<00:01:59.920> magneto<00:02:00.760> you<00:02:01.090> had<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.360> have

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
mechanical magneto you had to have

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.940 
mechanical magneto you had to have
redundancy<00:02:01.750> because<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.380> thing<00:02:02.530> was<00:02:02.710> going

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
redundancy because the thing was going

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.220 
redundancy because the thing was going
to<00:02:03.010> fail<00:02:03.220> yes<00:02:03.550> one<00:02:03.790> of<00:02:03.940> them<00:02:04.030> yeah<00:02:04.420> every<00:02:04.720> 600

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
to fail yes one of them yeah every 600

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.180 
to fail yes one of them yeah every 600
hours<00:02:05.500> since<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.830> mean<00:02:05.950> time<00:02:06.160> between

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
hours since the mean time between

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.480 
hours since the mean time between
failure<00:02:06.880> route<00:02:07.090> so<00:02:07.630> 600<00:02:08.470> hours<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.800> 20,000

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
failure route so 600 hours to 20,000

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.040 
failure route so 600 hours to 20,000
hours<00:02:09.580> correct<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.300> comparison<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:10.869> you're

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
hours correct the comparison that you're

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.560 
hours correct the comparison that you're
making<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.500> okay<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:12.370> let's<00:02:12.820> go<00:02:13.030> give<00:02:13.300> us<00:02:13.420> some

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.260 
horsepower per hour i what does that
translate<00:05:28.830> to<00:05:29.070> a<00:05:29.220> gallon<00:05:29.670> per<00:05:29.700> hour<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:30.210> a

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
translate to a gallon per hour that a

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.330 
translate to a gallon per hour that a
pilot<00:05:30.510> can<00:05:30.780> appreciate<00:05:30.960> about<00:05:31.740> four<00:05:32.190> and<00:05:32.280> a

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
pilot can appreciate about four and a

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.090 
pilot can appreciate about four and a
half<00:05:32.400> gallons<00:05:32.940> an<00:05:33.060> hour<00:05:33.180> get<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:34.380> normal<00:05:34.920> high

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
half gallons an hour get the normal high

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.830 
half gallons an hour get the normal high
cruise<00:05:35.460> you're<00:05:36.000> pretty<00:05:36.240> competitive<00:05:36.510> the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
cruise you're pretty competitive the

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.680 
cruise you're pretty competitive the
gallon<00:05:37.800> per<00:05:37.920> hour<00:05:38.040> basis<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.880> trike<00:05:39.150> Pat<00:05:39.450> I

gallon per hour basis the trike Pat I

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.480 
gallon per hour basis the trike Pat I
grew<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:40.170> high<00:05:40.440> overall<00:05:40.740> so<00:05:40.980> the<00:05:41.250> trike

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
grew that high overall so the trike

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.790 
grew that high overall so the trike
people<00:05:41.940> usually<00:05:42.420> run<00:05:42.600> about<00:05:42.630> two<00:05:43.080> two<00:05:43.380> and<00:05:43.410> a

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
people usually run about two two and a

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.640 
people usually run about two two and a
half<00:05:43.980> gallons<00:05:44.370> an<00:05:44.520> hour<00:05:44.610> oh<00:05:44.940> really<00:05:45.390> okay<00:05:45.780> well

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
half gallons an hour oh really okay well

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.350 
half gallons an hour oh really okay well
the<00:05:46.770> lighter<00:05:46.980> vehicle<00:05:47.460> so<00:05:47.640> there<00:05:47.820> can<00:05:48.000> back

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
the lighter vehicle so there can back

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.090 
the lighter vehicle so there can back
off<00:05:48.390> and<00:05:48.840> at<00:05:48.930> that<00:05:49.110> point<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.710> engine<00:05:49.980> will

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
off and at that point the engine will

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.710 
off and at that point the engine will
probably<00:05:50.580> last<00:05:50.790> a<00:05:50.970> little<00:05:51.120> longer<00:05:51.240> to<00:05:51.510> I'm

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
probably last a little longer to I'm

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.180 
probably last a little longer to I'm
guessing<00:05:52.110> I<00:05:52.230> would<00:05:52.530> guess<00:05:52.710> if<00:05:52.920> you're<00:05:53.070> not

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
guessing I would guess if you're not

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.490 
guessing I would guess if you're not
pushing<00:05:53.400> it<00:05:53.580> quite<00:05:53.790> so<00:05:53.940> hard<00:05:54.120> so<00:05:54.900> what<00:05:55.260> kind<00:05:55.440> of

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
pushing it quite so hard so what kind of

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.130 
pushing it quite so hard so what kind of
RPM<00:05:55.620> do<00:05:56.040> you<00:05:56.100> get<00:05:56.280> all<00:05:56.580> out<00:05:56.850> on<00:05:57.030> this<00:05:57.150> thing<00:05:57.360> the

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
RPM do you get all out on this thing the

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.840 
RPM do you get all out on this thing the
rated<00:05:59.130> horsepower<00:05:59.550> rpm<00:06:00.090> is<00:06:01.160> 5,800<00:06:02.160> rpm<00:06:02.610> and

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
rated horsepower rpm is 5,800 rpm and

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.410 
rated horsepower rpm is 5,800 rpm and
the<00:06:03.540> propeller<00:06:04.170> is<00:06:04.350> turning<00:06:04.830> 24<00:06:05.700> fifty<00:06:06.210> at

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
the propeller is turning 24 fifty at

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.310 
the propeller is turning 24 fifty at
that<00:06:06.630> rpm

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
that rpm

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.170 
that rpm
okay<00:06:07.650> so<00:06:07.920> again<00:06:08.100> you're<00:06:08.430> similar<00:06:08.850> numbers

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
okay so again you're similar numbers

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.120 
okay so again you're similar numbers
there's<00:06:09.780> a<00:06:09.810> lot<00:06:09.900> of<00:06:10.050> pilots<00:06:10.200> to<00:06:10.470> fly<00:06:10.650> like<00:06:10.920> oh

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
there's a lot of pilots to fly like oh

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.950 
there's a lot of pilots to fly like oh
man<00:06:11.280> Continental<00:06:11.910> Navy<00:06:11.940> jabiru<00:06:12.720> and<00:06:12.840> some

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
other brands that are just used to

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.020 
other brands that are just used to
numbers<00:06:15.660> in<00:06:15.810> the<00:06:15.930> high<00:06:16.080> mm<00:06:16.830> low<00:06:16.950> 3000<00:06:17.670> range

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
numbers in the high mm low 3000 range

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.730 
numbers in the high mm low 3000 range
Rotax<00:06:18.690> has<00:06:18.840> pretty<00:06:19.020> much<00:06:19.110> changed<00:06:19.230> the

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
Rotax has pretty much changed the

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.890 
Rotax has pretty much changed the
equation<00:06:19.950> on<00:06:20.340> that<00:06:20.520> yes

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
equation on that yes

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.510 
equation on that yes
and<00:06:21.050> higher<00:06:21.260> number<00:06:21.650> but<00:06:21.890> helping<00:06:22.280> proves

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
and higher number but helping proves

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.580 
and higher number but helping proves
itself<00:06:22.790> in<00:06:22.970> and<00:06:23.090> out<00:06:23.150> in<00:06:23.300> a<00:06:23.420> marine<00:06:24.170> world<00:06:24.380> I'm

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
itself in and out in a marine world I'm

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.690 
itself in and out in a marine world I'm
guessing<00:06:24.890> it<00:06:25.010> probably<00:06:25.040> could<00:06:25.430> do<00:06:25.520> pretty

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
guessing it probably could do pretty

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.370 
guessing it probably could do pretty
well<00:06:25.790> in<00:06:25.910> aviation<00:06:26.330> yes

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
well in aviation yes
