even<00:01:17.170> as<00:01:17.319> a<00:01:17.350> trailer<00:01:18.039> hitch<00:01:18.429> is<00:01:18.609> black<00:01:18.880> just

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
mole this is one of my favourite molds

from<00:01:24.340> reveal<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.909> shield<00:01:25.119> slash<00:01:25.539> generations

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
from reveal the shield slash generations

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.399 
from reveal the shield slash generations
now<00:01:26.859> when<00:01:27.009> you<00:01:27.100> compare<00:01:27.310> him<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.729> prime<00:01:28.359> you<00:01:29.079> do

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
now when you compare him to prime you do

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.800 
now when you compare him to prime you do
see<00:01:29.829> that<00:01:30.039> there<00:01:30.189> is<00:01:30.219> some<00:01:30.759> more<00:01:31.030> detail<00:01:31.600> in

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
see that there is some more detail in

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.080 
see that there is some more detail in
Prime<00:01:32.229> but<00:01:32.710> I<00:01:32.740> actually<00:01:32.950> think<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.520> repaint

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
Prime but I actually think the repaint

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.599 
Prime but I actually think the repaint
here<00:01:34.329> of<00:01:34.450> scourge<00:01:34.780> or<00:01:34.960> black<00:01:35.200> convoy<00:01:35.679> is<00:01:35.920> just

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
here of scourge or black convoy is just

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.209 
here of scourge or black convoy is just
a<00:01:36.759> better<00:01:37.270> overall<00:01:37.899> looking<00:01:38.530> figure<00:01:38.829> in

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
a better overall looking figure in

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.270 
a better overall looking figure in
vehicle<00:01:39.670> mode<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:40.329> just<00:01:40.389> works<00:01:41.319> better<00:01:41.740> for<00:01:41.950> me

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
vehicle mode it just works better for me

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.069 
vehicle mode it just works better for me
now<00:01:42.819> that's<00:01:43.030> not<00:01:43.209> saying<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.659> this<00:01:43.810> guy<00:01:44.020> is

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
now that's not saying that this guy is

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.649 
now that's not saying that this guy is
bad<00:01:44.679> or<00:01:44.950> anything<00:01:45.069> I<00:01:45.549> just<00:01:45.579> tend<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.329> like<00:01:46.509> the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
bad or anything I just tend to like the

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.440 
bad or anything I just tend to like the
black<00:01:46.959> a<00:01:46.990> lot<00:01:47.530> more<00:01:47.859> the<00:01:48.579> transformation<00:01:49.270> into

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
black a lot more the transformation into

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.679 
black a lot more the transformation into
robot<00:01:49.929> mode<00:01:50.139> is<00:01:50.369> identical<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.399> primes<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:52.569> to

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
robot mode is identical to primes so to

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.510 
robot mode is identical to primes so to
start<00:01:52.929> off<00:01:53.049> with<00:01:53.289> we<00:01:53.469> will<00:01:53.679> open<00:01:54.039> up<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.189> legs

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
start off with we will open up the legs

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.469 
start off with we will open up the legs
and<00:01:54.789> pull<00:01:55.149> out<00:01:55.359> the<00:01:55.600> hitch<00:01:57.119> which<00:01:58.119> will<00:01:58.149> become

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
and pull out the hitch which will become

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.399 
and pull out the hitch which will become
the<00:01:58.659> sword<00:01:59.369> then<00:02:00.369> we<00:02:00.759> come<00:02:01.060> up<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.990> front

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
the sword then we come up to the front

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.889 
the sword then we come up to the front
here<00:02:02.529> and<00:02:03.009> just<00:02:03.279> kind<00:02:03.459> of<00:02:03.490> lift<00:02:03.700> up<00:02:04.029> these<00:02:04.270> gas

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
here and just kind of lift up these gas

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.949 
here and just kind of lift up these gas
tanks<00:02:05.319> to<00:02:05.499> reveal<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.310> arms<00:02:06.789> I<00:02:07.029> like<00:02:07.689> to<00:02:07.779> come

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
tanks to reveal the arms I like to come

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.820 
tanks to reveal the arms I like to come
in<00:02:08.080> here<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.520> unpack<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:10.030> doors<00:02:10.840> from<00:02:11.560> the

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
in here and unpack the doors from the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.949 
in here and unpack the doors from the
rest<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.610> body<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.120> then<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:13.810> will

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
rest of the body and then that will

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.900 
rest of the body and then that will
allow<00:02:14.230> us<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:15.000> unpack<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.750> arms<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.640> pull<00:02:18.640> out

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
allow us to unpack the arms and pull out

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.540 
allow us to unpack the arms and pull out
the<00:02:19.209> shoulders<00:02:19.660> when<00:02:20.620> we<00:02:20.740> do<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.070> we<00:02:21.280> want<00:02:21.430> to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.700 
the shoulders when we do that we want to
reach<00:02:21.700> in<00:02:21.910> here<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> side<00:02:22.660> windows<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.140> we

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
reach in here to the side windows and we

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.130 
reach in here to the side windows and we
can<00:02:23.980> push<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.460> side<00:02:24.640> window

in<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:26.130> little<00:02:26.520> bit<00:02:26.790> right<00:02:27.660> now<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.560> then<00:02:28.980> we

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
in a little bit right now and then we

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.610 
in a little bit right now and then we
that<00:02:29.430> will<00:02:29.580> actually<00:02:29.760> push<00:02:30.300> up<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.900> section

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
that will actually push up the section

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.070 
that will actually push up the section
that<00:02:31.740> will<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.130> head<00:02:32.370> from<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.390> top<00:02:33.780> of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
that will be the head from the top of

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.740 
that will be the head from the top of
the<00:02:34.320> vehicle<00:02:34.590> mode<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.460> then<00:02:36.030> once<00:02:36.240> we<00:02:36.420> reveal

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
the vehicle mode and then once we reveal

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.830 
the vehicle mode and then once we reveal
the<00:02:36.900> head<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:37.320> could<00:02:37.440> fold<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.890> windows<00:02:38.250> up

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
the head we could fold the windows up

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.030 
the head we could fold the windows up
easier<00:02:40.550> then<00:02:41.550> we<00:02:41.730> take<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.000> whole<00:02:42.180> camp<00:02:42.570> cab

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
easier then we take the whole camp cab

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.380 
easier then we take the whole camp cab
section<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:45.020> bring<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.230> forward<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:48.240> where

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
section and bring that forward to where

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.860 
section and bring that forward to where
the<00:02:48.540> arms<00:02:48.840> are<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.290> slide<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:50.100> down<00:02:50.780> then<00:02:51.780> we

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
the arms are and slide that down then we

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.810 
the arms are and slide that down then we
take<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.260> back<00:02:52.590> section<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.340> continue<00:02:53.730> to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
take the back section and continue to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.020 
take the back section and continue to
fold<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.209> up<00:02:54.330> while<00:02:54.570> folding<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.250> these<00:02:56.250> gas

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
fold it up while folding in these gas

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.670 
icons that kind of end up ends up with
then<00:03:02.880> we<00:03:02.940> just<00:03:03.090> position<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.570> arms<00:03:04.080> as<00:03:04.290> we

tires will actually rotate forward to a

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.470 
tires will actually rotate forward to a
certain<00:03:31.470> point<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.100> then<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.850> can<00:03:33.030> slide

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
certain point and then you can slide

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.460 
certain point and then you can slide
them<00:03:33.870> in<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.190> leg<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.930> just<00:03:37.260> kind<00:03:37.440> of
