can<00:00:49.350> actually<00:00:49.440> put<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> file<00:00:50.579> make<00:00:50.789> it

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
can actually put that in a file make it

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.080 
can actually put that in a file make it
easier<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> see<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.020> let<00:00:52.260> me<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.800> PWD<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
easier to see so let me do PWD which is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.200 
easier to see so let me do PWD which is
the<00:00:54.680> gives<00:00:55.680> me<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.280> path<00:00:56.579> run<00:00:56.879> Matt's<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the gives me the path run Matt's I

again you look at use the man command to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.870 
again you look at use the man command to
see<00:03:13.110> all<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.560> possibilities<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:16.580> we<00:03:17.580> can<00:03:17.730> try

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
see all the possibilities and we can try

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.610 
see all the possibilities and we can try
things<00:03:18.180> like<00:03:18.420> for<00:03:18.570> instance<00:03:18.630> cow<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.380> then

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
things like for instance cow and then

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.880 
things like for instance cow and then
let's<00:03:19.800> look<00:03:19.980> at<00:03:20.160> December<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:21.000> this<00:03:21.420> year<00:03:21.720> or
