00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:42.479
 Today I can help you with your answer. 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.090
 'm dumb says cruto mother imagines the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.579
 time you leave with the first faustão 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.740
 The thing I was going to ask him to do was 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.950
 people eating a barbecue made in 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.950
 barbecue remote control say 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.969
 there is a game where you have to put a 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.090
 finger is a finger on the bottom that 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.069
 The old is the game, the flame is called bunga. 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.560
 bunga I think that's how he talks 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.319
 was done exactly for this to put the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.599
 finger there you played it on those 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.920
 machines and had even 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:23.189
 Butt shape for you to put your hand on 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.040
 play the fire the famous pula pirate pula 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.560
 pirate olap natura pirate a pity that 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.069
 This is the boy who's talking. 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.530
 Egg your control in the game that hand there 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.329
 with the finger pointing there for rest you already 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.599
 Do you know what you have to do, do not you? 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.879
 The goal is rock when I already showed it to you. 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.370
 there are many simulators 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.609
 strangers like those simulator 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.609
 stone him or else the shit simulator 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.579
 What the fuck is that partner that hand 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.620
 only drink is another of these simulators without 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.829
 notion your goal in the game is 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.269
 simply drinking a soda is just 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.090
 This is what you have to do in the game. 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.099
 gameplay is it's exciting 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.680
 You walk out in the middle of nowhere and 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.139
 he took his soda instead 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.049
 best game in the world would be cooler if 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.739
 Have you had an orange juice , father? 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.750
 he's such a family guy 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.329
 cool, you walk out and there's a guy. 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.790
 some things floating on the scene until 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:27.419
 now I do not understand, but that's not it 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.540
 has anything better than drinking soda in 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:32.849
 not sure you should already 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.129
 I played the car games, right? 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.790
 but I doubt they've played the 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:41.519
 game where you are a bear drives a car 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.879
 driving the car because the logic 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.189
 Viru bia 200 is a game where 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:50.099
 You do that, imagine you walking in the 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:53.340
 street and out of nowhere passes a bear driving a 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.919
 car and now even the top would be 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.009
 a horse driving a car imagine 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:01.889
 girl please make a game of it 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:04.769
 That's a success and puts me in credits 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.989
 because this idea of ​​course had great 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.319
 the worse thing is that only now that I realized that 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:13.680
 he controls everything using only one hand or the 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.689
 paw and if it's fuck it's whether or not they're the 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.250
 video game use is even 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.699
 since we 're talking about animals 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.760
 driving what by the way is already retarded 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:26.220
 has a running game of animals and has 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.390
 little horse have mpb 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.350
 a people are wearing a hat 11 idea 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:37.020
 mvezo race is a very funny game 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.480
 Yes, it's really until the couple approved of this. 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.390
 bagasse and besides funny is well 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.430
 Strange if it was strange, it was not in the 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.710
 video is because the weirdest games 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.110
 the cool world, the cool is that you do not 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.110
 Do you know where you 're going? 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.510
 occurs the rest that damages only by the menu 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.870
 you already feel the pressure of the 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.780
 dementia a little background song 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.430
 poisoned us the bug there is 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.280
 wagging ghia 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.050
 but the best is the start of the race if 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.050
 League is nothing to declare 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.599
 japan port 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.880
 We're already sorry, I do not know how to say that. 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.160
 Even more stupid than Japan 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.830
 Kurt's mood 3 I do not know the name 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.759
 sorry new disco is another game of 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.530
 running and dj and very but very queer 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.620
 By the time I saw this game I almost 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.849
 I was so upset I did not 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.990
 I do not have words 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.990
 looks just looking gameplay feels a book I 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.990
 feel 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.860
 There's a horse running in p &amp; d swinging. 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.820
 the arms 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.980
 another guy on top of a standing horse 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.440
 Kneeling kneeling, I do not know what to say. 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.290
 another wooden horse or whatever 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.050
 This is such fucking vehemence that I 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.540
 I do not know if I'm serious, I did not. 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.590
 I can analyze this rich thing in the 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.630
 kills in the dressing room only has france in fashion and 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.910
 marcelo perro is so much a silly game that 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.010
 I'm sure I'll do another part. 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.380
 So if you liked this video here and 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.480
 which is a continuation of x I liked it 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.330
 beauty click I did not like that the more 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.030
 you have more help, it's more of a kind of you 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.310
 but it helps but I know you want it 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.520
 too much complaint for one guy 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.520
 went
