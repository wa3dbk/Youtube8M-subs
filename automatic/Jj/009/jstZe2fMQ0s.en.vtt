00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
chances we weren't denied and that was a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.690 
chances we weren't denied and that was a
big<00:01:09.570> part<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.130> gotta<00:01:11.310> play<00:01:11.460> really

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
and I can visually so I regretted

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.870 
and I can visually so I regretted
anything<00:01:15.140> just<00:01:15.800> trying<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.280> pick<00:01:16.580> it<00:01:16.730> up

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
anything just trying to pick it up

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.930 
anything just trying to pick it up
defensively<00:01:17.860> get<00:01:18.860> out<00:01:19.010> and<00:01:19.310> get<00:01:19.430> those<00:01:19.610> tools

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
defensively get out and get those tools

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.840 
defensively get out and get those tools
and<00:01:20.620> getting<00:01:21.620> those<00:01:21.740> deflections<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.610> things

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
and getting those deflections and things

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.140 
and getting those deflections and things
like<00:01:23.000> that<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:23.480> I<00:01:24.080> think<00:01:24.560> that's<00:01:24.710> really<00:01:25.150> what

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
like that so I think that's really what

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.110 
like that so I think that's really what
kind<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.690> sparked<00:01:27.230> me<00:01:27.550> just<00:01:28.550> out<00:01:28.790> there

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
kind of sparked me just out there

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.840 
kind of sparked me just out there
defensively<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.830> that's<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.430> think<00:01:31.490> that's

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
defensively and that's I think that's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.180 
defensively and that's I think that's
what<00:01:32.000> helped<00:01:32.180> helped<00:01:32.720> us<00:01:33.040> well<00:01:34.040> we're
