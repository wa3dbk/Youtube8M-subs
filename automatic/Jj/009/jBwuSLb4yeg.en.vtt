00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
pretty much everything my evolved

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.740 
pretty much everything my evolved
monstrosity<00:00:40.350> goes<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.219> they<00:00:41.969> shoot<00:00:42.329> down<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
monstrosity goes in they shoot down the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.410 
monstrosity goes in they shoot down the
core<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.260> about<00:00:43.620> ten<00:00:44.160> percent<00:00:44.460> twelve<00:00:45.090> percent

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
core to about ten percent twelve percent

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.540 
core to about ten percent twelve percent
thirteen<00:00:45.899> percent<00:00:46.320> health<00:00:46.649> from<00:00:47.190> where<00:00:47.430> it

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
thirteen percent health from where it

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.330 
thirteen percent health from where it
was<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.079> really<00:00:49.289> all<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.190> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
was that so you you really all of this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.240 
was that so you you really all of this
is<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> 20<00:00:51.570> or<00:00:51.719> 30<00:00:51.989> second<00:00:52.440> cooldown<00:00:52.620> so

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
is on like a 20 or 30 second cooldown so

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.540 
is on like a 20 or 30 second cooldown so
it's<00:00:53.550> getting<00:00:54.030> nerfed<00:00:54.270> pretty<00:00:54.480> soon

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
it's getting nerfed pretty soon

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.709 
it's getting nerfed pretty soon
developers<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.730> said<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.510> just

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
developers have said that but you just

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.319 
developers have said that but you just
do<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.590> soon<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:59.399> everything's<00:00:59.850> back<00:01:00.120> on

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
do this as soon as everything's back on

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.950 
do this as soon as everything's back on
cooldown<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.160> core<00:01:02.879> cannot<00:01:03.449> handle

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
cooldown and the the core cannot handle

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.490 
cooldown and the the core cannot handle
much<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.840> basic<00:01:07.229> strat
