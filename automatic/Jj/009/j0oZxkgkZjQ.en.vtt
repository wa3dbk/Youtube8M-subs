heritage f150 4-wheel Drive now there's
two<00:00:29.400> bolts<00:00:29.670> under<00:00:30.060> there<00:00:30.240> which<00:00:30.570> I'll<00:00:30.720> show

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
two bolts under there which I'll show

you on the second if depend on the
tighten<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.980> loosen<00:00:35.010> um<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.420> raise<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
tighten or loosen um you can raise and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.350 
tighten or loosen um you can raise and
lower<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.730> front<00:00:39.000> end<00:00:39.920> now<00:00:41.120> of<00:00:42.120> course

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
lower the front end now of course

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.779 
lower the front end now of course
there's<00:00:43.230> limitations<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:44.040> how<00:00:44.280> high<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.550> can

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
there's limitations on how high you can

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.970 
there's limitations on how high you can
go<00:00:44.870> because<00:00:45.870> it'll<00:00:46.140> start<00:00:46.320> stressing<00:00:46.739> out

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
go because it'll start stressing out

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.619 
go because it'll start stressing out
parts<00:00:47.460> real<00:00:47.670> bad<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.120> front<00:00:48.360> end<00:00:48.480> like

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
parts real bad on the front end like

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.470 
parts real bad on the front end like
ball<00:00:48.899> joints<00:00:49.440> tire<00:00:49.680> rods<00:00:50.030> etc<00:00:51.030> stuff<00:00:51.300> like

ball joints tire rods etc stuff like

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:01.549 
ball joints tire rods etc stuff like
that<00:00:52.430> now<00:00:55.489> people<00:00:56.489> say<00:00:58.070> only<00:00:59.070> go<00:00:59.690> about<00:01:00.690> 24

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
that now people say only go about 24

inches<00:01:02.329> if<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.629> remember<00:01:04.110> right<00:01:05.900> from<00:01:08.540> this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
inches if I remember right from this

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.920 
inches if I remember right from this
center<00:01:10.110> cap<00:01:10.500> right<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.580> believe<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.540> may<00:01:12.869> be

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
center cap right here I believe I may be

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.640 
center cap right here I believe I may be
wrong<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:13.979> pretty<00:01:14.369> sure<00:01:15.229> you<00:01:16.229> measure<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
wrong but I'm pretty sure you measure it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.200 
wrong but I'm pretty sure you measure it
from<00:01:17.060> here

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
from here

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.530 
from here
all<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.860> way<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.850> inner<00:01:21.090> fender<00:01:21.509> well

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
all the way up to this inner fender well

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
all the way up to this inner fender well
up<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:24.080> now<00:01:25.080> let<00:01:25.710> me<00:01:25.830> show<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.790> torsion

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
up here now let me show you the torsion

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.120 
up here now let me show you the torsion
bars<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.780> where<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.259> torsion<00:01:28.650> keys<00:01:28.860> are

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
bars and where the torsion keys are

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:38.289 
bars and where the torsion keys are
those<00:01:29.729> bolts<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.600> talking<00:01:30.930> about<00:01:35.720> now

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
those bolts I was talking about now

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.260 
those bolts I was talking about now
these<00:01:39.920> right<00:01:40.920> here<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> torsion<00:01:42.060> bars

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
these right here or the torsion bars

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.480 
these right here or the torsion bars
that<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:43.530> attach<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.280> lower

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that you see they attach the lower

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.630 
that you see they attach the lower
control<00:01:44.909> arm<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:48.080> raise<00:01:49.080> them<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.490> is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
control arm and raise them like this is

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.310 
control arm and raise them like this is
how<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.690> tighten<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
how or it's like if you tighten the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.280 
how or it's like if you tighten the
torsion<00:01:52.710> key<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.130> pushes<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.640> bar<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.330> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
torsion key it pushes this bar and it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.719 
torsion key it pushes this bar and it
you<00:01:56.070> know<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.340> kind<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.600> rotates<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:58.289> way<00:01:58.729> you

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
you know it kind of rotates this way you

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.990 
you know it kind of rotates this way you
know<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.030> kind<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.240> does<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.720> number<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
know it kind of does that number so you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.609 
know it kind of does that number so you
know<00:02:03.060> ought<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> general<00:02:03.930> idea<00:02:04.020> when

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
know ought to get the general idea when

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.240 
know ought to get the general idea when
I'm<00:02:04.759> talking<00:02:05.759> about

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
I'm talking about

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.160 
I'm talking about
and<00:02:08.690> of<00:02:09.690> course

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
and of course

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.960 
and of course
well<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.890> wouldn't<00:02:12.530> suggest<00:02:13.819> lowering<00:02:14.819> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
well I wouldn't suggest lowering the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.240 
well I wouldn't suggest lowering the
front-end<00:02:15.480> from<00:02:15.810> stock<00:02:16.170> don't<00:02:16.860> know<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.069> y'all

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
front-end from stock don't know if y'all

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.690 
front-end from stock don't know if y'all
can<00:02:17.400> see<00:02:17.610> real<00:02:17.819> good<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.900> bump<00:02:19.440> stops<00:02:19.830> right

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
can see real good the bump stops right

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.680 
can see real good the bump stops right
here<00:02:21.680> y'all<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.860> see<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:25.220> art<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.580> mean<00:02:27.030> my

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
here y'all can see that art I mean my

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.039 
here y'all can see that art I mean my
crank<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.470> mine<00:02:28.650> up<00:02:28.890> maybe<00:02:29.340> an<00:02:30.269> inch<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.840> as

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
crank the mine up maybe an inch and as

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.680 
crank the mine up maybe an inch and as
you<00:02:31.200> see<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:32.970> much<00:02:33.150> room<00:02:33.450> in

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
you see really not that much room in

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.830 
you see really not that much room in
between<00:02:33.780> there<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:35.610> would<00:02:35.880> suggest<00:02:36.150> luring

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
between there so I would suggest luring

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.559 
between there so I would suggest luring
them<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:38.190> can<00:02:38.400> if<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:38.610> want<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.209> wouldn't

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
them you can if you want but I wouldn't

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.570 
them you can if you want but I wouldn't
I<00:02:39.810> guess<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.650> did<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.160> could<00:02:41.310> take<00:02:41.430> that

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
I guess if you did you could take that

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.460 
I guess if you did you could take that
little<00:02:41.790> bump<00:02:42.000> stopping<00:02:42.570> out<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> little<00:02:43.200> bolt

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
little bump stopping out a little bolt

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.830 
little bump stopping out a little bolt
down<00:02:43.650> there<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.820> on<00:02:44.970> anyway<00:02:46.640> here<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
down there but on anyway here to the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.020 
down there but on anyway here to the
torsion<00:02:49.260> keys<00:02:52.130> now<00:02:53.720> if<00:02:54.720> y'all<00:02:54.959> can<00:02:55.079> see<00:02:55.230> that

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
torsion keys now if y'all can see that

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.240 
torsion keys now if y'all can see that
those<00:02:57.030> are<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.989> torsion<00:02:58.410> keys<00:02:59.600> and<00:03:01.250> here's

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
those are the torsion keys and here's

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.880

stock Heights you know try to remember
how<00:03:23.250> many<00:03:23.310> turns<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.510> turn<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.440> with<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
how many turns you turn that with the

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.740 
how many turns you turn that with the
ratchet<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.640> if<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.850> ever<00:03:26.970> one<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.450> go<00:03:27.570> back

for it but most people don't recommend

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.440 
for it but most people don't recommend
them<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:59.230> what<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.260> was<00:04:00.470> just<00:04:00.800> doing<00:04:01.220> if<00:04:01.490> anyone

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
them and what I was just doing if anyone

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.100 
them and what I was just doing if anyone
does<00:04:02.720> do<00:04:03.080> this<00:04:03.580> after<00:04:04.580> you<00:04:04.760> do<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.000> drive<00:04:05.990> it

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
does do this after you do it drive it

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.870 
does do this after you do it drive it
around<00:04:06.200> pump<00:04:06.740> your<00:04:06.920> brakes<00:04:07.190> several<00:04:07.640> times

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
around pump your brakes several times

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.850 
around pump your brakes several times
where<00:04:08.300> you<00:04:08.420> start<00:04:08.690> driving<00:04:09.140> set<00:04:09.470> up<00:04:09.590> brake

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
where you start driving set up brake

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.660 
where you start driving set up brake
fluid<00:04:10.280> will<00:04:10.910> get<00:04:11.060> through<00:04:11.240> the<00:04:11.360> lines<00:04:11.600> and

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
fluid will get through the lines and

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.100 
fluid will get through the lines and
I'll<00:04:13.670> suggest<00:04:13.820> right<00:04:14.270> after<00:04:14.510> you<00:04:14.600> do<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.900> get

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
I'll suggest right after you do it get

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.130 
I'll suggest right after you do it get
your<00:04:15.380> front<00:04:15.830> in<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.130> lines<00:04:16.370> because<00:04:16.730> on

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
your front in the lines because on

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.600 
your front in the lines because on
independent<00:04:18.140> front<00:04:18.560> suspension<00:04:18.650> if<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.370> lift

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
independent front suspension if you lift

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.870 
independent front suspension if you lift
it<00:04:19.730> up<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.090> tires<00:04:20.360> kind<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:21.430> tires<00:04:22.430> kind<00:04:22.790> of

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
it up the tires kind of tires kind of

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.350 
it up the tires kind of tires kind of
pull<00:04:23.450> in<00:04:23.750> like<00:04:24.500> that

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
pull in like that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.850 
pull in like that
so<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.390> just<00:04:26.660> suggest<00:04:27.170> getting<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.470> front<00:04:27.740> end

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
so I just suggest getting the front end

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.740 
so I just suggest getting the front end
aligned<00:04:28.130> now<00:04:29.260> when<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.290> did<00:04:30.620> do<00:04:30.860> this<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:32.600> my

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
aligned now when I did do this to my

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.360 
aligned now when I did do this to my
truck<00:04:33.140> I<00:04:33.670> noticed<00:04:34.670> it<00:04:34.910> Road<00:04:35.470> not<00:04:36.470> too<00:04:36.830> bad<00:04:37.100> it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
truck I noticed it Road not too bad it

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.230 
truck I noticed it Road not too bad it
Road<00:04:37.580> just<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.970> little<00:04:38.450> bit<00:04:38.600> stiffer<00:04:40.000> but<00:04:41.000> I

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
Road just a little bit stiffer but I

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.880 
Road just a little bit stiffer but I
like<00:04:41.540> it<00:04:41.720> better<00:04:41.930> going<00:04:42.350> around<00:04:42.530> corners

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
like it better going around corners

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.130 
like it better going around corners
doesn't<00:04:43.550> lean<00:04:43.850> as<00:04:44.090> much<00:04:44.330> it's<00:04:44.660> kind<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:44.870> lays

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
doesn't lean as much it's kind of lays

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.410 
doesn't lean as much it's kind of lays
into<00:04:45.410> it<00:04:45.770> I<00:04:45.950> like<00:04:46.700> that<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:46.910> lot

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
into it I like that a lot

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.690 
into it I like that a lot
and<00:04:48.260> I<00:04:50.500> from<00:04:51.500> what<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:51.680> measured<00:04:52.190> if<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.400> remember

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
and I from what I measured if I remember

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.200 
and I from what I measured if I remember
right<00:04:52.850> I<00:04:53.120> measured<00:04:53.960> I<00:04:54.700> looked<00:04:55.700> in<00:04:55.820> mind<00:04:56.030> the

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
right I measured I looked in mind the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.690 
right I measured I looked in mind the
inch<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:56.840> half<00:04:56.870> in<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:58.760> front<00:04:59.500> and<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:01.490> put<00:05:01.520> a

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
inch and a half in the front and I put a

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.630 
inch and a half in the front and I put a
one<00:05:01.910> inch<00:05:02.120> block<00:05:02.540> in<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:02.990> rear<00:05:03.250> one<00:05:04.250> reason<00:05:04.610> I

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
one inch block in the rear one reason I

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.340 
one inch block in the rear one reason I
did<00:05:04.850> that<00:05:04.880> because<00:05:05.150> these<00:05:05.330> tires<00:05:05.660> would<00:05:05.960> scrub

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
did that because these tires would scrub

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.210 
did that because these tires would scrub
a<00:05:06.500> little<00:05:06.710> bit

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
a little bit

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.900 
a little bit
these<00:05:08.030> are<00:05:08.240> 33<00:05:08.990> 1250<00:05:09.710> much<00:05:10.280> rains<00:05:10.640> and<00:05:10.820> they

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
these are 33 1250 much rains and they

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.780 
these are 33 1250 much rains and they
would<00:05:11.030> scrub<00:05:12.190> bottom<00:05:13.190> of<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.370> bumper<00:05:13.760> right

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
would scrub bottom of the bumper right

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.490 
would scrub bottom of the bumper right
here<00:05:14.210> I've<00:05:14.450> heard<00:05:14.690> of<00:05:14.810> other<00:05:14.930> people<00:05:15.260> putting

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
here I've heard of other people putting

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.370
