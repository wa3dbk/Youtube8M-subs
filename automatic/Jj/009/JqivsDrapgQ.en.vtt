this picture is cinema mode but the

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.820 
this picture is cinema mode but the

you<00:05:27.509> don't<00:05:27.810> actually<00:05:28.050> notice<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:29.250> shutter

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
you don't actually notice the shutter

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.329 
you don't actually notice the shutter
speed<00:05:29.939> that<00:05:30.300> too<00:05:30.569> much<00:05:30.839> and<00:05:31.469> it<00:05:31.830> works<00:05:32.069> really

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:32.339 
speed that too much and it works really

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.390 
speed that too much and it works really
well<00:05:32.490> even<00:05:32.849> converting<00:05:33.539> for<00:05:33.750> 2d<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.349> 3d<00:05:34.400> that

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
well even converting for 2d to 3d that

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.800 
well even converting for 2d to 3d that
actually<00:05:35.909> looks<00:05:36.120> quite<00:05:36.300> nice<00:05:37.699> and<00:05:38.699> also<00:05:38.939> if

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
actually looks quite nice and also if

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.679 
actually looks quite nice and also if
you've<00:05:40.020> got<00:05:40.199> a<00:05:40.710> Bluetooth<00:05:41.610> on<00:05:41.969> smartphone

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:42.689 
you've got a Bluetooth on smartphone

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.709 
you've got a Bluetooth on smartphone
which<00:05:42.899> you<00:05:43.050> probably<00:05:43.349> would<00:05:43.560> do<00:05:43.800> you<00:05:44.430> can<00:05:44.719> hook

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:45.719 
which you probably would do you can hook

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:47.990 
which you probably would do you can hook
it<00:05:45.899> up<00:05:45.930> to<00:05:46.349> the<00:05:46.439> sound<00:05:46.680> bar<00:05:46.919> alone<00:05:47.219> so<00:05:47.939> if

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
it up to the sound bar alone so if

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.429 
it up to the sound bar alone so if
you've<00:05:48.089> got<00:05:48.210> you<00:05:48.360> mates<00:05:48.569> over<00:05:48.810> having<00:05:49.199> a<00:05:49.259> few

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:49.439 
you've got you mates over having a few

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:52.519 
you've got you mates over having a few
beers<00:05:49.469> you<00:05:49.949> want<00:05:50.099> to<00:05:50.159> play<00:05:50.310> some<00:05:51.529> whoever

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529 
beers you want to play some whoever

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.999 
beers you want to play some whoever
whoever<00:05:53.029> nwa<00:05:54.029> maybe<00:05:54.419> you<00:05:55.169> can<00:05:55.379> hook<00:05:55.589> it<00:05:55.740> up<00:05:55.860> to

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
whoever nwa maybe you can hook it up to

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.189 
whoever nwa maybe you can hook it up to
the<00:05:56.099> Bluetooth<00:05:56.520> on<00:05:56.789> the<00:05:56.909> sound<00:05:57.180> bar<00:05:57.419> and<00:05:57.779> it

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
the Bluetooth on the sound bar and it

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.679 
the Bluetooth on the sound bar and it
would<00:05:58.289> work<00:05:58.469> from<00:05:58.770> there<00:05:59.300> I'll<00:06:00.300> just<00:06:00.539> hook

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:00.689 
would work from there I'll just hook

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:25.010 
would work from there I'll just hook
this<00:06:00.870> up<00:06:00.930> again<00:06:01.589> in<00:06:01.680> fashion

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.680 

so<00:06:26.730> with<00:06:27.730> the<00:06:27.850> subwoofer

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
so with the subwoofer

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.040 
so with the subwoofer
it<00:06:28.750> doesn't<00:06:29.200> sound<00:06:30.000> overly<00:06:31.000> bassy<00:06:31.420> like

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
it doesn't sound overly bassy like

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.740 
it doesn't sound overly bassy like
you're<00:06:32.260> playing<00:06:32.500> some<00:06:33.250> sort<00:06:33.550> of<00:06:33.700> major<00:06:36.750> ghetto

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
you're playing some sort of major ghetto

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.230 
you're playing some sort of major ghetto
blaster<00:06:38.470> or<00:06:38.860> something<00:06:39.400> and<00:06:39.730> it<00:06:40.060> doesn't

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
blaster or something and it doesn't

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.690 
blaster or something and it doesn't
sound<00:06:40.600> tinny<00:06:41.230> especially<00:06:42.040> considering<00:06:42.610> he's

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
sound tinny especially considering he's

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.920 
sound tinny especially considering he's
got<00:06:42.880> a<00:06:42.910> subwoofer<00:06:43.300> in<00:06:43.900> bill<00:06:44.350> to<00:06:44.620> it<00:06:45.300> if<00:06:46.300> you<00:06:46.750> can

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
got a subwoofer in bill to it if you can

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.450 
got a subwoofer in bill to it if you can
find<00:06:47.170> it<00:06:47.410> it's<00:06:47.680> well<00:06:47.950> worth<00:06:48.130> buying

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
find it it's well worth buying

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.110 
find it it's well worth buying
especially<00:06:49.060> alongside<00:06:49.270> this<00:06:49.660> TV<00:06:50.670> this<00:06:51.670> is<00:06:51.730> the

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
especially alongside this TV this is the

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.530 
especially alongside this TV this is the
48<00:06:52.570> inch<00:06:52.930> and<00:06:53.260> I<00:06:53.680> think<00:06:53.980> and<00:06:54.250> the<00:06:54.610> biggest<00:06:55.030> one

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
48 inch and I think and the biggest one

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.610 
48 inch and I think and the biggest one
there<00:06:55.900> is<00:06:56.110> is<00:06:56.440> perhaps<00:06:56.890> better<00:06:57.810> but<00:06:58.810> the<00:06:58.990> 55

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
there is is perhaps better but the 55

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.360 
there is is perhaps better but the 55
inch<00:06:59.860> version<00:07:00.340> is<00:07:00.580> very<00:07:01.180> fairly<00:07:01.840> expensive<00:07:02.370> so

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370 
inch version is very fairly expensive so

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.560 
inch version is very fairly expensive so
48<00:07:04.150> inch<00:07:04.960> 1c<00:07:05.650> I<00:07:05.830> got<00:07:06.130> it<00:07:06.340> a<00:07:06.370> decent<00:07:06.790> price

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
48 inch 1c I got it a decent price

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.380 
48 inch 1c I got it a decent price
and<00:07:07.900> I<00:07:08.020> smart<00:07:08.290> too<00:07:08.530> much<00:07:08.800> different<00:07:09.250> to<00:07:09.520> the<00:07:09.700> 40

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390 
and I smart too much different to the 40

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.500 
and I smart too much different to the 40
inch<00:07:10.600> version<00:07:11.400> that's<00:07:12.400> my<00:07:12.640> guide<00:07:12.880> I<00:07:13.210> hope<00:07:13.360> you
