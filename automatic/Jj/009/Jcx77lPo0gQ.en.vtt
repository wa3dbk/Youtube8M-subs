00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.140
 full house in the drawbridge hall that 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.089
 especially creates an opponent of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.379
 record champion borussia d端sseldorf if 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.059
 The West Germans in the Westerwald 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.630
 then come the stands full 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.790
 occupied 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.080
 then the anticipation is huge in the bregtal 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.179
 especially to him 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.740
 Timo boll the man for the first time 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.119
 an opponent must find the in 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.580
 can bring distress 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.500
 Europe's number one meticulous 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.230
 one of them tried something when 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.660
 others are already in the locker room and he is 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.699
 is an ex patrick tree walked 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.349
 two years ago to borussia brought along 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.450
 her, among other things, two championships 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.000
 and became a champions league title 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.739
 2012 Vice World Champion with the team 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.300
 his opponent bordered on new ones 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.550
 Hope bearers of the croats andrej 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.399
 gacina who lost the first set, however 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.860
 with 7 12 tree caught the better 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.360
 start in an enthralling duel limit 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.550
 against d端sseldorf that was at this 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.860
 especially a table tennis in the afternoon 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.860
 An early example at world class level 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.650
 vehicle bounced a bit 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.480
 his timing cost him that 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.850
 a strong gacina den 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.920
 second set with 11 7 sat down the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.730
 Crocate through the game now absolutely 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
 balanced 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.420
 ttc coach anton stefko could do his 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.510
 protege only guess exactly like that 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.310
 go on and gacina did this 11 too 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.290
 9 again one too long from 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.000
 Patrick the Croats gets in 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.490
 this match with 2 1 sets in leadership 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.500
 but the expression of stefke betrays it 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.720
 You do not even clear a tree 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.800
 Pass by the side of the current 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.080
 world ranking 30 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.360
 had an answer ready claimed the 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.010
 fourth set with 11 9 and had with it 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.080
 actually the momentum on his side 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.030
 but all of china with a flash start in 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.160
 the fifth passage was fast with 5 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.500
 1 front tree had then again 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.920
 had grown at 10 26 but 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.920
 matchball 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.930
 what an incredible ball change 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.060
 You have to do that a second time 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.800
 look at tree and gacina mind you 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.080
 the original speed 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.819
 high class match with a winner of 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.910
 left a husky impressive 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.100
 andrej gacina the 1 0 for Grenzau im 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.020
 second single of the day went for ttc 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.890
 player-coach tomas pavelka into the duel 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.480
 with timo boll 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.010
 the czech likes to play against 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.690
 Germany's number one marc the 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.820
 fast-paced ball change against the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.830
 exception and can sometimes synonymous over it 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.930
 smile when berlin so gorgeous 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.120
 plays as in this scene, the two 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.930
 Just respect yourself is fun there 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.340
 watch 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.959
 even if d端sseldorf coach danny 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.970
 Heister quite optimistic 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.320
 may look his number one 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.570
 had this firmly under control 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.610
 boll won the first set in 11 3 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.530
 pawelka then got lost though 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.470
 the following passes at the end though 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.230
 with 8 12 and 9 12 not unexpected 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.209
 the d端sseldorfer for the borussia from 1 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.890
 1 1 to break but this also limits 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.870
 always possibilities the high favorites 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.380
 here in native hall one leg too 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.660
 put 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.120
 in the cup, the ttc had a few 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.739
 one week at 1 3 lost one 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.959
 quite clear matter 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.820
 here it was now more of a duel on 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.320
 Eye level like this example 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.010
 single call many things and 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.200
 christian sweet 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.820
 it went over five sets with the better 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.950
 however, the end is sweet for the sweet 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.750
 set back the passages four and 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.820
 five each won with 11 to 9 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.079
 pity there was not much missing in ruwen 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.880
 filus for the individual victory that meant 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.829
 also now it needs the duel of the two 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.660
 one against a victory of matschiner against 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.489
 Boll and the two gave it up 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.829
 really give really nothing 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.900
 already the first sentence a pure crime with 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.360
 happy end peoples china because boll one 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.070
 serves up 13 15 sees power 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.290
 you rarely get one with him 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.709
 set management against boll that does ever 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.959
 Well 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.970
 and the kroate worked in this phase 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.890
 on top of that, much fresher in his 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.310
 the border game had the game 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.200
 under control 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.200
 10 to 8 in the second set ball 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.439
 a real drama then in three 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.540
 again and again gacina got in the 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.099
 Advantage but in the end he could not 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.870
 use his five match balls 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.150
 again and again boll had the right one 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.609
 Answer thus prevented a 0 to 3 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.759
 defeat against the Grenzauer ball came 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:21.380
 ran again 17 15 and 11 to 8 in the fifth 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.380
 set at nine to nine 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.590
 once again there were three match balls for 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.140
 no china but no he could use 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.270
 There was nothing like the 22 at the end 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.370
 sat boy with 14 to 12 and 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.560
 Dusseldorf in total with 3 to 1 by 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.770
 bitter for grenzau after this great 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.770
 power 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.740
 usually better sometimes 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.440
 little luck and ok today 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.650
 everything possible so after the food game 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.750
 where went in for individual then 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.210
 we thought okay today you can 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.210
 we can do something and ok because of the case 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.840
 Rad lost and the third game too 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.220
 ruwen filus against is that was all 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.860
 open and was also very close game 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.960
 and if you won the game 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.650
 then probably it would be the last 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.120
 player andrej gacina against tino borris 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.909
 maybe game will have a bit 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.789
 more nervous and because that practically the victory 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.439
 for us for our players on sunday 28 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.150
 october, the next home game for 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.490
 china and co in bexbach 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.270
 then the opponent is called ttc at 3 pm 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.270
 quietude
