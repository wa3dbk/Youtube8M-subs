00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.940 
big I mean it is such a big part of
America<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.409> think<00:01:37.590> football<00:01:37.770> is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
America and I think football is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.649 
America and I think football is
America's<00:01:38.189> sport<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:38.909> say<00:01:39.090> baseball<00:01:39.299> or

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
America's sport you can say baseball or

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.030 
America's sport you can say baseball or
football<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> American<00:01:40.560> sport<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
football of the American sport and

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.859 
football of the American sport and
people<00:01:41.790> look<00:01:41.909> forward<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.270> football<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.750> not

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
people look forward to football and not

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.630 
people look forward to football and not
having<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.170> team<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.560> Los<00:01:43.680> Angeles<00:01:43.710> i<00:01:44.250> think<00:01:44.460> is

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
having a team in Los Angeles i think is

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.399 
having a team in Los Angeles i think is
it's<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> good<00:01:45.840> thing<00:01:45.990> i<00:01:46.140> think<00:01:46.200> they

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
it's not a good thing i think they

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.920 
it's not a good thing i think they
should<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.799> team<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:48.420> gives<00:01:48.600> us<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
should have a team here it gives us a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.330 
should have a team here it gives us a
sense<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.200> identity<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:50.220> we

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
sense of identity you know because we

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.550 
sense of identity you know because we
get<00:01:50.460> our<00:01:50.579> team<00:01:50.820> back<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.479> now<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
get our team back and so now we have to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.840 
get our team back and so now we have to
do<00:01:52.680> more<00:01:52.829> things<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> community<00:01:53.460> i<00:01:53.790> think

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
do more things in the community i think

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.539 
do more things in the community i think
would<00:01:54.210> benefit<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> community<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.860> also

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
would benefit the community and also

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.130 
would benefit the community and also
benefit<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> retired<00:01:57.570> prayers<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.110> are

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
benefit the retired prayers that are

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.399 
benefit the retired prayers that are
here<00:01:58.759> if<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.960> rams<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.380> raiders

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
here if it is the the rams and raiders

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.069 
here if it is the the rams and raiders
yes<00:02:01.860> i<00:02:02.100> think<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.670> clearly<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
yes i think they have clearly the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.389 
yes i think they have clearly the
history<00:02:04.439> here<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.920> rams<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
history here that the rams of

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.910 
history here that the rams of
establishing<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.960> raiders<00:02:07.350> certainly<00:02:07.680> plays

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
establishing the raiders certainly plays

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.389 
establishing the raiders certainly plays
I<00:02:07.950> think

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
I think

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.399 
I think
into<00:02:11.299> a<00:02:11.329> larger<00:02:12.939> I<00:02:13.939> think<00:02:14.659> valuable<00:02:15.079> picture

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
into a larger I think valuable picture

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.309 
into a larger I think valuable picture
for<00:02:15.769> me<00:02:15.920> personally<00:02:16.189> I<00:02:16.549> just<00:02:16.670> think<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.319> would

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
for me personally I just think it would

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.089 
for me personally I just think it would
be<00:02:18.379> the<00:02:18.590> easiest<00:02:18.890> transition<00:02:19.129> I<00:02:19.939> think<00:02:21.099> those

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
be the easiest transition I think those

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.300 
be the easiest transition I think those
teams<00:02:22.340> will<00:02:22.489> clearly<00:02:22.700> be<00:02:22.819> embraced<00:02:24.189> you<00:02:25.189> know

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
teams will clearly be embraced you know

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.679 
teams will clearly be embraced you know
it<00:02:25.549> remains<00:02:25.879> to<00:02:26.030> be<00:02:26.060> seen<00:02:26.150> what's<00:02:26.480> going<00:02:26.629> to

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
it remains to be seen what's going to

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.380 
it remains to be seen what's going to
happen<00:02:27.049> but<00:02:27.200> I'm<00:02:28.010> hoping<00:02:28.370> it's<00:02:29.030> those<00:02:29.239> two

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
happen but I'm hoping it's those two

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.720 
happen but I'm hoping it's those two
teams<00:02:29.890> they've<00:02:30.890> been<00:02:31.129> talking<00:02:31.280> about<00:02:31.489> two

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
teams they've been talking about two

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.250 
teams they've been talking about two
teams<00:02:32.000> possibly<00:02:32.420> three<00:02:32.599> I<00:02:32.629> just<00:02:32.930> don't<00:02:33.079> see

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
teams possibly three I just don't see

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.539 
teams possibly three I just don't see
the<00:02:33.379> charges<00:02:33.769> coming<00:02:33.950> here<00:02:34.159> I<00:02:34.189> don't<00:02:34.400> see<00:02:34.519> that

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
the charges coming here I don't see that

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:35.890 
the charges coming here I don't see that
he<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.879> don't<00:02:34.939> see<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.120> fit<00:02:35.450> but<00:02:35.659> You<00:02:35.780> Know<00:02:35.870> Who

am I I think the best fits would be for

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.289 
am I I think the best fits would be for
sure<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.709> los<00:02:39.829> angeles<00:02:40.040> rams<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.879> the

be the two two teams old get the best
here<00:02:59.180> in<00:02:59.299> LA<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:01.250> can<00:03:01.400> certainly<00:03:01.579> create<00:03:02.060> a

here in LA you can certainly create a

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.940 
here in LA you can certainly create a
greater<00:03:02.450> following<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.530> think<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.799> can

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
greater following and I think you can

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.369 
greater following and I think you can
impact<00:03:04.250> more<00:03:04.489> kids<00:03:04.870> especially<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.260> know
