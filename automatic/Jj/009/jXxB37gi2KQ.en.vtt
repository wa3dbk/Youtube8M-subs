00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 or the two people is pirate and I extract the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:09.680
 episode I do not know if the 2 of 3d 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.600
 the challenges of fifa 12 and this one was worth the 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.240
 I 'm sorry this bar is worth a bayern 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.580
 Munich madrid you know that if you follow the 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.180
 champions and such the madrid lost in the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.340
 90th minute for a goal by Mario's fool 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.539
 Gomez because he wanted to finish off with his foot and 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.820
 in the end he finished off with the knee silly goal 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.759
 and that tells us that we only have to 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.219
 to mark with mario gómez is worth neither revelli 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.090
 I neither repeated nor robbed nor with anyone 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.090
 more only with mario gómez 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.739
 to see what I read is the bayern and the branch in 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.530
 Equalities with the party almost included 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.420
 to be able to achieve more, well, that's what 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.540
 final minutes I do not know the minutes that 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.510
 I have to mark with mario gómez 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.160
 but if we have to go with the bayern to 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.589
 I honestly do not like to go with the 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.620
 country because I'm from Madrid 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.620
 i 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.390
 and that we are going to give to the professional as 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.280
 forever 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.280

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.600

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.579

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.860
