do<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.350> still<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.040> highest<00:01:44.159> clocked

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
do it's still one of the highest clocked

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.530 
do it's still one of the highest clocked
cards<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.869> overclock<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:48.299> makes

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
cards and it can overclock so that makes

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.240 
cards and it can overclock so that makes
it<00:01:48.689> perfect<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.200> home<00:01:49.320> theater<00:01:49.470> PC<00:01:49.619> build

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
it perfect for a home theater PC build

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.789 
it perfect for a home theater PC build
it's<00:01:50.640> small<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.390> doesn't<00:01:51.840> require<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.350> 6<00:01:52.590> pin

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
it's small it doesn't require the 6 pin

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.120 
it's small it doesn't require the 6 pin
and<00:01:53.070> most<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.880> all<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.600> runs<00:01:54.960> an<00:01:55.320> incredibly

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and most of all it runs an incredibly

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.580 
and most of all it runs an incredibly
low<00:01:56.640> power<00:01:57.270> draw<00:01:57.630> which<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.110> great<00:01:58.320> because

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
low power draw which is great because

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.859 
low power draw which is great because
that<00:01:58.829> system<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.340> almost<00:01:59.579> all<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> time<00:02:00.090> so

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
that system is on almost all the time so

according<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.560> PNY<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.190> card<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.519> actually

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
according to PNY this card is actually

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.780 
according to PNY this card is actually
clocked<00:02:51.269> at<00:02:51.720> 1200<00:02:52.650> +<00:02:52.799> 2<00:02:52.920> megahertz<00:02:53.250> with<00:02:53.610> a

boost<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.450> 1200<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.140> 81<00:02:55.950> now<00:02:56.580> that's<00:02:56.760> pretty

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
boost of 1200 and 81 now that's pretty

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.910 
boost of 1200 and 81 now that's pretty
impressive<00:02:57.269> if<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.870> compare<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.590> against

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
impressive if you compare this against

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.380 
impressive if you compare this against
some<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.160> other<00:02:59.190> cards<00:02:59.549> out<00:02:59.670> there<00:02:59.700> that's

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
some of the other cards out there that's

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.640 
some of the other cards out there that's
one<00:03:00.569> of<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.720> highest<00:03:00.870> boost<00:03:01.230> clocks<00:03:01.500> that

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
one of the highest boost clocks that

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.039 
one of the highest boost clocks that
you're<00:03:01.769> gonna<00:03:01.860> get<00:03:02.069> on<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> 750<00:03:02.849> Ti<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.450> like<00:03:03.959> I

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
you're gonna get on a 750 Ti and like I

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.809 
you're gonna get on a 750 Ti and like I
said<00:03:04.110> really<00:03:05.040> interesting<00:03:05.430> thing<00:03:05.580> about<00:03:05.640> that

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
said really interesting thing about that

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.300 
said really interesting thing about that
is<00:03:06.150> no<00:03:06.840> auxiliary<00:03:07.049> power<00:03:07.500> connection<00:03:08.040> needed

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
is no auxiliary power connection needed

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.770 
is no auxiliary power connection needed
so<00:03:08.580> let's<00:03:08.730> take<00:03:08.849> a<00:03:08.910> look<00:03:09.060> inside<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.390> box

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
so let's take a look inside the box

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.250 
so let's take a look inside the box
alright<00:03:10.680> slide<00:03:11.069> out<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.400> card<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.630> there<00:03:13.110> it

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
alright slide out the card and there it

from the power supply to the card which

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.670 
from the power supply to the card which
is<00:04:39.820> fantastic<00:04:40.330> because<00:04:41.020> at<00:04:41.199> a<00:04:41.229> home<00:04:41.410> theater

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
don't need them it just makes things

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.909 
don't need them it just makes things
cleaner<00:04:48.729> keeps<00:04:49.419> air<00:04:49.630> moving<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.200> just<00:04:50.740> makes

the<00:04:51.070> build<00:04:51.280> especially<00:04:52.000> in<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.389> cramped<00:04:52.600> case

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
the build especially in a cramped case

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.110 
the build especially in a cramped case
far<00:04:53.470> easier<00:04:53.740> so<00:04:54.490> some<00:04:54.669> of<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.790> features<00:04:55.090> of

far easier so some of the features of

far easier so some of the features of
this<00:04:55.360> card<00:04:55.630> obviously<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:56.740> has<00:04:56.889> this<00:04:57.100> nice<00:04:57.310> fan

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
this card obviously it has this nice fan

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.310 
this card obviously it has this nice fan
on<00:04:57.970> top<00:04:58.210> which<00:04:58.450> is<00:04:58.479> a<00:04:58.660> little<00:04:59.050> bit<00:04:59.169> of<00:04:59.260> a

on top which is a little bit of a
departure<00:04:59.560> from<00:04:59.950> stock<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.760> stock<00:05:00.820> of<00:05:01.210> this

departure from stock the stock of this

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.510 
departure from stock the stock of this
