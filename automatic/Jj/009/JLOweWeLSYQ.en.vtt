down there and see see get back here
fall<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.550> wire<00:00:54.199> here's<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> connector

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
fall of this wire here's the connector

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
fall of this wire here's the connector
see<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> connector<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.190> could<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.489> there

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
see the connector so you could get there

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.209 
see the connector so you could get there
without<00:00:59.789> removing<00:01:00.359> anything<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.920> notice

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
without removing anything and you notice

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.380 
without removing anything and you notice
the<00:01:02.340> connector<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:05.090> same<00:01:06.200> as<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:08.390> that's

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the connector is the same as that that's

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.310 
the connector is the same as that that's
bad<00:01:11.390> you're<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.600> break<00:01:12.780> down<00:01:12.810> started

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
bad you're going to break down started

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.440 
bad you're going to break down started
so<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> right<00:01:16.710> part<00:01:16.979> good<00:01:17.970> part<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
so it's the right part good part and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.060 
so it's the right part good part and
then<00:01:19.049> we're<00:01:19.170> gonna<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.530> remove<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.890> nut

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
then we're gonna have to remove the nut

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.050 
then we're gonna have to remove the nut
on<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> rear

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
on the one in the rear

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:34.400 
on the one in the rear
it's<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.600> e8<00:01:22.460> external<00:01:23.460> torques<00:01:29.150> slow

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.220 

can't<00:01:35.410> really<00:01:35.680> show<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:36.040> to<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.220> real<00:01:36.400> good

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
off pop the new one in see if it fixes

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.160 
off pop the new one in see if it fixes
the<00:02:32.030> problems<00:02:32.450> make<00:02:32.600> sure<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.840> check<00:02:33.020> engine

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
the problems make sure the check engine

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.880 
the problems make sure the check engine
light<00:02:33.350> goes<00:02:33.560> away

sure the code doesn't come back that

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.330 
sure the code doesn't come back that
should<00:02:53.840> fix<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.320> problem<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.920> plastic

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
should fix the problem the plastic

subscribe<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:47.170> if<00:03:47.319> after<00:03:47.500> taking<00:03:47.980> out<00:03:48.069> the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
subscribe so if after taking out the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.330 
subscribe so if after taking out the
crankshaft<00:03:51.720> position<00:03:52.720> sensor<00:03:53.140> try<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.010> get<00:03:54.250> it

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
crankshaft position sensor try to get it

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.080 
crankshaft position sensor try to get it
to<00:03:54.459> focus<00:03:54.640> there<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.180> is<00:03:55.300> right<00:03:55.450> there

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
to focus there it is right there

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.000 
to focus there it is right there
so<00:03:58.090> that's<00:03:58.269> what<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.540> looks<00:03:58.570> like<00:04:02.010> that's

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
so that's what it looks like that's

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.000 
so that's what it looks like that's
where<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:03.250> goes<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:05.170> reference<00:04:05.800> to

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
where it goes and reference to

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.630 
where it goes and reference to
everything<00:04:06.370> it's<00:04:08.190> this<00:04:09.190> is<00:04:09.370> where<00:04:09.550> I'm

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
everything it's this is where I'm

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.440 
everything it's this is where I'm
looking<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.700> it's<00:04:12.819> down<00:04:13.060> there<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.690> the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
looking so it's down there and the

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.409 
looking so it's down there and the
actually<00:04:16.450> I'm<00:04:16.780> not<00:04:16.959> using<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.380> e<00:04:18.419> external

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
actually I'm not using the e external

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.940 
actually I'm not using the e external
torque<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:19.840> I'm<00:04:19.900> using<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.260> 12<00:04:20.560> point<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:20.890> think

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
torque so I'm using a 12 point I think

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.800 
torque so I'm using a 12 point I think
it's<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.280> quarter-inch<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:21.940> yes<00:04:22.510> I<00:04:22.690> now

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
it's a quarter-inch and yes I now

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.909 
it's a quarter-inch and yes I now
quarter<00:04:23.140> inches<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:23.470> sae<00:04:23.950> but<00:04:24.850> uh<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:26.500> works

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
quarter inches and sae but uh it works

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.969 
quarter inches and sae but uh it works
it<00:04:27.610> gets<00:04:27.820> on<00:04:27.970> there<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.150> I<00:04:28.750> went<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:29.680> this<00:04:29.800> other

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
it gets on there I I went to this other

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.650 
it gets on there I I went to this other
sensor<00:04:30.400> it's<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.610> same<00:04:30.790> as<00:04:30.970> this<00:04:31.090> sensor<00:04:31.450> so

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
sensor it's the same as this sensor so

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.810 
sensor it's the same as this sensor so
if<00:04:31.930> whatever<00:04:32.260> socket<00:04:32.890> you<00:04:33.010> using<00:04:33.400> fits<00:04:33.640> that

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
if whatever socket you using fits that

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.120 
if whatever socket you using fits that
sensor<00:04:34.240> right<00:04:34.390> there<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.840> it's<00:04:35.770> going<00:04:35.919> to<00:04:35.979> fit

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
sensor right there and it's going to fit

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.230 
sensor right there and it's going to fit
the<00:04:36.250> one<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.580> back<00:04:36.700> because<00:04:36.880> it's<00:04:37.090> the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
the one in the back because it's the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.810 
the one in the back because it's the
same<00:04:37.419> but<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:38.950> could<00:04:39.130> get<00:04:39.250> those<00:04:39.430> external

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
same but you could get those external

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.900 
same but you could get those external
torques<00:04:40.180> for<00:04:40.330> pretty<00:04:40.479> cheap<00:04:41.700> just<00:04:42.700> going<00:04:42.850> to

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
torques for pretty cheap just going to

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.880 
torques for pretty cheap just going to
put<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:43.570> new<00:04:43.690> one<00:04:43.720> in<00:04:43.900> there<00:04:44.140> put<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.650> bolt

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
put the new one in there put the bolt

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.400 
put the new one in there put the bolt
back<00:04:45.039> in<00:04:45.280> and<00:04:46.150> that's<00:04:46.270> it<00:04:46.570> thanks<00:04:47.380> for

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
back in and that's it thanks for

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.770
