00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:08.320
 hello my name is daniel santoro and they 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.800
 I will explain how the annuals are done 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.490
 manual horns and hardware 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.490
 okay 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.720
 that is basically the same but 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 simply goes the foot in another place of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:33.050
 for the manual windows for the foot in the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.050
 base and it comes 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.480
 d 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.950
 maintain success with the team of 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.950
 in front and the two feet up 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.400
 to do this trick what basically 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.400
 you can do is do 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.390
 so in front and backwards not 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.079
 understanding the balance 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.079
 so 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.340
 They give you the idea of how your 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.119
 movement of your want 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.119
 and it 's like that 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:19.270
 the bottom consists of leaving out and 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.590
 this will allow you with the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.590
 foot of the trail go 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.119
 no need if you're running out 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.100
 the same foot is giving you even to 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.920
 keep moving forward 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.950
 to do this trick in this same thing 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.100
 that urged not to create a front and 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.650
 leave this foot in many many 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.080
 guys who practice this trick put the 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.090
 standing like this this is wrong because when 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.859
 you have to finish 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.859
 dt with will not let you 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.600
 ah 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.890
 to have well well well well the trick 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.710
 there can be many ways 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.140
 the simplest and best practice 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.140
 so you can do it is this 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.390
 it consists in leaving a pial to leave the foot 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.060
 on the floor or the tip then well 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.590
 to go dragging then this is going 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.569
 to give the facility that 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.180
 logically you do not drop the base but 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.340
 you're going to write well done in the one 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.850
 foot nose manual and when I'm ready 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.450
 you can let go of the foot and having the 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.450
 balance as 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.500
 it consists of having a right click 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.500
 left 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.210
 only that the same will drive the 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.620
 front and with the foot you will go driving 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.320
 So good is going to keep 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.320
 distribution you can usually 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.879
 and practice the ifai with the heel but 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.570
 that's wrong because it takes its speed and 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.690
 when you want to do the field 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.690
 without him 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.420
 you're going to ruin your tennis even so the trick 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:38.020
 not going to win 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:39.520
 and the same not only that rents 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.680
 to be a little careful because if 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.510
 you have another or the base can reach 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.760
 hit you 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.030
 one of the complications is pitched 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.299
 that if the whole base runs alone like this 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.250
 so for this the basic practice of 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.640
 this corner 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.159
 is to keep it tilted a bit more this 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.319
 stand a little straight and not see him playing 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.720
 too much but simply nothing more 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.720
 take it a bit like that so that the base 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.440
 Chamorro and it does not hurt you 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.070
 and I want to see 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.070
 I want 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.769
 3 tricks 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:08.910
 and you want to either practice the plan 

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:12.270
 fight I know I do not know lowering any 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.860
 ending with the bar suite like you 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.520
 you want it's a matter of who you are 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.520
 practicing and
