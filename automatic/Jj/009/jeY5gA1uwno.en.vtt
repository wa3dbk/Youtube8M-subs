this one tool versus using an air gun
get<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.670> tight<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.630> air<00:00:19.080> gun<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.920> lot<00:00:20.220> longer

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490

and<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.630> know<00:00:21.750> usually<00:00:22.109> doesn't<00:00:22.289> fit

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619

it<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.219> seemed<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> job<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.300> would<00:00:40.140> think

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
it it seemed to do the job I would think

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.319 
it it seemed to do the job I would think
I<00:00:40.410> would<00:00:40.469> buy<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.739> over<00:00:41.100> an<00:00:41.340> air<00:00:41.489> gun<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.000> mean

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
I would buy this over an air gun I mean

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.760 
I would buy this over an air gun I mean
every<00:00:42.570> use<00:00:42.660> mechanic<00:00:43.079> seems<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.379> two<00:00:43.500> or<00:00:43.590> three

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
every use mechanic seems of two or three

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.650 
every use mechanic seems of two or three
air<00:00:43.920> gun<00:00:44.160> I'm<00:00:44.550> sure<00:00:45.000> it'll<00:00:45.149> be<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.329> about<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
air gun I'm sure it'll be in about the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.360 
air gun I'm sure it'll be in about the
same<00:00:45.840> price<00:00:46.110> range<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.860> actually<00:00:47.160> does<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
same price range it actually does the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.670 
same price range it actually does the
job<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:48.090> two<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.539> think<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.230> definitely

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
job of two I think this is a definitely

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040 
job of two I think this is a definitely
thin<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.030> thing<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.239> tools<00:00:51.480> only<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
thin the thing for tools only for the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.410 
thin the thing for tools only for the
fact<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:53.129> has<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.550> torque<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
fact that it has the torque that all the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.689 
fact that it has the torque that all the
other<00:00:54.570> ones<00:00:55.260> along<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.590> way<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.219> had<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
other ones along the way have had and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.549 
other ones along the way have had and
they<00:00:56.789> break<00:00:57.059> right<00:00:57.300> away<00:00:57.329> either<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.350> broke

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
they break right away either they broke

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.290 
they break right away either they broke
right<00:00:58.739> at<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> head<00:00:59.219> where<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.030> tools

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
right at the head where this tools

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.450 
right at the head where this tools
design<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.109> nice<00:01:01.289> one<00:01:01.530> piece<00:01:01.770> where<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
design it's like nice one piece where it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.590 
design it's like nice one piece where it
seems<00:01:02.640> all<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.820> other<00:01:03.000> ones<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.359> like

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
seems all the other ones have like

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.810 
seems all the other ones have like
mechanisms<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> average<00:01:05.369> for

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
mechanisms here and when you average for

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.969 
mechanisms here and when you average for
mechanics<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.540> stuff<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.350> your<00:01:07.500> forces<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
mechanics for stuff and your forces the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
mechanics for stuff and your forces the
head<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.340> breaks<00:01:08.549> off<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.510> throw

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
head just breaks off and you just throw

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.810 
head just breaks off and you just throw
the<00:01:09.810> tool<00:01:09.990> out<00:01:10.159> versus<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.610> seems

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the tool out versus this one here seems

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.609 
the tool out versus this one here seems
like<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.210> very<00:01:12.360> strong<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.170> do<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> job

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
like it's very strong to do the job

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.070 
like it's very strong to do the job
that's<00:01:14.100> worth<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> price<00:01:14.780> when<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> first

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that's worth the price when I first

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.539 
that's worth the price when I first
tried<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.560> liked<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.740> way<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:16.979> didn't<00:01:17.280> jerk

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
tried it I liked the way it didn't jerk

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.160 
tried it I liked the way it didn't jerk
the<00:01:17.759> thing<00:01:18.030> right<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.390> my<00:01:18.540> hand<00:01:18.780> usually

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the thing right out of my hand usually

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
the thing right out of my hand usually
anything<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.159> has<00:01:20.310> some<00:01:20.549> torque<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.030> it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
anything that has some torque to it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.969 
anything that has some torque to it
you<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.720> your<00:01:21.840> hand<00:01:22.080> wedge<00:01:22.320> or<00:01:22.560> your<00:01:22.680> fingers

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
you get your hand wedge or your fingers

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.010 
you get your hand wedge or your fingers
wedged<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> frame<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.000> car<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.479> would

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
wedged in the frame of the car I would

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020 
wedged in the frame of the car I would
describe<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> nice<00:01:26.310> little<00:01:26.549> compact

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
describe this as a nice little compact

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.690 
describe this as a nice little compact
tool<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.930> would<00:01:28.590> call<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.340> fit<00:01:29.549> in

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
tool I would call it they can fit in

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.399 
tool I would call it they can fit in
between<00:01:29.820> anything<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.509> has<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.869> power<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.320> an

between anything but has the power of an
air<00:01:31.560> gun<00:01:31.740> what<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.670> most<00:01:32.790> about<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.150> was<00:01:33.360> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
air gun what I like most about it was it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
air gun what I like most about it was it
doesn't<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:34.439> you're<00:01:34.560> using<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:34.979> break

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
doesn't when you're using it to break

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.219 
doesn't when you're using it to break
something<00:01:35.520> loose<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.210> doesn't<00:01:36.570> rip<00:01:36.810> your<00:01:36.990> hand

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
something loose it doesn't rip your hand

think you can save me time rather than

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.139 
think you can save me time rather than
come<00:02:05.979> back<00:02:06.219> and<00:02:06.399> forth<00:02:06.579> to<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.759> toolbox

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
come back and forth to the toolbox

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.930 
come back and forth to the toolbox
getting<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:07.929> ranch<00:02:08.259> or<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:08.679> air<00:02:09.250> tool<00:02:09.670> or

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
getting this ranch or that air tool or

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.759 
getting this ranch or that air tool or
whatever<00:02:10.179> this<00:02:10.360> one<00:02:10.569> wrench<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:11.500> do<00:02:11.620> the

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
whatever this one wrench can do the

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.759 
whatever this one wrench can do the
whole<00:02:11.980> job<00:02:12.370> as<00:02:12.640> as<00:02:12.819> one<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:14.080> know<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.650> a

whole job as as one you know in a
40-hour<00:02:15.310> week<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.819> think<00:02:16.120> you'd<00:02:16.269> save<00:02:16.480> about

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
40-hour week I think you'd save about

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.119 
40-hour week I think you'd save about
three<00:02:16.900> or<00:02:17.019> four<00:02:17.170> hours<00:02:17.470> using<00:02:17.769> this<00:02:17.890> hammer

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
three or four hours using this hammer

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.850 
three or four hours using this hammer
head<00:02:18.400> just<00:02:18.910> in<00:02:19.030> time<00:02:19.300> savings<00:02:19.840> instead<00:02:20.709> of

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
head just in time savings instead of

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.140 
head just in time savings instead of
going<00:02:21.099> back<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.310> forth<00:02:21.640> with<00:02:21.760> different

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
going back and forth with different

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.800 
going back and forth with different
tools<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.140> would<00:02:23.950> if<00:02:24.310> one<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.209> my<00:02:25.239> friends<00:02:25.330> saw

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
tools I would if one of my friends saw

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.970 
tools I would if one of my friends saw
me<00:02:25.840> weren't<00:02:26.110> using<00:02:26.500> this<00:02:26.590> thing<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:26.920> they

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
me weren't using this thing and they

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.229 
me weren't using this thing and they
didn't<00:02:27.160> think<00:02:27.280> would<00:02:27.400> be<00:02:27.459> good<00:02:27.670> for<00:02:27.879> them<00:02:28.030> I

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
didn't think would be good for them I

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.000 
didn't think would be good for them I
tell<00:02:28.840> them<00:02:28.900> they're<00:02:29.080> crazy<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.500> think<00:02:29.799> it's<00:02:29.920> an

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
tell them they're crazy I think it's an

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.220 
tell them they're crazy I think it's an
excellent<00:02:30.310> tool<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.030> if<00:02:31.330> they<00:02:31.480> tried<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.959> they

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
excellent tool and if they tried it they

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.180 
excellent tool and if they tried it they
would<00:02:32.379> buy<00:02:32.530> one<00:02:32.739> too

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
would buy one too

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.550 
would buy one too
I<00:02:33.220> think<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.150> would<00:02:34.420> say<00:02:34.599> in<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.110> next<00:02:35.290> five

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
I think I would say in the next five

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.050 
I think I would say in the next five
years<00:02:35.590> everybody<00:02:36.190> would<00:02:36.519> have<00:02:36.549> one<00:02:36.849> of<00:02:36.940> these

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
years everybody would have one of these

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.180 
years everybody would have one of these
in<00:02:37.840> their<00:02:38.440> toolbox
