00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.460
 ace 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.980
 Hello my loves, how are you for years and tell me 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.050
 in that yes I am very happy to be another 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.720
 week more with you today 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.250
 let's make this beautiful necklace 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.900
 reusing a few little things that I 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.300
 I know we all have in our homes 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.399
 so they have no excuses to do my 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.439
 cool days and good the best of everything is 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.840
 what can we do in any color 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.340
 let's create in any color and this 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.649
 It will be very useful when it comes to 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.780
 combine outfits and many looks 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.280
 is going to take out a lot of troubles and I know 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.840
 who are going to make the envy of all their 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.059
 friends because they will question you 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.220
 where they bought it and not us 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.829
 we did it and no one is going to realize 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.450
 because the finish is incredible to know very 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.120
 it looks nice that we would have bought it 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.640
 in some store like zara bershka or by 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.130
 same garzon and today I without further ado 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.130
 let's start for this same day 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.740
 we will need 15 plastic cigarettes 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.000
 scissors 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:10.560
 sharp spray paint and gun with 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.760
 silicone chain or ribbon and wire 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.590
 moldable 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.990
 We started by putting the cigarettes in 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.700
 row and after this we're going to 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.370
 Draw a few lines quotes more 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.060
 small to large that is to say let's 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.170
 draw a triangle as I show here 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.930
 after this we begin to 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.000
 cut what we draw to where 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.070
 we made the hairline if you want 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.960
 can take a2 cigarettes from the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.850
 sides as shown in the video to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.850
 make it much easier and take us 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 unless we are going to cut all of them all 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.110
 cigarettes and we will accommodate them 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.240
 a fit side on how they came 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.060
 drawn that is in the form of a triangle 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.890
 let's go adjusting from small to 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.890
 Longer more grandecitos 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.140
 we accommodate all the cigarettes that already 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.390
 we cut and now we take our 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.930
 marker and let's draw a few points 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.780
 where we are going to cross a lace 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.370
 hot please be very careful 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.500
 we're going to go through hot in all 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.569
 the little dots from side to side so that we 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.910
 there are some small holes there and we can 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.100
 go through the wire right now we are going to 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.560
 do it in all the cigarettes we should 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.269
 something like this now let's take a 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.880
 sheet of paper and we are going to make some 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.670
 Very thin rolls of paper can be 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.160
 help from a stick of these we are going to 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.110
 make some rolls and these rolls 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.650
 let's start putting in each of 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.170
 the cigarettes but only until more 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.940
 below where the little hole is 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.130
 we cut the surplus and we must stay 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.080
 something like this we are going to do in all 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.510
 skinny we cut this is so that 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.630
 they get a little bit heavier and they do not 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.370
 rise with the wind now we take the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.709
 moldable wire and what we're going to do 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.270
 is to cut a slightly wider piece of 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.370
 what is the triangle 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.320
 we take the wire and we're going to start 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.820
 pass each of the cigarettes by the 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.820
 little hole we made 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.010
 we opened the cigarettes a little so that 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.050
 open and we can paint them very well with 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.880
 spray paint if you do not have 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.800
 of this painting can use the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.990
 paint that you have at hand I 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.510
 I use this one because the finish is a lot 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.040
 more beautiful but you can use 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.040
 what you have at hand 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.989
 yes 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.099
 Here I took two black pearls and the 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.439
 put on each corner to make it look more 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.540
 pretty the necklace and what I'm going to do is 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.609
 catch the excess wire and 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.650
 roll it up to make a ring for 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.600
 that there can go the chain or the ribbon 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.340
 so we can hang the necklace 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.420
 in the other corner we are going to do 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.420
 exactly the same 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.870
 now we take our pebbles for 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.090
 decorate the bottom part so you do not 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.970
 see the paper I am using 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.680
 these strollers these black spikes and 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.780
 I'm sticking them with hot silicone 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.490
 but if you do not have this you can 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.370
 use what you have any 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.400
 type of stones here you can 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.260
 put string or cloth tape on me 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.790
 this case I will use cloth tape 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.760
 because I think it looks much more 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.160
 pretty with the design we just spent 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.440
 the tape through the habit and the 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.240
 we bend and stick it with silicone 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.910
 hot this way is super 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.090
 simple the same thing we're going to do the other 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.090
 side 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.300
 we should have something like that now we take 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.850
 the corners of the tape and what we're going 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.920
 to do is pass a lighter to 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.590
 that we are not going to sow the tape 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.360
 They Taran and this is the end result my 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.310
 love the truth that I loved it 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.590
 it tastes beautiful does not seem that what 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.270
 We have done ourselves hope 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.740
 that you really liked this 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.110

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.670

 send me in your photos really that I 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.960
 they make the necklace very very happy and good 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.120
 they do not necessarily have to do it 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.860
 exactly to this one as you can see here 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.780
 I made a rosadito and I put a 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.080
 golden chain looks beautiful too 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.210
 you can play with colorful chains 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.490
 cords what you want everything is 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.690
 question of creativity 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.880
