00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.270 

we're<00:00:09.509> not<00:00:09.629> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.809> look<00:00:09.959> at<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.290> granular

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
we're not going to look at the granular

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.129 
we're not going to look at the granular
effect<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.360> egg<00:00:12.539> timer<00:00:12.780> because<00:00:12.959> that's

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
effect of this egg timer because that's

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.760 
effect of this egg timer because that's
kind<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.349> what<00:00:13.499> we<00:00:13.620> want<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.509> sand<00:00:15.509> salt<00:00:16.320> that

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
kind of what we want to sand salt that

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.290 
kind of what we want to sand salt that
type<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.040> thing<00:00:17.750> so<00:00:18.750> if<00:00:18.870> i<00:00:18.960> open<00:00:19.110> up<00:00:19.290> my

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
type of thing so if i open up my

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.210 
type of thing so if i open up my
granular<00:00:21.300> effect<00:00:21.600> i'm<00:00:21.750> also<00:00:21.900> turned<00:00:22.440> on<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
granular effect i'm also turned on the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.840 
granular effect i'm also turned on the
animation<00:00:24.590> and<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.860> this<00:00:26.280> is<00:00:26.460> important

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
animation and this is this is important

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.840 
animation and this is this is important
thing<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.150> understand<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.600> that<00:00:27.930> we've<00:00:28.140> got

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
thing to understand is that we've got

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.500 
thing to understand is that we've got
not<00:00:29.850> just<00:00:30.800> static<00:00:31.800> collision<00:00:32.189> objects<00:00:32.669> but

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
not just static collision objects but

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.739 
not just static collision objects but
this<00:00:33.749> collision<00:00:34.019> object<00:00:34.699> is<00:00:35.699> turning<00:00:36.480> that

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:36.749 
this collision object is turning that

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:38.419 
this collision object is turning that
for<00:00:36.960> moving<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.589> also<00:00:37.710> continually

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:38.429 
for moving but it's also continually

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.180 
for moving but it's also continually
turning<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.089> the<00:00:39.239> particle<00:00:39.749> is<00:00:39.870> getting

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
turning so the particle is getting

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.500 
turning so the particle is getting
collision<00:00:41.190> another<00:00:41.789> collision<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.269> the<00:00:42.329> next

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
collision another collision on the next

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.700 
collision another collision on the next
time<00:00:42.659> another<00:00:42.809> collision<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.289> a<00:00:43.379> different

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
time another collision in a different

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.610 
time another collision in a different
place<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.159> as<00:00:44.339> a<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:45.089> is<00:00:45.269> a<00:00:45.300> an<00:00:45.960> extreme<00:00:46.379> case

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
place so as a this is a an extreme case

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.559 
place so as a this is a an extreme case
of<00:00:47.659> non<00:00:48.659> deforming<00:00:49.289> collision<00:00:50.159> objects

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:50.569 
of non deforming collision objects

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:52.969 
of non deforming collision objects
actually<00:00:51.569> doing<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.109> continuous<00:00:52.769> collisions

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
actually doing a continuous collisions

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:54.529 
actually doing a continuous collisions
you<00:00:53.399> notice<00:00:53.640> how<00:00:53.760> when<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.089> play<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.359> back

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
you notice how when we play this back

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.930 
you notice how when we play this back
again<00:00:54.870> some<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> elements<00:00:55.949> are<00:00:56.339> flying

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
again some of the elements are flying

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.939 
again some of the elements are flying
out<00:00:57.149> because<00:00:57.600> at<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:57.870> frame<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.710> starts

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
out because at one frame when it starts

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.619 
out because at one frame when it starts
to<00:00:58.979> turn<00:00:59.249> let's<00:00:59.519> this<00:00:59.670> border<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.269> second

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
to turn let's this border for a second

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.349 
to turn let's this border for a second
there<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.809> go<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.499> on<00:01:01.589> one<00:01:01.800> frame<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.699> object

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
there we go so on one frame the object

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.549 
there we go so on one frame the object
is<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.780> then<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.960> next<00:01:04.019> frame<00:01:04.320> it's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
is here and then the next frame it's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
is here and then the next frame it's
moved<00:01:04.829> so<00:01:05.549> there's<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> couple<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.000> things<00:01:06.060> we

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
moved so there's a couple of things we

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.270 
moved so there's a couple of things we
can<00:01:06.920> look<00:01:07.920> at<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.509> substance<00:01:09.979> this<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
can look at here substance this is the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.639 
can look at here substance this is the
number<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> calculations<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:13.170> are

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
number of calculations that are

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.249 
number of calculations that are
happening<00:01:13.829> in<00:01:14.280> order<00:01:14.759> to<00:01:14.909> work<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
happening in order to work out the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.380 
happening in order to work out the
position<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.159> particle<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.149> whether<00:01:18.329> or

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
position of the particle and whether or

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.630 
position of the particle and whether or
not<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.719> it's<00:01:18.930> actually<00:01:19.740> needing<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
not it's it's actually needing to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.370 
not it's it's actually needing to
collide<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.270> how<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.600> should<00:01:21.780> collide<00:01:22.110> so

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
collide and how it should collide so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.209 
collide and how it should collide so
that's<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:23.009> should<00:01:23.280> reduce<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:25.110> issue<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
that's that should reduce the issue of

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.420 
that's that should reduce the issue of
them<00:01:26.369> flying<00:01:26.909> around<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:28.590> sub<00:01:28.829> steps<00:01:29.070> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
them flying around the more sub steps of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.039 
them flying around the more sub steps of
the<00:01:29.609> more<00:01:29.789> iterations<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.570> slower<00:01:30.810> will

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the more iterations are slower will

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.090 
the more iterations are slower will
become<00:01:31.380> because<00:01:31.619> their<00:01:31.799> number<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
become because their number of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740 
become because their number of
calculations<00:01:32.399> that<00:01:32.850> we'd<00:01:33.030> be<00:01:33.119> doing<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.539> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
calculations that we'd be doing but the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.539 
calculations that we'd be doing but the
more<00:01:33.899> accurate<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.740> will<00:01:35.100> become<00:01:37.549> we're

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
more accurate it will become we're

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.730 
more accurate it will become we're
dealing<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:38.789> quite<00:01:39.060> large<00:01:39.530> particles<00:01:40.530> here

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
dealing with quite large particles here

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.410 
dealing with quite large particles here
but<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.070> want<00:01:41.219> to<00:01:41.310> reduce<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.299> into

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
but we want to reduce that so going into

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.300 
but we want to reduce that so going into
the<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.899> original<00:01:42.990> emission<00:01:43.740> here<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the the original emission here the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.569 
the the original emission here the
resolution<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.780> try<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> point<00:01:46.350> five<00:01:46.679> so

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
resolution I can try a point five so

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
resolution I can try a point five so
half<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.210> originally<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:48.929> you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.320> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
half that originally so you can see that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.999 
half that originally so you can see that
the<00:01:49.759> number<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.899> particles<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.259> dramatically

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the number of particles is dramatically

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.679 
the number of particles is dramatically
bigger<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.909> let's<00:01:54.090> see<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.240> happens

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
bigger here so let's see what happens

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.359 
bigger here so let's see what happens
when<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.079> starts<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.130> turn<00:01:57.770> I'll<00:01:58.770> go<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.189> a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
when this starts to turn I'll go it's a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.270 
when this starts to turn I'll go it's a
a<00:01:59.640> lot<00:02:00.359> more<00:02:00.570> smaller<00:02:00.990> particles<00:02:01.619> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
a lot more smaller particles and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.620 
a lot more smaller particles and
therefore<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> calculations<00:02:03.420> are

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
therefore the calculations are

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.270 
therefore the calculations are
considerable<00:02:06.740> what<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:07.859> going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.069> do<00:02:08.159> is

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
considerable what they going to do is

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.609 
considerable what they going to do is
you<00:02:08.550> see<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.849> surface<00:02:09.119> friction<00:02:09.810> that's<00:02:10.319> good

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
you see the surface friction that's good

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.930 
you see the surface friction that's good
that<00:02:10.830> will<00:02:10.979> help

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that will help

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.620 
that will help
stop<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.210> jittering<00:02:12.630> when<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.930> hits<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
stop the jittering when it hits the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.840 
stop the jittering when it hits the
bottom<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.440> egg<00:02:16.560> timer<00:02:16.800> here<00:02:17.130> one

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850

thing<00:02:18.000> I'm<00:02:18.060> going<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.240> do<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:18.540> add<00:02:18.720> a

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
thing I'm going to do is just add a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.760 
thing I'm going to do is just add a
little<00:02:19.280> offset<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:22.350> like<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> piece

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
little offset so that it's like a piece

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.260 
little offset so that it's like a piece
of<00:02:22.800> glass<00:02:23.070> here<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.670> want<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.940> be<00:02:24.060> right

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
of glass here and I want it to be right

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.930 
of glass here and I want it to be right
on<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.570> boundary<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:26.010> collision<00:02:26.670> on

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
on the boundary of the collision on

on the boundary of the collision on
Genesis<00:02:27.390> moving<00:02:27.780> slightly<00:02:31.760> there<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:32.910> go<00:02:33.410> so

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
Genesis moving slightly there we go so

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.320 
Genesis moving slightly there we go so
it's<00:02:34.590> still<00:02:34.710> got<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> few<00:02:35.160> more<00:02:35.400> flying<00:02:36.060> off

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
it's still got a few more flying off

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.320 
it's still got a few more flying off
there<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:36.600> back<00:02:37.290> into<00:02:37.470> our<00:02:37.710> sub<00:02:38.280> steps<00:02:38.520> again<00:02:39.270> I

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
there so back into our sub steps again I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.140 
there so back into our sub steps again I
could<00:02:39.510> perhaps<00:02:39.720> go<00:02:40.230> up<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.440> four<00:02:41.000> slow<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.120> down

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
could perhaps go up to four slow it down

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.250 
could perhaps go up to four slow it down
slightly<00:02:42.510> but<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:42.810> going<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.990> make<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.230> a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
slightly but it's going to make it a

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.500 
slightly but it's going to make it a
little<00:02:43.380> bit<00:02:43.560> more<00:02:43.650> accurate<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:45.300> there's

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
little bit more accurate so there's

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.670 
little bit more accurate so there's
gonna<00:02:45.600> be<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> number<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:46.080> occasions<00:02:46.260> where<00:02:46.590> if

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
gonna be a number of occasions where if

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.500 
gonna be a number of occasions where if
you<00:02:46.770> have<00:02:46.950> multiple<00:02:47.160> collision<00:02:47.880> objects

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
you have multiple collision objects

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.740 
you have multiple collision objects
deforming<00:02:49.410> collision<00:02:49.770> objects<00:02:50.280> which<00:02:50.750> logo

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
deforming collision objects which logo

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.660 
deforming collision objects which logo
is<00:02:52.020> really<00:02:52.260> dealing<00:02:52.830> with<00:02:53.040> static<00:02:53.490> or

is really dealing with static or

objects<00:02:56.450> here<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:57.510> case<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:58.020> see<00:02:58.050> that

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
objects here in case you can see that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.350

increasing<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.280> number<00:02:59.490> of<00:02:59.550> sub<00:02:59.790> steps<00:03:00.000> has

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
increasing the number of sub steps has

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.320 
increasing the number of sub steps has
helped<00:03:00.860> stop<00:03:01.860> them<00:03:02.100> flying<00:03:02.460> out<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:06.090> if<00:03:06.180> we

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
helped stop them flying out and if we

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.750 
helped stop them flying out and if we
were<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.480> increase<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.620> number<00:03:08.070> of<00:03:08.100> particles

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
were to increase the number of particles

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.850 
were to increase the number of particles
by<00:03:08.940> reducing<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.810> resolution<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.620> this<00:03:10.710> is

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
by reducing the resolution and this is

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.660 
by reducing the resolution and this is
point<00:03:11.130> five<00:03:11.430> units<00:03:12.950> there<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.100> another<00:03:14.190> trick

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
point five units there is another trick

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.780 
point five units there is another trick
we<00:03:14.850> can<00:03:15.060> do<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.890> can<00:03:17.070> even<00:03:17.160> go<00:03:17.280> back<00:03:17.520> into<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
we can do you can even go back into the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.760 
we can do you can even go back into the
playback<00:03:18.360> options<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.380> do<00:03:19.440> things<00:03:19.650> like

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
playback options and do things like

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.580 
playback options and do things like
double<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.340> frame<00:03:20.700> rate<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.350> double<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
double the frame rate and double the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.699 
double the frame rate and double the
step<00:03:23.070> size<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.900> could<00:03:25.110> actually<00:03:25.290> go<00:03:25.530> back

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
step size and I could actually go back

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.850 
step size and I could actually go back
and<00:03:25.950> reduce<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:27.170> reduce<00:03:28.170> their<00:03:28.440> number<00:03:28.739> of

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
and reduce the reduce their number of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.540 
and reduce the reduce their number of
sub<00:03:29.100> steps<00:03:29.340> here<00:03:34.070> so<00:03:35.070> what<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.370> will<00:03:35.520> be

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
sub steps here so what this will be

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.280 
sub steps here so what this will be
doing<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:35.970> simulation<00:03:36.570> has<00:03:36.930> its<00:03:37.110> own

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
doing this simulation has its own

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.920 
doing this simulation has its own
calculations<00:03:38.250> but<00:03:39.060> we're<00:03:39.300> playing<00:03:39.720> around

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
calculations but we're playing around

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.720 
calculations but we're playing around
with<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.110> frame<00:03:40.440> rate<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.680> can<00:03:40.950> also<00:03:41.130> play<00:03:41.519> around

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
with a frame rate I can also play around

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.240 
with a frame rate I can also play around
with<00:03:42.000> how<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:43.440> whole<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.620> softer<00:03:44.070> Marge

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
with how the whole of softer Marge

environment is interacting with all of
the<00:03:47.640> simulation<00:03:47.900> environments<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.800> can

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
the simulation environments so I can

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.680 
the simulation environments so I can
play<00:03:50.400> around<00:03:50.489> with<00:03:50.730> sub<00:03:50.910> steps<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.360> can<00:03:51.540> play

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
play around with sub steps I can play

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.840 
play around with sub steps I can play
around<00:03:51.780> with<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.560> frame<00:03:52.860> rate<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.519> be<00:03:53.580> able<00:03:53.700> to

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
around with the frame rate to be able to

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.330 
around with the frame rate to be able to
get<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.150> accurate<00:03:54.830> collisions<00:03:55.830> here<00:03:56.070> all<00:03:56.310> I

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
get the accurate collisions here all I

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.440 
get the accurate collisions here all I
can<00:03:56.550> do<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.700> combination<00:03:57.239> of<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.230> two
