00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
take a closer look as we've all the lava

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.060 
take a closer look as we've all the lava
core<00:00:12.910> base<00:00:13.120> layer<00:00:13.389> products<00:00:13.870> it's<00:00:14.710> made<00:00:14.920> from

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
core base layer products it's made from

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.410 
core base layer products it's made from
a<00:00:15.190> three<00:00:15.460> layer<00:00:15.700> material

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
a three layer material

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.470 
a three layer material
yeah<00:00:17.380> after<00:00:17.439> fabric<00:00:18.009> is<00:00:18.460> a<00:00:18.669> waterproof<00:00:19.060> and

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
yeah after fabric is a waterproof and

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.500 
yeah after fabric is a waterproof and
windproof<00:00:19.660> poly<00:00:20.619> therm<00:00:20.949> material<00:00:21.670> so<00:00:22.330> it's

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
windproof poly therm material so it's

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.330 
windproof poly therm material so it's
stopping<00:00:22.720> any<00:00:22.990> wind<00:00:23.230> from<00:00:23.650> caused<00:00:23.859> any<00:00:24.100> chill

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
stopping any wind from caused any chill

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.240 
stopping any wind from caused any chill
gets<00:00:24.609> the<00:00:24.730> body<00:00:24.939> but<00:00:25.930> also<00:00:26.070> stopping<00:00:27.070> that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
gets the body but also stopping that

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.529 
gets the body but also stopping that
little<00:00:27.519> penetrating<00:00:28.060> as<00:00:28.180> well

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
little penetrating as well

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.380 
little penetrating as well
it<00:00:28.750> is<00:00:28.900> obviously<00:00:29.170> still<00:00:29.260> breathable

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
it is obviously still breathable

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.310 
it is obviously still breathable
perspiration<00:00:31.390> is<00:00:31.510> still<00:00:31.810> pass<00:00:32.019> through

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
perspiration is still pass through

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.829 
perspiration is still pass through
that's<00:00:33.280> all<00:00:33.580> aided<00:00:33.970> by<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.210> middle<00:00:34.629> layer

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:34.839 
that's all aided by the middle layer

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.590 
that's all aided by the middle layer
which<00:00:35.190> polyurethane<00:00:36.190> layer<00:00:36.600> again

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
which polyurethane layer again

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.479 
which polyurethane layer again
breathable<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.470> perspiration<00:00:38.860> can<00:00:39.309> come

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
breathable the perspiration can come

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.280 
breathable the perspiration can come
through<00:00:39.670> but<00:00:40.150> it<00:00:40.239> is<00:00:40.360> waterproof<00:00:40.720> so<00:00:40.930> there's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
through but it is waterproof so there's

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.380 
through but it is waterproof so there's
again<00:00:41.350> another<00:00:41.830> barrier<00:00:42.309> from<00:00:42.790> water<00:00:42.970> coming

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
again another barrier from water coming

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.509 
again another barrier from water coming
through<00:00:43.420> stopping<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.500> from<00:00:44.890> getting<00:00:45.070> killed

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
through stopping you from getting killed

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.670 
through stopping you from getting killed
me<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:46.000> winds<00:00:46.210> or<00:00:46.570> water<00:00:46.870> just<00:00:47.229> resting<00:00:47.589> on

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
me the winds or water just resting on

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.820 
me the winds or water just resting on
the<00:00:47.769> surface<00:00:48.420> both<00:00:49.420> those<00:00:49.659> layers<00:00:49.900> mean<00:00:50.589> that

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
the surface both those layers mean that

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.460 
the surface both those layers mean that
the<00:00:51.159> fabric<00:00:51.729> is<00:00:51.820> incredibly<00:00:52.420> fast<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.809> dry<00:00:53.140> so

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
the fabric is incredibly fast to dry so

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.780 
the fabric is incredibly fast to dry so
if<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:53.619> does<00:00:53.769> get<00:00:53.979> wet<00:00:54.159> especially<00:00:54.369> if<00:00:54.699> you're

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
if it does get wet especially if you're

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.180 
if it does get wet especially if you're
wearing<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:55.180> wet<00:00:55.390> suit<00:00:55.420> it<00:00:55.960> does<00:00:56.019> dry<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:56.979> very

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
wearing a wet suit it does dry and very

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.539 
wearing a wet suit it does dry and very
very<00:00:57.460> quickly<00:00:57.839> and<00:00:58.839> then<00:00:59.769> the<00:00:59.949> inside<00:01:00.280> layer

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
very quickly and then the inside layer

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.380 
very quickly and then the inside layer
is<00:01:00.790> a<00:01:01.269> micro<00:01:01.839> fiche<00:01:02.049> fiche<00:01:02.220> so<00:01:03.220> it's<00:01:03.729> great<00:01:04.119> for

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
is a micro fiche fiche so it's great for

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.200 
is a micro fiche fiche so it's great for
both<00:01:04.659> wet<00:01:05.260> suits<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.680> dry<00:01:06.010> suits<00:01:06.340> cause<00:01:07.000> he<00:01:07.120> of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
both wet suits and dry suits cause he of

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.780 
both wet suits and dry suits cause he of
diving<00:01:07.420> in<00:01:07.630> a<00:01:07.690> wet<00:01:07.810> suit<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.530> fabric<00:01:09.070> traps

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
diving in a wet suit that fabric traps

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.150 
diving in a wet suit that fabric traps
the<00:01:09.940> water<00:01:10.120> against<00:01:10.480> the<00:01:10.570> skin<00:01:11.200> heating<00:01:12.040> that

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
the water against the skin heating that

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.680 
the water against the skin heating that
water<00:01:12.340> up<00:01:12.580> keep<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:12.940> nice<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.150> warm<00:01:13.330> and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
water up keep you nice and warm and

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.450 
water up keep you nice and warm and
again<00:01:14.260> if<00:01:14.440> you're<00:01:14.560> diving<00:01:14.740> in<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:14.950> dry<00:01:15.160> suit

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
again if you're diving in a dry suit

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.510 
again if you're diving in a dry suit
that<00:01:15.970> fabric<00:01:16.780> just<00:01:16.960> traps<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.650> air<00:01:17.680> keeps<00:01:18.400> it

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
that fabric just traps the air keeps it

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.480 
that fabric just traps the air keeps it
a<00:01:18.610> nice<00:01:18.900> temperature<00:01:20.040> trapping<00:01:21.040> it<00:01:21.130> in<00:01:21.250> there

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
a nice temperature trapping it in there

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.210 
a nice temperature trapping it in there
is<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:21.910> great<00:01:22.120> big<00:01:22.270> pocket<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.830> it's<00:01:23.980> great<00:01:24.190> for

is a great big pocket so it's great for

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.470 
is a great big pocket so it's great for
both<00:01:24.580> points<00:01:24.910> of<00:01:24.970> view<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.030> stitching
