what<00:01:44.070> actually<00:01:44.189> curry<00:01:44.610> does<00:01:44.790> require<00:01:45.090> some

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
what actually curry does require some

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.539 
what actually curry does require some
skill<00:01:45.659> um<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.680> yeah<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> kind<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.340> wanted

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
skill um but yeah so I kind of wanted

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.130 
skill um but yeah so I kind of wanted
just<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.759> give<00:01:47.939> my<00:01:48.119> thoughts<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.960> subject

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
just to give my thoughts on the subject

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.780 
just to give my thoughts on the subject
and<00:01:49.500> why<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> think<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.460> going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> be

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and why I think that this is going to be

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.160 
and why I think that this is going to be
a<00:01:50.820> good<00:01:51.060> change<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.509> don't<00:01:51.689> think<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:51.960> going

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
a good change I don't think it's going

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.380 
a good change I don't think it's going
to<00:01:52.259> ruin<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.740> game<00:01:52.920> by<00:01:53.100> any<00:01:53.250> means<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
to ruin the game by any means and the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.819 
to ruin the game by any means and the
first<00:01:54.600> thing<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> lot<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.500> players

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
first thing is that a lot of players

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.340 
first thing is that a lot of players
like<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.399> say<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:57.420> quick<00:01:57.780> scoping<00:01:58.170> in

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
like to say that quick scoping in

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.200 
like to say that quick scoping in
battlefield<00:01:58.770> 3<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.159> ridiculous<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> shouldn't

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
battlefield 3 is ridiculous it shouldn't

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.160 
battlefield 3 is ridiculous it shouldn't
be<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> game<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:01.049> not

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
be in the game because it's not

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.440 
be in the game because it's not
realistic<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.070> while<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.880> think<00:02:03.329> that's

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
realistic and while I do think that's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.240 
realistic and while I do think that's
very<00:02:03.780> true<00:02:04.229> you're<00:02:04.500> not<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> see<00:02:05.009> in

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
very true you're not going to see in

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
very true you're not going to see in
real<00:02:05.850> combat<00:02:06.119> you're<00:02:06.540> not<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> see<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
real combat you're not going to see a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.080 
real combat you're not going to see a
sniper<00:02:07.530> up<00:02:07.890> close<00:02:08.190> trying<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.610> go<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:08.879> quick

what<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> remember

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
what they do but you have to remember

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.270 
what they do but you have to remember
that<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.780> video<00:02:13.050> game

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
that this is a video game

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.280 
that this is a video game
and<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.640> counter-argument<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.540> your<00:02:14.750> realism

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
and the counter-argument to your realism

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.380 
and the counter-argument to your realism
thing<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:16.190> it's<00:02:16.310> not<00:02:16.370> realistic<00:02:16.910> for<00:02:17.180> a

you're probably going to die that's not
the<00:02:35.840> case<00:02:35.989> in<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.230> game<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.770> only<00:02:36.920> get<00:02:37.069> one

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
the case in this game you only get one

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.309 
the case in this game you only get one
shot<00:02:37.340> one<00:02:37.670> kills<00:02:37.910> from<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.630> long<00:02:38.810> distance<00:02:39.020> to

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
shot one kills from a long distance to

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.410 
shot one kills from a long distance to
get<00:02:39.500> headshots<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:40.760> just<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.209> that

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
get headshots and so just that that

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.690 
get headshots and so just that that
argument<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:42.230> not<00:02:42.410> realistic<00:02:42.950> can<00:02:43.610> be

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
argument that it's not realistic can be

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.759 
argument that it's not realistic can be
countered<00:02:44.090> by<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.510> isn't<00:02:45.050> realistic<00:02:45.440> in<00:02:45.739> the

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
countered by it isn't realistic in the

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.770 
countered by it isn't realistic in the
first<00:02:46.010> place<00:02:46.220> like<00:02:46.580> this<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> video<00:02:47.239> game<00:02:47.480> so

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
first place like this is a video game so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.150 
first place like this is a video game so
the<00:02:48.170> argument<00:02:48.350> you're<00:02:48.709> working<00:02:49.010> you're

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
the argument you're working you're

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.490 
the argument you're working you're
looking<00:02:49.489> for<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:49.880> that's<00:02:50.120> balanced<00:02:50.840> it's<00:02:51.290> not

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
looking for is that's balanced it's not

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.830 
looking for is that's balanced it's not
balanced<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.250> balancing<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.090> game<00:02:53.269> is<00:02:53.480> what

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
balanced and balancing the game is what

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.540 
balanced and balancing the game is what
dice<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.380> trying<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.769> do<00:02:54.920> right<00:02:55.130> now<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.489> I

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
dice is trying to do right now and I

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.800 
dice is trying to do right now and I
think<00:02:55.580> that<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.180> way<00:02:56.360> that<00:02:56.510> they're<00:02:56.660> going

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
think that the way that they're going

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.900 
think that the way that they're going
right<00:02:56.989> now<00:02:57.050> is<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.350> good<00:02:57.560> way<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.010> balance<00:02:58.489> the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
right now is a good way to balance the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.210 
right now is a good way to balance the
game<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.720> reason<00:03:00.590> why<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:00.739> think<00:03:01.010> it's<00:03:01.130> a

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
game and the reason why I think it's a

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.979 
game and the reason why I think it's a
good<00:03:01.340> way<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.519> balance<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.120> game<00:03:02.269> is<00:03:02.450> because

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
good way to balance the game is because

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.229 
good way to balance the game is because
right<00:03:03.260> now<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:04.010> recon<00:03:04.400> class<00:03:04.670> really<00:03:05.000> is

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
right now the the recon class really is

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.330 
right now the the recon class really is
not<00:03:05.450> as<00:03:05.660> effective<00:03:05.840> as<00:03:06.290> pretty<00:03:06.769> much<00:03:06.950> any<00:03:07.190> of

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
not as effective as pretty much any of

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.430 
not as effective as pretty much any of
the<00:03:07.580> other<00:03:07.730> classes<00:03:08.269> at<00:03:08.870> least<00:03:09.050> using<00:03:09.380> the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
the other classes at least using the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.930 
the other classes at least using the
bolt-action<00:03:09.709> rifle<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:10.400> if<00:03:10.489> I'm<00:03:10.610> playing<00:03:10.730> this

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
bolt-action rifle so if I'm playing this

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.580 
bolt-action rifle so if I'm playing this
alt<00:03:11.150> class<00:03:11.330> I've<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.019> feel<00:03:12.350> very

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
alt class I've you I feel very

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.559 
alt class I've you I feel very
comfortable<00:03:12.860> turning<00:03:13.670> around<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:14.060> corner<00:03:14.300> and

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
comfortable turning around a corner and

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.240 
comfortable turning around a corner and
taking<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.930> lot<00:03:15.050> of<00:03:15.080> people<00:03:15.319> out<00:03:15.470> because<00:03:15.860> you

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
taking a lot of people out because you

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.620 
taking a lot of people out because you
know<00:03:16.340> it's<00:03:16.550> really<00:03:16.760> good<00:03:17.000> at<00:03:17.120> close<00:03:17.299> range

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
know it's really good at close range

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.090 
know it's really good at close range
it's<00:03:17.870> really<00:03:18.260> good<00:03:18.380> at<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:18.680> know<00:03:18.709> medium

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
it's really good at you know medium

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.340 
it's really good at you know medium
range<00:03:19.310> combat<00:03:19.579> so<00:03:19.880> like<00:03:20.030> 25<00:03:20.329> meters<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.019> it

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
range combat so like 25 meters and it

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.810 
range combat so like 25 meters and it
does<00:03:21.470> all<00:03:21.590> right<00:03:21.799> at<00:03:21.980> those<00:03:22.220> long<00:03:22.430> distance

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
does all right at those long distance

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.280 
does all right at those long distance
shots<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.239> know<00:03:23.269> I<00:03:23.360> can<00:03:23.600> bar<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.959> can<00:03:24.110> burst

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
shots you know I can bar I can burst

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.710 
shots you know I can bar I can burst
fire<00:03:24.530> people<00:03:24.890> down<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.549> know<00:03:25.640> just<00:03:25.940> fine<00:03:26.239> with

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
fire people down you know just fine with

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.420 
fire people down you know just fine with
an<00:03:26.840> assault<00:03:27.049> rifle<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.680> know<00:03:27.769> maybe<00:03:28.010> not<00:03:28.220> so

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
an assault rifle you know maybe not so

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.280 
an assault rifle you know maybe not so
much<00:03:28.489> with<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.940> SMGs<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.720> engineer<00:03:30.079> class

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
much with the SMGs in the engineer class

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.900 
much with the SMGs in the engineer class
those<00:03:30.620> long<00:03:30.860> range<00:03:31.100> shots<00:03:31.310> maybe<00:03:31.549> a<00:03:31.730> little

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
those long range shots maybe a little

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.340 
those long range shots maybe a little
bit<00:03:32.060> more<00:03:32.209> difficult<00:03:32.360> but<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.840> can<00:03:32.989> still<00:03:33.140> take

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
bit more difficult but I can still take

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.770 
bit more difficult but I can still take
people<00:03:33.650> out<00:03:33.799> so<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.700> compared<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:35.360> the

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
people out so that compared to the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.509 
people out so that compared to the
sniper<00:03:36.079> rifle<00:03:36.500> if<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.799> turn<00:03:37.010> around<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.310> corner

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
sniper rifle if I turn around a corner

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.460 
sniper rifle if I turn around a corner
and<00:03:37.730> i'm<00:03:37.850> using<00:03:38.120> my<00:03:38.150> bolt<00:03:38.390> action<00:03:38.690> rifle<00:03:39.079> you

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
and i'm using my bolt action rifle you

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.630 
and i'm using my bolt action rifle you
know<00:03:39.590> i'm<00:03:39.890> going<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.220> be<00:03:40.310> at<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.430> disadvantage

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
know i'm going to be at a disadvantage

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.280 
know i'm going to be at a disadvantage
it's<00:03:41.150> going<00:03:41.269> to<00:03:41.329> be<00:03:41.390> very<00:03:41.420> hard<00:03:41.930> for<00:03:41.989> me<00:03:42.140> to

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
it's going to be very hard for me to

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.960 
it's going to be very hard for me to
take<00:03:42.440> people<00:03:42.709> out<00:03:42.859> it's<00:03:43.100> just<00:03:43.190> not<00:03:43.579> very<00:03:43.609> easy

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
take people out it's just not very easy

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.509 
take people out it's just not very easy
to<00:03:44.690> get<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:45.140> head<00:03:45.410> shot<00:03:45.440> like<00:03:45.829> i<00:03:46.010> do<00:03:46.070> it<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.400> this

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
to get a head shot like i do it in this

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.759 
to get a head shot like i do it in this
video<00:03:46.790> quite<00:03:47.329> frequently<00:03:47.750> but<00:03:47.989> overall<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.709> is

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
video quite frequently but overall it is

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.099 
video quite frequently but overall it is
a<00:03:48.890> very<00:03:49.220> difficult<00:03:49.489> task<00:03:49.880> even<00:03:50.660> at<00:03:50.750> medium

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
a very difficult task even at medium

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.050 
a very difficult task even at medium
range<00:03:51.140> it's<00:03:51.560> still<00:03:51.799> very<00:03:52.040> hard<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.579> get<00:03:52.760> you

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
range it's still very hard to get you

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.039 
range it's still very hard to get you
know<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.209> kill<00:03:53.480> someone<00:03:53.690> they're<00:03:53.870> going<00:03:53.989> to

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
know to kill someone they're going to

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.380 
know to kill someone they're going to
have<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.290> advantage<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:54.859> know<00:03:55.160> I'm<00:03:56.150> not

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
have the advantage you know I'm not

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.090 
have the advantage you know I'm not
going<00:03:56.570> to<00:03:56.660> feel<00:03:56.780> as<00:03:56.930> comfortable<00:03:57.109> if<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.620> had<00:03:57.829> a

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
going to feel as comfortable if I had a

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.580 
going to feel as comfortable if I had a
assault<00:03:58.670> rifle<00:03:59.030> compared<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.570> a<00:03:59.810> sniper<00:04:00.470> rifle

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
assault rifle compared to a sniper rifle

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.620 
assault rifle compared to a sniper rifle
pretty<00:04:01.130> much<00:04:01.280> in<00:04:01.400> any<00:04:01.549> situation<00:04:02.239> if<00:04:02.390> it's<00:04:02.570> a

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
pretty much in any situation if it's a

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.270 
pretty much in any situation if it's a
medium<00:04:02.930> range<00:04:03.140> shot<00:04:03.350> I'm<00:04:03.560> probably<00:04:03.920> going<00:04:04.190> to

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
medium range shot I'm probably going to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.009 
medium range shot I'm probably going to
have<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.579> advantage<00:04:05.000> unless<00:04:05.299> I'm<00:04:05.480> setup<00:04:05.870> and

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
have the advantage unless I'm setup and

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.509 
have the advantage unless I'm setup and
I<00:04:06.079> know<00:04:06.140> you<00:04:06.620> know<00:04:06.650> whatever<00:04:07.130> does<00:04:07.400> that

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
I know you know whatever does that

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.610 
I know you know whatever does that
that's<00:04:07.700> not<00:04:07.910> that's<00:04:08.150> besides<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.630> point<00:04:08.720> for

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
that's not that's besides the point for

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.289 
that's not that's besides the point for
most<00:04:09.739> players<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.430> assault<00:04:10.850> rifles<00:04:11.180> are

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
most players the assault rifles are

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.580 
most players the assault rifles are
going<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.510> be<00:04:11.600> better<00:04:11.750> in<00:04:11.900> those<00:04:11.989> situations

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
going to be better in those situations

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.920 
going to be better in those situations
but<00:04:12.980> even<00:04:13.310> at<00:04:13.400> long<00:04:13.670> range<00:04:14.000> or<00:04:14.209> even<00:04:14.450> really

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
but even at long range or even really

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.140 
but even at long range or even really
long<00:04:15.170> range<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:16.010> bolt-action<00:04:16.400> rifles<00:04:16.940> are

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
long range the bolt-action rifles are

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.240 
long range the bolt-action rifles are
still<00:04:17.539> not<00:04:17.780> destroying<00:04:18.470> people<00:04:18.919> at<00:04:19.070> those

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
still not destroying people at those

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.550 
still not destroying people at those
distances<00:04:19.609> like<00:04:19.789> because<00:04:20.780> you<00:04:20.900> have<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.320> add

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
distances like because you have to add

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.860 
distances like because you have to add
those<00:04:21.739> distances<00:04:22.099> the<00:04:22.820> bolt-action<00:04:23.300> rifles

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
those distances the bolt-action rifles

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.260 
those distances the bolt-action rifles
you<00:04:24.050> have<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.500> compensate<00:04:25.460> for<00:04:25.820> bullet<00:04:26.090> drop

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
you have to compensate for bullet drop

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.040 
you have to compensate for bullet drop
and

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
and

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.390 
and
as<00:04:27.139> you<00:04:27.229> guys<00:04:27.349> many<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.770> know<00:04:27.919> you're

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
as you guys many of you know you're

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.010 
as you guys many of you know you're
going<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:28.669> hear<00:04:28.849> a<00:04:28.909> lot<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:29.360> sniper<00:04:29.599> you<00:04:29.930> know

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
going to hear a lot of sniper you know

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.450 
going to hear a lot of sniper you know
bullets<00:04:30.319> fly<00:04:30.590> past<00:04:30.889> you<00:04:31.099> and<00:04:31.159> they're<00:04:31.370> not

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
bullets fly past you and they're not

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.040 
bullets fly past you and they're not
actually<00:04:31.610> hitting<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.150> because<00:04:32.659> it<00:04:32.780> really

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
actually hitting you because it really

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.200 
actually hitting you because it really
is<00:04:33.259> difficult<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:33.919> take<00:04:34.220> people<00:04:34.490> out<00:04:34.639> at<00:04:34.879> long

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
is difficult to take people out at long

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.600 
is difficult to take people out at long
range<00:04:35.599> so<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.199> say<00:04:36.409> that<00:04:36.680> bolt<00:04:36.889> action<00:04:37.250> rifles

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
range so to say that bolt action rifles

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.430 
range so to say that bolt action rifles
yes<00:04:38.120> they<00:04:38.389> should<00:04:38.449> be<00:04:38.599> good<00:04:38.870> at<00:04:39.110> long-range

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
yes they should be good at long-range

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.499 
yes they should be good at long-range
combat<00:04:39.949> and<00:04:40.220> yes<00:04:40.430> they<00:04:40.580> are<00:04:40.759> but<00:04:40.970> they're<00:04:41.360> not

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
combat and yes they are but they're not

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.540 
combat and yes they are but they're not
super<00:04:41.990> effective<00:04:42.530> at<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:42.919> because<00:04:43.069> it's<00:04:43.370> so

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
super effective at it because it's so

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.790 
super effective at it because it's so
hard<00:04:43.849> to<00:04:43.909> line<00:04:44.180> up<00:04:44.300> those<00:04:44.419> shots<00:04:44.780> compared<00:04:45.590> to

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
hard to line up those shots compared to

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800 
hard to line up those shots compared to
the<00:04:46.159> you<00:04:46.639> know<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:46.879> assault<00:04:47.120> rifles<00:04:47.449> or<00:04:47.659> the

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
the you know the assault rifles or the

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.110 
the you know the assault rifles or the
SMGs<00:04:48.319> they're<00:04:48.770> really<00:04:49.310> effective<00:04:49.759> up<00:04:49.879> close

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
SMGs they're really effective up close

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.879 
SMGs they're really effective up close
to<00:04:50.300> really<00:04:50.690> affect<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.110> at<00:04:51.199> medium<00:04:51.379> range<00:04:51.530> in

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
to really affect it at medium range in

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.290 
to really affect it at medium range in
the<00:04:52.009> role<00:04:52.159> right<00:04:52.370> at<00:04:52.610> you<00:04:52.759> know<00:04:52.879> long-range

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
the role right at you know long-range

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.999 
the role right at you know long-range
shots<00:04:53.569> but<00:04:54.199> right<00:04:54.349> now<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.560> bolt-action

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
shots but right now the bolt-action

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.040 
shots but right now the bolt-action
rifles<00:04:55.580> while<00:04:55.789> they<00:04:56.000> are<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.419> best<00:04:56.629> at<00:04:56.840> long

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
rifles while they are the best at long

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.050 
rifles while they are the best at long
range<00:04:57.319> shots<00:04:57.620> it<00:04:57.860> still<00:04:58.190> requires<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:58.819> lot<00:04:59.030> of

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
range shots it still requires a lot of

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.610 
range shots it still requires a lot of
skill<00:04:59.419> and<00:04:59.599> a<00:04:59.750> lot<00:04:59.900> of<00:05:00.020> patience<00:05:00.409> to<00:05:00.530> get

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
skill and a lot of patience to get

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.260 
skill and a lot of patience to get
really<00:05:00.979> good<00:05:01.129> at<00:05:01.190> it<00:05:01.310> compared<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.150> other

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
really good at it compared to the other

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.820 
really good at it compared to the other
weapons<00:05:02.629> that<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:03.020> can<00:05:03.199> just<00:05:03.379> kind<00:05:03.650> of<00:05:03.680> pick

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
weapons that you can just kind of pick

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.469 
weapons that you can just kind of pick
up<00:05:03.979> and<00:05:04.190> do<00:05:04.340> just<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.699> know<00:05:04.789> just<00:05:04.819> destroy

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
up and do just you know just destroy

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.659 
up and do just you know just destroy
people<00:05:05.840> at<00:05:06.259> close<00:05:06.469> to<00:05:06.500> medium<00:05:06.830> range<00:05:07.069> so<00:05:07.520> my

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
people at close to medium range so my

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.399 
people at close to medium range so my
main<00:05:07.789> argument<00:05:08.270> is<00:05:08.360> that<00:05:08.389> since<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.259> both

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
main argument is that since the both

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.409 
main argument is that since the both
action<00:05:09.770> rifles<00:05:10.129> are<00:05:10.280> only<00:05:10.460> good<00:05:10.669> at<00:05:10.789> maybe<00:05:10.969> you

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
action rifles are only good at maybe you

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.089 
action rifles are only good at maybe you
know<00:05:11.509> long-range<00:05:12.080> shots<00:05:12.349> technically<00:05:12.860> and

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
know long-range shots technically and

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.559 
know long-range shots technically and
even<00:05:13.310> then<00:05:13.490> they're<00:05:13.699> only<00:05:13.849> all<00:05:14.060> right<00:05:14.240> at<00:05:14.419> it

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
even then they're only all right at it

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.659 
even then they're only all right at it
because<00:05:15.169> does<00:05:15.500> require<00:05:15.740> so<00:05:16.009> much<00:05:16.099> skill<00:05:16.460> I

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
because does require so much skill I

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.010 
because does require so much skill I
don't<00:05:17.150> think<00:05:17.210> it's<00:05:17.449> going<00:05:17.539> to<00:05:17.629> be<00:05:17.719> a<00:05:17.750> bad<00:05:17.990> thing

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
don't think it's going to be a bad thing

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.110 
don't think it's going to be a bad thing
when<00:05:18.469> they<00:05:18.620> add<00:05:18.770> this<00:05:19.069> one<00:05:19.280> shot<00:05:19.580> one<00:05:19.789> kill<00:05:19.819> or

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
when they add this one shot one kill or

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.850 
when they add this one shot one kill or
even<00:05:20.300> if<00:05:20.389> they<00:05:20.509> do<00:05:20.569> to<00:05:21.229> the<00:05:21.319> chest<00:05:21.560> at<00:05:21.800> close

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
even if they do to the chest at close

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.529 
even if they do to the chest at close
range<00:05:22.400> combat<00:05:22.460> because<00:05:23.060> it's<00:05:23.240> going<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.419> make

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
range combat because it's going to make

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.510 
range combat because it's going to make
them<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:23.900> little<00:05:24.139> bit<00:05:24.349> more<00:05:24.440> effective<00:05:24.949> in<00:05:25.099> some

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
them a little bit more effective in some

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.830 
them a little bit more effective in some
situations<00:05:26.210> I<00:05:26.330> don't<00:05:26.509> think<00:05:26.659> it's<00:05:26.750> gonna

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
situations I don't think it's gonna

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.779 
situations I don't think it's gonna
break<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.229> game<00:05:27.409> um<00:05:27.620> but<00:05:28.280> that's<00:05:28.460> my<00:05:28.669> opinion

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
break the game um but that's my opinion

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:29.920 
break the game um but that's my opinion
and<00:05:29.150> I<00:05:29.240> do<00:05:29.300> want<00:05:29.539> to<00:05:29.569> know<00:05:29.659> what<00:05:29.780> you<00:05:29.900> guys
