00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
is that the jobs of mine yeah we use

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.880 
is that the jobs of mine yeah we use
some<00:02:14.160> cutters<00:02:14.959> we<00:02:15.959> use<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.440> cut<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.829> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
some cutters we use that to cut all the

posts<00:02:17.459> around<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.730> roof<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:18.540> could<00:02:18.660> just

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
posts around the roof so we could just

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.870 
posts around the roof so we could just
lift<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.110> roof<00:02:19.260> off<00:02:19.799> and<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.519> was<00:02:20.579> pretty

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
lift the roof off and that was pretty

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.610 
lift the roof off and that was pretty
much<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> main<00:02:21.360> tool<00:02:21.569> we<00:02:21.690> use<00:02:21.900> other<00:02:22.440> than

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
much the main tool we use other than

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.229 
much the main tool we use other than
things<00:02:22.799> like<00:02:22.950> axes<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.760> we<00:02:23.819> took<00:02:24.030> out

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
things like axes that we took out

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.000 
things like axes that we took out
windows<00:02:24.690> with<00:02:24.900> would<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.560> say<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.890> it's

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
windows with would you say that it's

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.190 
windows with would you say that it's
like<00:02:26.489> maybe<00:02:26.790> around<00:02:27.030> 20<00:02:27.360> minutes<00:02:27.480> or<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.079> do

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
like maybe around 20 minutes or so to do

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.589 
like maybe around 20 minutes or so to do
that<00:02:28.349> we<00:02:29.220> initially<00:02:29.970> were<00:02:30.090> going<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.299> take<00:02:30.450> her

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
that we initially were going to take her

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.020 
that we initially were going to take her
out<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.780> passenger<00:02:31.170> door<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:32.190> we<00:02:32.880> had<00:02:33.000> a

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
out the passenger door so we had a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.089 
out the passenger door so we had a
transition<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.900> cut<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> roof<00:02:34.560> off<00:02:34.769> when<00:02:35.010> we

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
transition to cut the roof off when we

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.770 
transition to cut the roof off when we
decided<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.519> we<00:02:35.640> want<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.030> try<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.480> protect

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
decided that we want to try to protect

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.380 
decided that we want to try to protect
that<00:02:36.870> c-spine<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.489> was<00:02:38.640> probably<00:02:38.790> about<00:02:39.060> 20

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
that c-spine so it was probably about 20

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.789 
that c-spine so it was probably about 20
minutes<00:02:39.660> from<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.959> time<00:02:39.989> we<00:02:40.260> got<00:02:40.380> here<00:02:40.590> till

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
minutes from the time we got here till

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.470 
minutes from the time we got here till
we<00:02:40.860> had<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.190> roof<00:02:41.340> taken<00:02:41.700> off<00:02:41.819> yeah<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.329> just

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
we had the roof taken off yeah I just

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.220 
we had the roof taken off yeah I just
thinking<00:02:42.750> because<00:02:42.900> that's<00:02:43.049> kind<00:02:43.200> of

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
thinking because that's kind of

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.630 
thinking because that's kind of
important<00:02:43.709> for<00:02:43.769> some<00:02:43.950> people<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.250> remember<00:02:44.549> if

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
important for some people to remember if

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.559 
important for some people to remember if
you<00:02:44.700> ever<00:02:44.760> find<00:02:45.120> themselves<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.540> that

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
you ever find themselves in that

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.900 
you ever find themselves in that
situation<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.950> not<00:02:47.130> just<00:02:47.370> an<00:02:47.459> immediate

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
situation it's not just an immediate

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.910 
situation it's not just an immediate
thing<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.750> might<00:02:48.930> take<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> few<00:02:49.319> minutes<00:02:49.500> where

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
thing it might take a few minutes where

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.590 
thing it might take a few minutes where
you<00:02:49.980> got<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.220> be<00:02:50.340> at<00:02:50.430> work<00:02:50.549> yeah<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.359> place<00:02:51.569> a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600
