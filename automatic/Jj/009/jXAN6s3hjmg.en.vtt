00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.030 

I<00:00:49.780> got<00:00:50.170> a<00:00:50.199> 2011<00:00:51.059> summit<00:00:52.059> 154<00:00:52.960> eat<00:00:53.350> eat<00:00:53.800> Tech

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.340 
I got a 2011 summit 154 eat eat Tech
then<00:00:54.790> I<00:00:54.820> put<00:00:55.090> a<00:00:55.120> tee<00:00:55.300> motion<00:00:55.660> suspension<00:00:56.230> on

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.290 
then I put a tee motion suspension on
and<00:00:56.589> I<00:00:56.650> broke<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:57.010> track<00:00:57.280> make<00:00:57.879> it<00:00:58.030> kind<00:00:58.269> of

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
and I broke the track make it kind of

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.899
