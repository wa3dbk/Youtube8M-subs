00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
got my resolution at 800 by 600 my

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.550 
got my resolution at 800 by 600 my
aspect<00:01:27.060> ratio<00:01:27.360> auto<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:28.080> change<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
aspect ratio auto you can change that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.740 
aspect ratio auto you can change that
doesn't<00:01:28.890> make<00:01:28.979> much<00:01:29.159> difference<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:30.119> change

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
doesn't make much difference like change

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.480 
doesn't make much difference like change
it<00:01:30.900> change<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.170> change<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.680> I'm<00:01:31.920> just

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
it change it change it but I'm just

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999 
it change it change it but I'm just
preferring<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.210> auto<00:01:33.890> texture<00:01:34.890> quality

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
preferring it on auto texture quality

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.030 
preferring it on auto texture quality
cat<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.939> low<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.320> make<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.740> medium

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
cat is low you can make it medium

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.340 
cat is low you can make it medium
because<00:01:38.880> it'll<00:01:39.119> run<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> probably<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> same

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
because it'll run it probably the same

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.310 
because it'll run it probably the same
thing<00:01:40.380> maybe<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.159> little<00:01:41.310> bit<00:01:41.520> different<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.990> my

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
thing maybe a little bit different so my

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.719 
thing maybe a little bit different so my
texture<00:01:43.710> quality<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.070> low<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.490> change

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
texture quality is low you can change

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.999 
texture quality is low you can change
all<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:46.350> medium

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
all of this to medium

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.340 
all of this to medium
alright<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:48.450> won't<00:01:48.780> make<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> big

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
alright it it won't make a big

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.090 
alright it it won't make a big
difference

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
difference

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.370 
difference
probably<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.790> frame<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.900> frame<00:01:52.170> or<00:01:52.350> two

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
probably like one frame one frame or two

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.010 
probably like one frame one frame or two
frames<00:01:52.770> that's<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.220> it'll<00:01:54.000> go<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.150> bit<00:01:54.360> lower<00:01:54.810> so

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
frames that's it it'll go a bit lower so

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
can see this is the game it's running

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.800 
can see this is the game it's running
pretty<00:02:25.290> II<00:02:25.640> alright<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:27.060> guess<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:29.010> it's

pretty II alright I guess it's it's
running<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.930> by<00:02:31.470> currently<00:02:32.160> at<00:02:32.569> four<00:02:33.569> forty

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
running it by currently at four forty

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.320 
running it by currently at four forty
frames<00:02:34.410> per<00:02:34.650> second<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.489> will<00:02:35.790> run<00:02:36.120> at

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
frames per second but it will run at

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.750 
frames per second but it will run at
about<00:02:36.390> 20<00:02:36.989> frames<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.440> second<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:39.030> know<00:02:39.930> if<00:02:40.760> you

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
about 20 frames a second you know if you

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.449 
about 20 frames a second you know if you
don't<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.360> you're<00:02:42.510> not<00:02:42.600> recording<00:02:43.049> with<00:02:43.319> fraps

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
don't if you're not recording with fraps

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.100 
don't if you're not recording with fraps
so<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.880> guys<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.180> see<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.420> textures<00:02:46.080> that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
so as you guys can see the textures that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.470 
so as you guys can see the textures that
have<00:02:46.440> not<00:02:46.799> loaded<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.459> that's<00:02:47.970> because<00:02:48.330> my

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
view distance on my draw distance is low

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.050 
view distance on my draw distance is low
so<00:02:50.700> as<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.910> walk<00:02:51.360> towards<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.830> know

mine is probably like the lowest
something<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:48.090> could<00:03:48.269> be<00:03:48.329> pretty<00:03:48.540> much<00:03:48.630> it's

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
something it could be pretty much it's

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.289 
something it could be pretty much it's
pretty<00:03:49.110> low<00:03:49.349> so<00:03:49.620> dipping<00:03:50.489> on<00:03:50.610> depending<00:03:51.180> on

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
pretty low so dipping on depending on

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.660 
pretty low so dipping on depending on
this<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.599> can<00:03:51.810> tell<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.170> if<00:03:52.349> your<00:03:52.650> game<00:03:53.400> will

it's running at 14 frames per second

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.610 
it's running at 14 frames per second
which<00:04:20.160> is<00:04:20.190> pretty<00:04:20.630> decent<00:04:21.630> actually<00:04:22.019> I<00:04:22.320> would

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
which is pretty decent actually I would

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.900 
which is pretty decent actually I would
say<00:04:22.800> it's<00:04:23.100> not<00:04:23.190> bad

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
say it's not bad

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.210 
say it's not bad
but<00:04:24.630> it's<00:04:24.930> definitely<00:04:25.289> not<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.680> best<00:04:25.800> if<00:04:26.100> you

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
but it's definitely not the best if you

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.159 
but it's definitely not the best if you
