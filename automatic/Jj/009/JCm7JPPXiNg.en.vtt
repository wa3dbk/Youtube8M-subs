00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.200 

and<00:01:51.659> you'll<00:01:52.140> notice<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.979> control<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.969> far

that<00:01:58.140> essentially<00:01:59.360> disconnected<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> engine

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that essentially disconnected the engine

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.219 
that essentially disconnected the engine
from<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:02.030> drive<00:02:03.030> wheel<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.960> could

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
from the drive wheel so that you could

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.139 
from the drive wheel so that you could
coast<00:02:04.679> and<00:02:05.090> save<00:02:06.090> fuel

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
coast and save fuel

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.000 
coast and save fuel
eventually<00:02:09.149> they<00:02:12.470> essentially<00:02:13.470> outlawed

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
eventually they essentially outlawed

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.430 
eventually they essentially outlawed
that<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:15.930> was<00:02:16.050> no<00:02:16.230> engine

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
that so because there was no engine

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.089 
that so because there was no engine
braking<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.930> didn't<00:02:18.930> help<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.410> stopping<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
braking so didn't help in stopping the

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.340 
braking so didn't help in stopping the
car
