00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
because it is going to make you go to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.789 
because it is going to make you go to
the<00:01:26.220> bathroom<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.119> would<00:01:27.330> only<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the bathroom I would only like if you

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.960 
the bathroom I would only like if you
were<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> drink<00:01:29.280> something<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.790> this

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
were going to drink something like this

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.840 
were going to drink something like this
I<00:01:30.210> would<00:01:30.240> only<00:01:30.570> drink<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.990> periodically<00:01:31.490> but<00:01:32.490> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
I would only drink it periodically but I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.330 
I would only drink it periodically but I
think<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.540> does<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.829> combine<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.220> with

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
think it does if you combine it with

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.609 
think it does if you combine it with
exercise<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:35.970> diet<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.479> think<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.350> help

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
exercise and diet I think this can help

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.069 
exercise and diet I think this can help
you<00:01:37.890> slim<00:01:38.220> down<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:39.000> particular<00:01:39.180> one<00:01:39.840> I
