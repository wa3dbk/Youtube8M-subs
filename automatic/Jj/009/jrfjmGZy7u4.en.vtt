00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
really good like that's an accurate

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.980 
really good like that's an accurate
that's<00:00:26.640> real<00:00:26.910> close<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.539> color<00:00:27.779> it

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
that's real close to what color it

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.320 
that's real close to what color it
actually<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.590> right<00:00:28.830> there<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.789> noticed

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
actually is right there and I noticed

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.999 
actually is right there and I noticed
the<00:00:30.480> bow<00:00:30.660> wave<00:00:30.929> I'm<00:00:31.199> really<00:00:31.439> proud<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.740> that

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the bow wave I'm really proud of that

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.740 
the bow wave I'm really proud of that
bow<00:00:32.219> wave<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.790> think<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.270> might<00:00:33.450> have<00:00:33.600> got<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
bow wave I think it might have got a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.680 
bow wave I think it might have got a
little<00:00:33.809> bit<00:00:34.140> too<00:00:34.380> much<00:00:34.559> light<00:00:35.430> blue<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
little bit too much light blue on the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.590 
little bit too much light blue on the
under<00:00:36.960> paint<00:00:37.309> I<00:00:38.309> don't<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.180> customer

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
under paint I don't know the customer

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.380 
under paint I don't know the customer
said<00:00:39.809> he<00:00:39.899> liked<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:41.090> guess<00:00:42.090> that's

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
said he liked it so I guess that's

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.150 
said he liked it so I guess that's
pretty<00:00:42.510> much<00:00:42.719> subjective<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.800> only<00:00:43.980> my

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
pretty much subjective it's only my

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.040 
pretty much subjective it's only my
second<00:00:44.610> water<00:00:44.789> diagram<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.690> think<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
second water diagram and so I think I

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.720 
second water diagram and so I think I
did<00:00:46.260> pretty<00:00:46.410> good<00:00:46.530> there's<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.100> evil<00:00:47.489> mast

elsewhere<00:01:39.030> let's<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.810> moving<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.200> towards

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
elsewhere let's see we moving up towards

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.289 
elsewhere let's see we moving up towards
the<00:01:40.619> center<00:01:40.829> there's<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.549> tomahawk

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the center there's the tomahawk

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.880 
the center there's the tomahawk
launchers<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.310> I'm<00:01:44.310> not<00:01:44.490> sure<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:44.909> little

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
launchers and I'm not sure with little

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.109 
launchers and I'm not sure with little
things<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.979> point<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.460> diagonally<00:01:48.090> or

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
things that point up diagonally or

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.730 
things that point up diagonally or
something<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.630> told<00:01:48.810> me<00:01:48.930> once<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.409> forgot

something you told me once but I forgot

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.560 
something you told me once but I forgot
I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.399> there's<00:01:50.579> some<00:01:50.729> sort<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.060> defensive

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
I think there's some sort of defensive

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.620 
I think there's some sort of defensive
weapon

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
weapon

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.750 
weapon
and<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.290> lifeboats<00:01:53.740> here<00:01:54.040> you<00:01:54.160> go<00:01:54.310> up<00:01:54.460> front

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
and the lifeboats here you go up front

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.440 
and the lifeboats here you go up front
where<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:54.910> can<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.420> red<00:01:55.660> life<00:01:55.900> rafts<00:01:57.450> all
