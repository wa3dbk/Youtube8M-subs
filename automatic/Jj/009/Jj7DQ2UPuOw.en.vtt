throwback question the invention of

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.699 
throwback question the invention of
strong<00:02:25.980> side<00:02:26.540> not<00:02:27.540> many<00:02:27.750> people<00:02:27.810> have<00:02:28.319> a

in<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.910> game<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.480> think<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:33.959> really<00:02:34.170> limited<00:02:34.680> to

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
in a game I think it's really limited to

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.150 
in a game I think it's really limited to
strong<00:02:36.239> siding<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.900> maybe<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.620> Gandhi<00:02:38.010> ha

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
strong siding and maybe the Gandhi ha

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.140 
strong siding and maybe the Gandhi ha
tell<00:02:38.760> us<00:02:38.910> about<00:02:39.090> how<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.450> came<00:02:40.290> up<00:02:40.350> with

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
tell us about how you came up with

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.370 
tell us about how you came up with
strong<00:02:42.150> siding<00:02:42.600> because<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.930> doesn't<00:02:43.260> really

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
strong siding because it doesn't really

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.380 
strong siding because it doesn't really
make<00:02:43.620> sense<00:02:43.680> if<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.310> think<00:02:44.370> about<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.120> video

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
make sense if you think about in a video

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.750 
make sense if you think about in a video
game<00:02:45.450> your<00:02:46.290> head<00:02:46.440> kind<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.769> stays<00:02:47.069> still<00:02:47.430> so

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
game your head kind of stays still so

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.340 
game your head kind of stays still so
even<00:02:48.060> though<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.269> look<00:02:48.600> down<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.230> would

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
even though you look down you would

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.259 
even though you look down you would
think<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.739> your<00:02:50.580> head<00:02:50.760> would<00:02:50.910> be<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
think that your head would be in the

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.809 
think that your head would be in the
