today we're gonna show you how to change
the<00:00:10.950> PID<00:00:11.370> settings<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.269> expo<00:00:12.570> bar<00:00:12.750> Brutus

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
the PID settings on the expo bar Brutus

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.740 
the PID settings on the expo bar Brutus
they<00:00:14.280> come<00:00:14.519> set<00:00:14.820> from<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> factory<00:00:15.420> but

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
they come set from the factory but

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.090 
they come set from the factory but
sometimes<00:00:16.109> people<00:00:16.440> give<00:00:16.590> them<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.859> change

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
sometimes people give them to change

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.230 
sometimes people give them to change
them<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.430> they<00:00:17.490> don't<00:00:17.730> know<00:00:17.880> how<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.119> it

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
them and they don't know how to get it

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.480 
them and they don't know how to get it
back<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:18.539> we're<00:00:18.630> gonna<00:00:18.720> go<00:00:18.930> over<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.490> there's

to pee hit the down arrow gets you to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.380 
to pee hit the down arrow gets you to
your<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.420> city<00:01:13.040> integral<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.760> then<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.180> if

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
your I city integral and then you can if

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.609 
your I city integral and then you can if
you<00:01:15.450> want<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.630> change<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.960> push<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.460> or<00:01:17.460> down

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
you want to change you push up or down

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.450 
you want to change you push up or down
if<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.770> don't<00:01:19.799> want<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.040> change<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.310> we're<00:01:20.430> just

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
if we don't want to change it we're just

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.039 
if we don't want to change it we're just
basically<00:01:20.790> verifying<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> point

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
basically verifying it so it's a point

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.630 
basically verifying it so it's a point
zero<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:22.890> what<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.159> want<00:01:25.640> patiently
