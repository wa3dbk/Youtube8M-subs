00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
the ER Kia's mining facility mission

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.810 
the ER Kia's mining facility mission
where<00:00:07.770> were<00:00:07.919> actually<00:00:08.010> send<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.700> this

where were actually send it to this

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.730 
where were actually send it to this
mining<00:00:09.179> facility<00:00:09.570> now<00:00:10.050> few<00:00:10.320> things<00:00:10.559> have

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
mining facility now few things have

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.830 
mining facility now few things have
changed<00:00:11.099> mostly<00:00:11.550> they're<00:00:11.759> using<00:00:12.599> more<00:00:12.809> of

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
changed mostly they're using more of

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.600 
changed mostly they're using more of
these<00:00:13.049> while<00:00:13.530> distressful<00:00:13.950> lighting<00:00:14.460> like

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
these while distressful lighting like

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.460 
these while distressful lighting like
the<00:00:14.639> emergency<00:00:15.389> lighting<00:00:15.630> which<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.080> red

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
the emergency lighting which is red

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.859 
the emergency lighting which is red
right<00:00:16.500> now<00:00:16.680> throughout<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.640> entire<00:00:18.090> mission

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
right now throughout the entire mission

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.019 
right now throughout the entire mission
pretty<00:00:19.199> much<00:00:19.350> but<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> best<00:00:20.310> part<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
pretty much but the best part and the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.160 
pretty much but the best part and the
biggest<00:00:21.330> part<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.630> they<00:00:21.720> actually<00:00:21.810> changed

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
biggest part that they actually changed

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.080 
biggest part that they actually changed
is<00:00:22.500> all<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.980> way<00:00:23.070> down<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.400> pit<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:23.789> once<00:00:23.970> you

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
is all the way down the pit so once you

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.939 
is all the way down the pit so once you
get<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.630> again<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.439> pretty<00:00:25.769> much<00:00:25.890> your

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
get here again it's pretty much your

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.890 
get here again it's pretty much your
standard<00:00:26.400> procedure<00:00:26.880> everything<00:00:27.480> looks<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
standard procedure everything looks the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.109 
standard procedure everything looks the
same<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.410> before<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:29.400> then<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.789> get<00:00:29.970> deeper

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
same as before but then we get deeper

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.550 
same as before but then we get deeper
and<00:00:30.300> deeper<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.720> deeper<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.140> you'll<00:00:31.170> see

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
and deeper and deeper and you'll see

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.530 
and deeper and deeper and you'll see
something<00:00:32.130> pretty<00:00:32.550> cool<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
something pretty cool right here and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.690 
something pretty cool right here and
this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> actual<00:00:34.559> new<00:00:34.890> drilling<00:00:35.250> machine

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
this is the actual new drilling machine

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.190 
this is the actual new drilling machine
I<00:00:35.880> haven't<00:00:36.450> really<00:00:36.540> thought<00:00:37.020> yet

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
I haven't really thought yet

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.630 
I haven't really thought yet
because<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.559> wanted<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> show<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.040> guys<00:00:38.190> like

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
because I wanted to show you guys like

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.330 
because I wanted to show you guys like
how<00:00:39.270> bad<00:00:39.899> as<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.350> turned<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.770> all<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.070> sudden

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
how bad as it turned to all of a sudden

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.060 
how bad as it turned to all of a sudden
this<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> new<00:00:42.629> Dam<00:00:43.290> drilling<00:00:43.770> machine

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
this is the new Dam drilling machine

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.459 
this is the new Dam drilling machine
before<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.550> used<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.969> beetus<00:00:45.629> tiny<00:00:45.930> pool<00:00:46.350> I

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
before it used to be beetus tiny pool I

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.100 
before it used to be beetus tiny pool I
guess<00:00:46.950> placeholder<00:00:47.640> drill<00:00:47.879> or<00:00:48.329> they<00:00:48.809> actually

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
guess placeholder drill or they actually

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.380 
guess placeholder drill or they actually
got<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.379> feedback<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:50.010> okay<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:51.329> was

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
got this feedback like okay so this was

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.510 
got this feedback like okay so this was
a<00:00:51.539> bit<00:00:51.719> underwhelming<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.739> got<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.399> it's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
a bit underwhelming we got here and it's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.310 
a bit underwhelming we got here and it's
like<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.879> tiny<00:00:54.120> thing<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.079> this

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
like this tiny thing but now it's this

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.650 
like this tiny thing but now it's this
so<00:00:55.860> let's<00:00:56.039> actually<00:00:56.160> click<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.879> boom

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so let's actually click it and boom

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.090 
so let's actually click it and boom
there<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:57.930> go<00:00:58.079> i<00:00:58.109> finally<00:00:58.530> got<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> crystals<00:00:59.039> i

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
there we go i finally got the crystals i

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.979 
there we go i finally got the crystals i
need<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> fix<00:00:59.489> my<00:00:59.640> ship's<00:00:59.850> FTL<00:01:00.210> Drive<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.629> should

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
need to fix my ship's FTL Drive I should

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.410 
need to fix my ship's FTL Drive I should
talk<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> sail<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.940> actually<00:01:03.059> turn<00:01:03.270> it

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
talk to sail and we can actually turn it

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
talk to sail and we can actually turn it
off<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.350> which<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.070> pretty

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
off as you can see here which is pretty

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.609 
off as you can see here which is pretty
cool<00:01:05.939> nothing<00:01:06.600> really<00:01:06.720> James<00:01:07.020> because<00:01:07.290> turn

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
cool nothing really James because turn

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.770 
cool nothing really James because turn
it<00:01:07.740> back<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.340> want<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.600> turn

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
it back on if we want to and we do turn

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.330 
it back on if we want to and we do turn
it<00:01:09.930> off<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> light<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.619> slowly<00:01:10.799> gone<00:01:11.100> here

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it off the light is slowly gone here

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.039 
it off the light is slowly gone here
which<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.580> kind<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.850> terrifying<00:01:12.420> gotta<00:01:12.780> say

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
which is kind of terrifying gotta say

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.070 
which is kind of terrifying gotta say
I'm<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> keep<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.270> but<00:01:15.270> it'd<00:01:16.020> be

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
I'm just going to keep it on but it'd be

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
I'm just going to keep it on but it'd be
really<00:01:16.439> cool<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.000> turned<00:01:18.360> it

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
really cool if we like if we turned it

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.320 
really cool if we like if we turned it
off<00:01:18.630> well<00:01:19.009> obviously<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.220> should<00:01:20.790> sort<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
off well obviously that should sort of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.649 
off well obviously that should sort of
impact<00:01:21.689> those<00:01:21.960> creatures<00:01:22.320> escaping<00:01:22.920> from

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
impact those creatures escaping from

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.120 
impact those creatures escaping from
possibly<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> urca's<00:01:25.290> crystals<00:01:25.770> i'm<00:01:25.950> not

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
possibly the urca's crystals i'm not

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
possibly the urca's crystals i'm not
sure<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.610> they're<00:01:26.790> escaping<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.689> but

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
sure if they're escaping from here but

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.609 
sure if they're escaping from here but
obviously<00:01:28.799> something<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.700> earth<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.619> i'm

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
obviously something was on earth and i'm

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.140 
obviously something was on earth and i'm
still<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.130> hoping<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.820> mission

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
still kind of hoping that this mission

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.120 
still kind of hoping that this mission
would<00:01:33.299> end<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> bang<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.890> down

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
would end on a bang like we get down

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
would end on a bang like we get down
here<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.670> there's<00:01:36.210> something<00:01:36.659> crazy

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
here and there's something crazy

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.950 
here and there's something crazy
guarding<00:01:37.590> guarding<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> actual<00:01:38.700> drilling

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
guarding guarding the actual drilling

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.569 
guarding guarding the actual drilling
set<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.079> over<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.350> that'd<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.009> extremely

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
set up over here that'd be extremely

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.399 
set up over here that'd be extremely
cool<00:01:41.729> but<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.180> now<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.930> I'm

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
cool but right now it's just this I'm

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.929 
cool but right now it's just this I'm
really<00:01:43.560> happy<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.189> did<00:01:44.460> choose<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
really happy that they did choose to

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.270 
really happy that they did choose to
change<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.329> by<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> way<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.280> this

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
is way cooler to actually arrive to them
