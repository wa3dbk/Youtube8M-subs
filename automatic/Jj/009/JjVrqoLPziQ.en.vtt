hi<00:00:00.210> this<00:00:00.269> is<00:00:00.480> Brad<00:00:00.780> Smith<00:00:01.020> from<00:00:01.290> beer<00:00:01.439> Smith

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
hi this is Brad Smith from beer Smith

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.560 
hi this is Brad Smith from beer Smith
calm<00:00:02.100> I'll<00:00:02.610> talk<00:00:02.820> with<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:03.000> about<00:00:03.179> some<00:00:03.480> of

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
calm I'll talk with you about some of

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.110 
calm I'll talk with you about some of
the<00:00:03.629> new<00:00:03.750> tools<00:00:03.929> and<00:00:04.290> beer<00:00:04.410> Smith<00:00:04.650> -<00:00:05.120> we're

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
the new tools and beer Smith - we're

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.670 
the new tools and beer Smith - we're
gonna<00:00:06.240> start<00:00:06.480> with<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.600> water<00:00:06.810> profile<00:00:07.350> tool

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
gonna start with a water profile tool

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.970 
gonna start with a water profile tool
and<00:00:08.040> here<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.120> can<00:00:09.269> actually<00:00:09.420> determine

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
and here you can actually determine

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.230 
and here you can actually determine
additions<00:00:10.980> for<00:00:11.099> your<00:00:11.250> water<00:00:11.429> profile<00:00:11.969> and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
additions for your water profile and

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.360 
additions for your water profile and
we've<00:00:12.960> actually<00:00:13.110> added<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.620> lot<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.099> tool

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
we've actually added a lot to this tool

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.640 
we've actually added a lot to this tool
now<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.360> start<00:00:15.599> with<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.750> base<00:00:15.960> profile

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
now you can start with a base profile

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.930 
now you can start with a base profile
for<00:00:16.890> example<00:00:17.279> let's<00:00:17.490> start<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:17.789> some

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
for example let's start with some

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.840 
for example let's start with some
bottled<00:00:18.240> water<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.710> target<00:00:20.039> profile<00:00:20.460> so

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
bottled water and a target profile so

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.580 
bottled water and a target profile so
for<00:00:21.000> example<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.420> want<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.660> make<00:00:21.869> double<00:00:22.500> in

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
for example we want to make double in

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.529 
for example we want to make double in
Ireland<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.189> believe<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.000> or<00:00:24.060> not<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.420> can

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
Ireland and believe it or not you can

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.240 
Ireland and believe it or not you can
push<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> button<00:00:24.930> down<00:00:25.230> here<00:00:25.260> calculate<00:00:26.010> best

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
push the button down here calculate best

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.330 
push the button down here calculate best
additions<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.000> then<00:00:27.660> it'll<00:00:27.840> actually

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
additions and then it'll actually

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.620 
additions and then it'll actually
automatically<00:00:29.340> calculate<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.210> best<00:00:30.390> amount

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
automatically calculate the best amount

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.959 
automatically calculate the best amount
of<00:00:30.779> water<00:00:30.990> additions<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.619> add<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.579> reach<00:00:32.759> this

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
of water additions to add to reach this

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.240 
of water additions to add to reach this
target<00:00:33.230> profile<00:00:34.230> starting<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:34.770> US<00:00:34.890> bottled

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
target profile starting with US bottled

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.430 
target profile starting with US bottled
water<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.570> also<00:00:36.690> go<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.200> dilute

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
water and you can also go in and dilute

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.260 
water and you can also go in and dilute
it<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.710> well<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.579> pretty<00:00:39.210> powerful

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it as well so this is a pretty powerful

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.139 
it as well so this is a pretty powerful
stuff<00:00:39.989> here<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.500> we've<00:00:40.620> added<00:00:40.940> basically<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
stuff here that we've added basically a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.369 
stuff here that we've added basically a
single<00:00:42.510> button<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.899> allows<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
single button that allows you to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.880 
single button that allows you to
calculate<00:00:43.590> your<00:00:43.980> water<00:00:44.160> additions<00:00:45.890> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
calculate your water additions the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.860 
calculate your water additions the
infusion<00:00:47.190> tool<00:00:47.579> actually<00:00:48.120> does<00:00:48.570> all<00:00:48.690> your

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
infusion tool actually does all your

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.209 
infusion tool actually does all your
calculations<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.649> you're<00:00:49.800> doing<00:00:50.010> mash

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
calculations if you're doing mash

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.770 
calculations if you're doing mash
infusions<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.210> example<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.660> can

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
infusions so for example you can

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.209 
infusions so for example you can
calculate<00:00:51.930> either<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.559> initial<00:00:52.949> strike

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
calculate either the initial strike

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.520 
calculate either the initial strike
water<00:00:53.399> needed<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.390> calculate<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
water needed or you can calculate the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.340 
water needed or you can calculate the
temperature<00:00:55.800> need<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> given<00:00:56.820> strike<00:00:57.420> I'm

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
temperature need for a given strike I'm

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.319 
temperature need for a given strike I'm
sorry<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.649> given<00:00:58.920> step<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.879> if<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.030> want<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> go

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
sorry a given step so if you want to go

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.819 
sorry a given step so if you want to go
from<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.539> step<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> another<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.649> type

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
from one step to another you just type

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770 
from one step to another you just type
in<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> parameters<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.600> it'll

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
in the parameters here and it'll

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.179 
in the parameters here and it'll
estimate<00:01:04.199> how<00:01:04.350> much<00:01:04.530> water<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.890> need<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> add

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
estimate how much water you need to add

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.250 
estimate how much water you need to add
and<00:01:05.610> what<00:01:06.119> temperature<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.689> water<00:01:06.869> needs<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and what temperature that water needs to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.480 
and what temperature that water needs to
be<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.689> decoction<00:01:09.689> volume<00:01:10.260> tool<00:01:10.560> allows

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
be at the decoction volume tool allows

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.030 
be at the decoction volume tool allows
you<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.880> two<00:01:11.970> Coxon's<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.229> gives<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
you to do two Coxon's so it gives you is

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.859 
you to do two Coxon's so it gives you is
given<00:01:14.369> an<00:01:14.430> initial<00:01:14.850> step<00:01:15.030> temperature<00:01:15.570> and

can<00:01:19.890> actually<00:01:20.189> calculate<00:01:20.369> how<00:01:20.790> much<00:01:20.970> volume

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
can actually calculate how much volume

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.499 
can actually calculate how much volume
you<00:01:21.479> need<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.720> decocked<00:01:23.000> there's<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.060> mash<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
you need to decocked there's a mash of

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.810 
you need to decocked there's a mash of
just<00:01:24.750> tool<00:01:24.960> here<00:01:25.500> what<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.310> allows<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
just tool here what that allows you to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.880 
just tool here what that allows you to
do<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.330> if<00:01:27.570> your<00:01:27.750> mass<00:01:28.110> strike<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> little

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
do is if your mass strike is a little

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.800 
do is if your mass strike is a little
bit<00:01:28.979> off<00:01:29.130> let's<00:01:29.460> say<00:01:29.610> you're<00:01:29.880> off<00:01:30.299> by<00:01:30.540> four

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
bit off let's say you're off by four

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.359 
bit off let's say you're off by four
degrees<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.380> your<00:01:31.470> mash<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.070> actually

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
degrees and your mash you can actually

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.230 
degrees and your mash you can actually
enter<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.610> temperatures<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
enter the temperatures and the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.999 
enter the temperatures and the
parameters<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.439> it'll<00:01:34.829> calculate

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
parameters here and it'll calculate

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
parameters here and it'll calculate
either<00:01:35.400> how<00:01:35.670> much<00:01:35.850> boiling<00:01:36.479> water<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.810> need

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
either how much boiling water you need

are integrated directly into the recipe
tools<00:04:55.700> recipe<00:04:56.700> system<00:04:57.150> so<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.419> don't

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
tools recipe system so you don't

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.700

necessarily use you have to use them
separately<00:04:58.950> but<00:04:59.310> but<00:04:59.820> doing<00:05:00.060> a<00:05:00.120> quick

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
separately but but doing a quick

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.050 
separately but but doing a quick
calculation<00:05:00.930> is<00:05:01.050> quite<00:05:01.290> handy<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:02.030> finally<00:05:03.030> I

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
calculation is quite handy and finally I

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.129 
calculation is quite handy and finally I
