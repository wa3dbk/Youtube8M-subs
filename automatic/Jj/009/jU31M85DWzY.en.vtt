was really pumped at this point I I
continued<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.489> do<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.850> noob<00:02:36.450> tube<00:02:36.690> see<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
continued to do the noob tube see if I

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.449 
continued to do the noob tube see if I
you<00:02:37.050> get<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.350> back-to-back<00:02:37.890> quads<00:02:38.220> or

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
something like that but then right here

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.390 
something like that but then right here
I<00:02:40.350> calling<00:02:40.650> my<00:02:40.770> air<00:02:40.920> strike<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.489> guess<00:02:42.420> what

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
I calling my air strike and guess what

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.250 
I calling my air strike and guess what
what<00:02:44.400> do<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.520> get<00:02:44.700> right<00:02:44.850> here<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.390> not<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.630> quad

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
what do I get right here it's not a quad

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.650 
what do I get right here it's not a quad
but<00:02:46.620> it's<00:02:46.770> it's<00:02:47.100> pretty<00:02:47.340> good<00:02:47.459> I'd<00:02:48.390> say<00:02:48.630> a

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
but it's it's pretty good I'd say a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.949 
but it's it's pretty good I'd say a
triple<00:02:49.110> right<00:02:49.890> after<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> quad<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:50.730> uh<00:02:50.780> not<00:02:51.780> too

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
triple right after a quad is uh not too
