00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
what kind of protein I have in my cup if

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.150 
what kind of protein I have in my cup if
you<00:00:39.149> said<00:00:39.390> whey<00:00:39.600> protein<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.559> one-third

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.100 
correct what does that mean one-third
that<00:00:46.950> means<00:00:47.160> i<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.430> three<00:00:47.760> proteins<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:49.050> i

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
that means i have three proteins that i
