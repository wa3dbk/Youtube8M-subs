00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:14.150
 pulsar quantum hd 38 with the newest model 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.210
 thermal imager from the Belarusian company 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.910
 pulsar became more accessible due to 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.119
 component optimization and upgrades 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.739
 software letters hd in 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.739
 titles say that this 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:31.220
 thermal imager with high-frequency matrix with 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:33.920
 frame refresh rate of 30 hertz it 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.989
 weight is only 350 grams and it is secure 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.469
 protected from damage when falling 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.839
 because carbon fiber is stronger than steel without 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.789
 thermal imager shape and size of its body 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.699
 make it convenient to keep it in one 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.800
 arm and partly gumming 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.320
 helps you hold securely

 thermal imager detector matrix with 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.429
 384 by 288 pixel resolution will help 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.649
 you see more details and 2 times 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.230
 optical and digital zoom will bring closer

 features of your vision thermal imager 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 powered by four finger batteries 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.890
 on one charge which he is capable 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.890
 work up to five and a half hours 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.820
 wide-angle lens device 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.410
 provides a large field of view and its 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.510
 luminosity says that he 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.170
 catches maximum thermal radiation 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.170
 and not 1 heat beam will be left out 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.760
 view internal lens focus 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.070
 wheel spin 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.660
 allows right while watching 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.660
 achieve the best image quality 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.940
 adjusting contrast and total brightness 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.090
 the rest is done with 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.140
 special wheel n-coder 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.770

 thermal imager 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.770
 under different conditions of observation in 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.260
 thermal imagers pulsar quantum hd 38 with 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.420
 created three modes of observation mode 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.270
 Recognition provides improved 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.000
 detailing warm objects and facilitates 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.950
 their detection due to the high frequency 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.800
