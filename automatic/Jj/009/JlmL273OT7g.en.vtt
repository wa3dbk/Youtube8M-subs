00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.740
 Chapter 6 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.740
 after this Jesus went to the other side 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.900
 of the sea of galilea the one of tiberias and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.780
 there was still a great crowd because they saw the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.309
 signs he made in the sick 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.369
 then Jesus went up a mountain and he 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.030
 he sat there with his disciples and he was 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.860
 near the easter the feast of the Jews 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.170
 when Jesus lifted his eyes and saw that 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.930
 he had come to him great multitude said to 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.450
 where will we buy bread so that 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.309
 eat these but this said for 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.760
 prove him because he knew what he had to 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.710
 make felipe he answered two hundred 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.380
 pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.230
 each one of them took a little 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.450
 one of his disciples andré brother of 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.220
 Simon Pedro told him here is a 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.370
 boy who has five barley loaves 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.970
 and two more minnows that is this for 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.430
 so many then jesus said do 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.920
 lay people down and there was a lot of grass 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.920
 in that place and they reclined as the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.750
 number of five thousand men and he took Jesus 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.510
 those loaves and having given thanks 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.190
 He distributed them among the disciples and 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.950
 disciples among those who were 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.680
 also reclined from the fish how much 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.170
 they wanted and when they had satiated 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.060
 he told his disciples to pick up the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.150
 pieces that were left over so that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.610
 lose nothing they picked up then and they filled 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.350
 twelve baskets of pieces that of the five 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.840
 barley loaves left over to those who 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.330
 they had eaten those men then 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.880
 seeing the sign that Jesus had made 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.460
 they said this is truly the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.440
 prophet who was to come to the world but 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.380
 understanding Jesus they were going to come for 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.130
 seize him and make him king he went back to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.500
 retreat to the mountain alone 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.719
 at nightfall his disciples descended 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.719
 to the sea and entering a boat were going 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.610
 crossing the sea ​​towards capernaum I was 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.430
 already dark and jesus had not come to 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.159
 them and the sea rose with a great 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.610
 wind that was blowing when they had rowed 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.470
 as 25 or 30 stadia gave Jesus that 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.409
 He walked on the sea and approached the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.280
 boat and they were afraid more they were told 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.620
 I am not afraid of them then with 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.130
 They welcomed him in the boat which 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.260
 He arrived immediately at the land where they were going 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.000
 the next day the people who were at 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.580
 Another side of the sea saw that there was no 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.500
 there was more than just one boat and that 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.660
 Jesus had not entered into it with his 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.569
 disciples but that these were gone 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.819
 alone but other boats had arrived 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.440
 of tiberias next to the place where they had 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.079
 eaten the bread after having given 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.360
 thank you sir when he saw then the 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.790
 people that Jesus was not there or his 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.000
 disciples entered the boats and 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.769
 they went to capernaum looking for jesus and 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.819
 finding him across the sea will 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.130
 they said 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.860
 ravi when you arrived here 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.290
 Jesus answered and told them of certain 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.360
 I tell you that you are looking for me, not because 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.540
 you have seen the signs but because 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.430
 ate and if the bread is towards estuis 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.900
 working for the food that perishes but 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.450
 for the food that eternal life 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.320
 that the son of man remains 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.540
 give him hath God the Father said 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.930
 Then they told him we should do 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.030
 to implement God's works 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.160
 Jesus answered and told them this is the 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.550
 God's work that you believe in the one he has 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.500
 sent him then what signal 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.740
 so you do so we can see if you 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.660
 we create what work you do our parents 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.910
 they ate the manna in the desert as 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.420
 it is written bread from heaven gave them to 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.330
 eat and jesus told them of certain 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.490
 true, I tell you, he gave us Moses bread 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.160
 heaven plus my father gives you the true 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.260
 bread from heaven because the bread of God is 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.550
 the one who came down from heaven and gives life 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.630
 to the world 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.480
 they said sir, always give us this bread 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.000
 Jesus told them I am the bread of life the 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.600
 that comes to me will never be hungry and the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.580
 that in me he believes he will not thirst anymore 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.430
 I told you that although you have seen me 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.520
 you do not believe everything the father gives me 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.950
 will come to me and the one that comes to me does not 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.560
 I miss out because I have descended from 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.080
 heaven not to do my will but the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.600
 will of the one who sent me and this is the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.030
 will of the father who sent me that 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.370
 of everything that he gave me, do not lose 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.130
 nothing but to resurrect it in the day 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.410
 last and this is the will of the one who 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.260
 has sent me that everyone who sees the 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.040
 son and believe in him have eternal life and I 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.710
 I will resurrect him in the last day 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.650
 they murmured then of the Jews because 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.130
 I had said I am the bread that came down 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.770
 of heaven and they said is not this jesus the 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.950
 son of joseph whose father and mother we 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.100
 we know how it says this from heaven 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.070
 has descended Jesus answered and told them 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.900
 JCE mutters not among you any 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.510
 can come to me if the father that I 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.180
 sent I did not bring him and I will resurrect him 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.790
 in the last day written is in the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.300
 prophets and they will all be taught by 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.000
 god so everyone who heard the father 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.890
 and learned from him comes to me not that 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.870
 some have seen the father but that 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.380
 that came from god this one has seen the father 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.650
 Of certain truth I tell you who believes 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.410
 in me he has eternal life I am the bread of 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.990
 your fathers ate the manna in 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.120
 the desert and they died this is the bread 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.520
 that descends from heaven so that the one who 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.860
 of him eat do not die 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.229
 I am the living bread that came down from 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.020
 heaven if anyone ate of this bread 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:41.020
 will live forever and the bread that I will give 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.379
 It is my flesh which I will give for life 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.990
 of the world then the Jews would contend 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:50.349
 each other saying how can this one give us 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.169
 to eat his meat Jesus told them of 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:55.479
 True, I tell you if you do not eat the 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:59.050
 meat of the man's son and you drink his 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:01.270
 blood you do not have life in you who 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.909
 eat my flesh and drink my blood has 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.699
 eternal life and I will raise him up in the day 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:09.300
 last because my flesh is true 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:12.729
 food and my blood is real drink 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:16.270
 he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood in 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:18.930
 It remains me and I in him as he sent me 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.340
 living father and I live for the father 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.069
 likewise he who eats me also 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.380
 will live for me this is the bread that 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.930
 He came down from heaven not like your 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.860
 parents ate the manna and died the 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.259
 who eats of this bread will live eternally 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.639
 these things said in the synagogue 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.530
 teaching in capernaum 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.770
 when many of his disciples heard it 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.919
 they said hard is this word who the 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.900
 can hear knowing Jesus in himself that 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.780
 his disciples murmured about this 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.880
 said these offend 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.730
 for if you had the son of man 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.130
 go up to where the spirit was first 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.590
 He is the one who gives life to the flesh for nothing 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:03.160
 take advantage of the words that I have 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:05.800
 spoken are spirit and they are life but there 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.050
 some of you who do not believe because 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.150
 Jesus knew from the beginning who 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.940
 they were the ones who did not believe and who had 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.130
 to deliver and said that's why I told you 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.950
 that none can come to me if I do not 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.840
 it was inherited from the father since then 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:23.169
 many of his disciples went back 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:26.020
 and they were not walking with him he said then 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:28.690
 Jesus to the twelve you will perhaps go 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:32.380
 you also answered him Simon 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:35.050
 pedro sir who will we go to you 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.540
 words of eternal life and we have 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.030
 believed and we know that you are the Christ 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:43.510
 the son of the living god 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:46.120
 Jesus answered them I have not chosen you 

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:49.450
 you twelve and one of you is 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.820
 Devil spoke of Judas Iscariot son 

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:55.950
 of Simon because this was the one that was going to 

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.950
 deliver and was one of the twelve
