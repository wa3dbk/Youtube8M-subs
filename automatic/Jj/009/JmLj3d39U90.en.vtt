hi everyone its Danny and today I

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.579 
hi everyone its Danny and today I

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
thought I'd film a video on sort of my

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.700 
thought I'd film a video on sort of my
take<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.520> 5<00:00:05.850> product<00:00:06.210> face<00:00:06.480> because<00:00:07.410> I

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
take of the 5 product face because I

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.830 
take of the 5 product face because I
never<00:00:08.519> thought<00:00:08.970> about<00:00:09.030> doing<00:00:09.210> this<00:00:09.450> video

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
never thought about doing this video

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.410 
never thought about doing this video
because<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.590> always<00:00:11.429> just<00:00:11.700> use<00:00:11.940> quite<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> lot<00:00:12.330> of

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
because I always just use quite a lot of

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.640 
because I always just use quite a lot of
products<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.929> thought<00:00:13.139> it'd<00:00:13.290> be<00:00:13.320> really

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
products and I thought it'd be really

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.680 
products and I thought it'd be really
unrealistic<00:00:14.099> for<00:00:14.429> me<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.730> try<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:14.969> only<00:00:15.240> use<00:00:15.389> 5

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
unrealistic for me to try and only use 5

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.349

but recently I've been doing my makeup a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.810 
but recently I've been doing my makeup a
lot<00:00:18.480> more<00:00:18.660> simply<00:00:19.140> just<00:00:19.500> like<00:00:19.800> day-to-day<00:00:20.760> so

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
lot more simply just like day-to-day so

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.519

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
that I can just have a little bit of

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.679 
that I can just have a little bit of
makeup<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.430> not<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.970> spend<00:00:24.180> ages<00:00:24.570> on

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
products or 7 products but I thought for

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.669 
products or 7 products but I thought for

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
that I like to use so without further

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.340

really my kind of color for the lips I

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.640 
really my kind of color for the lips I
don't<00:05:00.930> know<00:05:01.050> I<00:05:01.080> think<00:05:01.200> it<00:05:01.440> looks<00:05:01.560> very

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
don't know I think it looks very

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.010 
don't know I think it looks very
different<00:05:01.980> on<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.490> lips<00:05:02.670> too<00:05:02.940> on<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.360> cheeks

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
different on the lips too on the cheeks

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.170 
different on the lips too on the cheeks
it<00:05:04.290> looks<00:05:04.470> much<00:05:04.650> lighter<00:05:04.980> on<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.250> lips<00:05:05.550> so<00:05:06.150> I

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
it looks much lighter on the lips so I

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.020 
it looks much lighter on the lips so I
tend<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:06.960> just<00:05:07.320> wear<00:05:08.100> this<00:05:08.490> look<00:05:08.730> without

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
tend to just wear this look without

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.910 
tend to just wear this look without
anything<00:05:09.510> on<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.660> lips<00:05:09.840> just<00:05:10.020> off<00:05:10.380> with<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.680> bit
