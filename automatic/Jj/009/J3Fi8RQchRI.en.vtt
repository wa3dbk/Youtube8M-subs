going<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:28.060> be<00:04:28.120> adding<00:04:28.210> new<00:04:28.450> ones<00:04:28.480> in<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:28.930> that

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
going to be adding new ones in is that

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.510 
going to be adding new ones in is that
because<00:04:29.440> there's<00:04:29.590> going<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.860> be<00:04:29.889> a<00:04:29.950> tab<00:04:30.160> for<00:04:30.190> it

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
because there's going to be a tab for it

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.050 
because there's going to be a tab for it
but<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.150> have<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.300> few<00:04:31.480> different<00:04:31.540> maps<00:04:33.060> and

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
but you have a few different maps and

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.090 
but you have a few different maps and
you<00:04:34.180> have<00:04:34.300> six<00:04:34.630> different<00:04:34.750> maps<00:04:35.110> different

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
that it feels like the AI is actually

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:29.519 
that it feels like the AI is actually
fighting<00:06:28.870> against

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:29.529 
fighting against

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.439
