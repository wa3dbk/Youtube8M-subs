00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
stuff so what we do is we experiment

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.850 
stuff so what we do is we experiment
with<00:02:23.980> getting<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.459> dog<00:02:24.670> by<00:02:25.510> luring<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:26.650> do

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
with getting the dog by luring to do

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.920 
with getting the dog by luring to do
each<00:02:27.129> of<00:02:27.400> these<00:02:27.519> positions<00:02:27.790> physically<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
each of these positions physically the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.229 
each of these positions physically the
way<00:02:29.019> we<00:02:29.200> want<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.769> what<00:02:30.640> we<00:02:30.670> would<00:02:30.879> ideally

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
way we want and what we would ideally

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.180 
way we want and what we would ideally
like<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.780> for<00:02:31.930> my<00:02:32.019> dog<00:02:32.200> should<00:02:32.440> be<00:02:32.530> able<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.800> sit

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
like is for my dog should be able to sit

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.770 
like is for my dog should be able to sit
down<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.550> stand<00:02:33.730> without<00:02:34.209> moving<00:02:34.510> from<00:02:34.599> the

down and stand without moving from the
same<00:02:34.959> spot<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.739> their<00:02:35.890> shoulder<00:02:36.340> stays<00:02:36.670> on<00:02:36.879> the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
same spot so their shoulder stays on the

same spot so their shoulder stays on the
same<00:02:37.269> plane<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:39.099> whole<00:02:39.280> time<00:02:39.550> whether<00:02:40.090> they

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
same plane the whole time whether they

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.930

going<00:03:13.659> to<00:03:13.719> happen<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:14.049> they're<00:03:14.170> going<00:03:14.290> to

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
going to happen is they're going to

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.199 
going to happen is they're going to
anticipate<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.859> do<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.159> 10<00:03:15.340> or<00:03:15.459> 15<00:03:15.790> times<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.150> a

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
anticipate I do that 10 or 15 times in a

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.459 
anticipate I do that 10 or 15 times in a
row<00:03:16.359> and<00:03:16.629> then<00:03:16.870> I'm<00:03:16.959> going<00:03:17.079> to<00:03:17.109> say<00:03:17.230> stand

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:17.469 
row and then I'm going to say stand

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.289 
row and then I'm going to say stand
they're<00:03:17.709> going<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:17.890> pop<00:03:18.099> up<00:03:18.280> before<00:03:18.849> I<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.269> a

them a party great right so now they

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.080 
them a party great right so now they
figure<00:03:23.859> out<00:03:23.980> oh<00:03:24.099> that's<00:03:24.430> how<00:03:24.579> you<00:03:24.609> get<00:03:24.879> them

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
figure out oh that's how you get them

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.339 
figure out oh that's how you get them
the<00:03:25.239> sound<00:03:25.629> that<00:03:25.810> comes<00:03:25.900> out<00:03:26.049> of<00:03:26.139> my<00:03:26.200> mouth

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
the sound that comes out of my mouth

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.890 
the sound that comes out of my mouth
predicts<00:03:26.859> this<00:03:27.069> and<00:03:27.340> we<00:03:27.849> use<00:03:27.969> anticipation<00:03:28.569> on

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
predicts this and we use anticipation on

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.020 
predicts this and we use anticipation on
the<00:03:29.079> dogs<00:03:29.260> part<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.829> get<00:03:29.980> them<00:03:30.099> to<00:03:30.189> do<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.340> right

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
the dogs part to get them to do it right

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.789 
the dogs part to get them to do it right
on<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.239> hip<00:03:31.389> so<00:03:31.780> be<00:03:31.900> careful<00:03:32.290> about<00:03:32.409> luring

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
on the hip so be careful about luring

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.709 
on the hip so be careful about luring
you're<00:03:33.370> pushing<00:03:33.670> your<00:03:33.790> hand<00:03:33.939> at<00:03:34.180> her<00:03:34.359> when<00:03:34.629> you

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:34.719 
you're pushing your hand at her when you

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.629 
you're pushing your hand at her when you
do<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.959> sit<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.769> problem<00:03:36.099> with<00:03:36.189> that<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.430> the

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
do the sit the problem with that is the

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.190 
do the sit the problem with that is the
dog<00:03:36.760> rocks<00:03:37.060> backwards<00:03:37.599> under<00:03:37.810> their<00:03:37.930> rear<00:03:38.049> end

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
dog rocks backwards under their rear end

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.970 
dog rocks backwards under their rear end
right<00:03:38.319> so<00:03:38.439> one<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.709> ways<00:03:38.799> that<00:03:38.919> people

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
right so one of the ways that people

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.220 
right so one of the ways that people
frequently<00:03:39.310> teach<00:03:39.760> sitting<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:40.359> what<00:03:41.109> you

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
frequently teach sitting is what you

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.330 
frequently teach sitting is what you

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
were doing she pushes her hand out and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.039 
were doing she pushes her hand out and
she<00:03:42.489> lures<00:03:42.849> back<00:03:43.239> over<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.569> dog's<00:03:43.720> head<00:03:43.900> like

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
she lures back over the dog's head like

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.929 
she lures back over the dog's head like
this<00:03:44.349> right<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.040> when<00:03:45.159> she<00:03:45.280> goes<00:03:45.400> back<00:03:45.430> like

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
this right so when she goes back like

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.059 
this right so when she goes back like
