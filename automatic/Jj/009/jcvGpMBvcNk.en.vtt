00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
that's about three feet by one feet so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.800

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.920 
will last a lifetime
I<00:02:01.950> think<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.030> good<00:02:03.180> investment<00:02:03.509> because

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
I think it's a good investment because

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.990 
I think it's a good investment because
you<00:02:04.530> know<00:02:05.310> they're<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.640> hold<00:02:05.820> their

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
you know they're going to hold their

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.320 
you know they're going to hold their
value<00:02:06.030> over<00:02:06.420> time<00:02:07.280> any<00:02:08.280> time<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.030> could<00:02:09.119> put

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
value over time any time you could put

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.540 
value over time any time you could put
something<00:02:09.660> into<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.899> business<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.530> get<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
something into a business and get it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.520 
something into a business and get it
back<00:02:11.700> later<00:02:11.989> that's<00:02:12.989> all

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
back later that's all

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.680 
back later that's all
better<00:02:13.740> than<00:02:13.980> putting<00:02:14.880> money<00:02:15.120> into<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.569> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
better than putting money into it and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.020 
better than putting money into it and
not<00:02:16.200> getting<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.590> back<00:02:16.620> later<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.310> those<00:02:17.940> are

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
not getting it back later so those are

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.020 
not getting it back later so those are
my<00:02:18.180> thoughts<00:02:18.360> behind<00:02:18.750> that
