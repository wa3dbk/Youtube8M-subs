00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
weighed see how much weight it takes for

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.120 
weighed see how much weight it takes for
the<00:01:36.800> key<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.400> go<00:01:37.580> down<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.950> then<00:01:39.950> there's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
the key to go down and then there's

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.770 
the key to go down and then there's
another<00:01:40.280> weight<00:01:40.670> is<00:01:40.909> how<00:01:41.300> much<00:01:41.480> would<00:01:41.659> you

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
another weight is how much would you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.870 
another weight is how much would you
have<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:42.050> take<00:01:42.080> off<00:01:42.470> before<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.070> comes<00:01:43.340> back<00:01:43.460> up

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
have to take off before it comes back up

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.180 
have to take off before it comes back up
and<00:01:44.120> that<00:01:44.720> relationship<00:01:45.260> is<00:01:45.440> very<00:01:45.680> important

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
and that relationship is very important

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.340 
and that relationship is very important
some<00:01:46.490> can<00:01:46.670> go<00:01:46.790> down<00:01:46.970> quickly<00:01:47.270> but<00:01:47.600> up<00:01:47.780> slowly

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
some can go down quickly but up slowly

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.380 
some can go down quickly but up slowly
otherwise<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:49.490> go<00:01:49.580> down<00:01:49.729> slowly<00:01:50.030> enough

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
otherwise and go down slowly enough

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.070 
otherwise and go down slowly enough
quickly<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.350> balance<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:52.040> very<00:01:52.100> important

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
quickly the balance is very important

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.750 
quickly the balance is very important
there<00:01:54.080> are<00:01:54.110> personal<00:01:54.650> preferences<00:01:55.190> involved

and we just do it on a piano that's not
enough<00:02:38.740> but<00:02:39.740> we<00:02:39.800> have<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.130> put<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.430> pedal<00:02:40.760> down

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
enough but we have to put the pedal down

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.610 
enough but we have to put the pedal down
on<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.360> piano<00:02:41.630> if<00:02:41.780> we're<00:02:41.930> doing<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.290> actually

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
on the piano if we're doing it actually

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.650 
on the piano if we're doing it actually
because<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:42.830> lifts<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.400> weight<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:44.510> the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
because that lifts the weight of the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.250 
because that lifts the weight of the
dampers<00:02:45.110> off<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:46.190> lifts<00:02:46.720> as<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.960> damper

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
dampers off that lifts as the damper

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.700 
dampers off that lifts as the damper
pedal<00:02:48.290> is<00:02:48.680> pressed<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.900> then<00:02:53.710> abnormally

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
pedal is pressed and then abnormally

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.350 
pedal is pressed and then abnormally
heavy<00:02:54.920> but<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.430> not<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.610> real<00:02:55.910> pan<00:02:56.150> on

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
heavy but this is not a real pan on

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:11.560 
heavy but this is not a real pan on
there<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:10.400> would<00:03:10.490> be<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.640> very<00:03:10.820> heavy<00:03:11.090> action

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
there that would be a very heavy action

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.200 
there that would be a very heavy action
these<00:03:12.410> are<00:03:12.950> known<00:03:13.160> as<00:03:13.190> key<00:03:14.530> bushings<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
these are known as key bushings on the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.460 
these are known as key bushings on the
front<00:03:17.480> rail<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.670> there<00:03:19.670> is<00:03:19.820> a<00:03:20.470> different

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
front rail and there is a different

amounts<00:03:21.860> for<00:03:22.040> each<00:03:22.190> key<00:03:22.900> in<00:03:23.900> order<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.380> get<00:03:24.530> the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
amounts for each key in order to get the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.030 
amounts for each key in order to get the
right<00:03:24.920> key<00:03:25.550> depth<00:03:26.120> we<00:03:27.080> can<00:03:27.110> measure<00:03:27.440> that<00:03:27.620> with

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
right key depth we can measure that with

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.890 
right key depth we can measure that with
a<00:03:28.910> little<00:03:29.150> device<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:30.880> by<00:03:31.880> measuring<00:03:32.750> it

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
a little device that by measuring it

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.990 
a little device that by measuring it
next<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.290> adjacent<00:03:33.560> key<00:03:34.100> we<00:03:34.400> can<00:03:34.580> tell<00:03:34.820> if

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
next to the adjacent key we can tell if

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.380 
next to the adjacent key we can tell if
it's<00:03:35.150> even<00:03:35.780> or<00:03:36.020> too<00:03:36.980> deep<00:03:37.250> or<00:03:37.790> not<00:03:38.000> deep<00:03:38.240> enough

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
it's even or too deep or not deep enough

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.180 
it's even or too deep or not deep enough
and<00:03:38.960> then<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.230> can<00:03:39.320> be<00:03:39.380> adjusted<00:03:39.830> by<00:03:39.950> how<00:03:40.130> many

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
and then it can be adjusted by how many

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.120 
and then it can be adjusted by how many
types<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.360> washers<00:03:41.930> we<00:03:42.350> can<00:03:42.500> put<00:03:42.710> underneath

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
types of washers we can put underneath

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.020 
types of washers we can put underneath
that<00:03:43.400> key<00:03:43.990> after<00:03:44.990> a<00:03:45.290> while<00:03:45.530> with<00:03:46.460> compression

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
that key after a while with compression

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.520 
that key after a while with compression
of<00:03:47.180> these<00:03:47.330> cells<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.930> are<00:03:48.170> going<00:03:48.440> to

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
of these cells that are going to

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.170 
of these cells that are going to
typically<00:03:48.860> go<00:03:49.100> deeper<00:03:49.730> than<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:50.030> would

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
typically go deeper than you would

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.920 
typically go deeper than you would
desire<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.620> then<00:03:51.940> later<00:03:52.940> on<00:03:53.240> in<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.630> life<00:03:53.780> of

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
desire so then later on in the life of

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.570 
desire so then later on in the life of
the<00:03:54.020> piano<00:03:54.260> it's<00:03:54.590> good<00:03:54.770> for<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:54.980> technician

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
the piano it's good for the technician

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.540 
the piano it's good for the technician
to<00:03:56.240> add<00:03:56.510> more<00:03:57.080> of<00:03:57.230> these<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.860> bring<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.310> key

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
to add more of these and bring the key

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.570 
to add more of these and bring the key
back<00:03:59.300> up<00:03:59.510> so<00:04:00.410> you<00:04:00.470> want<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.740> very<00:04:00.950> even<00:04:01.430> and

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
back up so you want the very even and

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.230 
back up so you want the very even and
just<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:02.480> right<00:04:02.510> amount<00:04:02.660> of<00:04:03.050> depth
