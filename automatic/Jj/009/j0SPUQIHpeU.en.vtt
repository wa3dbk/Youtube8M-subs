00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.020

 we can manage our ship 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.550
 maritime to fight with other ships 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.770
 of this style and see who has more 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.690
 big the bow there is a lot of modality of 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.670
 armament boats very varied and simple 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.080
 fact of being able to get more and more 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.810
 more improvements will leave you completely 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.000
 hooked on what was said by loving more money 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.160
 in position number 4 we have a dogus 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.560
 Look, I recommended games, I hope 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.880
 but a game egg is recommended and 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.650
 one of the games that I played in my 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.820
 netbook when I did not have my usual pc and 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.220
 What else has had me hooked 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.159
 A lot of time has passed me fuck is 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.810
 that two buses joins rpg better than where 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.580
 has any kind of novelty you know but 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.960
 the charm that this game has is its 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.850
 aesthetic you do not have to look more than 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.560
 other than its aesthetic for many 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.320
 It may seem a bit like the fact 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.760
 play in 2d a m today but good to me 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.680
 I think it's very chachi, that's why it's in 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.660
 this post your combat system is a 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.630
 so weird but it's super funny and 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.220
 sincerely, I do not give you the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.110
 game with which you are going to make a 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.400
 competitive player there is milk but 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.250
 yes I give you hours and hours of 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.680
 totally free fun yes as 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.840
 You can guess the free, not the following 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.340
 that is, it is very free or it is so free 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.259
 which is up for free 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.330
 you know blog in the post number 3 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.310
 we have the sex and fidget this is a 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.040
 so quirky ok it 's browser like that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.870
 do not panic, we can 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.209
 classify it as a m 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.040
 but good, your main mission is that you 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.660
 art is to say do missions do 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.459
 missions to get objects and 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.200
 stay even more is the typical game quoted 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.550
 you have open in a separate tab 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.110
 and when you get bored you get a couple of 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.540
 missions you get a couple of objects and 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.040
 outside do not do as I do that in less than 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.719
 one month it went up to level 100 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.610
 a ticket that you flip waiting for there 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.049
 missions but good has a very style 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.730
 similar to the world of warcraft and 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.129
 sincerely the gameplay that you have of 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.900
 background says everything all for the sex and 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.430
 Fidget entertained me and I think that you 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.099
 can entertain you in the post 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.720
 number 2 we have a dead island epidemic 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.459
 I'm going to be honest the hack and slash 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.849
 I have never been noticed 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.500
 fuck is this is dead island zombies 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.510
 on a tropical island that better than 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.950
 cool off in summer that kill a couple 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.170
 of hundreds of waves of zombies 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.239
 Uncle bloody tell me there is better 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.859
 that this title is the flip the free 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.180
 to play of the saga of dead island has 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.159
 left quite surprised by the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.510
 craft system that has because the 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.970
 variety of objects that can be reached 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.220
 to do is infinite in agreement and together 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.989
 with its good playability this is a 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.689
 game where you will spend many many 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.180
 hours hooked came out very recently and 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:23.209
 people have very good opinions there 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.250
 about 15,600 votes in positive steam and 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.579
 about 3000 and negative peaks of people 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.439
 there is a planet adenist 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.209

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.159
 We had recommended before they were free to 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.709
 play all absolutely but 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.049
 currently it is very cheap at two euros 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.700
 or two dollars in steam is fun to 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.349
 play with friends without friends with girlfriends 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.849
 no vale if I'm youtuber I do not have 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.409
 only seven a few hundred hamid like 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.090
 let me say that the name says it 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.040
 everything is a stigma that must fight 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.079
 against another stigma to see who has 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.489
 better skills and defeat him in a 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.379
 super epic battlefield and 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.209
 easy heroes platform simple and for 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.620
 the whole family I honestly what 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.939
 I recommend in this position because 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.220
 laughs that I've come to throw with this 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:13.099
 playing multiplayer it 's true that it's a 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.209
 game not not very elaborate by saying you're going 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.690
 and you 'll see that you laugh 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.310
 incredible is very common and quite by 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.280
 put it like this with very good playability 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.229
