00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.970
 hello to all youtube friends today 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.820
 I bring another edition of course to websites 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.820
 from lehman and 31 and today we will talk about websites 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.370
 lehman already 20 we are already approaching the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.350
 end of the series the fight that opens the 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.560
 event is that of John dinner against big 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.110
 show for the title of the usa and it's in 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.260
 this fight where john dinner takes off at 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.390
 stardom is very strange to see this fight 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.540
 nowadays since people supported 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.180
 totally to dinner is not a great 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.970
 fight but it's a good to have and 11 not 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.100
 get his first championship and fight 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.199
 It ends when you have dinner 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 chain by the here is the rapper gives you 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.730
 in the head and applies the adjustment of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.870
 attitude that at that time was called 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.940
 efe a big show and the return reaches 3 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.700
 then we had a fight for the title 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.490
 world champion couples 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.190
 rob van dam and booker and they faced 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.310
 the sweet boys to the resistance and 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.310
 grab a cave and anne marie idrac to me 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.840
 I personally do not like the best 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.570
 it would have been to leave oscar 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.060
 lions against the zoobles end up 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.670
 win and retain titles steal danny 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.500
 ships and when they go sant covered one of 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.600
 the members of the rÃ©sistance after 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.899
 of the end and be of vic in you and a country 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.060
 be flower splash the following is one of 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.459
 the best fights of the night between 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.740
 cristian and cristian and ccoo with trish 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.490
 stratus in between like a triangle 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.829
 loving and have an incredible fight 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.319
 fights at air canvas very much 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.720
 quality between the two and in the end it arrives 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.640
 trish stratus tries to prevent 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.220
 cristian hurt yesterday and ccoo but 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.189
 cristian throws her to the ground and arico hits 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.439
 a cristian is going to help stratus but 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.629
 havoc hits yesterday and ccoo thinking that 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.489
 he was a Christian in this that Crisitan 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.700
 seize takes the fight with a 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.760
 little packet then trish stratus slapped 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.160
 yesterday and with cristian he made the insult and 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.299
 in the ramp cristian and trish stratus it 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.000
 they kissed 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.459
 as I already said very good fight after 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.799
 we have evolution formed by the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.900
 intercontinental champion randy orton 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.239
 batista and rico 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.090
 who were facing the rock i amics 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.370
 for this reason it is worth noting that it is the first 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.069
 stoneware germany from another di battista and it 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.950
 supposed the last of the rock very 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.989
 good fight with great xbox like play 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.720
 limiting people's rock with the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.150
 boom at the end is the evolution 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.370
 when orton applies the erreka waffle 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.980
 in this fight is a little below 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.409
 from the level of the previous fight the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.750
 next is the playboy fight in costume 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.230
 at night between tower and wilson and saber 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.750
 against stacy keibler and miss jackie al 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.659
 final all dresses are removed and 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.060
 they fight in underwear win tower and 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.489
 wilson and saber when tower and he does the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.010
 count of 3 to miss jackie the fight is 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.739
 I'm not going to comment on adas or of 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.200
 she later we had a fight for the 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.540
 cruise title is a fight of 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.939
 elimination in which the chavo champion 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.859
 warrior retained the title with the help of 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.129
 his father the legend of wrestling 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.660
 Mexican Warrior Warrior Lord 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:38.170
 eliminations are fast very 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.420
 and by far I see as I said 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.940
 warrior retains when at the end of the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.940
 fight is alone with king mysterio and his 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.510
 father intervenes in his favor the fight is 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.420
 good 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.060
 11 minutes of show after 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.820
 we had a supposed green match between 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.040
 goldberg and brock lesnar having a stone 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.490
 cold steve austin as special referee 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.560
 and in the end it turned out to be a garbage one of 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.780
 the worst combats in the history of 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.720
 wes lehman already considering the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.840
 quality of the two fighters this is the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.350
 last fight of both fighters in ww 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.690
 until the return of the star in 2012 as 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.420
 it was known that both were leaving all the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.720
 public began to sing several chants 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.880
 of farewell for these two monsters the 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.580
 fight is very boring takes it to 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.820
 goldberg with a suplex game and a spear 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.340
 The best thing about the fight is that in the end the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.680
 Rattlesnake applies his 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.320
 stoner both goldberg and brock 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.320
 lesnar the next fight is for the 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.470
 title in pairs of the wwf 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.590
 the shelton benjamin and charlie champions 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.410
 haas faced the apa ie 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.570
 for show farouk abdul who was 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.480
 formed by ricky si scott and to hold and 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.790
 besides an brothers the fight to me 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.670
 personally I do not like it is very 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.430
 boring and since they are the winners 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.790
 and they take the championships and I never 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.220
 I understood why the wwf had two titles 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.130
 in pairs first because they did not have 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.590
 good teams for this division if 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.360
 They want to know more here I leave my 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.360
 video with all the history of the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.730
 championships in pairs after we had 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.040
 a hair fight against hair by the 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.830
 title of women where the champion 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.260
 victory exposed his title before modi 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.200
 holly the fight lasts about 5 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.870
 minutes and in the end victory takes the 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.060
 Both divas look had good technique 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.180
 but when they fought together they did not 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.340
 they understood very well after we had one 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.970
 of the main events for the championship of 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.880
 the wwf between the champion the warrior and the 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.820
 putative slut 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.680
 an incredible fight simply the 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.450
 quality that was in the ring was 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.130
 impressive two of the best 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.340
 fighters flush with canvas 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.800
 there is also struggle in the end it takes 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.380
 the warrior when he feigns an injury and 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.540
 unleash the drop and when there is honey 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.730
 applies for the second time anchor what 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.250
 Eddie takes off and there he takes his boot 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.610
 and he makes a small package and leans on the 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.530
 strings so that the account reaches three 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.750
 then we go to the fight of the return 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.060
 of undertaker returning after 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.670
 lose the battle of buried alive before 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.460
 vince mcmahon in survivor series where 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.680
 appears cane and undertaker returns with 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.990
 thirst for revenge this time with the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.150
 character of the set man and set aside the 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.910
 the big ball paras as you want 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.910
 call the entrance of three of the best 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:42.360
 of history with the druids and about 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:45.060
 everything with returning the fight to the opposite of 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.880
 west lehman's already 14 leaves a lot that 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.830
 wish the west germany 14 lasts more 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.410
 double that of this west lehman already 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.210
 in this fight undertaker dominates 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.430
 completely to kane 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:00.360
 ghana with a tombstone when in stoneware 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:03.000
 lehman already 14 cost him three tombs tones and 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.280
 finally we had the main event for the 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.500
 heavyweight title this 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.750
 incredible triple threat between chris 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.580
 benoÃ®t who had won the royal rumble 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:16.050
 shawn michaels and triple h the fight is 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.270
 spectacular super intense 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.370
 michaels and triple h are a sea of ââblood 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.190
 at the end of the fight all apply 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.080
 the finishers is really very very good 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.539
 and as we all know 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.419
 benoÃ®t the fight takes making 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:32.849
 triple h surrender with the cross face 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.979
 it sounds like something the end is 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:38.009
 exactly like the one in west 

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:40.020
 mania 30 also in a triple threat and 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:43.050
 also with daniel bryan which is a 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:46.110
 kind of replica of benoÃ®t but good 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.720
 that we will see in a few weeks a former 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.360
 final client and when the warrior enters 

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.479
 and they embrace is a great moment 3 lehman 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.729
 already and very emotional and good friends 

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:58.289
 up here came the video today I hope 

00:07:56.729 --> 00:08:01.229
 what you liked 

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:03.749
 in the comments that you think for me is 

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:06.539
 a good you are lehman no longer excellent 

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:09.330
 but it's pretty good and we 

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:12.149
 We have an appointment next Friday with 

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.449
