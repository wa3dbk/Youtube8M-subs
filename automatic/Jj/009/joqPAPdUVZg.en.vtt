and<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:52.350> easiest<00:00:52.680> option<00:00:53.160> I'll<00:00:53.250> start<00:00:53.460> with

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
and the easiest option I'll start with

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.660 
and the easiest option I'll start with
the<00:00:53.610> easiest<00:00:53.879> option<00:00:54.590> if<00:00:55.590> you're<00:00:56.039> exporting

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the easiest option if you're exporting

the easiest option if you're exporting
it<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> YouTube<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.469> should<00:00:58.710> use<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.370> YouTube

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
it to YouTube you should use the YouTube

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.569 
it to YouTube you should use the YouTube
button<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.899> only<00:01:01.079> reason<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.859> don't<00:01:01.920> use

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
button but the only reason I don't use

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.920 
button but the only reason I don't use
this<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.059> because<00:01:04.850> usually<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.450> doesn't<00:01:06.810> work

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this is because usually it doesn't work

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.539 
this is because usually it doesn't work
for<00:01:06.960> me<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.650> says<00:01:07.830> there<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> an<00:01:08.250> error

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
for me like it says there is an error

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.410 
for me like it says there is an error
and<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> re<00:01:09.689> export<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:11.420> re-upload

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420

and I have to re export it and re-upload
it<00:01:12.650> normally<00:01:13.650> without<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.340> option<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.810> I

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110

YouTube make sure you don't choose the
bigger<00:04:49.550> size<00:04:49.820> because<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:50.330> will<00:04:50.480> be<00:04:50.600> too<00:04:51.200> big

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
and I think it plays an HD but it's just

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.460 
and I think it plays an HD but it's just
not<00:04:53.750> as<00:04:53.990> good<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:55.760> sound<00:04:56.060> should<00:04:56.540> be<00:04:56.600> right
