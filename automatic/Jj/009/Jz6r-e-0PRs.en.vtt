00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
though I can't get like most of the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.529 
though I can't get like most of the
assault<00:00:46.379> rifles<00:00:46.739> or<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.160> submachine<00:00:48.149> guns<00:00:48.360> i

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
assault rifles or this submachine guns i

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.799 
assault rifles or this submachine guns i
have<00:00:48.719> picked<00:00:48.989> them<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.410> used<00:00:49.590> them<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.809> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
have picked them up and used them and it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.560 
have picked them up and used them and it
just<00:00:52.110> doesn't<00:00:52.469> compare<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.250> Diablo<00:00:53.760> but

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
just doesn't compare with the Diablo but

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.760 
just doesn't compare with the Diablo but
I<00:00:54.600> guess<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.590> opinion

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
my opinion Diablo helped me out a lot

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.240

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
because you know i'll pull off the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.560 
because you know i'll pull off the
running<00:01:02.520> gunning<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> AI<00:01:03.149> blow<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
running gunning with the AI blow and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.740 
running gunning with the AI blow and
then<00:01:03.660> maybe<00:01:03.870> I'll<00:01:04.019> try<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.909> m4<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
then maybe I'll try the m4 and then that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.969 
then maybe I'll try the m4 and then that
won't<00:01:06.810> do<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.200> good<00:01:07.439> because<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.710> doesn't<00:01:07.950> have

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979

you go around you can just kill them all
I<00:01:48.390> number<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.899> game<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> had<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.530> eight<00:01:49.890> kills

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
I number one game I had like eight kills

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.010 
I number one game I had like eight kills
by<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.299> killing<00:01:51.540> all<00:01:51.780> snipers

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
by just going and killing all snipers

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.660 
by just going and killing all snipers
because<00:01:52.500> most<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> team<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.220> snipers

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
because most of the team with snipers

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.499 
because most of the team with snipers
and<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:55.399> that<00:01:56.399> helped<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.790> my<00:01:56.969> game<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.390> you

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
and that that helped out my game so you

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.469 
and that that helped out my game so you
probably<00:01:57.689> see<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> back<00:01:58.350> name<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> future

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
probably see the back name in the future

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.910 
probably see the back name in the future
but<00:02:00.479> yeah<00:02:00.600> most<00:02:00.899> people<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.439> chillin

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920

and<00:05:30.130> then<00:05:30.990> you<00:05:31.990> go<00:05:32.140> check<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.410> leaderboard

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
and then you go check the leaderboard

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.110 
and then you go check the leaderboard
and<00:05:32.920> you're<00:05:33.040> still<00:05:33.250> at<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.430> exact<00:05:33.670> same<00:05:33.850> thing

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
and you're still at the exact same thing

and you're still at the exact same thing
so<00:05:34.360> i'm<00:05:34.420> not<00:05:34.540> sure<00:05:34.750> if<00:05:34.840> here<00:05:35.020> it's<00:05:35.650> just<00:05:35.950> slow

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
can actually capture the objective which

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.020 
can actually capture the objective which
makes<00:07:01.480> no<00:07:01.570> sense<00:07:01.690> to<00:07:02.170> me<00:07:02.710> like<00:07:03.130> a<00:07:03.160> bomb<00:07:03.490> I<00:07:03.700> found

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
makes no sense to me like a bomb I found

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.910 
makes no sense to me like a bomb I found
my<00:07:04.180> guy<00:07:04.330> and<00:07:04.660> I'm<00:07:05.080> trying<00:07:05.470> to<00:07:05.530> capture<00:07:05.710> an

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:05.920 
my guy and I'm trying to capture an

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.530 
my guy and I'm trying to capture an
objective<00:07:06.280> and<00:07:06.400> there's<00:07:06.580> a<00:07:06.670> huge<00:07:06.970> tank<00:07:07.270> there

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
objective and there's a huge tank there

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.450 
objective and there's a huge tank there
most<00:07:08.260> likely<00:07:08.350> I'm<00:07:08.620> gonna<00:07:08.710> die<00:07:08.980> if<00:07:09.280> they're

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
most likely I'm gonna die if they're

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.460 
most likely I'm gonna die if they're
gonna<00:07:09.580> what<00:07:10.300> should<00:07:10.570> happen<00:07:10.750> if<00:07:11.020> they're

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 
gonna what should happen if they're

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.440 
gonna what should happen if they're
trying<00:07:11.650> to<00:07:11.740> capture<00:07:12.010> an<00:07:12.580> objective<00:07:13.120> they<00:07:13.270> need

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.450 
trying to capture an objective they need

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.790 
trying to capture an objective they need
to<00:07:13.600> need<00:07:13.990> to<00:07:14.050> get<00:07:14.200> out<00:07:14.290> of<00:07:14.350> the<00:07:14.410> vehicle<00:07:14.530> to

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
to need to get out of the vehicle to

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.190 
to need to get out of the vehicle to
capture<00:07:15.280> it<00:07:15.310> so<00:07:16.090> hopefully<00:07:16.420> they<00:07:16.990> can<00:07:17.050> fix

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.200 
capture it so hopefully they can fix

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.500 
capture it so hopefully they can fix
that<00:07:17.590> an<00:07:17.740> update<00:07:18.040> cuz<00:07:18.340> I'm<00:07:18.490> don't<00:07:19.150> know<00:07:19.210> why

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:19.510 
that an update cuz I'm don't know why

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.680 
that an update cuz I'm don't know why
they<00:07:19.750> would<00:07:19.900> do<00:07:20.110> that<00:07:20.190> by<00:07:21.190> F<00:07:21.430> slide<00:07:22.270> down<00:07:22.510> with

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
they would do that by F slide down with

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.960 
they would do that by F slide down with
my<00:07:22.810> helicopter<00:07:23.410> and<00:07:23.530> I<00:07:23.590> can<00:07:23.800> capture<00:07:24.460> there's

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:24.970 
my helicopter and I can capture there's

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.390 
my helicopter and I can capture there's
something<00:07:25.210> wrong<00:07:25.390> with<00:07:25.630> that<00:07:25.770> so<00:07:26.770> hopefully

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
something wrong with that so hopefully

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.390 
something wrong with that so hopefully
that<00:07:27.550> gets<00:07:27.670> fixed<00:07:28.030> soon<00:07:29.010> the<00:07:30.010> games<00:07:30.190> coming

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 
that gets fixed soon the games coming

that gets fixed soon the games coming
down<00:07:30.580> to<00:07:30.790> it<00:07:30.910> come<00:07:31.480> coming<00:07:31.840> down<00:07:31.960> to<00:07:32.080> an<00:07:32.170> end

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320 
down to it come coming down to an end
