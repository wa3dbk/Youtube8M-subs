winged<00:01:28.310> eyeliner<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:29.660> am<00:01:30.140> now<00:01:30.380> going<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:30.890> go<00:01:31.070> in

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.420 

now<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.110> trick<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.410> to<00:01:45.560> balance<00:01:46.010> this<00:01:46.190> with

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
now the trick is to balance this with

00:01:46.430 --> 00:02:01.120 
now the trick is to balance this with
this<00:01:50.680> you<00:01:56.740> want<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:58.720> it's<00:01:59.720> it's<00:02:00.260> liquidy<00:02:00.770> and

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
this you want it it's it's liquidy and

this you want it it's it's liquidy and
it's<00:02:01.610> like<00:02:01.970> liquid<00:02:02.420> I<00:02:02.450> guess<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:03.080> like<00:02:03.200> pencils

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
it's like liquid I guess I like pencils

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.859 
it's like liquid I guess I like pencils
more<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.640> want<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:04.910> start<00:02:05.119> it<00:02:05.210> spinning<00:02:05.540> and

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
more you want to start it spinning and

more you want to start it spinning and
go<00:02:05.990> out<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.560> it's<00:02:06.770> not<00:02:06.950> as<00:02:07.130> soon<00:02:07.340> as<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.550> wanted

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.280 

there<00:02:28.330> we<00:02:28.569> go

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
there we go

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.520

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
different in the video they were

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.340 
different in the video they were
straight<00:03:57.220> across<00:03:57.630> clothes<00:03:58.630> I'm<00:03:59.050> gonna<00:03:59.200> get

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
straight across clothes I'm gonna get

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.210 
straight across clothes I'm gonna get
rid<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.500> just<00:03:59.710> fall<00:03:59.950> off<00:04:00.160> from<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.580> eye<00:04:00.910> shadow

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.290 

me<00:04:06.630> now<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.980> want<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.190> use<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> black<00:04:09.550> liner<00:04:09.820> I

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
me now you want to use a black liner I

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.980 
me now you want to use a black liner I
just<00:04:10.690> thought<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:10.870> new<00:04:11.050> one<00:04:11.230> from<00:04:11.560> Sigma

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
just thought this new one from Sigma

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:20.690 
just thought this new one from Sigma
Eclipse<00:04:13.990> just<00:04:14.920> put<00:04:15.130> it<00:04:15.190> in<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.340> waterline<00:04:15.730> so

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.160 

it's<00:04:21.700> not<00:04:21.850> as<00:04:21.970> dramatic<00:04:22.090> as<00:04:22.420> a<00:04:22.450> video<00:04:22.750> because

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
it's not as dramatic as a video because

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.450 
it's not as dramatic as a video because
my<00:04:23.700> natural<00:04:24.700> brow<00:04:24.970> goes<00:04:25.660> down<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.740> flow<00:04:27.130> the

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
my natural brow goes down the flow the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.880 
my natural brow goes down the flow the
symmetry<00:04:27.940> of<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.120> all<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.900> flow<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.290> better<00:04:29.620> if

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
symmetry of it all the flow is better if

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.240 
symmetry of it all the flow is better if
it's<00:04:30.070> going<00:04:30.400> up<00:04:31.140> my<00:04:32.140> eyebrow<00:04:32.500> is<00:04:32.590> going<00:04:32.710> down

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
it's going up my eyebrow is going down

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.110 
it's going up my eyebrow is going down
so<00:04:33.820> it's<00:04:34.140> it's<00:04:35.140> creating<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:35.590> cutesy<00:04:35.920> look<00:04:36.430> but

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
so it's it's creating a cutesy look but

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.970 
so it's it's creating a cutesy look but
if<00:04:37.210> we<00:04:37.300> want<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.510> go<00:04:37.600> fierce<00:04:37.930> we<00:04:38.560> got<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.800> block
