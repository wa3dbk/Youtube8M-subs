00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
been a ton ran off anyway so you select

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.920 
been a ton ran off anyway so you select
the<00:00:31.980> first<00:00:32.219> area<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.180> if<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.719> want<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the first area and you if you want to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.139 
the first area and you if you want to
make<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.140> square<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.620> suggest<00:00:35.309> go<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.640> direct

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
make it square I suggest go in a direct

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.540 
make it square I suggest go in a direct
line<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.649> then<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.920> set<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> second

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
line and then you just set the second

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.430 
line and then you just set the second
position<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.739> you<00:00:40.739> put<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.070> set<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:42.980> expand

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
position and you put in set one expand

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.880 
position and you put in set one expand
for<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.309> will<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:48.770> that<00:00:49.770> would

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
for up so that will make a that would

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.860 
for up so that will make a that would
make<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> full<00:00:51.949> stone<00:00:52.949> block<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.750> then<00:00:54.750> you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
make you a full stone block and then you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.299 
make you a full stone block and then you
select<00:00:55.050> these<00:00:55.289> two<00:00:55.350> points<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.980> right<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
select these two points with right and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.930 
select these two points with right and
left<00:00:56.489> click<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.920> expand<00:00:59.600> for<00:01:00.600> down<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:02.489> then

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
left click and expand for down and then

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.320 
left click and expand for down and then
set<00:01:03.600> naught<00:01:03.870> which<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.409> air<00:01:04.710> value<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
set naught which is the air value so you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.120 
set naught which is the air value so you
know<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> base<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:08.040> your

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
know you have the base of your

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.550 
know you have the base of your
skyscraper<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.909> since<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.840> not<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.350> big

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
skyscraper and since it's not that big

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.630 
skyscraper and since it's not that big
it's<00:01:10.830> three<00:01:11.630> one<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:12.659> three<00:01:13.100> okay<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.490> can

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it's three one two three okay so we can

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.670 
it's three one two three okay so we can
make<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> window<00:01:15.689> from<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.439> make

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
make the window from there we can make

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.399 
make the window from there we can make
it<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> big<00:01:17.100> window<00:01:17.400> skyscraper<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.150> their<00:01:19.430> sets

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
it a big window skyscraper to their sets

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.580 
it a big window skyscraper to their sets
20<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:22.979> yeah<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.850> glass<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:25.439> do

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
20 I think it is yeah for glass you do

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.380 
20 I think it is yeah for glass you do
the<00:01:25.710> same<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.070> each<00:01:26.310> side<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.970> guess<00:01:27.240> you

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the same on each side I guess you

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.149 
the same on each side I guess you
probably<00:01:27.600> copy<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.229> paste<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.680> moving<00:01:29.009> all

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
probably copy and paste and moving all

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.130 
probably copy and paste and moving all
that<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.360> kind<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.810> bit<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
that but this is kind of a bit of a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.330 
that but this is kind of a bit of a
beginner's<00:01:31.560> guide<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.579> anyone<00:01:33.000> who's<00:01:33.240> a

beginner's guide just to anyone who's a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.280 
beginner's guide just to anyone who's a
started<00:01:35.340> using<00:01:35.520> world<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.390> would

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
started using world that I would

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.719 
started using world that I would
seriously<00:01:37.500> recommend<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.189> go<00:01:38.340> watch<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
seriously recommend you go watch a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.980 
seriously recommend you go watch a
proper<00:01:39.060> video<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.509> tells<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.780> how<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> use

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
proper video that tells you how to use

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.969 
proper video that tells you how to use
the<00:01:40.079> commands<00:01:40.439> because<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.740> don't<00:01:40.890> really

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the commands because I don't really

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.740 
the commands because I don't really
explain<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.210> anyway<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.540> have

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
explain it at all so anyway you have

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.280 
explain it at all so anyway you have
this<00:01:42.930> building<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:45.180> easy<00:01:45.420> thing<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:45.960> is

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
this building and the easy thing now is

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.330 
this building and the easy thing now is
gets<00:01:47.220> really<00:01:47.520> easy<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.390> select<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:48.960> block

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
gets really easy you select one block

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.429 
gets really easy you select one block
you<00:01:50.340> select<00:01:50.909> second<00:01:51.509> block<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.340> do

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
you select second block and you just do

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.740 
you select second block and you just do
start<00:01:57.560> 5<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:59.250> now<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.670> this<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.570> make

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
start 5 up for now and this will make

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.440 
start 5 up for now and this will make
you<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.950> will<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.280> stack<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.969> building<00:02:03.299> on

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you this will just stack the building on

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.469 
you this will just stack the building on
top<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.780> each<00:02:03.869> other<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:05.060> that's<00:02:06.060> pretty

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
top of each other and that's pretty

this bit is easy as well

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:21.390 
this bit is easy as well
select<00:02:13.540> area<00:02:14.080> 1<00:02:14.790> select<00:02:15.790> area<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:18.090> UM<00:02:20.160> set<00:02:21.160> what

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
select area 1 select area to UM set what

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.020 
select area 1 select area to UM set what
you'll<00:02:21.550> make<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.819> out<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.020> okay<00:02:24.030> yeah

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
and there you have a glass capsule or if

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.100 
and there you have a glass capsule or if
I<00:02:27.850> mean<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.060> could<00:02:28.209> have<00:02:28.300> made<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.480> higher<00:02:28.750> so

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
I mean I could have made that higher so

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.140 
I mean I could have made that higher so
this<00:02:29.950> wood<00:02:30.160> frame<00:02:30.430> all<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> way<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.120> top

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
this wood frame all the way to the top

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.060 
this wood frame all the way to the top
so<00:02:31.900> I'll<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.050> show<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.320> how<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.590> do<00:02:32.800> want

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
so I'll just show you how to do want

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.820 
so I'll just show you how to do want
that<00:02:33.360> just<00:02:34.360> done<00:02:34.540> here<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.020> type<00:02:35.230> in<00:02:35.410> pause

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
that just done here and type in pause

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.580 
that just done here and type in pause
one<00:02:36.220> because<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:37.080> forgot<00:02:38.080> it's<00:02:38.140> double<00:02:38.380> slash

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
one because I forgot it's double slash

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.310 
one because I forgot it's double slash
pause<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:39.610> that's<00:02:39.700> position<00:02:40.390> one<00:02:40.420> but

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
pause one so that's position one but

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.590 
pause one so that's position one but
it's<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.520> block<00:02:42.730> above<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.300> one<00:02:43.450> you're

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
it's the block above the one you're

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.320 
it's the block above the one you're
standing<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:44.920> means<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.760> frame<00:02:46.060> of

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
standing on so that means the frame of

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.760 
standing on so that means the frame of
my<00:02:46.480> skyscraper<00:02:46.750> could<00:02:47.200> get<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.590> top

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
my skyscraper could get to the top

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.070 
my skyscraper could get to the top
without<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.160> glass<00:02:48.400> mixing<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:49.180> with<00:02:49.360> the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
without the glass mixing in with the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.460 
without the glass mixing in with the
with<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.110> top<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.920> then<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.850> do<00:02:55.000> set<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:56.380> the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
with the top and then you do set of the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.620 
with the top and then you do set of the
top<00:02:56.650> loss<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.489> now<00:02:57.700> that's<00:02:58.030> actually<00:02:58.420> properly

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
top loss so now that's actually properly

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.040 
top loss so now that's actually properly
framed<00:02:59.080> and<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:01.090> if<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.510> want<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.900> make<00:03:02.019> a

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
framed and so if you want to make a

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.520 
framed and so if you want to make a
glass<00:03:02.290> dome<00:03:02.590> it's<00:03:02.890> pretty<00:03:03.280> easy<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:04.030> mean<00:03:04.530> you

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
glass dome it's pretty easy I mean you

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.190 
glass dome it's pretty easy I mean you
just<00:03:05.560> kind<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.570> I'll<00:03:07.570> just<00:03:07.780> show<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:07.930> quickly

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
just kind of I'll just show you quickly

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.370 
just kind of I'll just show you quickly
how<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.500> make<00:03:08.800> a<00:03:08.950> double<00:03:09.250> slotted<00:03:09.790> roof<00:03:10.380> just

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
how to make a double slotted roof just

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.440 
how to make a double slotted roof just
go<00:03:11.560> here<00:03:12.480> pause<00:03:13.480> 10<00:03:15.060> keep<00:03:16.060> forgetting<00:03:16.420> to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
go here pause 10 keep forgetting to

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.390 
go here pause 10 keep forgetting to
double<00:03:16.780> slash<00:03:17.049> i<00:03:17.410> guess<00:03:17.829> it's<00:03:18.010> cool<00:03:18.250> though

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
double slash i guess it's cool though

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.990 
double slash i guess it's cool though
makes<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.360> easier<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.660> use<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:19.900> stuff<00:03:20.579> what<00:03:21.579> do

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
makes it easier to use and stuff what do

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.610 
makes it easier to use and stuff what do
because<00:03:22.360> you're<00:03:22.840> not<00:03:22.989> going<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.200> get<00:03:23.290> mixed<00:03:23.470> up

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
because you're not going to get mixed up

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.920 
because you're not going to get mixed up
with<00:03:23.680> any<00:03:23.950> other<00:03:24.130> plug-in<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:25.079> I've<00:03:26.079> kind<00:03:26.680> of
