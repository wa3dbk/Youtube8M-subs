00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
little um they this substrate you can

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.420 
little um they this substrate you can
use<00:01:37.590> old<00:01:38.960> cereals<00:01:39.960> or<00:01:40.409> any<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.100> old<00:01:41.220> stuff

you put in there so here that works good
too<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:45.240> that's<00:01:45.509> them<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.380> bedding<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> after

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
too so that's them the bedding so after

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.840 
too so that's them the bedding so after
they<00:01:48.540> turn<00:01:48.750> into<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.079> pupa<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.490> turn<00:01:50.759> into

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
they turn into a pupa and you turn into

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.060 
they turn into a pupa and you turn into
pupae<00:01:51.329> they<00:01:51.840> turn<00:01:52.079> into<00:01:52.229> darkling<00:01:52.710> beetles

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
pupae they turn into darkling beetles

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.490 
pupae they turn into darkling beetles
they<00:01:53.280> get<00:01:53.430> their<00:01:53.549> name<00:01:53.700> because<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.290> few<00:01:55.290> weeks
