00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
alright next we'll move on to the hitch

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.050 
alright next we'll move on to the hitch
ball<00:01:23.390> assembly<00:01:24.160> again<00:01:25.160> it<00:01:25.310> uses<00:01:25.580> a<00:01:25.610> locking

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
ball assembly again it uses a locking

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.290 
ball assembly again it uses a locking
pin<00:01:26.680> same<00:01:27.680> key<00:01:27.950> as<00:01:28.070> before<00:01:31.030> take<00:01:32.030> our<00:01:32.150> hitch

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
pin same key as before take our hitch

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.060 
pin same key as before take our hitch
pin<00:01:32.800> and<00:01:33.800> we're<00:01:33.920> gonna<00:01:34.010> move<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:34.430> up<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.730> down
