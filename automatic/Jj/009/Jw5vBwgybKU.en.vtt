an adapter here for that that should
plug<00:03:08.780> right<00:03:08.989> in<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:12.970> there's<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.239> polarity

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
plug right in and there's the polarity

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.140 
plug right in and there's the polarity
and<00:03:15.050> he's<00:03:15.200> right<00:03:15.530> way<00:03:15.910> weather<00:03:16.910> tight

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
and he's right way weather tight

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.460 
and he's right way weather tight
Becker's<00:03:17.599> definitely<00:03:18.019> want<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.200> under

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
Becker's definitely want that under

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.380 
Becker's definitely want that under
there<00:03:18.620> let's<00:03:18.980> test<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.340> see<00:03:19.640> if<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.819> work

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.580 

that's<00:03:26.390> definitely<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.049> that<00:03:27.230> sounds<00:03:27.530> a

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
that's definitely it that sounds a

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.650 
that's definitely it that sounds a
little<00:03:27.709> quieter<00:03:28.190> it's<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.880> good<00:03:29.060> sign

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:40.420 

swap<00:03:32.660> this<00:03:32.840> hose<00:03:33.079> off<00:03:34.780> pop<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.959> on<00:03:36.110> there<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
swap this hose off pop it on there the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.759 
swap this hose off pop it on there the
modus<00:03:40.730> is<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:41.090> little<00:03:41.930> bit<00:03:42.049> easier<00:03:42.440> because<00:03:42.560> I

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
modus is a little bit easier because I

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.720 
modus is a little bit easier because I
don't<00:03:42.950> have<00:03:43.099> the<00:03:43.310> shroud<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.360> here<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:46.519> inner

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
fender the plastic thing though that's

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.449 
fender the plastic thing though that's
supposed<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.590> keep<00:03:48.769> all<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.010> crap<00:03:49.250> out<00:03:49.430> of

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
supposed to keep all the crap out of

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.809 
supposed to keep all the crap out of
here<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:50.860> had<00:03:51.860> to<00:03:51.980> take<00:03:52.160> that<00:03:52.310> out<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:52.519> course

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
here I had to take that out of course

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.190 
here I had to take that out of course
when<00:03:53.000> I<00:03:53.030> walked<00:03:53.930> out<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:56.600> body<00:03:56.810> panel

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
when I walked out the the the body panel

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.199 
when I walked out the the the body panel
here<00:03:57.319> for<00:03:57.470> extra<00:03:57.680> clearance<00:03:57.950> for<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.280> tire<00:03:58.519> so

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
here for extra clearance for the tire so

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.080 
here for extra clearance for the tire so
that<00:03:59.420> means<00:03:59.660> I<00:04:00.170> got<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:00.769> lot<00:04:00.980> more<00:04:01.010> crap<00:04:01.459> slide

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
that means I got a lot more crap slide

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.210 
that means I got a lot more crap slide
around<00:04:02.359> in<00:04:02.480> here<00:04:02.660> which<00:04:02.859> explains<00:04:03.859> why<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.069> have

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220

going to get a little water throw all
that<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.170> there<00:04:27.350> make<00:04:27.650> sure<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.890> doesn't<00:04:28.070> leak

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
that in there make sure it doesn't leak

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.620 
that in there make sure it doesn't leak
and<00:04:28.580> we'll<00:04:29.540> give<00:04:29.660> her<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:29.810> little<00:04:29.930> test

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
and we'll give her a little test

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.460 
and we'll give her a little test
all<00:04:32.630> right<00:04:32.840> go<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.260> water<00:04:33.580> here<00:04:34.580> we<00:04:34.700> go

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
all right go to the water here we go

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.710 
all right go to the water here we go
it's<00:04:36.470> not<00:04:36.590> going<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:36.800> put<00:04:36.950> much<00:04:37.160> in<00:04:37.510> just<00:04:38.510> want

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
it's not going to put much in just want

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.530 
it's not going to put much in just want
to<00:04:38.870> cover<00:04:39.170> the<00:04:39.350> bottom<00:04:39.470> of<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.800> pump<00:04:40.070> there

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
to cover the bottom of the pump there

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.070 
to cover the bottom of the pump there
test<00:04:41.540> it<00:04:41.750> out<00:04:41.840> make<00:04:41.900> sure<00:04:42.140> works<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:43.840> I'll<00:04:44.840> put

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
test it out make sure works and I'll put

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.670 
test it out make sure works and I'll put
in<00:04:45.430> some<00:04:46.430> proper<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:46.880> freeze<00:04:47.530> washer<00:04:48.530> fluid

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
in some proper a freeze washer fluid

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.790 
in some proper a freeze washer fluid
here<00:04:49.840> apparently<00:04:50.840> this<00:04:51.260> stuff<00:04:51.500> gives<00:04:51.740> a

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
here apparently this stuff gives a

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.560 
here apparently this stuff gives a
little<00:04:51.950> more<00:04:52.070> lubrication<00:04:52.910> for<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.330> pump

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
little more lubrication for the pump

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.780 
little more lubrication for the pump
which<00:04:53.840> is<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.020> good<00:04:54.260> thing<00:04:54.490> make<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.640> last

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
which is a good thing make it last

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:08.410 
which is a good thing make it last
longer<00:05:02.620> let's<00:05:03.620> test<00:05:03.890> that<00:05:04.010> out<00:05:07.060> okay<00:05:08.060> it's<00:05:08.210> try

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
longer let's test that out okay it's try

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:24.890 
longer let's test that out okay it's try
it<00:05:08.510> out

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.690 

yeah<00:05:25.900> that<00:05:26.230> definitely<00:05:26.350> works<00:05:28.380> okay<00:05:29.380> so

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
yeah that definitely works okay so

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.250 
yeah that definitely works okay so
that's<00:05:30.700> got<00:05:30.910> her<00:05:30.970> working<00:05:31.180> right<00:05:31.660> on<00:05:31.690> that<00:05:32.140> was

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
that's got her working right on that was

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.800 
that's got her working right on that was
a<00:05:32.430> well<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:33.550> easiest<00:05:33.940> thing<00:05:34.150> I've<00:05:34.270> ever<00:05:34.300> fixed

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
a well the easiest thing I've ever fixed

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.290 
a well the easiest thing I've ever fixed
on<00:05:34.930> this<00:05:35.080> thing
