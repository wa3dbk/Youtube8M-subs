00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.009
 many will have happened to be 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.520
 involved in a small accident or not 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.050
 know how to deal with the situation 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.470
 first of all it is essential to maintain the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.210
 calm 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.070
 so take a deep breath and 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.360
 avoid getting out of the car screaming e 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.000
 swearing at the driver 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.680
 of the other car in the event of an accident 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.720
 with material damage and minor injuries 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.429
 the person has the obligation to 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.499
 inform your own in writing 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.699
 insurance within three days of 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:38.499
 date of the accident 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.909
 if there is no agreement between the parties can 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.800
 be useful to request the intervention 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:43.780
 of the authorities that will provide to 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.050
 establish the person responsible for the accident 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.550
 and remember it is essential not to move 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.449
 cars before the arrival of forces 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.999
 the order 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.710
 if you decide instead to proceed with the 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.929
 amicable finding is a lot 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.139
 important to be precise and fill in the 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.789
 cai cig model in all its parts 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:03.280
 today I will show you how to compile it 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.750
 correctly avoid errors in this 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.880
 phase will save you a lot 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.560
 hassles the blue form is important 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.600
 because it can help us not only to 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.310
 report an accident and resolve it on 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.440
 as soon as possible but you are compiled 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.090
 properly in a complete way can also 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.670
 halve the time for the offer of 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.260
 compensation from the insurance company 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.880
 i must have i 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.040
 registration books for both 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.980
 cars drivers' licenses i 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.000
 insurance certificates and some 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.770
 of patience 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.240
 the module consists of five parts 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.340
 the heading from point 1 to point 5 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.260
 in the header you must specify 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.600
 date time and place of the accident 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.760
 whether or not there are wounded 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.950
 data and contact details of any witnesses 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.040
 and if others have been damaged 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.430
 vehicle or vehicle objects or vehicles b 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.860
 from point 6 to point 11 it is two o'clock 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.630
 balusters usually one blue and one yellow 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.409
 where the relevant data is entered 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.880
 to the people and cars involved 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.500
 attention in this section go 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.640
 indicated the data of the holder of 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.230
 insurance 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.830
 driver data must be entered 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.630
 only from point 9 another part maybe 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.490
 the less intuitive is the relative one 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.260
 under the circumstances of the accident 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.360
 often not due 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.150
 be careful in compiling this 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.310
 point that is very important instead 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.650
 since it is from here that it is established as it is 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.480
 the accident occurred at point 12 are 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.430
 reported standard situations 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.010
 the most common ones that will help 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.230
 understand the dynamics of the accident 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.850
 therefore the driver will have to put one 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.980
 or more crosses on the white boxes 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.300
 of his column that best describe 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.970
 his situation in the moment 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.470
 of the accident the same thing will have to do 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.540
 the driver b 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.220
 now we come to the graph of the accident 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.260
 don't worry just a stylized drawing 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.760
 that illustrates the direction of the vehicles 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.160
 on the road the position at the moment 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.100
 the impact of the presence of signs and 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.690
 street names for the form to be 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.600
 valid as a friendly statement 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.240
 must be signed by both parties 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.100
 if the other party does not agree to sign 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.170
 you compile yours and bring it 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.880
 however to the insurance 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.010
 in this case it will become a complaint of 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.840
 left and having done it will still go to 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.070
 your advantage 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.960
 always remember to check the 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.730
 form in all its parts and of 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.570
 reach an agreement in the most manner 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.700
 as serene as possible 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.700
 good trip to cech for 24
