00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.020
 Current otto how is it that here spoke 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.710
 of numbers recorded a small clip 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.349
 it's the super watch is the first thing that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.480
 if you can see this is a way to capture 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.419
 so it is almost certain that it will 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.800
 work there is exactly what works 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.510
 or it is understood by half an hour in which 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.980
 there is a central point that needs to be 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.160
 capture and from there is fight avenue 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.630
 strong and ugly 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:48.990
 imagine chiclÃ© taquara 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:51.360
 now it's a pork chicken and promises a lot 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.770
 fun for art lovers 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.240
 no doubt 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.500
 Another thing you notice is that this 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.980
 can see that in the center of the image 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.119
 seems to be the flag that is 10 in a 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.210
 flag and the fun jet crash 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.369
 As for the time when it was at hand, 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.999
 to use when it rained because it is full 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.999
 gas 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.070
 but anyway you can 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.840
 better again until the flag also 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.980
 above or to capture will be 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:31.000
 need to be close and this one 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:37.210
 century will be the center point of the map 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.680
 and apart from that it is already disc with plenty and 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.190
 it will certainly be very much physical vigor 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.740
 for those who like water it will be a 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.979
 birds struggle is that it is one thing 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.979
 incredible 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.990
 I 'm sure I'll try 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.900
 maybe it's the way I'm going to improve 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.100
 my skills in jets usually 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.820
 say that I do not like theater very much 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.010
 tax that happened next to the game but 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.360
 in this way I think it will no longer exist 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.490
 because the game is even fighting the games 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.350
 I think it's an excellent 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.930
 addition work company and this is my 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.190
 part of everything a big hug to 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.190
 everybody be well
