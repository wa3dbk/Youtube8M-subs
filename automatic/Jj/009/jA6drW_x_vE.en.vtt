00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:10.580
 Hello, I want to tell the device 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:15.420
 which I made myself for sharpening knives 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:18.900
 called her this manas speech about how you already 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.090
 guessed the scheme is the same as on 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:29.420
 Known sharpeners apex edge pro 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:31.109
 actually why I made such a sharpener 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:37.670
 I ordered 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:40.980
 clone chinese apex well and think 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.129
 purchase stone from the original apex 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.770
 Well, as if hunting that kitchen knives 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.420
 Were also sharp, we for certain 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.870
 by the corner 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.510
 I decided to make such an adaptation 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:01:00.710
 which is not a pity the stone is you yourself he 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.710
 its simplest double pebble 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:12.430
 I'll tell you, but its structure means 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:15.710
 the main part is made of skateboard 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.970
 as i ride skateboard here 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:25.030
 in the summer I broke a few as you can see 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:28.640
 Russians bard goes such a lift here and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:33.490
 two holes four more holes 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.490
 patents well which secures trucks 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.210
 Actually I cut out like this 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.190
 millimeters in my 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.100
 and here are the holes and the decline of the crayfish twisted 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.100
 such stalinka 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:57.950
 cut here like this at an angle was 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.740
 conveniently glued here a medical harness to 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:07.000
 did not slip 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:11.060
 you take it means that it was the most difficult 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.410
 do in this sharpener is screwed 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:19.540
 -35 thread 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.260
 so there is such a clamp to us 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.900
 screwed it here 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:30.569
 furniture let's say retainer and in 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.319
 drilled a hole glued here also 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.319
 clamp 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:45.079
 here we have two movable hinges 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.079
 which easily connects once 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.900
 what i did inside it for extruded 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:59.530
 here here are now let's say the seals 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:02.420
 so that the main clamp went in it 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:08.810
 let's say not on a tree 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.620
 and flew and put plastic here 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.439
 such nonsense 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.980
 how much if you put metal she 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:24.349
 rubbed and quickly began to play here 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:27.019
 will not start here so much here 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:33.639
 250 millimeter clamp screwed in here 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:39.420
 carvings such aluminum stone clamps 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:45.569
 so caught Gadget so 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:47.340
 here, too, Gadget to swap 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:54.660
 the stone has to open everything 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:04:13.110
 just unscrew one nut gadget 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:14.390
 10 swapped and neatly 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.239
 we twist 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.389
 i will put as uncomfortable in this 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.389
 moment 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.750
 principle think concept 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:47.470
 further simply mafik 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:54.510
 fixing the knife in this country will bring 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:59.890
 example with a kitchen knife to start 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:03.690
 actually yesterday did even yesterday 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:07.360
 sharpener and decided to try it on the knife 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.150
 look at the kitchen if you can see 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.150
 what kind 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.150
 carts 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.570
 I do not know how many degrees sharpened 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:28.900
 carts seems to be very even here 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:28.900
 we fasten the knife in the old fashioned way 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:42.590
 I put two clamps here 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:46.169
 which is better to keep the knife since 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:52.650
 heavy enough stone can run away 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:56.220
 mash and by the way here it is this clamp 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:01.650
 for less friction, I rubbed with a mask 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:04.710
 forum for people to go here and how it is 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:14.280
 everything works so hold you here 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:24.139
 hand she is not so much different all 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:24.139
 quite comfortable also on the other hand 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:36.380
 see here I made wiki markup 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.380
 to tag for example here and so 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:46.240
 also on the other hand and tried 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:50.390
 yesterday I sharpen my very first knife 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:59.180
 I think everyone had their first knife this 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:07:03.530
 with a sword weight is also so smooth 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:06.050
 submariners only failed 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:11.210
 if it will be seen here under this 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:12.950
 somewhere millimeter 21 millimeter why so 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:17.180
 It happened because it's so for a 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:22.280
 our chorus and the stone did not cling their name 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:25.610
 pin us we will see that he is here 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:30.250
 scratched well and did not decide to sharpen further 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.250
 so undermined the rule of adversity 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:43.500
 so here we say pribluda hope 

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.500
 everybody liked to see you bye
