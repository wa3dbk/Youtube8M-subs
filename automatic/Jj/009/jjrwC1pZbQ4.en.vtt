00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.859
 hello to all the people of Marcoussis soon 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:23.730
 by car 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.230
 all they can for what I have been more 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.529
 come with me for a ride as on the circuit spa-francorchamps 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.470
 here are the first details 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.170
 the match strong enough for the palaces of the source 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.880
 in second gear 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.309
 we accelerate 3 0 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.090
 a fourth 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.090
 25th then that will be done its future 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.260
 message that's pretty common 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.680
 everyone I think 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 very fast here a fifth showing the compression 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.290
 at the foot of the technion 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.440
 and then we go back on vibrators project points 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.560
 to keep up the speed to ride the sixth 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.800
 here on the straight line to arrive during the first chicane 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.210
 at the end of this story 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.920
 a plus or minus 110 meters 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.960
 what are the reports up to the third point on the vibrator to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.900
 the interior in clear not practical 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.450
 you have to look to rescue tourists because it was a match 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.030
 important enough for them for everything he does 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.390
 we just passed the congregation for the bush villages that you go 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.180
 see a scene 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.650
 peugeot moved them inside 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.120
 travelers to take the door 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.710
 so it's difficult here on 30 have changed 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.590
 sixty cars 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.550
 with the traffic 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.030
 we must not only see those who are in front but also behind 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.560
 often we go down 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.300
 to the double left 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.130
 we come in fifth 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.700
 4th bridge by the corpiq 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.700
 but if you want there are two bends here that we take as one man 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.770
 so we have a meaning 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.360
 to weigh text 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.460
 enough to make up for a final deal 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.820
 the settlers movement it's a single 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.510
 and here is the pif paf as we say here in belgium 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.510
 on the right then on the left, well keep the speed 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.040
 acceleration in the third one goes up the speed loss 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.780
 this is already more than a third new and then we must try to 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.929
 reset the gas 2 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.349
 as soon as possible here because that of the week after scarponi 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.469
 not 100% but almost 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.900
 and then there is still a point for both trips to world all 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:22.489
 it's a 100% bridge 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.579
 so it's important to keep my speed well I see 6 2 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.269
 the boss of the scuderia 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.519
 ferrari which is in front 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.229
 we spend the second Sunday they did not survive 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.229
 on the title 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.439
 outside 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.439
 and then in Africa braking is not early 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.709
 the fix for the earliest 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.489
 but we take three countries of age commenting on what is beyond me 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.429
 and then again an important acceleration continued
