00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.050
 we are very happy about the 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.130
 actuate 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.020
 We knew that we are in debt 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.670
 in debt to the hobby and we want 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.650
 save them 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.050
 we have to make it clear that there is a great 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.730
 commitment and I think the first match 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.860
 we show it now likewise not 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.670
 we talk about it we do not have to 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.230
 wait 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.180
 what happens the tournament to demonstrate this 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.310
 to look up 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.300
 in the season start table 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.579
 We have to go out 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.100
 and show that hunger not wanting to be 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.809
 always in the close- ups of that 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.030
 protagonists and néstor torne I think of the 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.760
 important stabilization has been the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.030
 contribution of the reinforcements that have 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.800
 come players like rock not with a 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.589
 great trajectory but that follows 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.900
 showing that each of the plays 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.300
 fight like it's the last one 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.739
 works with all intensity not only 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.739
 the parties but during the week 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.510
 the sea ​​is fine 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.060
 of rock and chaco must be discomfort 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.140
 muscle and even not doing studies 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.780
 Well, you can talk more accurately 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.610
 very important the six points 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.580
 very important not to receive the goal in two 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.960
 matches and most importantly happy 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.100
 that is going to our stadium people 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.200
 we knew it was going to be a few goals and 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.229
 very locked up we have to fight what 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.420
 we had to go to work as 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.770
 gave because it's a very good team this 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.190
 saint is very compact then very 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.350
 difficult to reach is something I do not know if you can 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.200
 think that rightly 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.520
 it's going to be a good tournament but we're going a little 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.679
 little always with his feet on him 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.869
 on the floor and knowing that there are many 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.189
 other teams that also have very 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.229
 good staff which is what it does 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.500
 interesting and exciting to our league 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.240
 I think I 'm leaving here satisfied I'm still 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.130
 growing a lot clear in these 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.979
 players of the menu that is this project 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.229
 and things are not as they start they are 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.959
 how they end up and many times what is 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.209
 a defeat is the mother of many 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.160
 victories that can be followed if you can 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.230
 be for not the new one we understand that 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.500
 the novatez of the 25 elements of the 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.170
 template in 23 days and will win titles 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.569
 or trophies I would like to look at another 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.630
 template that also has that that 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.000
 number or 17 of those same 25 that 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.370
 they have selection process or there is 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.160
 who confuses a lot what is an age 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.380
 young with what motherhood is not 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.060
 let's go in that direction because they are 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.400
 young but they know very well what 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.430
 they have what they want they already have many 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.989
 minutes already have a background 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.629
 interesting to be able to do what 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.099
 we set out to do then it will not be 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.099
 surely because of the age issue
