00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
 take the brittle and those chinese 

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.670
 we then had them on the spot 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.150
 that is obvious 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.299
 two finalists 5 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.099
 that requires a special app attention 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.660
 previous year moaffina I now call them the queen 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.920
 the term queen of this world championship won the rotterdamse 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.900
 the gold in the ten best rights watch gold in the the square the olympic 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.900
 Vierkamp silver on jump silver on bridge 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.329
 I find that published with the beer quay 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.820
 it's already before the half marathon 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.920
 it actually goes it already starts to run a bit not that tension 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.950
 to tackle 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.950
 the tension in the legs and hips 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.220
 must be good 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.740
 she knows she has no chance 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.740
 a gymnast always makes the program 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.200
 gymnast too, by the way 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.290
 just as you have to finish at work as that job, even when it's somewhere 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.290
 against him 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.640
 look it is a split jump with head in the neck 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.030
 at a transhipment hall, transhipment turns forward 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.280
 and the driving behavior 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.820
 she also masters all techniques 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.890
 team don't mind I'm against you wrong 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.890
 jump off 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.120
 a few places free 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.620
 The viewer faces face for most wanted Mustafina is it a competition 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.940
 who only want this is 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.040
 and if it doesn't win 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040
 it is the anp but there it is this face 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.650
 that says bad enough 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.770
 6 from romania 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.720
 yes so far all the most decorated disciplines are always with those 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.799
 half turn yes then you might be just a few centimeters 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.679
 a little body heat points from the center of the bar 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.939
 and then you just can't keep that, she probably has at the sales 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.769
 when early to turn already deployed 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.950
 that you have to wait a little longer, but those are also fractions or hundredths of 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:25.999
 seconds 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.889
 who will say watch your feet here 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:32.449
 no they are not completely used left foot but the right not yes 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.449
 whatever goes, the jury deals with this 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.159
 the jury watches the front footsteps keeper catches Piet de Jong 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.349
 so the rear tells nothing so there according to the band deduction for get the 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.379
 technology but the triple count is counted 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.769
 he looks disappointment, then, even when he is already talking about himself 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.959
 from the ten minutes that come for the television then comes the protected radio 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.719
 eyes of anger 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.719
 but not of course off to the rest of Romanian 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.719
 you learn seven yourself 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.879
 because if you want to become a star look the tears come 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.009
 if you want to be the star, you just want to get inside 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:09.769
 and then you can't have it 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.760
 If you lose yourself because it is actually you lose yourself 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.760
 they are not just opponents, but only supporters 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.239
 the orchestra is now at the first place and we have forest after us 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.169
 moestafina was going to be a finalist 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:32.479
 she scores five points 90 for the difficulty level and certainly eighty six 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.149
 points 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:35.859
 among the six cores that want to see sporting 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:36.669
 and with that state
