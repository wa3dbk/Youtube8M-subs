trainer people often ask me if they need

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.940 
trainer people often ask me if they need
extra<00:00:20.300> protein<00:00:20.840> when<00:00:21.050> they<00:00:21.170> start<00:00:21.470> training

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
extra protein when they start training

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.580 
extra protein when they start training
and<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:22.340> answer<00:00:22.730> is<00:00:22.850> yes<00:00:23.210> but<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.170> kinds<00:00:24.529> of

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
and the answer is yes but the kinds of
