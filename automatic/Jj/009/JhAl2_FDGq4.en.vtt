00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
step higher on the g string than where

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.680 
step higher on the g string than where
my<00:00:51.490> first<00:00:51.730> finger<00:00:51.940> is

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
and I've got a D chord and I go like

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.230 
and I've got a D chord and I go like
this<00:01:08.040> let's<00:01:09.040> learn<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.610> notes<00:01:09.790> of<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.090> melody

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
this let's learn the notes of the melody

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.440 
this let's learn the notes of the melody
so<00:01:10.750> it's<00:01:10.840> where<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:11.620> note<00:01:11.800> is<00:01:11.979> right<00:01:12.160> there

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.130 

this<00:01:16.450> is<00:01:16.570> all<00:01:16.690> over<00:01:16.870> D<00:01:17.110> chord<00:01:17.350> so<00:01:17.500> far<00:01:19.110> pinky<00:01:20.110> a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
this is all over D chord so far pinky a

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.149 
this is all over D chord so far pinky a
whole<00:01:20.380> step<00:01:20.560> our<00:01:21.510> pinky<00:01:22.510> off<00:01:22.659> again<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.740> in

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
whole step our pinky off again and in

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:34.710 
whole step our pinky off again and in
that<00:01:24.310> string<00:01:24.580> open<00:01:25.200> so

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.390 

then<00:01:36.900> forth<00:01:37.900> what<00:01:38.290> we<00:01:38.440> call<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.740> forthright<00:01:39.190> 1

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
then forth what we call the forthright 1

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:49.190 
then forth what we call the forthright 1
2<00:01:39.670> 3<00:01:39.910> 4<00:01:40.210> from<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.510> capo<00:01:40.840> on<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.260> D<00:01:41.440> string

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.160 

and<00:01:49.439> that's<00:01:50.280> all<00:01:50.580> with<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.270> concept<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> D

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and that's all with the concept of the D

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:10.510 
and that's all with the concept of the D
chord

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.590 

so<00:02:11.520> if<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.640> look<00:02:11.790> at<00:02:11.880> my<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.240> hand<00:02:12.270> you

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
so if you look at my right hand you

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.510 
so if you look at my right hand you
could<00:02:12.750> kind<00:02:12.960> of<00:02:13.020> just<00:02:13.230> strum<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.340> higher

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
could kind of just strum it the higher

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:24.410 
could kind of just strum it the higher
strings

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.580 

so<00:02:25.420> let<00:02:25.630> me<00:02:25.720> show<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.900> what<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.290> have<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:26.560> far

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
so let me show you what we have so far

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.460 
so let me show you what we have so far
we<00:02:26.830> have

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.890 

so<00:02:34.470> when<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:34.920> get<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:35.880> dead<00:02:36.180> on

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
so when I get to that then I go dead on

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.700 
so when I get to that then I go dead on
you<00:02:37.290> know<00:02:37.410> on<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.460 

then<00:02:41.310> I'm<00:02:41.430> gonna<00:02:41.550> hit<00:02:41.930> second<00:02:42.930> fret<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
then I'm gonna hit second fret on the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.770 
then I'm gonna hit second fret on the
d-string

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.760 

then<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.990> open<00:02:49.530> g<00:02:49.680> string<00:02:49.970> see<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.770> then

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
then the open g string see that then

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.760 
then the open g string see that then
fourth<00:02:53.220> fret<00:02:53.460> on<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.580> d-string

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
fourth fret on the d-string

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.380 
fourth fret on the d-string
and<00:02:55.860> then<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.640> D<00:02:56.760> chord

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
and then the D chord

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:15.280 
and then the D chord
so<00:02:58.990> let<00:02:59.410> me<00:02:59.500> do<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.710> normal

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.410 

so<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.500> remember<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:16.860> hit<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:17.310> note<00:03:17.550> and

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
so just remember I hit this note and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.390 
so just remember I hit this note and
then<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.110> open<00:03:19.530> g<00:03:19.710> string<00:03:19.740> which<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.220> this

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
then the open g string which is this

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.850 
then the open g string which is this
string<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:20.940> open<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:21.630> try<00:03:22.380> not<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.740> your

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
string but open so try not to have your

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.320 
string but open so try not to have your
first<00:03:23.070> finger<00:03:23.340> block<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:25.880> in<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.630> one<00:03:29.330> fourth

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
first finger block it in this one fourth

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:51.300 
first finger block it in this one fourth
on<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.540> D<00:03:30.780> string<00:03:30.810> D<00:03:31.650> chord

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:04:06.540 

one<00:03:51.880> more<00:03:52.060> time<00:03:55.320> one<00:03:56.320> more<00:03:56.380> time<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:06.250> then<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.430> go

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
one more time one more time so then I go

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.770 
one more time one more time so then I go
to<00:04:06.610> a<00:04:06.730> C<00:04:06.970> chord<00:04:07.770> so<00:04:08.770> you<00:04:08.830> hit<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.850> third<00:04:10.450> fret

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
to a C chord so you hit the third fret

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.020 
to a C chord so you hit the third fret
with<00:04:10.959> your<00:04:11.080> ring<00:04:11.230> finger<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:12.400> form<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.850> C

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
with your ring finger you form the C

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.790 
with your ring finger you form the C
chord<00:04:13.360> but<00:04:13.630> you're<00:04:13.780> gonna<00:04:13.870> just<00:04:14.380> hit<00:04:14.620> this

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.880 

then<00:04:22.000> middle<00:04:22.540> finger<00:04:22.960> on<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.110> second<00:04:23.680> fret<00:04:23.710> of
