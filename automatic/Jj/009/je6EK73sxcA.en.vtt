 (rock music)

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.607 size:88% position:44%
 - My name is Yannis Pappas,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.776
 I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.344
 Apparently 26 percent Turkish,

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:13.413 size:88% position:44%
 just found that out
 from Ancestry.com.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.647
- [Man] Oh yeah, you logged on?

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.149 size:84% position:42%
  - Yeah, which is
  crazy 'cause like

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.784
Turks and Greeks
hate each other.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:22.288
 So I'm 26 percent the
 enemy in Greek's eyes.

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.323 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That was probably
 during the Ottoman Era

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:25.792
 when there was a lot of rape,

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.094 size:84% position:42%
  I can't say rape on here.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.431 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.632 size:84% position:42%
  We're done right?

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:33.599 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That's what you
 guys wanted to know?

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:34.434
Is that what you came here for?

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.169 size:88% position:44%
  - [Man] We got it.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.673 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - No big thrill
 when people saw me.

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:42.542
 Just like, oh yeah,
 he's always been here.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.477 size:88% position:44%
 I didn't get that chance to
 make that big announcement.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.180
 Guys would come from
 New Orleans or Boston,

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.581
 they step on the comedy scene

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.216 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and they've already
 had their like

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:51.484
 polished 20 minutes.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:52.852 align:start size:88% position:13%
And they come like, have
you seen the new guy?

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.253
 I've just always been

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:55.555
around.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:58.391
 Like the Empire State
 Building, just there.

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:00.293
 I kinda just tried to
 build my own fan base.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.463 
  I did a couple characters
  that got popular.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.498 
  And I think a lot of
  people started finding out

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.801 align:start size:88% position:13%
 about my stand up
 through my characters.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:10.803
 I just moved down to Miami for

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:13.272
 my television show down there.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.240 size:88% position:44%
  You been to Miami?

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:15.808 size:88% position:44%
  Anyone been to Miami ever?

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:16.909
(cheers)

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:20.780 
 It's kinda like if New York
 and LA had a baby right?

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:25.118
 And that baby developed a coke
 problem, it would be Miami.

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:27.220 
  It's the most superficial
  town in existence.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.788
I mean BMW's are like Hyundais.

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:32.158 
  You can see like 10 purple
  Lamborghinis in a day.

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.093 size:88% position:44%
 Fake asses.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.361
 I moved down from New York and
 I had like a New York body,

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:37.096
 you know what I mean?

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:38.431
 I was like 30 pounds heavier,

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.366 align:start size:88% position:13%
my body looked like
yogurt with hair in it.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.103 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I looked like a
 relief pitcher for the

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:45.671 size:88% position:44%
 Kansas City Royals.

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:49.809
 I come in for on batter, I'm
 a lefty on lefty specialist.

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:53.579 size:88% position:44%
 - [Man] Are you doing your
 Boston joke here in Boston?

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:57.316
 - My Boston joke was
 in the submission,

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.185
but I just had a
meeting upstairs

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:02.021
 and they're like, why
 don't we stay safe.

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.624 align:start size:88% position:13%
 You could tell Boston
 is a shitty city

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:06.159 size:84% position:42%
  based on,

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:08.161 align:start size:88% position:13%
you ever notice that
every movie about Boston

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:11.797 align:start size:88% position:13%
is about some guy trying
to get out of Boston?

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.332
 If I see you here
 in the morning Will,

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:15.134
I will fucking kill you myself.

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:17.436
 Boston treats New York
 like we used to date

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.105
 way back in the day.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.040 
 And then like we moved on
 with our life and became great

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:23.342 
  and Boston is just like
  stalking our Facebook page

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:24.610 size:84% position:42%
  everyday.

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:26.345
And I just wanna be like
Boston, let it go dude.

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:28.347 size:88% position:44%
 Alright, we are way
 outta your league.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.615
 Go date Philadelphia.

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:31.651 align:start size:88% position:13%
  You guys got a lot
  more in common.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:34.220 align:start size:88% position:13%
Go be mediocre and
racist together forever.

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:36.055 align:start size:88% position:13%
Yell about your
quarterback in a fucking

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:38.157 size:84% position:42%
  bar every Sunday.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.625 
  I mean it's the only city
  where you walk around

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:40.726 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and you're like,
 does this whole city

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:44.130 
work in the athletic department
of the Boston Red Sox?

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.232 size:88% position:44%
 They gotta wear fucking Red
 Sox attire the whole time?

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:50.103 
  Some fucking judge wearing
  a big Poppy jersey.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.740
