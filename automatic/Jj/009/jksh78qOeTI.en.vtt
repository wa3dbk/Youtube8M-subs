00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.670 

we<00:02:11.510> get<00:02:11.660> one<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.930> cameras<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.410> kind<00:02:12.560> of

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
we get one of the cameras to kind of

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.380 
we get one of the cameras to kind of
zoom<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.070> real<00:02:13.400> quick<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:13.820> basically<00:02:14.240> I'm

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
zoom in real quick but basically I'm

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.560 
zoom in real quick but basically I'm
going<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.600> reach<00:02:14.720> over<00:02:14.930> here<00:02:16.120> if<00:02:17.120> I'm<00:02:17.300> pushing

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
changing the patterns there so again

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.530 
changing the patterns there so again
there's<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.240> total<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:24.430> 31<00:02:25.540> different

something<00:02:35.630> interesting<00:02:35.840> about<00:02:36.380> this<00:02:36.710> I'm

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
something interesting about this I'm

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.990 
something interesting about this I'm
going<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.040> zip<00:02:37.160> around<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.610> side<00:02:37.820> of<00:02:37.850> the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
going to zip around to the side of the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.570 
going to zip around to the side of the
vehicle<00:02:39.550> as<00:02:40.550> I<00:02:40.700> go<00:02:40.880> in<00:02:41.060> here<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.950> grab<00:02:43.220> this

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.270 

basically<00:02:46.580> this<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.890> equipment<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.100> you

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
basically this is the equipment that you

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.830 
basically this is the equipment that you
would<00:02:49.400> need<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.700> mount<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:50.300> inside<00:02:50.690> the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
would need to mount this inside the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.630 
would need to mount this inside the
vehicle<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.320> where<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.680> mounts<00:02:52.220> inside<00:02:52.340> the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
vehicle and where this mounts inside the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.010 
vehicle and where this mounts inside the
vehicle<00:02:52.940> take<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.150> look<00:02:53.330> up<00:02:53.450> at<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.630> front<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:53.960> a

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
vehicle take a look up at the front in a

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.440 
vehicle take a look up at the front in a
second<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:54.950> basically<00:02:55.130> mounts<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:56.030> where

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
second but it basically mounts in where

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.360 
second but it basically mounts in where
the<00:02:56.630> Sun<00:02:56.870> Visor<00:02:57.140> goes<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:57.830> you've<00:02:58.040> got<00:02:58.220> your

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
the Sun Visor goes so you've got your

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.250 
the Sun Visor goes so you've got your
visor<00:02:58.580> left<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.150> right<00:02:59.270> passenger<00:02:59.780> side<00:02:59.990> and

visor left and right passenger side and
this<00:03:00.680> bracket<00:03:01.130> rehear<00:03:01.550> will<00:03:01.910> allow<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.180> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
this bracket rehear will allow you to

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.960 
this bracket rehear will allow you to
mount<00:03:02.660> this<00:03:03.020> particular<00:03:03.470> product<00:03:03.920> up<00:03:04.550> in<00:03:04.820> that

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
mount this particular product up in that

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.940 
mount this particular product up in that
area<00:03:05.390> now<00:03:05.720> there's<00:03:05.900> two<00:03:06.020> different<00:03:06.050> variances

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
area now there's two different variances

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.670 
area now there's two different variances
of<00:03:07.010> this<00:03:07.250> this<00:03:07.430> happens<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.880> be<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.440> 44<00:03:09.440> so

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
of this this happens to be the 44 so

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.010 
of this this happens to be the 44 so
it's<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.950> one-piece<00:03:10.550> again<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.630> can<00:03:11.780> mount<00:03:11.900> it

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
it's a one-piece again you can mount it

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.570 
it's a one-piece again you can mount it
on<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.260> back<00:03:12.470> deck<00:03:12.710> you<00:03:12.980> can<00:03:13.160> mount<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.430> up

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
on the back deck you can mount it up

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.870 
on the back deck you can mount it up
front<00:03:13.820> if<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.270> decide<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.870> do<00:03:15.050> so<00:03:15.880> let's

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
front if you decide to do so let's

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.240 
front if you decide to do so let's

quickly tros down the the cover here and

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.790 
quickly tros down the the cover here and
we<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.430> kind<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.700> see<00:03:22.940> this<00:03:23.620> through<00:03:24.620> the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
we can kind of see this through the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.570 
we can kind of see this through the
tinted<00:03:25.390> rear<00:03:26.390> of<00:03:26.540> this<00:03:26.690> particular<00:03:27.580> demo

now<00:03:32.470> again<00:03:32.680> it's<00:03:32.830> not<00:03:32.950> pushed<00:03:33.250> right<00:03:33.459> up

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
now again it's not pushed right up

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.520 
now again it's not pushed right up
