00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.589
 Hello everyone, Artem Cardan I am with you 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.040
 all love and so the card called 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.150
 bell chapter one is called where am i 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.710
 card to do so and whether geographically 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.260
 some rules for getting the most 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.270
 buzz don't break anything builds nothing 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.410
 follow the story after reading 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.779
 break the glass a year or two where che so 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.230
 the plot you are the head of one of the mafiosi why 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.460
 scream zombies i don't understand you can 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.370
 slightly quieter 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.980
 according to the plot you are the head of one of the mafia 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.320
 clans italy and after one successful 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.090
 raids on guard order you woke up 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.600
 here why is my root so strong 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.760
 ring ears take one sole 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.640
 it means breaking the whole cheek without any problems 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.680
 now we break I don't know if it makes sense 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.160
 We do not completely break the signs 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.270
 are needed 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.489
 a duck further so tv interference 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.040
 hi i want to play a game with you 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.200
 killed too often and to do it 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.570
 you should have been right but you 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.659
 I did it for my pleasure now I 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.460
 here and now it's your turn 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.729
 act as a victim of the very beginning 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.500
 you inhale your awakening 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:25.890
 neurotoxin that will kill you in two 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:29.280
 hours of years for the game Brain and what are they that 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.540
 he is right on my hands really 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 a lot of blood i deserved this little chest 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.009
 take everything you want from here let me remind you 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.759
 at any moment you can die therefore 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.180
 be more economical in may bastard what am i 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.240
 take why why in english so 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.649
 clock okay clock and take two apples i 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.720
 I hope I will not die 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.870
 41 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.480
 what are these fire resist and 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.340
 honestly I do nâ€™t remember what these are for 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.700
 cocktails okay so why are there pens 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.630
 probably worth a look at the lever here they are 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.500
 so and the second 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:14.130
 and second yes he is completely these two pen 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.100
 fully opens the door and so is the speaker 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.380
 speaker and so is your first test this 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.570
 the metaphor of how you made people 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.290
 dance to your pipe now 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.820
 you dance about 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.540
 how can I jump read I can 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.260
 die and my children let me out 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.260
 from here i want 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:46.770
 I'm scared I will not die so okay collected 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:47.580
 gathered gathered gathered where where 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.370
 turned out to be 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.820
 so after an unsuccessful attempt i am i 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.650
 try again so half the things out 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.250
 burned me only two apples left 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.040
 but generally fine okay I take two at once 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.690
 so then again, why take a risk 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.750
 it's easy to go there right now 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:14.610
 only I am the winner so there will already be 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.190
 harder on my why I hurt me 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.019
 jumped in fact it's scary 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.890
 process with if i think i'm gonna drop like 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:30.570
 I have no choice to take the risk 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:33.810
 jump right there it will hurt me and 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.530
 I really hurt the attempt number 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.239
 three 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.549
 try to go oh yeah fine so after 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.459
 several failures do not ask to download the map 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.290
 again and i will now go through the same 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.630
 place again and it seems I understood why 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.459
 these drinks are so go sign 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.430
 here are these potions 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.739
 about in Russian fire potion up but i 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.910
 so basically suspected countries that all 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.870
 became in Russian 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.410
 and so okay that these goals are one more all 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.180
 so we now knock the potion out of the big 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.700
 sign go out of here i said her with 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.500
 great confidence and jump us 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.530
 nevermind we can besides even can here 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.170
 go hot and hot krisu berchu 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.160
 pot and so but it seems I have no choice 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.960
 have to risk and jump I jumped about 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.640
 yes I fail somewhere we are fine 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.600
 we go on we go on we go on 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:34.260
 further further adore further so 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:39.800
 stop i stopped at all see nothing 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:44.330
 nothing is visible where to live and ago 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:50.070
 fine well finally so and that yes 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:54.930
 where am I not? where am I to go ? 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:58.770
 fight up and here are the words here is water in 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.100
 Well, have I really got out ? I'm just great and 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:07.040
 so further your second test is 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.870
 death metaphor of zigzag 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:15.419
 note from the author to heighten the effect 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:18.830
 you should run a zigzag all so stop then 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.830
 I will run now these plates will 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.910
 I burn I hit the arrow and I'm not alive 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.800
 in fact I was thinking of stepping on plates 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.290
 they will fail so now 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.160
 Of course, the abyss and there water does not mean 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.170
 nothing scary cakes cakes such 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.160
 that is, you can not eat skin before 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:43.140
 Do we continue to write the game in skype 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.670
 of course continues dude of course we want 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.530
 Ali to cardboard was pretty 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.130
 interesting and complicated not even first 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.420
 times and she went this way to finish 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.540
