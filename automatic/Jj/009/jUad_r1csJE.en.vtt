now<00:03:51.199> I<00:03:52.689> mentioned<00:03:53.689> obviously<00:03:54.019> this<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.439> be

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
now I mentioned obviously this to be

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.259 
now I mentioned obviously this to be
looked<00:03:54.709> at<00:03:54.769> as<00:03:54.889> either<00:03:55.040> a<00:03:55.189> remake<00:03:55.609> or<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:55.849> sequel

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
looked at as either a remake or a sequel

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.819 
looked at as either a remake or a sequel
so<00:03:56.299> it<00:03:56.509> really<00:03:56.689> follows<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.139> same<00:03:57.319> story<00:03:57.680> as

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
so it really follows the same story as

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.640 
so it really follows the same story as
the<00:03:57.979> original<00:03:58.310> Deathstalker<00:03:59.560> but<00:04:00.560> it

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
the original Deathstalker but it

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.710 
the original Deathstalker but it
actually<00:04:01.129> uses<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.639> lot<00:04:01.879> of<00:04:01.909> footage<00:04:02.269> from<00:04:02.599> that

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
actually uses a lot of footage from that

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.270 
actually uses a lot of footage from that
film<00:04:03.139> so<00:04:03.919> really<00:04:04.549> in<00:04:04.669> two<00:04:04.879> places<00:04:05.239> so<00:04:05.659> that<00:04:05.720> the

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
film so really in two places so that the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.199 
film so really in two places so that the
where<00:04:07.280> they<00:04:07.400> when<00:04:07.579> they're<00:04:07.639> kind<00:04:07.819> of<00:04:07.849> in<00:04:08.000> the

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
where they when they're kind of in the

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.809 
where they when they're kind of in the
in<00:04:08.659> the<00:04:08.900> castle<00:04:09.459> when<00:04:10.459> they're<00:04:10.579> doing<00:04:10.759> the

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
in the castle when they're doing the

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.580

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
quite a long sort of scene and basically
