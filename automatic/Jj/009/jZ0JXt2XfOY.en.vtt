 pros 14,45 you all go very well 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.570
 but for my part, I'm fine 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.490
 the good shape fishing everything he 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.110
 need to make a great video like 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.790
 so usually today we get 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.380
 so find for a new video of 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.480
 presentation as you could see at 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.850
 the screen so it's a water product that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.190
 comes from the mobile site 24 point fr so 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.350
 which is priced at 34 euros 60 so is 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.360
 a classic jabra bluetooth headset 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.070
 me so it's a very good product so 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.680
 for those who have a car and who 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.260
 want to do courses and be able to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.600
 call 3 he's lying without having a pv 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.040
 or other is pretty practical so then 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.390
 this is an atrium so I removed 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.040
 right now their ride so for you 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.840
 show laureate in the summer 10 months ago the 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.070
 like this good I had to remove it because 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.170
 that it's actually going well 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.300
 stalled in rice factory mode but it's a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.710
 pure impossible to put back in with the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 plastic so remove them otherwise 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.710
 would come back to the site I would put you 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.300
 product links or see how it 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.009
 was all packed so I still 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.289
 so managed to put it back for you 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.600
 so show up there if the little pack of 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.100
 times where you can see hop with so 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.619
 everything they cables from 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.850
 reloading and high so in fact you 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.920
 can also see small 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.390
 information about the box 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 either it's a classic box 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.220
 as indicated on the so on the name 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780
 of the product picking it up is a very very 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.610
 good product so for now I 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.409
 so found to have done everything was 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.560
 to open so we show you a little 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.850
 little of me if it's a little crazy the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.170
 time that I wish you all that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.369
 so the content but a magnet dancing 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.770
 quickly I'll be able to show you a 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.509
 parent so then regarding so the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.460
 content of the box so you have 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.750
 also a headset so of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.280
 spare so what allows you to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.750
 put then is an earlobe 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.310
 in fact it seemed so in May that 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.990
 ordered you spare as you case 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.460
 it's nice enough it gives you 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.960
 so also a second 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.369
 so headset we'll say it's 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.440
 rather a rubber to protect 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.729
 Lorraine so you hear an old 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.869
 second so that's pretty cool what 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.850
 underlies quarters of time we end up 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.619
 the locker sort of things and that's it you 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.569
 allows to have a spare but 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.430
 you also have the cable of 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.530
 recharge request ok on sector 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.000
 but if I think my opinion should buy it 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.110
 to speak as you see if you want 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.400
 from the city other products I think 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.870
 that you have to buy them separately on 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.110
 internet which will allow you to 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.989
 so reload directly via usb so 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.220
 by car 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.170
 after that so so what about 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.000
 contains the frac so that's marked 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.920
 to register my product so in 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.640
 cause it's a real official product of 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.230
 the mark 0 after concerning others 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.790
 so this is the notice all the paperwork 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.860
 good as what you should not use it 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.360
 too strong gubler without you know a 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.980
 little blah, so it's the same 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.060
 soon mom have watched so the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.370
 notice so will try to find her 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.269
 in french racing at 10 o'clock 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.080
 go downstairs it's very simple so 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.060
 the anoci what we could see 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.400
 connection instruction so it takes 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.890
 activate therefore the ear placed on the market 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.930
 so does not appear jose sugar the afssa sound 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.220
 pay a little faster 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.810
 so then laureate she introduces herself 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.420
 so like these there you can see 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.769
 the button whose blue tooth and the button 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.000
 from the top so in fact it's the battery 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.150
 so in fact you have to put it up 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.130
 like that to light it there you see a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.320
 slight depression so we can press 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.120
 this is the button so pick up and 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.670
 simply hang up or put in 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.150
 stop or else there is the cable of 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.650
 reloading so with the frame that we 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.390
 reloads successful heart but I 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.140
 think you have to buy something 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.030
 wronged and that's the +1 button that 1 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.470
 therefore allows you no willpower and 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.610
 lower the volume so that is really 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.810
 good quality what I have all the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.980
 time noted style make front one hears 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.930
 really well there are other things one 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.280
 do not hear well so I'm going 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.510
 says you value him but to show you 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.910
 a little bit how it works 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.040
 so here it should come on 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.989
 so there he will speak to speak to me in 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.130
 German but well we understand is past 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.900
 to 1 to understand it's just when we 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.380
 the lit one reads in blue tooth so he 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.970
 will flash 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.340
 so I'm going to show you on my 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.140
 phone in how we read it in blue 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.459
 tooth in fact it's very simple you 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.620
 press blue tooth so me she is 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.260
 already he is already operated so jabra 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.459
 classic v10 5 2 so we're going to 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.870
 explain how it works for those 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.400
 who buy it supposed to mark time there 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.230
 in the notice in fact you have to support 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.269
 so 5 this in three seconds 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.170
 excuse me three seconds on it and 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.490
 it is necessary 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.380
 so activate the button is actually 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.730
 activating the three seconds in 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.410
 staying pressed this will help to 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.239
 trigger the search for route or a 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.000
 new device so after he you 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.650
 just have to connect sums so there 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.940
 it's looking for the 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.520
 connection soon after in tron level 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.750
 led poite device is connected me 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.250
 I do not want to wait for this 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.510
 hour a year ago I'm wrong I know 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.710
 you're in five or shower was telling me 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.440
 also so here it is connected as 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.370
 can see on the screen connected I was 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.660
 putting a speaker on you 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.250
 touch tell me what's the good worry 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.990
 so otherwise things I wanted to 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.080
 tell you c they also did 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.430
 no application dron jabra attends 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.530
 so that is available on the apple 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.120
 store and android store so see built 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.889
 you just have to download it 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.930
 toral stated in the record is like 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.610
 that I found them so connect a 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.440
 jaguar almost so they explain you 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.650
 for those who are a little bit and who would have 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.970
 chosen I explain to you how it was 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.470
 how to connect it as facts 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.850
 currently to find my cat is going 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.200
 so that's if you lose it you can 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.280
 find him too much of my car 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.320
 it's if you want it's your job 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.970
 in the car and guides so that's 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.450
 always good to have a little 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.010
 some information for those who 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.080
 not sure where that would be so 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.820
 it's still pretty practical could see 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.340
 at the top we will try to show you 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.570
 the screen so at the top right I try 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.370
 to show with my right ends 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.570
 to use on the battery the very first 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.919
 trick so that's the battery that's me 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.750
 so stay in my bluetooth device 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.070
 and that's the blue tooth look and there 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.910
 it's localization like koné but this 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.320
 which is really the air is we see 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.140
 the bluetooth but still the battery 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.890
 so two the headset directly on 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.870
 the phone 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.580
 So therefore this is for my darker hand 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.810
 a good product that will allow you to 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.850
 make your life easier for me I think 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.539
 that it's going to make me cite it too so 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.910
 that's why I recommend it 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.560
 especially for a very very good price 34 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.880
 euros and some is not excessive 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.620
 one way I will put all the links 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.580
 useful in the description if you have 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.440
 questions as usual do not hesitate 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.060
 not at my request and on Skype or at 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.140
 total on all information will be 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.700
 in the description 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.860
 on this I tell you soon see people 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.860
 for a next video go ciao bye
