taking<00:05:39.570> a<00:05:39.690> risk<00:05:39.870> with<00:05:39.990> this<00:05:40.139> movie<00:05:40.409> I<00:05:40.440> think

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
taking a risk with this movie I think

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.839 
taking a risk with this movie I think
just<00:05:40.919> at<00:05:41.009> the<00:05:41.070> did<00:05:41.190> with<00:05:41.310> guardians<00:05:41.669> but<00:05:41.820> I
