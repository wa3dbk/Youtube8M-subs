animation<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:27.660> think<00:04:28.590> they're<00:04:28.710> quite

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800

effective<00:04:29.250> actually

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.940 

to<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.870> animation<00:04:44.350> for<00:04:44.410> example<00:04:44.770> for<00:04:44.890> the

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
to the animation for example for the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
again you know that that's good

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.860 
again you know that that's good
it<00:05:11.300> gets<00:05:11.630> settled<00:05:11.930> but<00:05:12.170> it's<00:05:12.320> there

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
it gets settled but it's there

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.930 
it gets settled but it's there
