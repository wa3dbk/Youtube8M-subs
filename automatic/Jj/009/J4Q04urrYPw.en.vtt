00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
oils and that is grapeseed oil I've been

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.690 
oils and that is grapeseed oil I've been
using<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.589> for<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.859> past<00:00:08.010> couple<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.519> months

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
using this for the past couple of months

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.030 
using this for the past couple of months
because<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.210> heard<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:09.750> Megan<00:00:10.260> Fox<00:00:10.559> actually

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
because I heard that Megan Fox actually

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.100 
because I heard that Megan Fox actually
uses<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.429> as<00:00:11.670> like<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> body<00:00:12.179> moisturizer<00:00:12.750> so

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
uses this as like a body moisturizer so

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.390 
uses this as like a body moisturizer so
I<00:00:13.139> thought<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.740> try<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.009> out

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
I thought to try it out

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.939 
I thought to try it out
I<00:00:14.660> usually<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:15.960> stick<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.230> coconut<00:00:16.619> oil<00:00:16.800> when

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
I usually just stick to coconut oil when

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.490 
I usually just stick to coconut oil when
it<00:00:17.070> comes<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.550> oils<00:00:18.119> for<00:00:18.300> my<00:00:18.449> body<00:00:18.660> because<00:00:19.230> I

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
it comes to oils for my body because I

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.349 
it comes to oils for my body because I
don't<00:00:19.680> know<00:00:19.740> let's<00:00:19.949> let<00:00:20.189> everybody<00:00:20.490> seems<00:00:21.119> to

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
don't know let's let everybody seems to

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.570 
don't know let's let everybody seems to
use<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.350> got<00:00:22.529> pretty<00:00:22.710> curious<00:00:23.100> about<00:00:23.369> this

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
use but I got pretty curious about this

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.880 
use but I got pretty curious about this
one<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.180> decided<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> buy<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.170> from<00:00:25.410> vitacost

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
one so I decided to buy it from vitacost

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.460 
one so I decided to buy it from vitacost
of<00:00:26.099> course<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.640> will<00:00:27.599> link<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.990> place<00:00:28.199> where<00:00:28.410> you

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
of course I will link a place where you

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.470 
of course I will link a place where you
can<00:00:28.590> buy<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.800> down<00:00:29.130> below<00:00:29.369> grapeseed<00:00:30.269> is

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
can buy this down below grapeseed is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.350

rich<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.960> linoleic<00:00:31.610> acid<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.940> think<00:00:33.239> that's

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
rich and linoleic acid I think that's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.040 
rich and linoleic acid I think that's
how<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.510> say<00:00:33.780> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
how you say it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.310 
how you say it
linoleic<00:00:34.700> mañalac<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:36.000> think<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.510> anyways

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
linoleic mañalac I think so anyways

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.590 
linoleic mañalac I think so anyways
that's<00:00:37.770> really<00:00:38.340> great<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:38.910> skin<00:00:39.360> it's

an omega-6 so it's really helpful for

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.799 
an omega-6 so it's really helpful for
anti<00:00:43.020> aging<00:00:43.309> omega-6<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.820> help<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.480> your

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
throughout the day and I use this on my

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200 
throughout the day and I use this on my
face<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.559> use<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.100> my<00:00:56.219> body<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:57.000> like

face I use this on my body I really like

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.090 
face I use this on my body I really like
it<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.629> because<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.050> very<00:00:58.350> lightweight

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
it just because it's very lightweight

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.389 
it just because it's very lightweight
and<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:01.140> sings<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.649> skin<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.129> away

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and it sings into my skin right away

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.280 
and it sings into my skin right away
that's<00:01:03.059> kind<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.390> thing<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.719> coconut<00:01:04.110> oil

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that's kind of thing with coconut oil

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.870 
that's kind of thing with coconut oil
that<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.439> don't<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.860> using<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> body

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that I don't like using as a body

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.450 
that I don't like using as a body
moisturizer<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.950> doesn't<00:01:08.280> sink

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
moisturizer is because it doesn't sink

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.520 
moisturizer is because it doesn't sink
into<00:01:08.610> my<00:01:08.760> skin<00:01:09.060> very<00:01:09.090> fast<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.260> feel<00:01:10.290> like

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
into my skin very fast and I feel like

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.899 
into my skin very fast and I feel like
it<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.740> kind<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.920> sits<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.250> top<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.549> my<00:01:11.640> skin

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
it just kind of sits on top of my skin

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.210 
it just kind of sits on top of my skin
for<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.210> little<00:01:12.390> while<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.780> still<00:01:13.500> really<00:01:14.070> like

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
for a little while I still really like

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
for a little while I still really like
using<00:01:14.670> coconut<00:01:14.880> oil<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> feel<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.750> with

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
using coconut oil but I feel like with

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600 
using coconut oil but I feel like with
grapeseed<00:01:16.350> oil<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.770> don't<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.490> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
grapeseed oil I don't really have to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.969 
grapeseed oil I don't really have to
worry<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:19.110> sinking<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:19.740> away

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
worry about it not sinking in right away

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.320 
worry about it not sinking in right away
kind<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> lighter<00:01:20.640> oil<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.210> moisturizes

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
kind of a lighter oil and it moisturizes

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.570 
kind of a lighter oil and it moisturizes
just<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.200> much<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.590> coconut<00:01:23.009> oil<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.369> not

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
just as much as coconut oil if not

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.160 
just as much as coconut oil if not
better<00:01:23.820> another<00:01:24.509> thing<00:01:24.780> that's<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.020> cool

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
better another thing that's really cool

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.810 
better another thing that's really cool
about<00:01:25.320> grapeseed<00:01:25.890> oil<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> helps<00:01:26.640> reduce

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
about grapeseed oil is it helps reduce

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.730 
about grapeseed oil is it helps reduce
your<00:01:27.270> dark<00:01:27.689> circles<00:01:28.080> underneath<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.590> eyes

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
your dark circles underneath your eyes

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.980 
your dark circles underneath your eyes
which<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.479> been<00:01:30.659> trying<00:01:30.930> that

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
which I have and I have been trying that

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.359 
which I have and I have been trying that
out<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.500> think<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> works

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
out and I do think it works

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.429 
out and I do think it works
not<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.729> dramatically<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:33.900> me<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.200> least

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
not like dramatically for me at least

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.350 
not like dramatically for me at least
but<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.100> definitely<00:01:35.400> makes<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.700> difference
