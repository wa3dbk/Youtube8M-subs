 not easy to create not studded tire 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.059
 which works equally well on 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.609
 dry and wet snowy and icy 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.900

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.699
 this with realized innovations 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.859
 nokian hakkapeliitta r2 combines 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.230
 unique properties so we are sure 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.170
 what is the best non-studded winter tire 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.180
 for harsh winter conditions we always 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.090
 we use the most modern rubber 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.489
 mixes for our tires this time for 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.710

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.649
 added strong microparticles 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.379
 shaped crystals like this 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.629
 it looks like millions of multifaceted
