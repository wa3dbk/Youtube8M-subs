large enough that if I ever had to use

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.170 
large enough that if I ever had to use
this<00:01:10.660> as<00:01:10.960> a<00:01:10.990> weapon<00:01:11.350> it<00:01:11.770> was<00:01:12.070> going<00:01:12.369> to<00:01:12.550> work<00:01:12.910> it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
this as a weapon it was going to work it

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.780 
this as a weapon it was going to work it
was<00:01:13.360> going<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.690> be<00:01:13.869> a<00:01:14.250> pretty<00:01:15.250> decent

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
was going to be a pretty decent

right<00:01:29.740> concept<00:01:30.369> wise<00:01:30.700> I<00:01:31.200> think<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:33.280> pretty

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
right concept wise I think it's pretty

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.450 
right concept wise I think it's pretty
cool<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:35.170> whole<00:01:35.440> idea<00:01:35.680> was<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.220> make<00:01:36.430> a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
cool the whole idea was to make a

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.840

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
gets excited about training knives so I

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.899 
gets excited about training knives so I
wanted<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.509> to<00:02:02.200> create<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.950> cool<00:02:03.430> training

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
wanted to to create a cool training

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.520 
wanted to to create a cool training
knife<00:02:04.060> basically<00:02:04.630> so<00:02:04.780> that<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:05.229> was<00:02:05.409> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
knife basically so that that was the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.100 
knife basically so that that was the
original<00:02:05.710> concept<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.670> then<00:02:06.909> from<00:02:07.659> there

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
original concept and then from there

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.650 
original concept and then from there
like<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:09.040> said<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.340> has<00:02:09.549> a<00:02:09.820> multiple<00:02:10.509> multiple

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
like I said this has a multiple multiple

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.560 
like I said this has a multiple multiple
to<00:02:11.019> of<00:02:11.489> function<00:02:12.489> so<00:02:12.700> one<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.329> it

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
to of function so one is that it

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.630 
to of function so one is that it
actually<00:02:13.780> doubles<00:02:14.440> as<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.769> self-defense

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
actually doubles as the self-defense

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.819 
actually doubles as the self-defense
tool<00:02:15.940> because<00:02:16.329> it's<00:02:16.510> just<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:17.350> packs<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
tool because it's just that packs a

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.460 
tool because it's just that packs a
wallop<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:19.030> that's<00:02:19.390> serious<00:02:19.989> right<00:02:20.230> there

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
wallop that that's serious right there

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.360 
wallop that that's serious right there
it's<00:02:20.860> pretty<00:02:21.160> thick<00:02:21.579> it's<00:02:22.360> pretty<00:02:22.600> solid<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
it's pretty thick it's pretty solid the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.370 
it's pretty thick it's pretty solid the
other<00:02:24.549> thing<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.090> like<00:02:25.630> for<00:02:25.870> example<00:02:25.959> this

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
other thing is like for example this

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.170 
other thing is like for example this
hole<00:02:26.620> right<00:02:26.650> here<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.970> could

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
hole right here is so that you could

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.840 
hole right here is so that you could
store<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.989> razor<00:02:29.290> blade<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.950> then<00:02:30.400> these<00:02:30.579> holes

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
store a razor blade and then these holes

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.490 
store a razor blade and then these holes
right<00:02:31.000> here<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.049> could<00:02:32.170> actually

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
right here is so you could actually

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.130

weapons<00:02:49.469> right<00:02:49.709> there<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.760> was<00:02:51.000> kind<00:02:51.269> of

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
weapons right there so it was kind of

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.059 
weapons right there so it was kind of
inspired<00:02:51.629> by<00:02:52.019> that<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.620> then<00:02:52.829> right<00:02:53.040> here

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
inspired by that and then right here

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.830 
inspired by that and then right here
this<00:02:53.519> is<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:53.730> hole<00:02:54.030> where<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.390> could<00:02:54.569> put

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
this is a hole where you could put

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.110 
this is a hole where you could put
obviously<00:02:55.799> for<00:02:56.400> lanyard<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.299> also<00:02:59.120> pocket

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
obviously for lanyard and also pocket

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.190 
obviously for lanyard and also pocket
clip<00:03:00.329> or<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:03.090> could<00:03:03.269> put<00:03:03.450> these<00:03:03.599> bolts<00:03:04.049> on

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
clip or you could put these bolts on

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.679 
clip or you could put these bolts on
there<00:03:04.439> that<00:03:04.650> help<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.670> when<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.480> could<00:03:06.599> just

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
there that help you when you could just

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.470 
there that help you when you could just
put<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.079> in<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.799> your<00:03:08.639> pants<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.329> then

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
put this in on to your pants and then

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.300 
put this in on to your pants and then
the<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.659> bolt<00:03:10.109> sticking<00:03:10.439> out<00:03:10.650> would<00:03:10.889> hook<00:03:11.099> on

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the the bolt sticking out would hook on

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.530 
the the bolt sticking out would hook on
it<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.659> was<00:03:12.780> another<00:03:12.870> idea<00:03:13.409> right<00:03:13.620> there

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
it so that was another idea right there

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.729 
it so that was another idea right there
and<00:03:16.189> if<00:03:17.189> you<00:03:17.970> look<00:03:18.389> at<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.959> change<00:03:19.470> the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
and if you look at it I change the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.250 
and if you look at it I change the
handle<00:03:20.189> grip<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.970> this<00:03:21.180> where<00:03:21.450> i<00:03:21.480> put<00:03:22.079> this

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
handle grip to this where i put this

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.559 
handle grip to this where i put this
tape<00:03:22.769> on<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.069> and<00:03:23.489> this<00:03:23.639> has<00:03:23.819> like<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.150> cloth

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
tape on it and this has like this cloth

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.229 
tape on it and this has like this cloth
type<00:03:24.930> material<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.680> its<00:03:26.250> really<00:03:26.700> really

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
type material and its really really

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.849 
type material and its really really
comfortable<00:03:27.989> um<00:03:29.299> originally<00:03:30.299> I<00:03:30.329> had<00:03:30.569> a

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
comfortable um originally I had a

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.920 
comfortable um originally I had a
parachute<00:03:31.859> cord<00:03:32.220> put<00:03:32.579> on<00:03:32.730> there<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.180> looked<00:03:33.780> a

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
parachute cord put on there it looked a

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.710 
parachute cord put on there it looked a
lot<00:03:34.109> nicer<00:03:34.169> than<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:35.010> but<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:36.120> wasn't<00:03:36.599> as

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
lot nicer than this but it wasn't as

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.449 
lot nicer than this but it wasn't as
comfortable<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.439> that's<00:03:37.620> my<00:03:37.889> fault<00:03:37.950> that's

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
comfortable and that's my fault that's

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.670 
comfortable and that's my fault that's
because<00:03:38.849> my<00:03:39.090> skills<00:03:39.480> with<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.810> parachute<00:03:40.290> cord

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
because my skills with a parachute cord

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.819 
because my skills with a parachute cord
to<00:03:41.340> make<00:03:41.519> handle<00:03:41.939> wrap<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.720> no<00:03:42.959> good<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.560> so

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
to make handle wrap is is no good so so

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.589 
to make handle wrap is is no good so so
that's<00:03:44.010> my<00:03:44.159> own<00:03:44.340> fault<00:03:46.400> now<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:48.389> said<00:03:48.419> the

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
that's my own fault now like I said the

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.330 
that's my own fault now like I said the
concepts<00:03:49.199> a<00:03:49.260> lot<00:03:49.440> better<00:03:49.620> than<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.190> actual

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
concepts a lot better than the actual

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.939 
concepts a lot better than the actual
execution<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.449> execution<00:03:52.049> wise<00:03:52.199> i<00:03:52.229> feel<00:03:52.919> that

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
execution the execution wise i feel that

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.550 
execution the execution wise i feel that
this<00:03:53.400> is<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:54.329> handle<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.870> bit<00:03:55.079> too<00:03:55.290> long

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
this is a the handle is a bit too long

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.250 
this is a the handle is a bit too long
and<00:03:55.940> this<00:03:56.940> this<00:03:57.180> part<00:03:57.629> right<00:03:57.659> here<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:58.109> can

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
and this this part right here you can

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.189 
and this this part right here you can
see<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.560> sticks<00:03:59.040> out<00:03:59.389> right<00:04:00.389> there<00:04:00.659> and<00:04:00.870> that's

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
see it sticks out right there and that's

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.500 
see it sticks out right there and that's
that's<00:04:01.590> for<00:04:01.889> grip<00:04:02.250> right<00:04:02.639> for<00:04:03.299> grip

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
that's for grip right for grip

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.420 
that's for grip right for grip
prevention<00:04:04.139> so<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.680> doesn't<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.040> slip<00:04:05.310> out

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
prevention so it doesn't just slip out

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.189 
prevention so it doesn't just slip out
of<00:04:05.609> your<00:04:05.639> hand<00:04:05.940> but<00:04:06.479> it<00:04:06.599> doesn't<00:04:06.840> really<00:04:06.930> work

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
of your hand but it doesn't really work

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.860 
of your hand but it doesn't really work
because<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:07.769> too<00:04:08.040> long<00:04:08.250> alright<00:04:09.030> if<00:04:09.299> i<00:04:09.690> was

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
because it's too long alright if i was

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.539 
because it's too long alright if i was
going<00:04:10.049> to<00:04:10.109> put<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.709> needed<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.069> be<00:04:11.159> higher

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
going to put this it needed to be higher

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.030 
going to put this it needed to be higher
up<00:04:11.720> it<00:04:12.720> doesn't<00:04:12.989> really<00:04:13.139> take<00:04:13.349> effect<00:04:13.769> there

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
up it doesn't really take effect there

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.460 
up it doesn't really take effect there
and<00:04:14.280> actually<00:04:15.120> just<00:04:15.599> kind<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.810> stabs<00:04:16.139> into

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
and actually just kind of stabs into

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.589 
and actually just kind of stabs into
your<00:04:16.590> hand<00:04:16.829> there<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.370> i<00:04:17.639> should<00:04:18.449> have<00:04:18.570> just

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
your hand there so i should have just

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.659 
your hand there so i should have just
tapered<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.500> almost<00:04:19.889> like<00:04:20.099> i<00:04:20.130> just<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.639> know

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
tapered it almost like i just you know

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.700 
tapered it almost like i just you know
kind<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.000> like<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.150> rifle<00:04:21.659> but<00:04:22.109> she<00:04:22.680> just

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
kind of like a rifle but she just

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.649 
kind of like a rifle but she just
tapered<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.400> almost<00:04:23.639> like<00:04:23.789> a<00:04:23.909> like<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.330> at<00:04:24.510> an

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
tapered it almost like a like a at an

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.120 
tapered it almost like a like a at an
angle<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.199> that<00:04:25.530> would<00:04:25.680> have<00:04:25.800> been<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.919> lot

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
angle and that would have been a lot

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.219 
angle and that would have been a lot
better<00:04:26.190> if<00:04:27.000> i<00:04:27.270> was<00:04:27.419> going<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.570> do<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.840> this<00:04:27.870> way

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
better if i was going to do it this way

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.740 
better if i was going to do it this way
but<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:29.190> handle<00:04:29.610> definitely<00:04:30.120> didn't<00:04:30.389> have<00:04:30.449> to

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
but the handle definitely didn't have to

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.589 
but the handle definitely didn't have to
be<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.050> long<00:04:31.610> another<00:04:32.610> thing<00:04:32.909> about<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.419> was

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
be this long another thing about it was

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.430 
be this long another thing about it was
see<00:04:34.530> this<00:04:34.740> part<00:04:34.979> right<00:04:35.039> here<00:04:35.780> this<00:04:36.780> part<00:04:37.110> i

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
see this part right here this part i

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.159 
see this part right here this part i
it's<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:39.030> reason<00:04:39.270> why<00:04:39.360> it's<00:04:39.479> this<00:04:39.659> short<00:04:39.990> is

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
it's the reason why it's this short is

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.649 
it's the reason why it's this short is
because<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.889> i<00:04:41.130> wanted<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.669> to<00:04:41.789> protrude<00:04:42.240> more

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
because it i wanted it to protrude more

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.659 
because it i wanted it to protrude more
the<00:04:42.870> original<00:04:43.259> design<00:04:43.620> had<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.070> come<00:04:44.280> out<00:04:44.400> more

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
the original design had it come out more

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.000 
the original design had it come out more
but<00:04:45.300> obviously<00:04:45.780> if<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:46.050> did<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:46.349> then<00:04:46.590> I<00:04:46.889> would

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
but obviously if I did that then I would

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.399 
but obviously if I did that then I would
have<00:04:47.039> to<00:04:47.190> cut<00:04:47.520> off<00:04:47.639> all<00:04:47.880> the

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.409 
have to cut off all the

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.699 
have to cut off all the
all<00:04:48.529> over<00:04:48.830> here<00:04:49.189> and<00:04:49.389> I<00:04:50.389> was<00:04:51.199> just<00:04:51.259> kind<00:04:51.559> of<00:04:51.589> a

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:51.709 
all over here and I was just kind of a

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:56.350 
all over here and I was just kind of a
waste<00:04:51.919> of<00:04:52.099> a<00:04:52.219> metal<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:53.319> you<00:04:54.319> know<00:04:54.439> it's<00:04:55.159> a<00:04:55.789> lot

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
waste of a metal and you know it's a lot

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.600 
waste of a metal and you know it's a lot
more<00:04:56.389> work<00:04:56.899> that<00:04:57.259> way<00:04:57.499> so<00:04:57.559> you<00:04:58.399> know<00:04:58.489> I<00:04:58.519> just

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
more work that way so you know I just

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.269 
more work that way so you know I just
did<00:04:59.029> it<00:04:59.119> this<00:04:59.269> way<00:04:59.509> and<00:04:59.779> because<00:05:00.229> of<00:05:00.499> it<00:05:00.830> like

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
did it this way and because of it like

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.459 
did it this way and because of it like
right<00:05:01.610> here<00:05:02.059> with<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.360> lot<00:05:02.599> of<00:05:02.659> weapons<00:05:02.959> if<00:05:03.349> you

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
right here with a lot of weapons if you

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.019 
right here with a lot of weapons if you
do<00:05:03.619> practice<00:05:04.099> stick<00:05:04.369> fighting<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:04.849> stuff

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:05.029 
do practice stick fighting and stuff

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:07.209 
do practice stick fighting and stuff
this<00:05:05.209> is<00:05:05.389> the<00:05:05.419> sweet<00:05:05.839> spot<00:05:05.869> all<00:05:06.529> right<00:05:06.739> this

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:07.219 
this is the sweet spot all right this

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:11.079 
this is the sweet spot all right this
right<00:05:07.489> here<00:05:07.789> is<00:05:07.909> a<00:05:08.089> sweet<00:05:08.539> spot<00:05:08.719> and<00:05:09.580> it<00:05:10.580> you're

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:11.089 
right here is a sweet spot and it you're

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:12.879 
right here is a sweet spot and it you're
my<00:05:11.389> finger<00:05:11.719> keeps<00:05:11.989> running<00:05:12.379> into<00:05:12.619> here<00:05:12.860> and

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
my finger keeps running into here and

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.439 
my finger keeps running into here and
because<00:05:13.249> of<00:05:13.369> the<00:05:13.459> angle<00:05:13.819> right<00:05:13.849> here<00:05:13.999> it<00:05:14.269> keeps

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
because of the angle right here it keeps

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.779 
because of the angle right here it keeps
coming<00:05:14.719> in<00:05:14.989> and<00:05:15.019> then<00:05:15.499> it<00:05:15.559> could<00:05:15.759> it<00:05:16.759> could

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
coming in and then it could it could

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.269 
coming in and then it could it could
sort<00:05:17.269> of<00:05:17.419> stab<00:05:17.689> me<00:05:17.899> I<00:05:17.929> guess<00:05:18.229> so<00:05:18.649> it's<00:05:18.979> not<00:05:19.219> a

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:19.279 
sort of stab me I guess so it's not a

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.669 
sort of stab me I guess so it's not a
comfortable<00:05:19.729> grip<00:05:20.029> right<00:05:20.749> around<00:05:21.019> here<00:05:21.379> so<00:05:21.619> if

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:21.679 
comfortable grip right around here so if

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:23.290 
comfortable grip right around here so if
it<00:05:21.800> had<00:05:21.919> extended<00:05:22.399> further<00:05:22.699> would<00:05:23.089> have<00:05:23.179> been

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
it had extended further would have been

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.419 
it had extended further would have been
nicer<00:05:23.719> how<00:05:24.199> would<00:05:24.379> I<00:05:24.409> have<00:05:24.679> actually<00:05:25.159> done

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:25.429 
nicer how would I have actually done

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:28.899 
nicer how would I have actually done
that<00:05:25.489> I<00:05:26.169> think<00:05:27.169> this<00:05:27.529> the<00:05:28.039> crossguard<00:05:28.610> just

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
that I think this the crossguard just

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.209 
that I think this the crossguard just
had<00:05:29.059> to<00:05:29.209> be<00:05:29.300> a<00:05:29.329> separate<00:05:29.779> piece<00:05:30.050> and<00:05:30.349> this<00:05:30.860> this

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:31.219 
had to be a separate piece and this this

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:32.889 
had to be a separate piece and this this
part<00:05:31.519> right<00:05:31.550> here<00:05:31.669> is<00:05:31.939> well<00:05:32.119> the<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.389> blade

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:32.899 
part right here is well the the blade

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:34.959 
part right here is well the the blade
catcher<00:05:33.169> portion<00:05:33.919> right<00:05:34.039> here<00:05:34.099> I<00:05:34.399> originally

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
catcher portion right here I originally

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.879 
catcher portion right here I originally
wanted<00:05:35.569> this<00:05:35.899> to<00:05:36.079> be<00:05:36.110> large<00:05:36.439> enough<00:05:36.499> that<00:05:36.769> I

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
wanted this to be large enough that I

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.350 
wanted this to be large enough that I
could<00:05:36.979> actually<00:05:37.219> put<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.639> finger<00:05:37.999> in<00:05:38.149> there

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
could actually put the finger in there

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.969 
could actually put the finger in there
and<00:05:38.539> you<00:05:38.929> can<00:05:39.050> actually<00:05:39.229> flip<00:05:39.679> it<00:05:39.889> if

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
and you can actually flip it if

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.149 
and you can actually flip it if
necessary<00:05:40.189> and<00:05:40.879> it<00:05:41.659> does<00:05:41.959> the<00:05:42.319> whole<00:05:42.529> you<00:05:43.039> know

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
necessary and it does the whole you know

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.100 
necessary and it does the whole you know
blade<00:05:43.429> catching<00:05:43.939> type<00:05:44.329> thing<00:05:44.599> used<00:05:44.869> for

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
blade catching type thing used for

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.019 
blade catching type thing used for
striking<00:05:45.409> and<00:05:45.739> those<00:05:46.159> kinds<00:05:46.429> of<00:05:46.459> purposes<00:05:46.669> as

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:47.029 
striking and those kinds of purposes as

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.229 
striking and those kinds of purposes as
well<00:05:47.059> but<00:05:47.949> once<00:05:48.949> again<00:05:49.069> i<00:05:49.309> had<00:05:49.550> to<00:05:49.759> minimize

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:50.239 
well but once again i had to minimize

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:53.079 
well but once again i had to minimize
this<00:05:50.629> this<00:05:51.399> region<00:05:52.399> right<00:05:52.429> here<00:05:52.579> and<00:05:52.849> as<00:05:52.939> you

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:53.089 
this this region right here and as you

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:54.939 
this this region right here and as you
can<00:05:53.209> see<00:05:53.240> i<00:05:53.360> did<00:05:53.599> it<00:05:53.719> for<00:05:53.749> this<00:05:54.079> side<00:05:54.379> where<00:05:54.679> I

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
can see i did it for this side where I

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.609 
can see i did it for this side where I
made<00:05:55.819> it<00:05:55.939> this<00:05:56.089> much<00:05:56.419> less<00:05:57.019> I<00:05:57.259> have<00:05:57.349> to<00:05:57.409> take

00:05:57.609 --> 00:05:57.619 
made it this much less I have to take

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:59.619 
made it this much less I have to take
off<00:05:57.769> all<00:05:57.979> this<00:05:58.189> metal<00:05:58.399> and<00:05:58.699> that<00:05:59.179> was<00:05:59.300> a<00:05:59.329> lot<00:05:59.599> of

00:05:59.619 --> 00:05:59.629 
off all this metal and that was a lot of

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:01.239 
off all this metal and that was a lot of
work<00:05:59.929> and<00:06:00.139> I<00:06:00.229> definitely<00:06:00.259> didn't<00:06:00.949> want<00:06:01.069> to<00:06:01.159> do

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:01.249 
work and I definitely didn't want to do

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:03.939 
work and I definitely didn't want to do
it<00:06:01.339> over<00:06:01.429> here<00:06:01.579> so<00:06:02.419> i<00:06:02.839> guess<00:06:03.289> the<00:06:03.439> best<00:06:03.709> way

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
it over here so i guess the best way

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.100 
it over here so i guess the best way
around<00:06:04.279> that<00:06:04.459> was<00:06:04.699> to<00:06:05.059> have<00:06:05.269> made<00:06:05.509> it<00:06:05.659> separate

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
around that was to have made it separate

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.499 
around that was to have made it separate
and<00:06:06.319> then<00:06:06.469> just<00:06:06.709> be<00:06:07.309> able<00:06:07.399> to<00:06:07.579> attach<00:06:08.240> it

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
and then just be able to attach it

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.069 
and then just be able to attach it
screwed<00:06:08.839> on<00:06:09.019> like<00:06:09.529> that<00:06:09.740> later<00:06:10.069> but<00:06:10.849> anyway<00:06:11.629> so

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:12.079 
screwed on like that later but anyway so

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:15.369
