00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.299
 Car Accessory Type Xenon Headlamps 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.740
 the subject raised doubts in those who already installed the intended one is there in the 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.019
 lamps 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.619
 we come back to the subject for more clarification on the norms 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.439
 the new rules for headlights inclusive and those for gas discharge 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.369
 known as xandÃ£o began to be valid on the first day of the year 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.869
 all new cars exported domestically and imported after 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.360
 of January 1, 2009 equipped with a xenon headlamp shall have 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.110
 cleaners and a system that regulates the inclination of the light beam 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.240
 the National Traffic Council resolution specifically cites the charges 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.889
 new 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:50.079
 but raised a doubt among thousands of Brazilians settled for this 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.230
 year after buying the car 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.120
 and who then the headlights before the 1st day 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.080
 also needs to adapt 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.969
 the answer is in another resolution of the contran 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.760
 and is worth both for those who are already crazy and for those who want to install 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.760
 xenon headlights on cars that will leave the factory without this payment 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.780

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.700
 requested prior authorization from the state 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.550

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.250
 licensed inspection by denatran 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.870
 If changes are approved, it is necessary to return to detran so that the 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.280
 change in lighting is recorded in the car document 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.050

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.960
 serious infraction falls 5 points in the portfolio and a fine of 127 reais

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.550

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.229
