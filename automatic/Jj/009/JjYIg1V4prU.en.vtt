some really really nice flight poses I
love<00:02:38.340> how<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.640> neck<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.420> actually<00:02:40.080> on<00:02:40.349> a

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
love how the neck is actually on a

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.190 
love how the neck is actually on a
separate<00:02:40.950> hinge<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.519> what<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.819> head<00:02:42.000> is

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
independent motion left and right on the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.530 
independent motion left and right on the
neck<00:02:47.400> as<00:02:47.549> well<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.269> shoulders<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.989> go<00:02:49.170> up<00:02:49.590> and

neck as well the shoulders can go up and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.020 
neck as well the shoulders can go up and
down<00:02:51.540> then<00:02:52.170> go<00:02:52.349> in<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.890> this<00:02:53.459> section<00:02:53.700> here<00:02:53.970> is

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
down then go in and this section here is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.729 
down then go in and this section here is
actually<00:02:54.330> on<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> separate<00:02:55.019> ping<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.410> as<00:02:55.620> you

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
actually on a separate ping so as you

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.170 
actually on a separate ping so as you
move<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.010> shoulder<00:02:56.310> up<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.579> actually<00:02:56.670> slides

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
move the shoulder up it actually slides

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.300 
move the shoulder up it actually slides
upwards<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.200> you've<00:02:58.290> got<00:02:58.410> great<00:02:58.739> range<00:02:58.980> there

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
upwards so you've got great range there

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.850 
upwards so you've got great range there
and<00:02:59.760> go<00:02:59.879> forwards<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.450> back<00:03:00.959> you've<00:03:01.590> got<00:03:01.709> an

and go forwards and back you've got an

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.850 
and go forwards and back you've got an
upper<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.489> biceps<00:03:03.060> swivel<00:03:03.569> you've<00:03:04.349> got<00:03:04.590> a

upper and biceps swivel you've got a

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.670 
upper and biceps swivel you've got a
double-jointed<00:03:05.849> bend<00:03:06.660> at<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.930> elbow<00:03:07.290> be

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
double-jointed bend at the elbow be

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.050 
double-jointed bend at the elbow be
careful<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.160> piece<00:03:08.370> here<00:03:08.549> this<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:08.790> quite

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
careful this piece here this is quite

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.059 
careful this piece here this is quite
sharp<00:03:09.420> again<00:03:10.410> it's<00:03:10.530> just<00:03:10.560> something<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:10.980> need

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
sharp again it's just something you need

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.619 
sharp again it's just something you need
to<00:03:11.129> look<00:03:11.250> out<00:03:11.370> for<00:03:11.549> it's<00:03:11.730> not<00:03:11.940> going<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.420> break

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
to look out for it's not going to break

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.770 
to look out for it's not going to break
but<00:03:12.959> it's<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.709> point<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.340> interest<00:03:14.730> fists<00:03:15.329> are

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
but it's a point of interest fists are

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.680 
but it's a point of interest fists are
on<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> ball<00:03:16.530> jointed<00:03:16.950> swivel<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.459> you've<00:03:18.420> got

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
on a ball jointed swivel and you've got

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.690 
on a ball jointed swivel and you've got
a<00:03:18.930> guard<00:03:19.290> here<00:03:19.530> which<00:03:19.650> moves<00:03:19.859> in<00:03:20.129> and<00:03:20.549> out

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
a guard here which moves in and out

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.449 
a guard here which moves in and out
which<00:03:21.000> gives<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.269> free<00:03:21.720> access<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.250> wrist

which gives you free access to the wrist

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.069 
which gives you free access to the wrist
joint<00:03:23.670> when<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.030> want<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.239> change<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.690> fists

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
joint when you want to change the fists

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.500 
joint when you want to change the fists
over<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.950> love<00:03:26.430> how<00:03:26.700> flexible<00:03:27.390> these

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
over I just love how flexible these

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.509 
over I just love how flexible these
butterfly<00:03:28.109> joints<00:03:28.500> are<00:03:28.680> on<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.069> chest<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:29.400> you

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
butterfly joints are on the chest so you

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.780 
butterfly joints are on the chest so you
can<00:03:29.670> bring<00:03:30.359> his<00:03:30.660> arm<00:03:30.930> all<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.560> way<00:03:31.680> across<00:03:31.920> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
abdomen does move left and right and you

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.009 
abdomen does move left and right and you
do<00:03:36.329> have<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.750> forward<00:03:37.440> motion<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.859> much<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:39.019> a

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
do have a forward motion that much and a

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.839 
do have a forward motion that much and a
back<00:03:40.230> motion<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.950> might<00:03:41.160> have<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.609> ball

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
back motion that might have a ball

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.879 
back motion that might have a ball
jointed<00:03:42.180> way<00:03:42.359> so<00:03:42.419> that<00:03:42.810> rotates<00:03:43.290> freely<00:03:43.590> and

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
jointed way so that rotates freely and

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.430 
jointed way so that rotates freely and
again<00:03:44.519> we<00:03:44.700> have<00:03:44.910> separate<00:03:45.389> motion<00:03:45.780> forward

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
again we have separate motion forward

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.890 
again we have separate motion forward
and<00:03:46.739> back<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.669> can<00:03:47.880> bend<00:03:48.209> him<00:03:48.419> right<00:03:48.870> over

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
and back so you can bend him right over

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.860 
and back so you can bend him right over
the<00:03:49.500> legs<00:03:50.220> are<00:03:50.459> on<00:03:50.489> an<00:03:50.700> upper<00:03:51.030> thigh<00:03:51.299> swivel

the legs are on an upper thigh swivel

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.920 
the legs are on an upper thigh swivel
you've<00:03:52.470> got<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:53.010> rotation<00:03:53.760> at<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.120> top<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.810> the

you've got a rotation at the top of the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.170 
you've got a rotation at the top of the
thigh<00:03:55.139> these<00:03:55.680> sections<00:03:56.099> here<00:03:56.310> move<00:03:56.609> out<00:03:56.880> so

thigh these sections here move out so

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.390 
thigh these sections here move out so
there's<00:03:57.359> no<00:03:57.389> hindrance<00:03:57.959> whatsoever<00:03:58.560> great
