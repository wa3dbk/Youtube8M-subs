tutorial<00:00:20.939> series<00:00:21.320> in<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.500> episode<00:00:22.980> we're

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
tutorial series in this episode we're

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.730 
tutorial series in this episode we're
going<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.609> talk<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:24.060> getting<00:00:24.900> ready<00:00:25.350> for

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
going to talk about getting ready for

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.620 
going to talk about getting ready for
using<00:00:26.250> breeder<00:00:26.519> reactors<00:00:27.090> that's<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> next

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
using breeder reactors that's the next

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.960 
using breeder reactors that's the next
reactor<00:00:28.109> we're<00:00:28.260> talking<00:00:28.619> about<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.820> need

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
reactor we're talking about and we need

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.540 
reactor we're talking about and we need
a<00:00:30.000> different<00:00:30.390> type<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> liquid<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.650> go<00:00:31.980> into<00:00:32.399> it

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
a different type of liquid to go into it

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.979 
a different type of liquid to go into it
so<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.880> episode<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.360> gonna<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.719> all<00:00:33.840> about

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
so this episode is gonna be all about

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.950 
so this episode is gonna be all about
the<00:00:34.590> electrolyzer<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.579> how<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> use<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.780> to

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the electrolyzer and how to use it to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.520 
the electrolyzer and how to use it to
produce<00:00:37.200> molten<00:00:38.040> sodium<00:00:39.170> that<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
produce molten sodium that is the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.680 
produce molten sodium that is the
working<00:00:40.860> fluid<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.940> breeder<00:00:42.239> reactor

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
working fluid in a breeder reactor

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.060 
working fluid in a breeder reactor
because<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.960> requires<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.590> use<00:00:43.770> sodium

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
because it requires you use sodium

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.670 
because it requires you use sodium
heaters<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.510> first<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.289> make<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
heaters so first to make the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.729 
heaters so first to make the
electrolyzer<00:00:48.050> you're<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> need<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
electrolyzer you're going to need a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.420 
electrolyzer you're going to need a
reservoir<00:00:50.360> for<00:00:51.360> liquid<00:00:51.840> pipes<00:00:52.079> two<00:00:52.980> base

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
reservoir for liquid pipes two base

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.330 
reservoir for liquid pipes two base
panels<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.149> two<00:00:54.750> steel<00:00:55.379> ingots<00:00:55.860> let's<00:00:56.129> turn

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
panels and two steel ingots let's turn

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.760 
panels and two steel ingots let's turn
off<00:00:56.430> any<00:00:56.789> night<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.420> stealing<00:00:57.750> goods<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
off any night to stealing goods that

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.959 
off any night to stealing goods that
gives<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> electrolyzer<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.850> not

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
gives you the electrolyzer so it's not

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.729 
gives you the electrolyzer so it's not
very<00:01:00.210> expensive<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.649> bunch

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
very expensive it's really just a bunch

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.020 
very expensive it's really just a bunch
of<00:01:01.949> steel<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> little<00:01:03.059> bit<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.239> glass<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
of steel and a little bit of glass and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.910 
of steel and a little bit of glass and
then<00:01:06.030> put<00:01:06.479> into<00:01:06.720> there<00:01:07.020> electrolyzer<00:01:07.710> you're

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
then put into there electrolyzer you're

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310 
then put into there electrolyzer you're
gonna<00:01:08.130> need<00:01:08.340> salt<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.869> make<00:01:10.020> salt

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
gonna need salt and you can make salt

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.929 
gonna need salt and you can make salt
super<00:01:10.710> easily<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.430> bucket<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.790> water

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
super easily with just a bucket of water

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.730 
super easily with just a bucket of water
and<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.210> crafting<00:01:12.540> station<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.590> gives

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and a crafting station and that gives

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.340 
and a crafting station and that gives
you<00:01:13.799> salt<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.640> auto<00:01:14.820> craft<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.479> so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
you salt so you can auto craft this so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.760 
you salt so you can auto craft this so
easily<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.490> much<00:01:17.610> salt<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> want

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
easily and get as much salt as you want

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.730 
easily and get as much salt as you want
anyway<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.040> electrolyzer<00:01:20.729> looks<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.150> this

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
anyway the electrolyzer looks like this

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
anyway the electrolyzer looks like this
okay<00:01:22.850> now<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.909> need<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.270> use<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.420> lot<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
okay now you need to use a lot of the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.960 
okay now you need to use a lot of the
sides<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.320> thing<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> work

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
sides of this thing to get it to work

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.179 
sides of this thing to get it to work
you<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.290> got<00:01:28.409> three<00:01:28.650> tanks<00:01:29.070> but

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you can see it's got three tanks but

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.149 
you can see it's got three tanks but
we're<00:01:29.310> only<00:01:29.400> interested<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.060> two<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.360> them

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
we're only interested in two of them

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.319 
we're only interested in two of them
this<00:01:32.159> isn't<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> only<00:01:32.700> thing<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.210> if

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
this isn't the only thing you can do if

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.039 
this isn't the only thing you can do if
the<00:01:33.450> electrolyzer

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the electrolyzer

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.740 
the electrolyzer
and<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.280> thing<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:36.000> which<00:01:36.570> is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and if you do that thing then which is

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.289 
and if you do that thing then which is
extracting<00:01:37.619> heavy<00:01:37.770> water<00:01:38.030> putting<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.150> heavy

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
extracting heavy water putting in heavy

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.260 
extracting heavy water putting in heavy
water<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:39.960> deuterium<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.270> oxygen

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
water to get out deuterium and oxygen

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.060 
water to get out deuterium and oxygen
then<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.899> use<00:01:43.110> all<00:01:43.259> three<00:01:43.470> tanks<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:43.860> only<00:01:43.950> in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
then you use all three tanks or only in

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.920 
then you use all three tanks or only in
these<00:01:44.159> two<00:01:44.220> tanks<00:01:45.229> but<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:47.570> whenever<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.720> use

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
these two tanks but the whenever you use

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
these two tanks but the whenever you use
the<00:01:49.079> electrolyzer<00:01:49.560> let's<00:01:50.220> put<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> wall

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the electrolyzer let's put it on a wall

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.069 
the electrolyzer let's put it on a wall
here<00:01:51.860> right<00:01:52.860> there<00:01:53.390> you're<00:01:54.390> gonna<00:01:54.479> get<00:01:54.720> two

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
here right there you're gonna get two

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.249 
here right there you're gonna get two
outputs<00:01:55.860> two<00:01:56.850> different<00:01:57.149> fluids<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.170> them

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
outputs two different fluids one of them

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.929 
outputs two different fluids one of them
is<00:01:58.439> lighter<00:01:58.680> than<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> other<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.759> one's

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
is lighter than the other and that one's

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.639 
is lighter than the other and that one's
gonna<00:02:00.060> come<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> top<00:02:00.630> okay<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> need

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
gonna come out the top okay so you need

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.380 
gonna come out the top okay so you need
pipes<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.130> top<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.790> heavier<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:03.240> it's

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
pipes on the top the heavier one it's

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.490 
pipes on the top the heavier one it's
gonna<00:02:03.479> come<00:02:03.689> out<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> bottom<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.320> need<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
gonna come out the bottom so you need a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.399 
gonna come out the bottom so you need a
pipe<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.799> bottom<00:02:05.240> okay

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
pipe on the bottom okay

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.229 
pipe on the bottom okay
you<00:02:08.129> always<00:02:08.280> need<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.489> put<00:02:08.640> power<00:02:08.819> into<00:02:09.119> it

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
you always need to put power into it

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.330 
you always need to put power into it
which<00:02:09.539> means<00:02:09.750> another<00:02:10.080> side<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:11.160> also

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
which means another side and you also

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.550 
which means another side and you also
need<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.640> heat<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.629> up<00:02:12.810> which<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.080> going<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.410> use

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
need to heat it up which is going to use

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.259 
need to heat it up which is going to use
a<00:02:13.590> friction<00:02:14.010> heater<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.340> another<00:02:14.550> side<00:02:14.790> you'll

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
a friction heater on another side you'll

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.670 
a friction heater on another side you'll
see<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.629> second<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.440> then<00:02:16.560> you're

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
see that in a second and then you're

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.539 
see that in a second and then you're
going<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.860> need<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.069> use<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.250> Van<00:02:17.400> de<00:02:17.519> Graaff

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
going to need to use a Van de Graaff

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.570 
going to need to use a Van de Graaff
generator<00:02:18.090> on<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.269> other<00:02:18.450> side<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:20.400> make<00:02:20.549> sure

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
generator on the other side so make sure

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.460 
generator on the other side so make sure
when<00:02:20.879> you<00:02:20.970> place<00:02:21.239> this<00:02:21.480> thing<00:02:21.750> there<00:02:22.200> are<00:02:22.379> a

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
when you place this thing there are a

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.809 
when you place this thing there are a
lot<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.650> R<00:02:22.799> is<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> lot<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.310> room<00:02:23.400> around<00:02:23.610> it

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
lot of R is a lot of room around it

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.300 
lot of R is a lot of room around it
because<00:02:24.480> as<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.840> can<00:02:25.019> see<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.980> setup

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
because as you can see this is the setup

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.920 
because as you can see this is the setup
here<00:02:26.489> we're<00:02:26.849> using<00:02:26.910> every<00:02:27.420> single<00:02:27.450> side

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
here we're using every single side

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.240 
here we're using every single side
except<00:02:28.319> for<00:02:28.500> one<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.920> front<00:02:29.129> face<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:31.250> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
except for one the front face and the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.920 
except for one the front face and the
funny<00:02:32.430> thing<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:33.180> would<00:02:33.269> actually<00:02:33.450> use

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
funny thing is you would actually use

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.320 
funny thing is you would actually use
this<00:02:34.379> front<00:02:34.709> face<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.129> well<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:36.209> were

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
this front face as well if you were

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.479 
this front face as well if you were
pumping<00:02:36.720> water<00:02:36.959> into<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:38.250> since<00:02:38.370> we're

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
pumping water into it but since we're

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.770 
pumping water into it but since we're
just<00:02:38.519> putting<00:02:38.790> salt<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.480> don't<00:02:39.569> need

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
just putting salt in it we don't need

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.479 
just putting salt in it we don't need
that<00:02:39.959> but<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.410> would<00:02:40.560> use<00:02:40.590> every<00:02:40.920> single<00:02:41.160> face

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
that but you would use every single face

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.039 
that but you would use every single face
of<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:41.730> thing<00:02:41.940> if<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.420> were<00:02:42.629> actually

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
of this thing if you were actually

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.380 
of this thing if you were actually
pumping<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> water<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.920> with<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> pipe<00:02:44.730> which

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
pumping the water in with a pipe which

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.880 
pumping the water in with a pipe which
means<00:02:45.629> you<00:02:45.750> couldn't<00:02:45.930> run<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.290> pipe<00:02:46.590> this

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
means you couldn't run this pipe this

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.940 
means you couldn't run this pipe this
way<00:02:47.040> whatever<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.790> can<00:02:47.970> figure<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.420> out<00:02:48.829> so<00:02:49.829> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
way whatever you can figure it out so to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.990 
way whatever you can figure it out so to
use<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.280> electrolyzer

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
use the electrolyzer

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.930 
use the electrolyzer

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
you need a couple of things first thing

you need a couple of things first thing
you<00:02:54.000> need<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.180> do<00:02:54.299> is<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.629> need<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.750> give<00:02:54.900> it

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
you need to do is you need to give it

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.680 
you need to do is you need to give it
power<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.890> requires<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.700> different<00:02:57.150> amount

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
power and it requires a different amount

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.800 
power and it requires a different amount
it<00:02:58.110> requires<00:02:58.410> one<00:02:58.620> hundred<00:02:58.920> thirty<00:02:59.190> one

to<00:03:16.980> electrolyze<00:03:17.340> salt<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.880> need<00:03:18.030> one<00:03:18.269> hundred

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
to electrolyze salt you need one hundred

he<00:03:22.019> doesn't<00:03:22.290> say<00:03:22.440> how<00:03:22.590> much<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.889> need<00:03:23.069> to

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
he doesn't say how much you need to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.009 
he doesn't say how much you need to
electrolyze<00:03:23.519> water<00:03:23.639> i'm<00:03:24.209> assuming<00:03:24.540> its<00:03:24.810> last

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
electrolyze water i'm assuming its last

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.430 
electrolyze water i'm assuming its last
but<00:03:25.200> who<00:03:25.290> knows<00:03:25.470> might<00:03:25.980> be<00:03:26.130> more<00:03:27.380> anyway<00:03:28.380> you

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
but who knows might be more anyway you

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.050 
but who knows might be more anyway you
put<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.739> power<00:03:28.889> on<00:03:29.040> any<00:03:29.400> other<00:03:29.519> side<00:03:29.819> that's

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
put the power on any other side that's

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.520 
put the power on any other side that's
why<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.239> was<00:03:30.419> green<00:03:30.630> on<00:03:30.660> those<00:03:30.870> sides<00:03:31.139> and<00:03:31.440> then

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
why it was green on those sides and then

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.319 
why it was green on those sides and then
you<00:03:31.680> need<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.859> heat<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.250> up<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.940> takes<00:03:33.150> a

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
you need to heat it up it takes a

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.539 
you need to heat it up it takes a
hundred<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.200> one<00:03:36.139> degrees<00:03:37.139> Celsius<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.250> melt

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
hundred and one degrees Celsius to melt

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.210 
hundred and one degrees Celsius to melt
the<00:03:38.849> salt<00:03:39.120> okay<00:03:40.079> so<00:03:40.500> first<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:40.829> give<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.099> power

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
the salt okay so first you give it power

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.650 
the salt okay so first you give it power
and<00:03:41.519> then<00:03:41.669> you<00:03:41.760> also<00:03:41.910> give<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.239> heat<00:03:42.389> which<00:03:42.540> is

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
and then you also give it heat which is

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.360 
and then you also give it heat which is
why<00:03:42.780> we're<00:03:42.959> using<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.260> friction<00:03:43.410> heater<00:03:43.769> you

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
why we're using the friction heater you

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.909 
why we're using the friction heater you
can't<00:03:44.609> use<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.849> here<00:03:45.329> because<00:03:45.810> we<00:03:46.139> need<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.739> use

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
can't use a here because we need to use

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.300 
can't use a here because we need to use
pipe<00:03:47.310> out<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.730> bottom<00:03:48.060> right<00:03:49.099> so<00:03:50.099> we<00:03:50.160> got<00:03:50.280> a

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
pipe out the bottom right so we got a

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.670 
pipe out the bottom right so we got a
friction<00:03:50.639> heater<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.599> just<00:03:51.840> gave<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.169> the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
friction heater and I just gave it the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.089 
friction heater and I just gave it the
same<00:03:52.859> amount<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.160> power<00:03:53.310> as<00:03:53.639> the<00:03:54.299> as<00:03:55.099> the

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
same amount of power as the as the

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.640 
same amount of power as the as the
electrolyzer<00:03:56.639> with<00:03:57.090> 128<00:03:57.900> Newton<00:03:58.440> meters<00:03:58.590> of

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
electrolyzer with 128 Newton meters of

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.550 
electrolyzer with 128 Newton meters of
torque<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:59.209> 1024<00:04:00.239> radians<00:04:00.930> per<00:04:01.049> second<00:04:01.410> and

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
torque and 1024 radians per second and

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.759 
torque and 1024 radians per second and
it<00:04:01.709> got<00:04:01.859> it<00:04:01.980> up<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.269> 846<00:04:03.269> C<00:04:04.019> which<00:04:04.560> was

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
it got it up to 846 C which was

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.629 
it got it up to 846 C which was
perfectly<00:04:05.700> fine<00:04:05.879> just<00:04:05.940> it's<00:04:06.419> over<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.780> 801<00:04:07.639> to

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
perfectly fine just it's over the 801 to

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.500 
perfectly fine just it's over the 801 to
melt<00:04:08.879> the<00:04:09.209> sodium<00:04:10.049> basalt<00:04:11.299> but<00:04:12.299> we're<00:04:12.419> not

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
melt the sodium basalt but we're not

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.979 
melt the sodium basalt but we're not
done<00:04:12.690> yet

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
done yet

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.259 
done yet
we<00:04:13.410> also<00:04:13.590> need<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.609> use<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.910> van<00:04:15.030> der<00:04:15.150> Graaf

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
we also need to use the van der Graaf

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.610 
we also need to use the van der Graaf
generator<00:04:15.299> because<00:04:15.840> if<00:04:16.049> you're<00:04:16.169> looking<00:04:16.259> here

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
generator because if you're looking here

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.860 
generator because if you're looking here
we're<00:04:17.039> giving<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.370> enough<00:04:17.549> power<00:04:17.789> okay

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
we're giving it enough power okay

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.050 
we're giving it enough power okay
we've<00:04:19.829> heated<00:04:20.009> it<00:04:20.220> up<00:04:20.310> we<00:04:20.579> put<00:04:20.850> the

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
we've heated it up we put the

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.190 
we've heated it up we put the
stuff<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.389> there<00:04:21.540> but<00:04:21.690> it's<00:04:21.810> not<00:04:21.840> doing

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
stuff in there but it's not doing

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.140 
stuff in there but it's not doing
anything<00:04:22.350> that's<00:04:23.010> because<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.460> electrolyzer

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
anything that's because the electrolyzer

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.940 
anything that's because the electrolyzer
needs<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:25.020> have<00:04:25.200> an<00:04:25.410> electrical<00:04:25.800> discharge

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
needs to have an electrical discharge

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.170 
needs to have an electrical discharge
and<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.520> do<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.730> with<00:04:26.850> a<00:04:26.880> Van<00:04:27.030> de<00:04:27.150> Graaff

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
and you do that with a Van de Graaff

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.330 
and you do that with a Van de Graaff
generator<00:04:27.780> now<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:28.410> don't<00:04:28.650> technically<00:04:29.250> have

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
generator now you don't technically have

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.010 
generator now you don't technically have
to<00:04:29.580> put<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.820> Van<00:04:29.970> de<00:04:30.090> Graaff<00:04:30.120> generator<00:04:30.660> right

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
to put the Van de Graaff generator right

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.150 
to put the Van de Graaff generator right
next<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.560> electrolyzer

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
next to the electrolyzer

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.520 
next to the electrolyzer
because<00:04:32.730> the<00:04:32.880> point<00:04:33.389> when<00:04:33.690> it<00:04:33.780> discharges<00:04:34.260> it

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
because the point when it discharges it

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.070 
because the point when it discharges it
does<00:04:34.710> arc<00:04:35.090> but<00:04:36.090> unless<00:04:36.540> you<00:04:36.660> put<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.960> right

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
does arc but unless you put it right

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.450 
does arc but unless you put it right
next<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.470> you<00:04:37.590> can't<00:04:37.889> be<00:04:38.040> certain<00:04:38.370> that

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
next to it you can't be certain that

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.860 
next to it you can't be certain that
it's<00:04:38.610> gonna<00:04:38.700> arc<00:04:38.940> in<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.150> right<00:04:39.300> direction<00:04:39.480> as

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
it's gonna arc in the right direction as

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.659 
it's gonna arc in the right direction as
well<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.650> mean<00:04:40.770> I<00:04:41.010> don't<00:04:41.070> know<00:04:41.220> maybe<00:04:41.340> you<00:04:41.550> do

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
well I mean I don't know maybe you do

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:42.680 
well I mean I don't know maybe you do
have<00:04:41.760> to<00:04:41.820> put<00:04:41.940> it<00:04:42.030> right<00:04:42.090> next<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.419> all<00:04:42.630> I

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
have to put it right next to it all I

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.780 
have to put it right next to it all I
know<00:04:42.720> is<00:04:42.930> that<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.169> works<00:04:43.410> if<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.770> do<00:04:43.919> so<00:04:44.700> now

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
know is that it works if you do so now

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.330 
know is that it works if you do so now
we<00:04:44.850> have<00:04:45.120> these<00:04:45.389> what<00:04:45.720> this<00:04:46.139> white<00:04:46.410> sparks

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
we have these what this white sparks

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.700 
we have these what this white sparks
jumping<00:04:47.730> off<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.090> if<00:04:48.419> we<00:04:48.480> look<00:04:48.720> at<00:04:48.810> here<00:04:49.200> we

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
jumping off and if we look at here we

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.670 
jumping off and if we look at here we
can<00:04:49.889> see<00:04:50.070> these<00:04:50.220> two<00:04:50.460> progress<00:04:51.120> meters<00:04:51.680> all

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
can see these two progress meters all

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.060 
can see these two progress meters all
right

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
right

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.710 
right
and<00:04:53.340> these<00:04:53.580> progress<00:04:53.970> meters<00:04:54.270> are<00:04:54.419> moving

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
and these progress meters are moving

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.780 
and these progress meters are moving
every<00:04:54.960> single<00:04:55.260> time<00:04:55.410> it<00:04:55.560> gets<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.860> spark<00:04:56.610> it

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
every single time it gets a spark it

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.060 
every single time it gets a spark it
moves<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.090> little<00:04:57.120> bit<00:04:57.360> more<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:58.040> we<00:04:59.040> are

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
moves a little bit more and we are

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.610 
moves a little bit more and we are
producing<00:04:59.490> two<00:04:59.729> liquids<00:05:00.240> well<00:05:00.780> one<00:05:01.440> of<00:05:01.500> them

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
producing two liquids well one of them

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:09.100 
producing two liquids well one of them
is<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.740> gas<00:05:05.060> we're<00:05:06.060> producing<00:05:06.570> chlorine<00:05:07.410> gas

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
is a gas we're producing chlorine gas

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.710 
is a gas we're producing chlorine gas
and<00:05:10.250> we're<00:05:11.250> also<00:05:11.370> producing<00:05:11.970> molten<00:05:12.479> sodium

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
and we're also producing molten sodium

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.050 
and we're also producing molten sodium
and<00:05:13.169> this<00:05:13.889> is<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.280> stuff<00:05:14.520> that<00:05:14.729> we<00:05:14.820> have<00:05:14.940> to

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
and this is the stuff that we have to

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.460 
and this is the stuff that we have to
put<00:05:15.300> into<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:15.840> breeder<00:05:16.080> reactor<00:05:18.200> so<00:05:19.200> we're

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
put into the breeder reactor so we're

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.469 
put into the breeder reactor so we're
storing<00:05:19.710> that<00:05:19.800> mone<00:05:20.040> sodium<00:05:23.240> that's<00:05:24.240> the

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
storing that mone sodium that's the

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.810 
storing that mone sodium that's the
electrolyzer<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:26.100> can<00:05:26.220> probably<00:05:26.370> speed<00:05:26.700> this

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
electrolyzer you can probably speed this

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.540 
electrolyzer you can probably speed this
thing<00:05:26.880> up<00:05:27.150> by<00:05:27.539> giving<00:05:27.930> this<00:05:28.200> vandegraaff<00:05:29.039> more

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
thing up by giving this vandegraaff more

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.590 
thing up by giving this vandegraaff more
power

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.290 

yeah<00:05:35.310> so<00:05:36.310> make<00:05:36.460> sure<00:05:36.490> that<00:05:36.639> the<00:05:36.910> other<00:05:37.030> Heiser

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
yeah so make sure that the other Heiser

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.700 
yeah so make sure that the other Heiser
has<00:05:37.539> more<00:05:37.720> power<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.229> then<00:05:38.320> if<00:05:38.440> you<00:05:38.500> want<00:05:38.650> to

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
has more power and then if you want to

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.050 
has more power and then if you want to
speed<00:05:38.919> it<00:05:38.949> up<00:05:39.100> just<00:05:39.400> give<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.729> vandegraaff

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
speed it up just give the vandegraaff

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.460 
speed it up just give the vandegraaff
some<00:05:40.389> more<00:05:40.479> juice<00:05:42.630> do<00:05:43.630> it<00:05:43.750> now<00:05:43.840> it's<00:05:43.960> blue<00:05:44.110> and

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.659 

now<00:05:47.470> we<00:05:47.530> see<00:05:47.800> the<00:05:47.830> arrows<00:05:48.190> are<00:05:48.340> moving<00:05:48.550> much

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
now we see the arrows are moving much

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:58.439 
now we see the arrows are moving much
faster<00:05:48.699> now<00:05:54.060> and<00:05:55.060> now<00:05:55.150> it's<00:05:55.300> purple<00:05:57.389> let<00:05:58.389> me

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
faster now and now it's purple let me

00:05:58.449 --> 00:05:59.520 
faster now and now it's purple let me
see<00:05:58.600> that<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.840> arrows<00:05:59.080> are<00:05:59.139> moving<00:05:59.380> quite

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
see that the arrows are moving quite

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:06.779 
see that the arrows are moving quite
quickly<00:05:59.590> now<00:05:59.979> I<00:06:05.370> got<00:06:06.370> to<00:06:06.430> make<00:06:06.520> sure<00:06:06.669> I<00:06:06.699> don't

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
quickly now I got to make sure I don't

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:12.960 
quickly now I got to make sure I don't
blow<00:06:07.030> this<00:06:07.180> thing<00:06:07.360> up<00:06:11.580> it's<00:06:12.580> starting<00:06:12.880> to

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
blow this thing up it's starting to

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.860 
blow this thing up it's starting to
scare<00:06:13.270> me<00:06:13.419> a<00:06:13.449> little<00:06:13.509> bit<00:06:13.860> I'm<00:06:14.860> sure<00:06:14.949> it's<00:06:15.250> fine

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
scare me a little bit I'm sure it's fine

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.180 
scare me a little bit I'm sure it's fine
no<00:06:16.870> there's<00:06:17.349> something<00:06:17.530> about<00:06:17.830> the<00:06:17.949> Van<00:06:18.099> de

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
no there's something about the Van de

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.710 
no there's something about the Van de
Graaff<00:06:18.220> generator<00:06:18.669> that<00:06:18.789> scares<00:06:19.060> me<00:06:19.210> but<00:06:19.570> as

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
Graaff generator that scares me but as

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.060 
Graaff generator that scares me but as
we<00:06:19.810> can<00:06:19.930> see<00:06:19.990> now<00:06:20.259> our<00:06:20.289> electrolyzer<00:06:20.830> is

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
we can see now our electrolyzer is

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.629 
we can see now our electrolyzer is
running<00:06:21.340> very<00:06:21.370> very<00:06:21.729> quickly<00:06:22.289> so<00:06:23.289> as<00:06:23.520> long<00:06:24.520> as

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 
running very very quickly so as long as

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.159 
running very very quickly so as long as
you<00:06:24.789> can<00:06:24.970> give<00:06:25.090> a<00:06:25.120> little<00:06:25.330> slider<00:06:25.599> there<00:06:25.810> as

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
you can give a little slider there as

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.570 
you can give a little slider there as
long<00:06:26.289> as<00:06:26.410> you<00:06:26.500> you<00:06:26.770> know<00:06:26.830> can<00:06:27.070> give<00:06:27.220> this<00:06:27.370> Van

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
long as you you know can give this Van

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.820 
long as you you know can give this Van
de<00:06:27.669> Graaff<00:06:27.699> generator<00:06:28.210> enough<00:06:28.509> power<00:06:28.690> to<00:06:31.830> arc

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
de Graaff generator enough power to arc

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.620 
de Graaff generator enough power to arc
enough<00:06:33.130> you<00:06:33.340> can<00:06:33.520> you<00:06:33.849> can<00:06:34.000> run<00:06:34.240> through<00:06:34.479> and

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
enough you can you can run through and

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.080 
enough you can you can run through and
produce<00:06:34.840> the<00:06:35.530> sodium<00:06:35.889> very<00:06:36.099> quickly<00:06:36.310> remember

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
produce the sodium very quickly remember

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.279 
produce the sodium very quickly remember
though<00:06:37.360> that<00:06:37.389> you're<00:06:37.570> also<00:06:37.840> producing<00:06:38.229> the

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
though that you're also producing the

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:39.839 
though that you're also producing the
chlorine<00:06:38.650> so<00:06:38.860> you're<00:06:38.979> gonna<00:06:39.070> have<00:06:39.460> somewhere

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
chlorine so you're gonna have somewhere

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:41.670 
chlorine so you're gonna have somewhere
to<00:06:39.970> put<00:06:40.150> that<00:06:40.300> and<00:06:40.570> there<00:06:40.870> is<00:06:40.900> use<00:06:41.169> for<00:06:41.199> it<00:06:41.560> I'm

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
to put that and there is use for it I'm

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.649 
to put that and there is use for it I'm
sure<00:06:43.979> but<00:06:44.979> there<00:06:45.130> we<00:06:45.190> go<00:06:45.280> we<00:06:46.270> are<00:06:46.389> producing

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:46.659 
sure but there we go we are producing

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:49.140 
sure but there we go we are producing
molten<00:06:47.590> sodium<00:06:47.800> and<00:06:48.370> so<00:06:48.699> these<00:06:48.789> are<00:06:48.849> gonna<00:06:49.030> go

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
molten sodium and so these are gonna go

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.600 
molten sodium and so these are gonna go
in<00:06:49.270> some<00:06:49.449> sodium<00:06:49.870> boilers<00:06:50.260> for<00:06:50.800> the<00:06:50.919> breeder

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
in some sodium boilers for the breeder

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.540 
in some sodium boilers for the breeder
reactor<00:06:52.030> so<00:06:52.889> make<00:06:53.889> sure<00:06:53.919> you<00:06:54.099> got<00:06:54.190> quite<00:06:54.370> a<00:06:54.430> bit

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
reactor so make sure you got quite a bit

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
reactor so make sure you got quite a bit
of<00:06:54.580> it<00:06:55.740> that's<00:06:56.740> going<00:06:57.010> up<00:06:57.099> real<00:06:57.280> quick<00:06:57.570> yeah

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
of it that's going up real quick yeah

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.120 
of it that's going up real quick yeah
I'm<00:06:58.720> worried<00:06:59.110> about<00:06:59.199> below<00:06:59.650> it<00:06:59.740> I<00:06:59.800> was<00:06:59.919> worried

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
I'm worried about below it I was worried

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.080 
I'm worried about below it I was worried
about<00:07:00.159> blowing<00:07:00.520> up<00:07:00.699> this<00:07:00.820> Van<00:07:00.970> de<00:07:01.060> Graaff

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.090 
about blowing up this Van de Graaff

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.520 
about blowing up this Van de Graaff
generator<00:07:01.630> which<00:07:01.720> I'm<00:07:01.840> sure<00:07:02.020> wouldn't<00:07:02.349> happen

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
generator which I'm sure wouldn't happen

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.200 
generator which I'm sure wouldn't happen
because<00:07:02.770> it<00:07:02.979> has<00:07:03.099> a<00:07:03.130> place<00:07:03.400> to<00:07:03.580> discharge<00:07:04.000> but

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
because it has a place to discharge but

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.550 
because it has a place to discharge but
I<00:07:04.240> don't<00:07:04.419> know<00:07:04.479> there's<00:07:04.930> something<00:07:05.020> about<00:07:05.320> all

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
I don't know there's something about all

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.800 
I don't know there's something about all
those<00:07:05.680> electrical<00:07:06.430> sparks<00:07:06.940> that<00:07:07.030> it<00:07:07.479> sort<00:07:07.750> of

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
those electrical sparks that it sort of

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.029 
those electrical sparks that it sort of
scares<00:07:08.139> me<00:07:10.020> if<00:07:11.020> it<00:07:11.139> wasn't<00:07:11.289> inside<00:07:11.620> my<00:07:11.830> base

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 
scares me if it wasn't inside my base

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:14.249 
scares me if it wasn't inside my base
maybe<00:07:12.340> I<00:07:12.490> wouldn't<00:07:12.789> be<00:07:12.849> so<00:07:13.210> cautious<00:07:13.870> but

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:14.259 
maybe I wouldn't be so cautious but

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:14.790 
maybe I wouldn't be so cautious but
there<00:07:14.409> you<00:07:14.470> go

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
there you go

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.469 
there you go
if<00:07:15.310> you<00:07:15.430> already<00:07:15.610> were<00:07:15.940> running<00:07:16.210> through

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 
if you already were running through

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.700 
if you already were running through
there<00:07:16.630> are<00:07:17.080> salt<00:07:18.009> here<00:07:19.380> now<00:07:20.380> one<00:07:20.530> thing<00:07:20.650> to

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710 
there are salt here now one thing to

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.320 
there are salt here now one thing to
keep<00:07:20.800> in<00:07:21.009> mind

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.960 

is<00:07:23.509> that<00:07:24.169> even<00:07:24.590> if<00:07:24.889> there's<00:07:25.189> no<00:07:25.310> salt<00:07:25.610> in<00:07:25.759> there

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:25.970 
is that even if there's no salt in there

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.570 
is that even if there's no salt in there
the<00:07:26.389> vandegraaff<00:07:26.720> will<00:07:27.169> still<00:07:27.580> discharge

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.580 
the vandegraaff will still discharge

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.119 
the vandegraaff will still discharge
into<00:07:28.849> the<00:07:29.000> electrolyzer<00:07:29.479> which<00:07:30.379> I<00:07:30.650> think

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:31.129 
into the electrolyzer which I think

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:33.339 
into the electrolyzer which I think
means<00:07:31.969> that<00:07:32.300> you're<00:07:32.419> safe<00:07:32.689> leaving<00:07:33.020> this<00:07:33.139> on

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:33.349 
means that you're safe leaving this on

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:35.649 
means that you're safe leaving this on
so<00:07:34.099> you're<00:07:34.610> not<00:07:34.759> gonna<00:07:34.879> blow<00:07:35.330> up<00:07:35.509> the

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:35.659 
so you're not gonna blow up the

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:36.790 
so you're not gonna blow up the
vandegraaff<00:07:35.960> general<00:07:36.319> you're<00:07:36.409> not<00:07:36.439> gonna<00:07:36.590> get

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 
vandegraaff general you're not gonna get

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.459 
vandegraaff general you're not gonna get
struck<00:07:37.069> by<00:07:37.129> lightning<00:07:37.610> because<00:07:38.419> it<00:07:38.840> still<00:07:39.229> has

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:39.469 
struck by lightning because it still has

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:42.550 
struck by lightning because it still has
a<00:07:40.000> place<00:07:41.000> to<00:07:41.060> discharge<00:07:41.689> let's<00:07:42.229> go<00:07:42.319> some<00:07:42.469> more

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 
a place to discharge let's go some more

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.890 
a place to discharge let's go some more
salt<00:07:44.889> just<00:07:45.889> put<00:07:46.039> some<00:07:46.159> more<00:07:46.189> salt<00:07:46.400> in<00:07:46.520> there<00:07:46.900> so

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:47.900 
salt just put some more salt in there so

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.899 
salt just put some more salt in there so
we<00:07:48.020> can<00:07:48.139> see<00:07:48.319> let's<00:07:48.740> go<00:07:48.860> and<00:07:48.949> brave<00:07:49.069> it<00:07:49.189> so

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:49.909 
we can see let's go and brave it so

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:51.730 
we can see let's go and brave it so
that's<00:07:50.419> how<00:07:50.659> you<00:07:50.719> produce<00:07:50.930> the<00:07:51.289> molten<00:07:51.530> sodium

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:51.740 
that's how you produce the molten sodium

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.570 
that's how you produce the molten sodium
that<00:07:52.460> you<00:07:52.580> need<00:07:52.789> for<00:07:53.060> redirector<00:07:54.250> so<00:07:55.250> in<00:07:55.490> an

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:55.580 
that you need for redirector so in an

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.730 
that you need for redirector so in an
and<00:07:55.879> so<00:07:56.419> that's<00:07:56.539> it<00:07:56.690> that's<00:07:57.139> the<00:07:57.259> electrolyzer

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:57.740 
and so that's it that's the electrolyzer

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.279 
and so that's it that's the electrolyzer
now<00:07:58.340> in<00:07:58.789> our<00:07:58.879> next<00:07:59.240> episode<00:07:59.690> of<00:07:59.719> the<00:07:59.900> reactor

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:00.289 
now in our next episode of the reactor

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:03.249 
now in our next episode of the reactor
craft<00:08:00.500> series<00:08:00.879> we'll<00:08:01.879> go<00:08:02.030> through<00:08:02.300> will

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:03.259 
craft series we'll go through will

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:06.760 
craft series we'll go through will
actually<00:08:03.560> make<00:08:03.830> a<00:08:04.599> breeder<00:08:05.599> reactor<00:08:06.080> using

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:06.770 
actually make a breeder reactor using

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.309 
actually make a breeder reactor using
the<00:08:06.830> molten<00:08:07.099> sodium<00:08:07.250> so<00:08:07.960> stay<00:08:08.960> tuned<00:08:09.139> for<00:08:09.199> that

00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 
the molten sodium so stay tuned for that

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:13.449 
the molten sodium so stay tuned for that
I'm<00:08:09.979> setting<00:08:10.340> late<00:08:10.460> and<00:08:11.030> I'm<00:08:11.150> sorry
