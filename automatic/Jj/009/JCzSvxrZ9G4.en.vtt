not<00:02:02.689> launching<00:02:03.380> off<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.860> turf<00:02:04.130> out<00:02:04.369> there<00:02:04.640> and

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
not launching off the turf out there and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.029 
not launching off the turf out there and
I<00:02:04.909> think<00:02:05.239> clearly<00:02:05.689> that<00:02:05.810> time<00:02:06.200> price<00:02:06.799> of<00:02:06.979> the

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
I think clearly that time price of the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.009 
I think clearly that time price of the
Williams<00:02:07.340> did<00:02:07.579> launch<00:02:07.849> and<00:02:08.599> he<00:02:08.720> probably

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
Williams did launch and he probably

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.680 
Williams did launch and he probably
looked<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:10.009> me<00:02:10.220> didn't<00:02:10.670> wrap<00:02:10.849> it<00:02:11.060> on<00:02:11.209> let's<00:02:11.540> be

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
looked to me didn't wrap it on let's be

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.660 
looked to me didn't wrap it on let's be
fair<00:02:11.930> about<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.230> but<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.560> do<00:02:12.680> not<00:02:12.920> think<00:02:13.129> from

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
fair about it but I do not think from

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.990 
fair about it but I do not think from
what<00:02:13.819> I'm<00:02:14.090> seeing<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.049> was<00:02:15.079> targeting<00:02:15.650> I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
what I'm seeing that it was targeting I

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.250 
what I'm seeing that it was targeting I
think<00:02:17.000> they<00:02:17.120> reversed<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.720> but<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.049> point

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
think they reversed that but the point

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.530 
think they reversed that but the point
the<00:02:18.440> bottom<00:02:18.620> line<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.250> not<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.180> penalty

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
the bottom line is not the penalty

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.710 
the bottom line is not the penalty
itself<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.549> Gamecocks<00:02:23.030> trailing<00:02:23.540> by

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
itself this is the Gamecocks trailing by

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.039 
itself this is the Gamecocks trailing by
