00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.479 

like<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.170> sequence<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:50.219> they'll

don't<00:00:52.829> come<00:00:52.949> out<00:00:53.190> after<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
don't come out after that you can do the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.729 
don't come out after that you can do the
snort<00:00:54.510> wheeze<00:00:54.660> which<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> top<00:00:55.440> here

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
snort wheeze which is on the top here

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.760 
snort wheeze which is on the top here
and<00:00:56.120> that's<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:59.989> challenge<00:01:00.989> wheeze<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:01.680> you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and that's up a challenge wheeze or you

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.590 
and that's up a challenge wheeze or you
can<00:01:01.920> go

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.450 

that's<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.900> cone<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.530> top<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.010> call<00:01:08.250> here

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
that's the cone on top of this call here

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.520 
that's the cone on top of this call here
you<00:01:08.580> probably<00:01:08.729> can't<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.390> uh<00:01:09.600> yeah

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you probably can't see it but uh yeah

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.710 
you probably can't see it but uh yeah
and<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.250> when<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> grow<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.299> bus<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and so when you grow up for bus it's a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.149 
and so when you grow up for bus it's a
really<00:01:13.020> effective<00:01:13.260> way<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> bring<00:01:13.860> them<00:01:14.040> in

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
really effective way to bring them in

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.920 
really effective way to bring them in
from<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.490> long<00:01:14.670> way<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.180> call<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.780> go

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
from a long way this call you can go

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.179 
from a long way this call you can go
really<00:01:16.200> hard<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.860> don't<00:01:20.070> really

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
really hard and now you don't really

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.190 
really hard and now you don't really
mess<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:20.700> out<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.750> that's<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
mess it up out there that that's a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.289 
mess it up out there that that's a
really<00:01:22.500> good<00:01:22.740> way<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> call<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:24.000> don't<00:01:24.119> want

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
really good way to call you don't want

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:32.240 
really good way to call you don't want
to<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:29.990> like<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.409> lot<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.770> times<00:01:31.979> because

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
to go like that a lot of times because

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.100 
to go like that a lot of times because
that's<00:01:32.549> not<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> real<00:01:33.119> real<00:01:33.689> deer<00:01:33.960> would

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that's not what a real real deer would

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.100 
that's not what a real real deer would
actually<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.759> gotta<00:01:36.450> think<00:01:36.600> logically

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
actually do so I gotta think logically

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.280 
actually do so I gotta think logically
and<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:38.130> few<00:01:38.369> short<00:01:38.729> ones<00:01:38.939> maybe<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.509> few<00:01:39.900> more

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and a few short ones maybe a few more

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170 
and a few short ones maybe a few more
than<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.070> most<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.369> do<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.610> probably<00:01:41.939> three

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
than the most I do is probably three

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:51.380 
than the most I do is probably three
just<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.040> call<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.460> really<00:01:50.820> loud<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
just and this call is really loud so it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.330 
just and this call is really loud so it
gets<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.659> call<00:01:51.840> out<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.170> good<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.649> when<00:01:53.220> your

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
gets a call out there good and when your

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.920 
gets a call out there good and when your
snort<00:01:53.640> wheezing<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.270> good<00:01:54.420> way<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.540> stop

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
snort wheezing that's a good way to stop

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.630 
snort wheezing that's a good way to stop
the<00:01:55.110> Bucks<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.530> bring<00:01:55.710> them<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.009> from<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.340> closer

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the Bucks or bring them in from a closer

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.770 
the Bucks or bring them in from a closer
range<00:01:56.939> because<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.509> too<00:01:57.689> loud<00:01:57.899> so

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
range because it's not too loud so

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.180 
range because it's not too loud so
something<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.960> deer<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.259> walking<00:02:01.560> but

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.910
