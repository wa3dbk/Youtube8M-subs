in<00:00:08.230> this<00:00:08.320> house<00:00:08.560> we<00:00:08.590> going<00:00:09.220> to<00:00:09.280> show<00:00:09.430> you<00:00:09.490> how

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
in this house we going to show you how

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.830 
in this house we going to show you how
to<00:00:09.730> inflate<00:00:10.240> the<00:00:10.600> tubers<00:00:11.020> tire<00:00:12.840> this

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
to inflate the tubers tire this

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.930 
to inflate the tubers tire this
particular<00:00:14.139> tire<00:00:14.530> is<00:00:15.010> not<00:00:15.309> a<00:00:15.370> tubeless<00:00:15.700> ready

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
particular tire is not a tubeless ready

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.500 
particular tire is not a tubeless ready
tire<00:00:16.450> and<00:00:16.990> therefore<00:00:17.650> it<00:00:17.770> can<00:00:18.040> pose<00:00:18.400> a<00:00:18.730> bit<00:00:19.420> of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
tire and therefore it can pose a bit of

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.340 
tire and therefore it can pose a bit of
a<00:00:19.570> struggle<00:00:19.860> to<00:00:20.860> get<00:00:21.010> it<00:00:21.130> inflated<00:00:22.140> few<00:00:23.140> tools

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
a struggle to get it inflated few tools

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.210 
a struggle to get it inflated few tools
that<00:00:23.500> can<00:00:23.740> help<00:00:23.800> us<00:00:24.070> inflate<00:00:24.490> it<00:00:24.790> is<00:00:25.420> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
that can help us inflate it is a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.440 
that can help us inflate it is a
compressor<00:00:27.220> and<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.990> use<00:00:29.170> a<00:00:29.200> compressor<00:00:30.450> with

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
compressor and to use a compressor with

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.990 
compressor and to use a compressor with
the<00:00:31.540> valve<00:00:31.780> but<00:00:32.590> with<00:00:32.770> a<00:00:32.800> Schrader<00:00:33.070> valve<00:00:33.280> you

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
the valve but with a Schrader valve you

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.790 
the valve but with a Schrader valve you
need<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.239> Schrader<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.750> press<00:00:34.989> the<00:00:35.760> converter

compressor to it that's suitable for a
car<00:01:00.699> tire<00:01:04.110> before<00:01:05.110> we<00:01:05.260> inflate<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.800> what<00:01:06.280> we

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
car tire before we inflate it what we

car tire before we inflate it what we
need<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.610> do<00:01:06.760> is<00:01:07.180> we<00:01:07.240> need<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.450> put<00:01:07.630> into<00:01:07.870> the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
need to do is we need to put into the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.350 
need to do is we need to put into the
tire<00:01:09.420> some<00:01:10.420> see<00:01:10.630> them<00:01:11.820> sitting<00:01:12.820> iqs<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.920> stands

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
tire some see them sitting iqs it stands

no<00:01:16.360> tubes<00:01:16.719> tied<00:01:17.110> sealant<00:01:19.439> let's<00:01:20.439> do<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:22.079> we

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
no tubes tied sealant let's do that we

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.880 
no tubes tied sealant let's do that we
use<00:01:23.380> two<00:01:24.060> normal<00:01:25.060> tire<00:01:25.270> levers<00:01:25.659> just<00:01:26.619> crack

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
use two normal tire levers just crack

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.240 
use two normal tire levers just crack
the<00:01:27.070> tire<00:01:27.280> off<00:01:27.549> the<00:01:27.579> rim

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the tire off the rim

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.959 
the tire off the rim
well<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.399> is<00:01:30.520> done<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:33.310> give<00:01:33.520> me<00:01:33.700> a<00:01:33.729> gap

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
well that is done it's give me a gap

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.660 
well that is done it's give me a gap
here<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:35.289> could<00:01:35.350> put<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.680> sealant<00:01:36.070> into

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
here that I could put the sealant into

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.219 
here that I could put the sealant into
the<00:01:36.759> tire<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:40.390> you've<00:01:40.539> gotten<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:40.780> good<00:01:40.810> shake

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
the tire if you've gotten a good shake

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
the tire if you've gotten a good shake
go<00:01:42.070> get<00:01:42.250> all<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.609> bits<00:01:42.869> into<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:44.109> liquid

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
go get all the bits into the liquid

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.109 
go get all the bits into the liquid
liquid<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:47.229> tiny<00:01:47.500> bits<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.859> latex<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.520> what

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
liquid with tiny bits of latex in what

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.539 
liquid with tiny bits of latex in what
that's<00:01:49.329> going<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.539> do<00:01:49.719> is<00:01:50.560> see<00:01:50.829> it<00:01:50.890> any<00:01:51.159> punches

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
that's going to do is see it any punches

00:01:51.549 --> 00:02:08.580 
that's going to do is see it any punches
do<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:51.820> care<00:01:52.030> if<00:01:52.119> you<00:01:52.210> go<00:01:52.390> along

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.319 

I<00:02:24.599> use<00:02:25.290> three<00:02:25.590> couples<00:02:26.250> one<00:02:26.969> for<00:02:27.239> luck

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
I use three couples one for luck

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.780 
I use three couples one for luck
firstly<00:02:30.329> when<00:02:30.510> first<00:02:30.750> betting<00:02:31.079> in<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.349> tire

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
firstly when first betting in a tire

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.819 
firstly when first betting in a tire
with<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.969> simmons<00:02:33.420> because<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:34.469> will<00:02:34.620> lose

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
with the simmons because you will lose

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.030 
with the simmons because you will lose
so<00:02:35.810> around<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.989> edges<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.500> if<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:37.769> already

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
so around the edges that if it's already

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.039 
so around the edges that if it's already
gotten<00:02:38.250> their<00:02:38.430> holes<00:02:38.609> in<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.659> what

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
gotten their holes in it this is what

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.229 
gotten their holes in it this is what
once<00:02:40.590> you've<00:02:40.709> got<00:02:40.799> your<00:02:40.920> three<00:02:40.950> cups<00:02:41.400> I've

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
once you've got your three cups I've

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.559 
once you've got your three cups I've
seen<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.659> in<00:02:42.810> your<00:02:42.840> tire

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
seen it in your tire

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.929 
seen it in your tire
to<00:02:45.569> take<00:02:45.780> off<00:02:49.099> put<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.189> tire<00:02:50.370> back<00:02:50.400> onto<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
to take off put the tire back onto the

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.890 
to take off put the tire back onto the
rim

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.449 

don't<00:02:54.900> dues<00:02:56.930> help<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.109> plate<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.530> tire<00:02:58.769> and

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
don't dues help you plate the tire and

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.210 
don't dues help you plate the tire and
move<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.849> tighter<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.299> rim<00:03:01.010> it's<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.069> good

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
move the tighter that rim it's a good

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.170 
move the tighter that rim it's a good
idea<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:03.049> loop<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.290> tip<00:03:04.909> everything<00:03:05.909> runs

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
idea to loop a tip everything runs

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.280 
idea to loop a tip everything runs
