00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:08.490
 personal is only a supplement here one 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.019
 inside the video of the last video, right? 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.519
 is what there is about the betclic site 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:20.039
 I passed the wrong information 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:24.449
 You're sorry the market is divided here. 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.890
 here between colors né then name that color 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.010
 here orange 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.590
 it's the market that calls beck né 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.100
 which is the market in favor 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.950
 this clear blue whiting is the market law that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.890
 The market is fine, so here home 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.940
 It's home, so here it is. 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.770
 here you see a unique thing then you are 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.379
 two markets but the markets but the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.000
 markets, then a pair here for 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:58.649
 rooney is quebec law column beck and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.469
 column of draw law column of bec column 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.339
 of the law so that the teams that are 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.830
 playing is and huawei which is the column of 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:13.680
 bec accumulating law very well then home 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.549
 At home, favorite at home, for example. 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.970
 the borussia dortmund wolfsburg if rome 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.000
 both in favor of betting or with the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.890
 how to bet against beck or law 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.049
 You're betting on who's 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.439
 plays at home omc what is borussia 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.560
 dortmund if it's a tie 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.920
 You 're betting on the tie. 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.450
 If that's the case, you're betting 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.380
 new visitor in the case the wolfsburg is 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.040
 so that information I had 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:55.950
 spoken before the arsenal when Mr. 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:02:01.229
 39 want to right 4150 wrong okay then 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:07.560
 market in favor of the arsenal 11 39 in favor 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:11.170
 1 and 41 against it is if you 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:18.840
 want to enter against the arsenal 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.840
 it is if you want to go against the arsenal 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.660
 instead of in favor of it for example 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.940
 You do not believe much in the air if you do not. 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.850
 Do not you think he's going to score? 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.170
 until the 30 minutes dodo the first part 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.330
 the first time 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.239
 then you will go against it that the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.519
 what will happen if he does not score 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.849
 until a given moment a support 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:46.360
 after 30 minutes of the first half 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.019
 If that time says here, she will. 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.510
 increase 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:54.970
 she's going to 1 4045, okay so if you 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:00.190
 put the 1 41 against and she went to 1 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.769
 45 you close here with 45 -1 44% ok 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.730
 then this is the market against this 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.430
 market in favor 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.420
 There you will be the mirror if 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.069
 specialize in the market that you 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.700
 feel more at ease 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.549
 okay then that is right for rooney grandson 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.489
 finds not so much for or against beck 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:25.840
 or law up the tie market he is 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:27.670
 paying 5.1 and 5.6 beck 5.1 and law 5.6 a 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:34.480
 please and do not 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:37.510
 would be how much here 5.15 would then be 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:44.070
 400% in case here we always take away 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:48.700
 one and here 460% betting on the tie 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:52.329
 placing order on the visitor's draw 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.900
 to the hesitant né in the case west ram 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:59.470
 so if I were to believe in I s 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:06.310
 place an order on him that is 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:08.650
 paying r 4,840 per cent 9.4 or 900 per cent 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.850
 law against counterattack 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.850
 then that's it 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.660
 but does not care about an all 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.859
 markets here all the options they say 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.860
 that is very simple 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.780
 okay with the software so here goes will 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.300
 simplify too much if you do not need 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.180
 worrying is going to close with the Argentinean 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.260
 by west hamm or software does that suffice 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.660
 you give the beginning 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.610
 for example I believe in the arsenal I will 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.760
 enter the Argentine market will enter 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.460
 so here beck 1.44 when closing 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.800
 I'll teach her later, I'll tell her. 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.669
 software that manually is very 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.690
 complicated mainly at the beginning 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.630
 taefik is very complex 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.200
 This is one more inside to explain. 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.780
 correctly that it had passed a 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.340
 Wrong information is fine, that's all. 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.340
 so to have the next video
