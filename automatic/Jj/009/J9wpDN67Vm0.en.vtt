different I got a comment the other day
asking<00:00:14.030> if<00:00:14.180> I<00:00:14.360> would<00:00:15.340> show<00:00:16.340> my<00:00:16.550> setup<00:00:17.119> for<00:00:17.390> the

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
asking if I would show my setup for the

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.529 
asking if I would show my setup for the
Helios<00:00:18.020> and<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:18.440> Deconstructor<00:00:19.360> since<00:00:20.360> it's

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
Helios and the Deconstructor since it's

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.410 
Helios and the Deconstructor since it's
the<00:00:21.789> Sentinel<00:00:22.789> I<00:00:22.850> use<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.210> most<00:00:23.259> the<00:00:24.259> next

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
the Sentinel I use the most the next

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.550 
the Sentinel I use the most the next
Sentinel<00:00:26.420> beyond<00:00:26.720> that<00:00:26.900> that<00:00:27.050> I<00:00:27.140> use<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.349> most

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
Sentinel beyond that that I use the most

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.790 
Sentinel beyond that that I use the most
we<00:00:27.949> Marta<00:00:28.310> Jing<00:00:28.550> Jing<00:00:29.330> however<00:00:30.230> you<00:00:30.380> say<00:00:30.560> that

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
we Marta Jing Jing however you say that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.290 
we Marta Jing Jing however you say that
which<00:00:31.609> is<00:00:31.789> basically<00:00:32.450> set<00:00:32.930> up<00:00:33.080> the<00:00:33.320> same<00:00:33.590> way

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
which is basically set up the same way

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.580 
which is basically set up the same way
in<00:00:35.300> terms<00:00:35.660> of<00:00:37.240> elements<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.380> only

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
in terms of elements and the only

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.320 
in terms of elements and the only
difference<00:00:39.980> really<00:00:40.070> between<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.580> Helios<00:00:41.060> and

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
difference really between the Helios and

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.630 
difference really between the Helios and
the<00:00:41.570> Shang<00:00:42.200> that<00:00:42.470> I<00:00:42.500> use<00:00:42.800> is<00:00:43.070> based<00:00:43.280> off<00:00:43.550> of

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
the Shang that I use is based off of

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.900 
the Shang that I use is based off of
whether<00:00:44.360> I<00:00:44.450> want<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:44.930> use<00:00:45.230> it<00:00:46.070> as<00:00:46.340> close<00:00:46.640> up

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
whether I want to use it as close up

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.230 
whether I want to use it as close up
which<00:00:47.450> is<00:00:47.690> obviously<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.320> Helios<00:00:48.740> since<00:00:49.010> it's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
which is obviously the Helios since it's

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.550 
which is obviously the Helios since it's
melee<00:00:50.240> weapon<00:00:50.570> or<00:00:51.200> the<00:00:51.410> Jing<00:00:51.680> which<00:00:52.010> is<00:00:52.220> a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
melee weapon or the Jing which is a

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.270 
melee weapon or the Jing which is a
quiet<00:00:54.560> and<00:00:54.940> long<00:00:55.940> distance<00:00:56.650> basically<00:00:57.650> but

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
quiet and long distance basically but

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.220 
quiet and long distance basically but
you'll<00:00:58.640> see<00:00:58.850> here<00:00:59.120> I'm<00:00:59.540> using<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.870> same<00:01:00.080> two

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
you'll see here I'm using the same two

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.190 
you'll see here I'm using the same two
elements<00:01:00.740> on<00:01:00.890> both<00:01:01.280> of<00:01:01.460> them<00:01:01.790> as<00:01:01.970> well<00:01:02.210> but<00:01:02.480> ok

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
elements on both of them as well but ok

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.810 
elements on both of them as well but ok
Helios<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:04.220> you're<00:01:04.339> probably<00:01:04.430> going<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.760> be

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
Helios and you're probably going to be

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.950 
Helios and you're probably going to be
surprised<00:01:05.210> at<00:01:05.449> this<00:01:05.570> setup<00:01:06.549> ok<00:01:07.549> it's<00:01:08.390> nothing

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
surprised at this setup ok it's nothing

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.710 
surprised at this setup ok it's nothing
crazy<00:01:09.170> as<00:01:09.710> you're<00:01:10.549> looking<00:01:10.580> at<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.060> here<00:01:11.299> of

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
crazy as you're looking at it here of

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.510 
crazy as you're looking at it here of
course<00:01:11.960> we<00:01:12.080> got<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.320> targeting<00:01:12.740> preceptor<00:01:13.310> or

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
course we got the targeting preceptor or

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.550 
course we got the targeting preceptor or

the receptor of course and we got the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.620 
the receptor of course and we got the

since this mod came out Guardian maxed

about<00:01:43.250> half<00:01:43.460> way<00:01:43.700> this<00:01:44.000> is<00:01:44.150> basically<00:01:44.540> what<00:01:44.840> it

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
about half way this is basically what it

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.830 
about half way this is basically what it
was<00:01:45.110> before<00:01:45.320> they<00:01:45.940> turned<00:01:46.940> it<00:01:47.120> into<00:01:47.300> like<00:01:47.630> the

was before they turned it into like the

the most part they don't die now I could
one<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.660> these<00:02:29.870> days<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.170> will<00:02:30.590> actually

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
one of these days I will actually

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.700 
one of these days I will actually
probably<00:02:31.240> rank<00:02:32.240> this<00:02:32.450> up<00:02:32.630> all<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.930> way<00:02:33.080> in

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
probably rank this up all the way in

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
this slot here which could be something

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.590

like<00:03:29.540> say<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> finisher<00:03:30.410> maybe<00:03:31.160> we'll<00:03:31.730> see<00:03:31.940> not

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
like say a finisher maybe we'll see not

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.900 
like say a finisher maybe we'll see not
really<00:03:32.870> sure<00:03:33.230> how<00:03:33.800> I'd<00:03:34.100> want<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.490> go<00:03:34.580> with<00:03:34.760> it

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
really sure how I'd want to go with it

really sure how I'd want to go with it
um<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:37.630> mean<00:03:38.630> there's<00:03:38.840> there's<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.320> couple<00:03:39.560> of

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
um I mean there's there's a couple of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.290 
um I mean there's there's a couple of
things<00:03:40.070> that<00:03:40.460> you<00:03:40.490> could<00:03:40.760> put<00:03:40.940> in<00:03:41.090> here

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
things that you could put in here

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
things that you could put in here
obviously<00:03:41.660> but<00:03:42.140> I<00:03:42.170> may<00:03:42.530> even<00:03:44.050> dropping<00:03:45.050> the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
obviously but I may even dropping the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.220 
obviously but I may even dropping the
status<00:03:45.710> chance<00:03:46.630> potentially<00:03:47.630> I'd<00:03:47.780> be<00:03:47.990> more

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
status chance potentially I'd be more

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.380 
status chance potentially I'd be more
inclined<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.770> actually<00:03:49.160> just<00:03:49.340> make<00:03:50.180> these

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
inclined to actually just make these

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.460 
inclined to actually just make these
into<00:03:50.630> their<00:03:50.930> full<00:03:51.200> on<00:03:51.470> Bob<00:03:52.160> energy<00:03:52.910> mods<00:03:53.120> or

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
into their full on Bob energy mods or

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.380 
into their full on Bob energy mods or
element<00:03:54.470> mods<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.550> would<00:03:55.670> really<00:03:56.150> bring

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
element mods and that would really bring

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.240 
element mods and that would really bring
up<00:03:56.570> my<00:03:56.720> major<00:03:56.990> damage<00:03:57.410> on<00:03:57.560> this<00:03:57.710> but<00:03:57.920> again<00:03:58.130> the

guess<00:04:15.740> i<00:04:16.430> could<00:04:17.330> put<00:04:17.780> prime<00:04:18.020> heavy<00:04:18.290> trauma<00:04:18.620> on

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
it but since I've only got one of those

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.500 
it but since I've only got one of those
