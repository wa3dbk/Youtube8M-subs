00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 question is it possible for a gay to be 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.470
 Christian a subject that is not touched and in 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.170
 many cases submitted to not having 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.599
 knowledge for this reason there are churches 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.969
 and people who hinder many to 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.340
 know of true and clean love of 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.830
 our savior Jesus Christ according to his 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.140
 own conclusions but it will be that God 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.269
 also rejects the homosexual and the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.210
 Blood of Christ is not able to forgive 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.359
 this sin because so many suicides 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.369
 abandonment violence and abuse for this 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.430
 community designated by the church and by 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.649
 homophobia will be that there is no hope 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.780
 for a law that did not choose its condition 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.059
 or that circumstances led to 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.100
 this feeling in some cases by 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.289
 violations when they were children by 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.840
 abuse or because they were forced to 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.480
 have homosexual relationships between 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.670
 some cases to mention will be possible 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.250
 that god that would be his only answer or 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.710
 output rejects them in the same way 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.079
 same believers who were forgiven 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.180
 of terrible sins have today the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.670
 authority to point these people 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.720
 they have different feelings to 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 that the world 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.920
 and age have approved as normal is 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.290
 true that the bible indicates the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.540
 homosexuality as a sin of equal 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.930
 way a big list of other sins 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.170
 a thief adulterer adulterer liar 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.090
 gossip greedy sorcerer is not 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.340
 seen with so much contempt for 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.830
 believers like still bay and this is what 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.380
 makes the difference of a pure love in 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.300
 christ and a religion holiness and the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.430
 love of our neighbor is what the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.280
 bible asks us to look for everything 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.290
 moment also lives but still nobody 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.840
 while I am in this body of flesh 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.060
 can reach that holiness until 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.700
 we are raptured and transformed into 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.400
 Christ and this not for us because it is a 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.070
 gift of God a gift a gift that is 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.960
 for everyone for his love then who 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.000
 is free from sin to throw the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.670
 first stone who is so tall to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.070
 sit on the throne of god and point or 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.960
 to judge a person for his sin I believe 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.479
 that this corresponds only to God 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.790
 Meanwhile we seek the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.980
 sanctity and pleasing God in everything 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.590
 time praying for others and praying 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.750
 Everyone not judging anyone 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.420
 loving one another with love 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.940
 true if a homosexual is touched by 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.010
 God and called to be saved and he confesses 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.500
 Jesus Christ in his heart as his 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.470
 savior voluntarily he will initiate his 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.129
 fight as we all do the fight 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.959
 to make it nice bye by helping us 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.230
 motivating us by supporting each other 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.690
 others in union in the holy spirit is 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.910
 true that on the road we have all 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.430
 failed but the same god who is faithful 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.920
 motivates us and puts us back in the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.870
 way to stay firm until your 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.540
 come or until the end of our 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.970
 lives is not that we justify sin 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.709
 or homosexuality but to put on 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.930
 the same level of all the others 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.299
 sins and that just as it is 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.610
 bad one to oneself is bad the other and the 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.739
 The only way to be well will be to look for 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.959
 god to be comforted and forgiven 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.760
 feelings and meat fight 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.099
 always against the will and the spirit 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.769
 so this is the reason why 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.140
 many marriages are broken and many 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.359
 believers leave the church with 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.579
 a deep resentment to the things of 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.040
 our savior thinking that is the 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.560
 guilt 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.200
 god while the same church is not 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.480
 able to forgive him his mistake by judging and 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.609
 pointing to these people who have 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.219
 failed is time to love our 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:36.040
 neighbor as ourselves and the 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:38.680
 judgment leave it goodbye the man and the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.650
 homosexual women who decide to look for 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.659
 jesus are welcome to his presence he 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.909
 loves them and died for their sins in the 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.920
 cross in no sense the bible 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.590
 describes homosexuality as a 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.629
 unforgivable sin nor does the Bible teach 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.760
 that homosexuality is a sin 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.310
 against which Christians never 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.680
 will have to fight maybe this is the 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.169
 key phrase as to whether it is possible 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.150
 be a gay Christian and fight against is 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.730
 possible for a Christian to fight with 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.010
 many homosexual temptations 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.409
 homosexuals who become Christians 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.739
 they have ongoing struggles with feelings 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.989
 and homosexual desires some men and 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.060
 strongly heterosexual women have 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.280
 experienced a spark of interest 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.090
 homosexual at some point in their lives 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.940
 if these desires and temptations exist there 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.800
 determines if a person is a Christian 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.530
 the bible is clear that no 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.940
 Christian is free from sin 1st of John 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.190
 18 10 while the specific sin or the 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.530
 temptation varies from one Christian to the other 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.200
 all Christians have struggles with 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.600
 sin and all Christians sometimes 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.170
 fail in those struggles 1st of 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.210
 Corinthians 10 perishes what distinguishes the 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.100
 life of a Christian the life of a no 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.890
 Christian is the fight against sin 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.750
 the Christian life is a process 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:03.340
 progressive to beat the works of the 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.830
 Galatian flesh 5 19 21 and allow the 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.570
 spirit of god produce the fruit of 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:14.070
 Galatian spirit 5 22 23 if the 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.870
 Christians sometimes sin horribly 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.900
 sadly sometimes Christians are 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.420
 indistinguishable from non-Christians without 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.430
 However a true Christian always 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.220
 will always regret 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.890
 finally to god and will always resume the 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.840
 fight against sin but the bible does not 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.120
 supports the idea that a person who 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.780
 continuous and impenitent mind takes part 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.660
 in sin 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.350
 in fact it can be a Christian in 1st 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.990
 of Corinthians 6 11 we read and that were 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.169
 some of you but they have already been 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.450
 washed have already been sanctified they have already 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.639
 been justified in the name of the lord 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:56.650
 Jesus Christ and for the spirit of our 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:59.200
 God 1st Corinthians 6 9 10 puts one 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.930
 list of sins that if practiced 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.389
 continuously identify a person 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.690
 as not redeemed not to be a Christian 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:10.510
 often homosexuality is pointed out 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.300
 from this list if a person struggles with 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.240
 homosexual temptations are supposed to 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.919
 that person is not saved if a person 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.800
 really takes part in acts 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.740
 homosexuals are definitely thinking 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.440
 that person is not saved however 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.260
 the same assumptions are not made at 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.930
 least not with the same emphasis as 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.440
 to other sins on the fornication list 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:38.830
 premarital sex adultery idolatry 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.620
 robbery greed alcoholism slander and 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.960
 cheating is inconsequential for him 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.699
 and declare the guilty of sex 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.310
 premarital as Christians 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.470
 disobedient and at the same time declare 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.410
 to homosexuals definitely not 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.380
 Christians it is possible to be a Christian 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.030
 gay if the phrase gay christian refers 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.300
 a person fighting 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:04.570
 temptations and homosexual desires if a 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.729
 Christian gay is possible however 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.680
 gay Christian qualifier is not 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:11.470
 suitable for a person of these 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.830
 characteristics since he does not want 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.169
 be gay and fight temptations 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:19.270
 a person is not a gay Christian but 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.610
 simply a Christian who struggles with 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.010
 this sin just as there are Christians 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.710
 who fight with fornication the lie 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:29.470
 and stealing amen the art of serving 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:32.789
 share this theme and let's help many 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.789
 know of God's love '
