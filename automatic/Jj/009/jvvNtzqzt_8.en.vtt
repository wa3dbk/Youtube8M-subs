I think this is a healthy alternative to
normal<00:04:22.220> spaghetti<00:04:22.460> seeing<00:04:22.970> as<00:04:23.060> how<00:04:23.270> i'm<00:04:24.080> using

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
normal spaghetti seeing as how i'm using

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.690 
normal spaghetti seeing as how i'm using
turkey<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.270> organic<00:04:26.270> whole<00:04:26.930> wheat<00:04:26.960> spaghetti

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
turkey and organic whole wheat spaghetti

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.290 
turkey and organic whole wheat spaghetti
and<00:04:28.700> stuff<00:04:29.330> um<00:04:29.950> so<00:04:30.950> if<00:04:31.400> you<00:04:31.700> feel<00:04:31.910> like<00:04:31.970> you're
