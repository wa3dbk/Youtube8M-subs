let's come to space weather news to see

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.479 
let's come to space weather news to see
that<00:00:29.029> solar<00:00:29.270> flaring<00:00:29.810> is<00:00:30.020> low<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:30.650> you

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
that solar flaring is low and you

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.120 
that solar flaring is low and you
guessed<00:00:31.759> it<00:00:31.939> blame<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:32.660> sunspots<00:00:33.500> let's

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
guessed it blame the sunspots let's

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.670 
guessed it blame the sunspots let's
