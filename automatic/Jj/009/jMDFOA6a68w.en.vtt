and eighty eight thirty mpg highway on
the other end is the four hundred

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.920
seventy horsepower s party grand
cherokee whose ballots he didn't really

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.900
care about the first place but second
out

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.060
big styling changes apart including

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.040
uh... redesigned headlines with

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.390
l_e_d_ accenture swim gear than before

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.750
progress just as they

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.440
plastic around housing

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.420
kind of look

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.830
break their there are backers re styled
taillights a lot more on the inside

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.790
let's check it out

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.910
figures on the inside

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.970
is right at the center of the dashboard
where there's been redesigned center

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.439
controls your redesigned cluster of

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.060
both instruments and a center screen
here this is chrysler's eight point four

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.600
inch you connect touchscreen works very
quickly which we like prior to some

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.099
other

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:15.270
competing countries

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.829
on the market there's also a seven inch
display here in the summer between to

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.340
uh... you know i gauges you can show
things like steering angle end we'll

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.450
articulation pretty cool stuff for
vehicle it's meant for a lot of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.070
operating

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.100
go find too many cars with the real
leather wrapped dashboards these days

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.090
like ours have kind of imitation leather
simulated stitching up here

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.390
the real deal

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.460
in the grand cherokee jeep says which is
a nice thing

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.200
one thing we don't like so much as the
new shifter this is an electronic

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.750
shifters kind of the same style as you
get an elegy para chrysler's a full-size

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.100
cars of three hundred the dodge charger
let me just kind of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.490
electronically into gear

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.530
does have a very good tactile feel to it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.520
large sedan spicer says

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.270
did improve packaging it was a smaller
thing to placing here helped out with

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.170
some of the space may be a does the same
thing here

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.729
back to you guys have a reasonable
really doesn't go forward and backward

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.430
but it does work fine

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.209
about twenty-four degrees in total deep
says

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.769
but all the way back in for example for
uh...

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.159
falsely beckett

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.169
but i can't do that cuz i gotta say the
rest this video

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.549
still pretty strong capabilities for
this vehicle up to eleven point three

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.229
inches of maximum

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:27.389
ground clearance and seventy four
hundred pounds of point vastly pretty

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:28.739
good figures

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.969
gas mileage improves thanks to a new
eight speed automatic transmission in

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.799
the gasoline v six that raises highway
miles up to twenty five miles per gallon

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.739
ta highly ratings keep estimates free
competitive with other mid-size s_u_v_'s

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.069
that doesn't lead by anyone if you
really want better miles that's what the

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.689
diesel is

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.559
check it out when the grand cherokee
goes on sale later on this year
