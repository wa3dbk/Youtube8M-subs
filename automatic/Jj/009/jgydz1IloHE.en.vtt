00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello guys I'm a plato's cave though 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.069
 I look like a drug addict maybe you are not 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.019
 so far from the truth in these 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.880
 days are very sick and look like a 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.160
 mixtures of the mixed filling of 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.900
 drugs but this will not stop me from 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.980
 make the video about my character 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.060
 favorite of dragon ball that ten shinan 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.039
 I'll wait for you at the end of the video 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.460
 because there are a couple of things that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.029
 I want to tell you and tell you so many have me 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.170
 asked around on facebook on youtube 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.030
 because you really like dragging and me 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.890
 I answer briefly because I'm not going 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.329
 fuck you to answer and then I can't 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.370
 to be eloquent on those systems 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.350
 messaging so we do neither useful 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.050
 we ask for something out of me because of me 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.390
 like point one is impossible 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.430
 identify with son goku gogh as 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.469
 many other protagonists of the comic 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.329
 Japanese sins of what is one 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.219
 character extremization 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.610
 completely devoted to these good 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.990
 characters are unattractive 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.290
 they are beautiful to look at but they are not even 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.470
 motivating more than sincerely 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.159
 therefore against the supporting characters 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.189
 they are more or less multi-faceted 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.080
 they are more human and so maybe you can 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.060
 immerse yourself better identify yourself with 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.840
 more point 2 then ten here guys 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.520
 this is the basis 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.860
 this is the base that is if you don't know 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.630
 this if you are not there you are not a 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.250
 comic book fans from Japan 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.979
 Japanese shits the hermit of the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.439
 Crane comes like a bolt from the blue 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.689
 in the history of dragon ball however it is 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.970
 what we all expected 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.570
 the clash between the arts schools 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.640
 rival martial arts there is this is the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.759
 fuchsia cinema this is the arts cinema 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.460
 Chinese martial arts to which one is torriana 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.090
 always inspired this time it also takes 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.069
 those narrative styles then you see 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.379
 dragging no the first time it arrives 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.770
 I'm kind of a bit bald with no chestnut 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.520
 never opened it feeds eyes 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.680
 door behind porcelain doll 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.190
 clear souvenir from a well-known destination of the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.740
 sex tourism of thailand and that 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.790
 see it say this qua goku makes it out 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.640
 in four and four, however, the sgami 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.990
 which in china is not a sborone for nothing 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:39.620
 all he says he does is very strong 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.230
 sa knows how to do amazing techniques 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.010
 that is when we get the first thing 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.650
 fa is right in the scene 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.720
 floating in the air I am no longer 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.320
 tricks is not the new fifth is not 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.870
 shoot 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.260
 the energy wave and get married 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.610
 energy flies is something you can 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.100
 doing is possible but it is fantastic but then 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.890
 there are absurd techniques you do 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.440
 check your arms from your back 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.060
 the wave woman can copy the wave 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.600
 energy ie it is the mere chamber 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.900
 very strong and then there is one of the techniques 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.610
 which is perhaps the most powerful technique of 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.270
 all those ever seen in dragonballs 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.950
 it is the kiko or the grain or that is a 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.950
 bim paradox because it puts handcuffs 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.900
 corner and down comes out the square that is though 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.959
 It's cool 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.920
 there is instead of using as a reservoir of 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.500
 energy the key laura uses life there is one 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.260
 killer technique so dangerous that 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.580
 not only can it kill the person against 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.910
 which he is fighting but can also 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:52.790
 kill you that is cool, that is 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.060
 the clash with and master muten is perhaps 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.440
 the most uplifting one is for the teacher 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.010
 muten that for ten cina for what 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.400
 happens 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.500
 there is an incredible life lesson 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.870
 muten tries to make ten chin han understand 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.660
 that the world he grew up in is 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.560
 basically a world I hate you 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.970
 of anger of murder is a world that 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.650
 maybe it is not suitable for him is not better 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.990
 serenely confront each other 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.400
 people having friends is a bit 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.620
 launched like this in the dark 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.240
 good in the manga, however, is very deep 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.400
 because it succeeds in instilling a doubt 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.550
 incredible in the mind of you on stage 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.870
 also because then the master muten decides 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.240
 to voluntarily lose the battle 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.090
 could win maybe he could win 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.240
 but he understands that his is coming 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.090
 moment no sooner or later will have to be done by 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.460
 part and therefore it is better to give space to 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.009
 new generations and therefore what happens 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.759
 in dragging an inner conflict e 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.430
 not just 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.320
 there is everything he believed in 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.840
 so far all the teachings that 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.220
 They were given 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.760
 he challenges them to a 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.160
 inner conflict not just kids 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:14.750
 and which then sublimates itself in the clash with 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:18.199
 goku in shinan manga understands that maybe 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.180
 being so dirty killing people 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.300
 it is not what he needs to mature 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.680
 as an athlete and in the manga he is called 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.479
 the pride of the athlete 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.150
 I prefer to call it in another 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.669
 in love way in china it is not 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.870
 passes a hand to the conscience and discovers 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:38.000
 love of one's own and it is a beautiful thing 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.979
 and if we think of all the characters 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.169
 of dragon ball and so on 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.110
 in the only one that then always looks for the way 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.930
 of self improvement by becoming a 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.289
 hermit and the way of choice 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.720
 maybe maybe maybe in the future if this 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.300
 what had been deepened there 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.610
 let's make the mental trine closer 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.900
 could become the new foreign muten 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:05.690
 here we throw ourselves there so it is for these 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.770
 reasons for his growth for his 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.389
 to be a dominant character indeed 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.550
 I really like my character 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.820
 favorite is neither there nor anyone else 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.030
 manages to beat drag for me is one 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:23.599
 superb characterization although it is 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.280
 very thin perhaps in the akira manga 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.210
 toriyama could not express to the 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.659
 better 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.849
 many things but when you read it you do 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.590
 reread you perceive it all there is one 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:37.310
 inner growth in that character 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:40.760
 that frightens everyone's asses 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.160
 something fantastic so I turn around 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.650
