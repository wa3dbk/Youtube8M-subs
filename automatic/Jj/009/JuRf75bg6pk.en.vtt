know pit stop challenge but it's

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.710 
know pit stop challenge but it's
actually<00:00:23.310> impossible<00:00:23.700> to<00:00:24.150> technically

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
actually impossible to technically

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.690 
actually impossible to technically
complete<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.590> challenge<00:00:26.220> for<00:00:26.370> what<00:00:26.550> we're

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
complete this challenge for what we're

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.400 
complete this challenge for what we're
gonna<00:00:26.790> be<00:00:27.000> doing<00:00:27.390> because<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.140> will<00:00:28.230> always

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
gonna be doing because it will always

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.370 
gonna be doing because it will always
disqualify<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.370> on<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.850> penultimate<00:00:30.180> lap<00:00:30.690> if

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
disqualify you on the penultimate lap if

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.080 
disqualify you on the penultimate lap if
you<00:00:31.560> don't<00:00:31.800> pit<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.279> basically<00:00:32.820> what<00:00:33.000> we're

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
you don't pit so basically what we're

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180 
you don't pit so basically what we're
gonna<00:00:33.149> be<00:00:33.360> doing<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.170> succeed<00:00:35.010> this

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
gonna be doing is if we succeed this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.529 
gonna be doing is if we succeed this
challenge<00:00:35.520> or<00:00:35.640> how<00:00:35.789> we<00:00:35.850> succeed<00:00:36.149> this

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
challenge or how we succeed this

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.440 
challenge or how we succeed this
challenge<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.230> basically<00:00:38.100> leading<00:00:38.670> across

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
challenge is basically leading across

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.360 
challenge is basically leading across
the<00:00:39.660> line<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.110> lap<00:00:40.320> number<00:00:40.590> ten<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.280> know

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the line on lap number ten now I know

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.190 
the line on lap number ten now I know
it's<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.700> exactly<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.390> whole<00:00:42.630> race<00:00:42.840> dish

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
it's not exactly a whole race dish

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
it's not exactly a whole race dish
that's<00:00:43.470> pretty<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.920> pretty<00:00:43.950> much<00:00:44.550> there<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that's pretty it's pretty much there and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.729 
that's pretty it's pretty much there and
let's<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.570> honest<00:00:45.810> if<00:00:45.930> they<00:00:46.020> don't<00:00:46.230> catch<00:00:46.470> me

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
let's be honest if they don't catch me

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.410 
let's be honest if they don't catch me
by<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> end<00:00:47.310> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> penultimate<00:00:47.910> lap

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
by the end of the penultimate lap

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.000 
by the end of the penultimate lap
they're<00:00:48.660> probably<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.410> gonna<00:00:49.650> be<00:00:49.829> catching

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
they're probably not gonna be catching

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.850 
they're probably not gonna be catching
me<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.760> race<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.329> yeah<00:00:51.630> this<00:00:52.320> race<00:00:52.560> and

didn't<00:04:39.420> realize<00:04:39.690> it<00:04:39.810> was<00:04:39.870> going<00:04:40.020> this<00:04:40.290> much

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
didn't realize it was going this much

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.870 
didn't realize it was going this much
different<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.250> start<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.700> race

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
different to the start of the race

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.690 
different to the start of the race
really<00:04:42.180> in<00:04:42.330> f1<00:04:42.630> 2014<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.530> managed<00:04:44.190> to<00:04:44.220> complete

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
really in f1 2014 I managed to complete

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.880 
really in f1 2014 I managed to complete
that<00:04:44.910> challenge<00:04:45.270> remember<00:04:45.870> correctly<00:04:46.290> and

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
that challenge remember correctly and

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.080 
that challenge remember correctly and
this<00:04:47.040> one<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.370> feels<00:04:47.460> completely<00:04:47.970> different

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
this one it feels completely different

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.420 
this one it feels completely different
dust<00:04:48.660> field<00:04:48.840> at<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.050> tire<00:04:49.290> wear<00:04:49.620> towards<00:04:50.340> the

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
dust field at the tire wear towards the

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.990 
dust field at the tire wear towards the
endless<00:04:50.730> stint<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> lot<00:04:51.420> worse<00:04:51.720> than<00:04:51.750> in<00:04:52.350> f1

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
endless stint is a lot worse than in f1

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.240 
endless stint is a lot worse than in f1
2014<00:04:54.000> as<00:04:54.320> Sebastian<00:04:55.320> Vettel<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.710> mean<00:04:55.890> he's<00:04:56.010> not

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
2014 as Sebastian Vettel I mean he's not

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.460 
2014 as Sebastian Vettel I mean he's not
that<00:04:56.520> far<00:04:56.850> behind<00:04:57.090> this<00:04:57.420> will<00:04:57.600> see<00:04:57.810> on<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
that far behind this will see on the

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.350 
that far behind this will see on the
sector<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.890> little<00:04:59.010> bit<00:04:59.280> in<00:04:59.550> a<00:04:59.880> minute<00:05:00.150> but<00:05:00.330> I

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
sector a little bit in a minute but I

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.880 
sector a little bit in a minute but I
think<00:05:00.690> he's<00:05:00.840> probably<00:05:01.020> a<00:05:01.260> bit<00:05:01.440> further<00:05:01.680> not

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
think he's probably a bit further not

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.040 
think he's probably a bit further not
behind<00:05:02.190> us<00:05:02.370> here<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.790> go<00:05:03.300> for<00:05:03.570> a<00:05:03.630> mover<00:05:04.020> and

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
behind us here to go for a mover and

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.020 
behind us here to go for a mover and
that's<00:05:04.230> completely<00:05:04.770> messed<00:05:05.130> up<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.550> final

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
that's completely messed up the final

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.000 
that's completely messed up the final
corner<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:07.080> it<00:05:07.169> looks<00:05:07.320> like<00:05:07.410> we'll<00:05:07.590> still<00:05:07.860> be

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
corner so it looks like we'll still be

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.070 
corner so it looks like we'll still be
on<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.190> podium<00:05:08.430> before<00:05:09.240> we<00:05:09.570> get<00:05:09.720> disqualified

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
on the podium before we get disqualified

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.320 
on the podium before we get disqualified
but<00:05:10.830> let's<00:05:11.160> be<00:05:11.340> honest<00:05:11.550> we've<00:05:11.700> still<00:05:12.000> failed

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
but let's be honest we've still failed

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.570 
but let's be honest we've still failed
the<00:05:12.540> challenge<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:13.169> we<00:05:13.890> haven't<00:05:14.190> done<00:05:14.310> a<00:05:14.370> very

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
the challenge and we haven't done a very

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.430 
the challenge and we haven't done a very
good<00:05:14.700> job<00:05:15.000> in<00:05:15.060> this<00:05:15.240> race<00:05:15.480> maybe<00:05:15.780> pacing

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
good job in this race maybe pacing

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.990 
good job in this race maybe pacing
yourself<00:05:16.530> at<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:16.980> start<00:05:17.250> wasn't<00:05:17.520> a<00:05:17.760> great

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
yourself at the start wasn't a great

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.420 
yourself at the start wasn't a great
idea<00:05:18.450> if<00:05:19.020> we'd<00:05:19.169> put<00:05:19.380> in<00:05:19.500> two<00:05:19.590> more<00:05:19.740> faster<00:05:20.280> lap

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
idea if we'd put in two more faster lap

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.940 
idea if we'd put in two more faster lap
times<00:05:20.669> at<00:05:20.790> the<00:05:20.880> start<00:05:21.210> maybe<00:05:21.660> just<00:05:22.140> maybe<00:05:22.350> this

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
times at the start maybe just maybe this

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.920 
times at the start maybe just maybe this
challenge<00:05:23.400> could<00:05:23.700> have<00:05:23.880> been<00:05:24.060> completed<00:05:24.540> but

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
challenge could have been completed but

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.360 
challenge could have been completed but
you<00:05:24.990> can<00:05:25.140> see<00:05:25.290> they're<00:05:25.530> already<00:05:25.710> at<00:05:25.860> someone

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
you can see they're already at someone

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.210 
you can see they're already at someone
so<00:05:26.850> I<00:05:26.910> cross<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.390> line<00:05:27.540> get<00:05:28.080> disqualified<00:05:28.440> we

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
so I cross the line get disqualified we

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.640 
so I cross the line get disqualified we
