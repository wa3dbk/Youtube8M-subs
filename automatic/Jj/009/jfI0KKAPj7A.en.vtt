students know i have small hands not at

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.640 
students know i have small hands not at
all<00:00:14.730> suited<00:00:15.330> for<00:00:15.509> piano<00:00:15.809> playing<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.350> ideal

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
all suited for piano playing the ideal

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.650 
all suited for piano playing the ideal
hand<00:00:16.980> would<00:00:17.160> be<00:00:17.310> longer<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.240> fingers<00:00:18.510> would

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
hand would be longer the fingers would

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.330 
hand would be longer the fingers would
be<00:00:18.750> longer<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.350> reach<00:00:19.650> would<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:19.949> longer<00:00:20.189> I

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
be longer the reach would be longer I

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.050 
be longer the reach would be longer I
can<00:00:20.430> barely<00:00:21.180> reach<00:00:21.480> an<00:00:21.630> octave<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:23.060> can

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
can barely reach an octave but I can

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.730 
can barely reach an octave but I can
reach<00:00:24.240> an<00:00:24.390> octave<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.869> I've<00:00:25.050> learned<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> fill

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
reach an octave and I've learned to fill

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.620 
reach an octave and I've learned to fill
in<00:00:25.890> notes<00:00:26.160> between<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.730> octave<00:00:27.119> notes<00:00:27.390> so

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
in notes between the octave notes so

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.960 
in notes between the octave notes so
they<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.930> get<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> full<00:00:28.410> sound<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.340> okay

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
they can get a full sound like that okay

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.479 
they can get a full sound like that okay
so<00:00:30.869> i'm<00:00:31.019> going<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.380> using<00:00:31.410> what<00:00:32.189> i<00:00:32.219> call

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
so i'm going to be using what i call

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.639 
so i'm going to be using what i call
stuffed<00:00:32.910> octaves<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> right<00:00:33.719> hand<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
stuffed octaves in the right hand in the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.319 
stuffed octaves in the right hand in the
left<00:00:34.890> hand<00:00:35.070> i'm<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> i'm<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.090> play

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
left hand i'm going to i'm going to play

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.180 
left hand i'm going to i'm going to play
chords<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:36.930> i'm<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> some<00:00:37.920> kind<00:00:38.070> of

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
chords but i'm going to some kind of

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.010 
chords but i'm going to some kind of
strum<00:00:38.579> them<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.120> kind<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.660> strum<00:00:39.989> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
strum them like it's kind of strum a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:01:12.640 
strum them like it's kind of strum a
guitar<00:00:40.140> okay<00:00:40.920> listen

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.890 

I'll<00:01:13.460> come<00:01:13.700> back<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.000> talk<00:01:14.120> about<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:14.600> core

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
I'll come back and talk about that core

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:28.340 
I'll come back and talk about that core
that's<00:01:15.170> kind<00:01:15.440> of<00:01:15.470> interesting

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.990 

I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:56.880 

I<00:01:37.530> notice<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.680> difference<00:01:39.010> here

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:10.870 

you

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.340 

as<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.150> see<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.480> barely<00:02:12.810> reach<00:02:13.080> those

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
as you can see I can barely reach those

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.010 
as you can see I can barely reach those
oCTA's<00:02:13.860> sometimes<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.870> little

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
oCTA's sometimes and so it's a little

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.330 
oCTA's sometimes and so it's a little
sloppy<00:02:16.380> but<00:02:18.290> those<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.620> with<00:02:19.800> slightly

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
sloppy but those of you with slightly

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.900 
sloppy but those of you with slightly
larger<00:02:20.970> hands<00:02:21.210> than<00:02:21.510> mine<00:02:22.490> can<00:02:23.490> do<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.760> much

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
larger hands than mine can do it much

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.350 
larger hands than mine can do it much
better<00:02:23.940> I'm<00:02:24.390> sure<00:02:25.160> but<00:02:26.160> even<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> little<00:02:27.180> hand

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
better I'm sure but even a little hand

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.090 
better I'm sure but even a little hand
like<00:02:27.540> mine<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:28.020> get<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.410> done<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:28.950> a

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
like mine can get it done it's just a

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.850 
like mine can get it done it's just a
little<00:02:29.250> bit<00:02:29.430> sloppy<00:02:29.700> when<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.270> was<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:31.830> know

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
little bit sloppy when I was a you know

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.340 
little bit sloppy when I was a you know
more<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.250> practice<00:02:32.730> I'm<00:02:33.420> an<00:02:33.630> old<00:02:33.780> guy<00:02:33.870> now<00:02:34.140> but

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
more in practice I'm an old guy now but

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.290 
more in practice I'm an old guy now but
when<00:02:34.530> i<00:02:34.650> was<00:02:34.800> born<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.100> practice<00:02:35.550> i<00:02:35.700> could<00:02:35.910> pull

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
when i was born in practice i could pull

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.810 
when i was born in practice i could pull
that<00:02:36.330> off<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.630> lot<00:02:36.930> cleaner<00:02:37.230> now<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.520> sloppy

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
that off a lot cleaner now it's sloppy

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.140 
that off a lot cleaner now it's sloppy
because<00:02:39.630> i<00:02:39.750> haven't<00:02:39.930> played<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.200> much<00:02:40.440> I

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
because i haven't played that much I

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.240 
because i haven't played that much I
used<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.240> before<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.570> perform<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.740> used<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.980> soak

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
used to before I perform I used to soak

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.600 
used to before I perform I used to soak
my<00:02:44.280> hands<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.120> really<00:02:45.900> warm<00:02:46.260> water<00:02:46.620> hot<00:02:47.340> as<00:02:47.490> I

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
my hands in really warm water hot as I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.880 
my hands in really warm water hot as I
can<00:02:47.760> stand<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.600> at<00:02:48.840> war<00:02:49.050> space<00:02:49.290> i<00:02:49.440> push<00:02:49.710> them

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
can stand in at war space i push them

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.530 
can stand in at war space i push them
down<00:02:49.920> at<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.430> bottom<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.850> stretch<00:02:51.180> them<00:02:51.390> and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
down at the bottom and stretch them and

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.980 
down at the bottom and stretch them and
leave<00:02:52.140> them<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:52.440> there<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:53.400> maybe<00:02:53.550> 60<00:02:54.480> seconds

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
leave them in there for maybe 60 seconds

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.610 
leave them in there for maybe 60 seconds
and<00:02:55.430> then<00:02:56.430> take<00:02:56.670> them<00:02:56.790> out<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.000> dry<00:02:57.330> them<00:02:57.620> well

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
and then take them out and dry them well

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.410 
and then take them out and dry them well
of<00:02:58.860> course<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.340> then<00:02:59.820> they<00:02:59.970> felt<00:03:00.210> very

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
of course and then they felt very

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.180 
of course and then they felt very
relaxed<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.230> supple<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:01.800> if<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.010> play

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
relaxed and supple so if you play

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.730 
relaxed and supple so if you play
professionally<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.450> would<00:03:04.050> urge<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.470> try

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
professionally I I would urge you to try

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.920 
professionally I I would urge you to try
that<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.760> technique<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.360> used<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.720> lot

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
that it's a technique that I used a lot

i get there there i'm using i'm using
not<00:03:33.670> just<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:34.000> coordinates<00:03:34.420> but<00:03:34.599> the<00:03:34.750> major

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
not just the coordinates but the major

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.750

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
seventh and the ninth and i can use

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.059 
seventh and the ninth and i can use
passing<00:03:40.239> tones<00:03:40.480> if<00:03:40.750> i<00:03:40.930> want<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.200> i<00:03:41.470> don't<00:03:41.920> think

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
passing tones if i want to i don't think

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:55.890 
passing tones if i want to i don't think
i<00:03:42.160> did<00:03:42.370> but<00:03:42.550> i<00:03:42.670> could<00:03:42.880> do<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.050> see<00:03:44.050> that<00:03:54.900> and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
i did but i could do that see that and

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.289 
i did but i could do that see that and
sometimes<00:03:56.319> i<00:03:56.530> use<00:03:56.560> octave<00:03:57.280> thirds<00:03:57.640> like<00:03:58.090> that

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
sometimes i use octave thirds like that

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.729 
sometimes i use octave thirds like that
that's<00:03:58.599> an<00:03:58.750> octave<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.170> there's<00:03:59.380> a<00:03:59.440> third

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
that's an octave and there's a third

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.809 
that's an octave and there's a third
below<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.160> top<00:04:00.400> octave<00:04:01.030> note<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:03.519> notice

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
below the top octave note and you notice

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.770 
below the top octave note and you notice
that<00:04:03.880> sometimes<00:04:04.329> I<00:04:05.130> on<00:04:06.390> purpose<00:04:07.390> light<00:04:07.599> off<00:04:07.750> a

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:29.659 
i'm only using one up between it's

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.739 
i'm only using one up between it's
cleaner<00:04:29.960> if<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.169> just<00:04:30.379> play<00:04:30.529> octaves<00:04:31.719> until<00:04:32.719> I

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:32.749 
cleaner if I just play octaves until I

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:36.249 
cleaner if I just play octaves until I
get<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.319> a<00:04:33.349> longer<00:04:33.680> note<00:04:34.689> so<00:04:35.689> you<00:04:35.749> want<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.080> fill
