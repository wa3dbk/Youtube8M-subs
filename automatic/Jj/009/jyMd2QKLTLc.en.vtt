00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:15.990
 the door opens begins the trigger who and 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:32.099
 why only in school I understand I am on the board 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:35.930
 I look I speak beautifully at me 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.360
 it turned out Russia 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.739
 it's easy for you to talk about you 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:49.980
 it's harder for me 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:55.170
 I, too, was not easy to draw good 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.570
 day let friends go why 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.840
 argue and we draw 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.830
 I drew ornaments like this 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.290
 leaves dotted dashes 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.250
 and here we can never decide which 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.979
 of them better and more beautiful let me see 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:20.340
 look well i like both of me too 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.189
 the more so because you have drawn perfectly 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.479
 different look types of ornament so i 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.880
 I think that in your dispute 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.200
 friendship won in different types of ornament 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.930
 and so you yourself spoke one of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.490
 the past lessons that ornament is 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.700
 repeating pattern 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.689
 what kind of a lot are there about 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.460
 different kinds 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.030
 ornament and each one in its own way 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.140
 unique for example shu dinar navin here 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.090
 called linear I why because 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.360
 he them off line or like league 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.399
 correctly look and here is a zubko ornament 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.360
 called circular but its still often 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.700
 call the word rosette why rosette 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.500
 socket is such a thing mouth where 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.180
 all kinds of electrical appliances stick from 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.270
 word rosette comes from french 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:20.010
 the words 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:25.420
 zed meaning rosette ornament and 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.800
 It seems to usually include a socket 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:35.530
 flower ornament 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:38.280
 what beautiful ornaments where depicted 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.550
 leaves and fruits and trees are called 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.730
 vegetative and I understood they were growing 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.160
 that with him right look here 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:58.480
 for example a floral ornament with fruits 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:03:03.280
 But look flower ornament and 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.020
 thumbs and now and the fact that all 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.970
 items in the ornament should be 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.060
 simple but recognizable 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.830
 for this, all the extra parts are removed 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.860
 it's called stylization stylization what 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.340
 it is but look here for example 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.520
 ordinary maple leaf wow how 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.140
 interesting and if its form to simplify and 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.040
 remove all unnecessary details 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:47.349
 then we will see this 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:52.769
 and very simple ornament 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.769
 Well, for example such as a portrayed Shun 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.290
 but not only linear but also 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.540
 geometric in may consist of 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.230
 different geometric shapes triangle 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.489
 square and circles of a dotted line 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.000
 geometric ornaments probably the most 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:12.549
 simple well it just think drew 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.459
 triangle or circle added a few 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.519
 lines and points and here it is today a few 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.259
 just repeated vlad arredamenti ready but 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.150
 can not you say the geometric environment 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:29.860
 Ornaments are simple 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:32.080
 for example here such but there are also difficult 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:38.130
 geometric designs here please 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:40.990
 and there is another type of ornament 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.530
 animals animals or something 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.650
 just so different animals and birds however 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:57.690
 their images are also greatly simplified 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:05:07.690
 here look but of course there is that too 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:10.210
 a separate type of ornament here look well 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.130
 so what kind of ornament 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.490
 we will draw today and 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.909
 where everything is repeated with water and moreover 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:23.130
 vegetable do not really like all sorts 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:23.130
 leaves and flowers, especially in the ornament 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.860
 sketch shave the artist already draws 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:35.759
 first leaf 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:39.090
 next to him are different curls and now 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:42.449
 repeat all the same but of course 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.990
 repeat from yourself and born 1-40 should 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.990

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:58.289
 ready turned vegetable 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.210

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.310
 now it's time to give the guys 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.770
