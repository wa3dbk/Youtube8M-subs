00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.280
 today I will cook an unusual dish 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.969
 usually this part of the trophy hunters 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.460
 leave or the huntsman or give the dogs I 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.070
 I think that in the first place it is not noble and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.460
 secondly it is not very prudent 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.930
 today we will cook a slide this dish 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.449
 which came up with the Rusyns 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.449
 First you need to burn your head 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.280
 I've been a little bit 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.050

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.949
 head club is elementary 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.309
 here I have a clean skin space 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.310
 but this process is best completed on the street 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.799
 Well, that's an hour and a half effort 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.990

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.990

 fit in our saucepan 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.380
 but the secret of the slide is that it is not only 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.229

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:37.539
