you're<00:02:47.260> not<00:02:47.409> really<00:02:47.590> here

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.680 

the<00:03:14.980> other<00:03:15.130> flaw<00:03:15.459> with<00:03:15.700> these<00:03:15.880> guitars<00:03:16.360> is

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
the other flaw with these guitars is

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.140 
the other flaw with these guitars is
they<00:03:17.260> had<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.440> very<00:03:17.680> unique<00:03:17.940> bridge<00:03:18.940> shape<00:03:19.740> a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
they had a very unique bridge shape a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.610 
they had a very unique bridge shape a
lot<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.300> guitar<00:03:22.810> companies<00:03:23.260> actually

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
lot of guitar companies actually

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.760 
lot of guitar companies actually
borrowed<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:25.420> idea<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.900> this<00:03:26.080> shape<00:03:26.350> but<00:03:26.590> then

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
borrowed the idea of this shape but then

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.920 
borrowed the idea of this shape but then
of<00:03:26.890> course<00:03:26.920> improved<00:03:27.520> upon<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.090> first<00:03:28.420> one

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
of course improved upon it the first one

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.090 
of course improved upon it the first one
I<00:03:28.959> think<00:03:29.080> about<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.620> tailor<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.370> Takamine

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
I think about is a tailor and Takamine

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.070 
I think about is a tailor and Takamine
one<00:03:33.100> thing<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.459> this<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:34.540> person<00:03:34.959> that

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
one thing that this the person that

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.420 
one thing that this the person that
reset<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.530> neck<00:03:35.680> had<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:35.920> do<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.160> course<00:03:36.190> is

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
reset the neck had to do of course is

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.870 
reset the neck had to do of course is
cut<00:03:36.820> a<00:03:36.850> new<00:03:37.180> saddle<00:03:37.750> for<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:38.230> guitar<00:03:38.880> usually

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
cut a new saddle for this guitar usually

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.150 
cut a new saddle for this guitar usually
the<00:03:40.209> saddles<00:03:40.630> on<00:03:40.780> these<00:03:40.989> guitars<00:03:41.410> were<00:03:41.739> very

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
the saddles on these guitars were very

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.780 
the saddles on these guitars were very
thin<00:03:42.640> a<00:03:42.910> lot<00:03:43.270> thinner<00:03:43.570> than<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.020> average

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
thin a lot thinner than the average

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.780 
thin a lot thinner than the average
saddle<00:03:45.790> we're<00:03:45.910> talking<00:03:46.330> about<00:03:46.600> maybe<00:03:47.610> maybe<00:03:48.610> a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
saddle we're talking about maybe maybe a

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.840 
saddle we're talking about maybe maybe a
quarter<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.390> an<00:03:49.540> inch<00:03:49.720> if<00:03:50.170> not<00:03:50.739> thinner<00:03:51.370> for<00:03:51.790> a

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
quarter of an inch if not thinner for a

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.729 
quarter of an inch if not thinner for a
saddle<00:03:52.300> so<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.050> first<00:03:53.230> thing<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.440> wanted<00:03:53.650> to

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
saddle so the first thing you wanted to

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.740 
saddle so the first thing you wanted to
do<00:03:53.890> is<00:03:54.070> put<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.340> in<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.520> thicker<00:03:54.820> saddle<00:03:55.540> like<00:03:55.690> a

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
do is put it in a thicker saddle like a

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.699 
do is put it in a thicker saddle like a
traditional<00:03:56.470> saddle<00:03:56.890> would<00:03:56.980> be<00:03:57.630> but<00:03:58.630> when<00:03:59.560> you

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
traditional saddle would be but when you

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.110 
traditional saddle would be but when you
had<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.100> route<00:04:00.400> for<00:04:01.360> that<00:04:01.390> particular<00:04:02.140> spot

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
had to route for that particular spot

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.330 
had to route for that particular spot
the<00:04:04.120> routing<00:04:04.570> made<00:04:05.200> it<00:04:05.350> long<00:04:05.530> like<00:04:05.799> a<00:04:05.830> pre-war

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
the routing made it long like a pre-war

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
the routing made it long like a pre-war
Marten<00:04:06.760> style<00:04:07.060> saddle<00:04:09.120> unfortunately<00:04:10.120> though

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
Marten style saddle unfortunately though

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.810 
Marten style saddle unfortunately though
he<00:04:10.720> didn't<00:04:11.019> have<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.140> piece<00:04:11.320> of<00:04:11.500> bone<00:04:11.709> that<00:04:12.700> was

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
he didn't have a piece of bone that was

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.080 
he didn't have a piece of bone that was
long<00:04:13.060> enough<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:13.600> this<00:04:14.080> is<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.260> piece<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:15.090> solid

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
long enough so this is a piece of solid

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.659 
long enough so this is a piece of solid
hickory<00:04:16.570> which<00:04:17.320> is<00:04:17.440> a<00:04:17.470> very<00:04:17.680> dense<00:04:17.950> you<00:04:18.549> know

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
hickory which is a very dense you know

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.849 
hickory which is a very dense you know
hard<00:04:18.940> wood<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.780> they<00:04:19.989> use<00:04:20.200> a<00:04:20.229> lot<00:04:20.500> of<00:04:20.620> times

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
hard wood that they use a lot of times

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.770 
hard wood that they use a lot of times
for<00:04:21.220> archtop<00:04:21.880> bridges<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.450> things<00:04:22.570> of<00:04:22.750> that

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
for archtop bridges and things of that

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.219 
for archtop bridges and things of that
nature<00:04:23.580> that's<00:04:24.580> been<00:04:24.850> hand<00:04:25.150> carved<00:04:26.080> and

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
nature that's been hand carved and

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.630 
nature that's been hand carved and
fitted<00:04:26.620> for<00:04:26.830> this<00:04:26.950> particular<00:04:27.430> bridge

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
fitted for this particular bridge

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.930 
fitted for this particular bridge
another<00:04:28.570> small<00:04:29.080> thing<00:04:29.380> he<00:04:29.500> did<00:04:29.710> was<00:04:29.860> he

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
another small thing he did was he

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.719 
another small thing he did was he
sculpted<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.630> bridge<00:04:31.900> back<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.620> little<00:04:33.130> bit<00:04:33.370> so

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
sculpted the bridge back a little bit so

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.170 
sculpted the bridge back a little bit so
as<00:04:34.450> not<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.720> have<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.440> severe<00:04:36.130> break<00:04:36.520> angle<00:04:37.030> on

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
as not to have a severe break angle on

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.540 
as not to have a severe break angle on
the<00:04:37.330> strings<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:38.169> does<00:04:38.620> still<00:04:38.950> have<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.190> pretty

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
the strings it does still have a pretty

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.960 
the strings it does still have a pretty
solid<00:04:39.880> break<00:04:40.240> angle<00:04:40.690> but<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:41.470> actually

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
solid break angle but that actually

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.700 
solid break angle but that actually
gives<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.210> pretty<00:04:43.479> nice<00:04:43.720> tight

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
gives it a pretty nice tight

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.129 
gives it a pretty nice tight
sound<00:04:46.340> better<00:04:46.639> a<00:04:46.910> lot<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:47.330> tight<00:04:47.600> resonance

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
sound better a lot of tight resonance

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:54.240 
sound better a lot of tight resonance
against<00:04:48.560> the
