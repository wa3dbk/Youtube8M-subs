00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
kind of had a nice amount of villainous

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.680 
kind of had a nice amount of villainous
if<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.400> know<00:00:17.580> what<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.699> mean<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:18.300> see<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> lot<00:00:18.630> of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
if you know what I mean we see a lot of

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.470 
if you know what I mean we see a lot of
mudarra<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.619> Kabuto<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.910> they're<00:00:21.330> actually

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
mudarra and Kabuto and they're actually

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.410 
mudarra and Kabuto and they're actually
surprised<00:00:22.199> about<00:00:22.470> ginkaku<00:00:23.070> ginkaku<00:00:23.420> losing

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
surprised about ginkaku ginkaku losing

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.779 
surprised about ginkaku ginkaku losing
getting<00:00:24.720> sucked<00:00:24.990> into<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.289> gory<00:00:25.560> ready<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.070> I

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
getting sucked into the gory ready and I

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.439 
getting sucked into the gory ready and I
thought<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.090> was<00:00:27.180> really<00:00:27.359> interesting

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
thought that was really interesting

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.640 
thought that was really interesting
because<00:00:29.269> we<00:00:30.269> haven't<00:00:30.570> seen<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.960> lot<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.199> them<00:00:31.470> in

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
because we haven't seen a lot of them in

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.700 
because we haven't seen a lot of them in
like<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.070> lot<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.399> previous<00:00:32.850> chapters<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.450> such

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
like a lot of previous chapters and such

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.260 
like a lot of previous chapters and such
basically<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.739> believe<00:00:35.219> mudarra<00:00:35.579> comes<00:00:35.969> to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
basically I believe mudarra comes to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.990 
basically I believe mudarra comes to
grab<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> gourd<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.680> was<00:00:38.129> left<00:00:38.370> behind<00:00:38.610> by

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
grab the gourd that was left behind by

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.479 
grab the gourd that was left behind by
being<00:00:39.300> cocky<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.719> kinkaku<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.350> retrieve<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
being cocky with kinkaku and retrieve it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.410 
being cocky with kinkaku and retrieve it

him and she actually was doing something

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.700 
him and she actually was doing something
but<00:01:33.180> things<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.900> bit<00:01:34.020> different<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.439> he<00:01:34.619> has

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
but things a bit different that he has

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.399 
but things a bit different that he has
the<00:01:34.890> Rinnegan<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.610> his<00:01:35.700> eyes<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.240> he's<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.190 
the Rinnegan in his eyes and he's just a
lot<00:01:37.590> more<00:01:37.770> stronger<00:01:38.100> than<00:01:38.189> previously<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.270> we

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
lot more stronger than previously so we

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.300 
lot more stronger than previously so we
don't<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.470> how<00:01:40.619> things<00:01:40.829> are<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.159> go

with his mask another thing like going
to<00:01:44.880> different<00:01:45.180> realms<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.320> can

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.100 
that's a little annoying as well because
it's<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.840> seems<00:01:52.049> like

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.810 
know we also get a little bit of the
rouille<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> chapter<00:01:58.320> that's<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.310> good<00:01:59.610> as

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
rouille in the chapter that's a good as

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.940 
rouille in the chapter that's a good as
well<00:02:00.030> he's<00:02:00.360> kind<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:01.020> little<00:02:01.439> nervous

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
well he's kind of like a little nervous

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.550 
well he's kind of like a little nervous
about<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.399> big<00:02:02.610> monster<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.869> madura<00:02:04.350> has

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
about the big monster that madura has

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.630 
about the big monster that madura has
summoned<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.719> that's<00:02:06.979> cool<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
summoned and that's cool just to see the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.160 
summoned and that's cool just to see the
ruie<00:02:08.789> i<00:02:08.910> guess<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.270> could<00:02:09.360> say<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:09.569> kind<00:02:10.140> of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
ruie i guess you could say but kind of

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.360 
ruie i guess you could say but kind of
makes<00:02:10.349> them<00:02:10.470> look<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> little<00:02:10.830> pumpkin

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
makes them look like a little pumpkin

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.870 
makes them look like a little pumpkin
away<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.270> punk

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
away not in a punk

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.540 
away not in a punk
not<00:02:12.970> punk<00:02:13.300> i<00:02:13.420> guess<00:02:13.630> because<00:02:13.810> he's<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:15.520> know

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
not punk i guess because he's you know

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.480 
not punk i guess because he's you know
obviously<00:02:15.790> scared<00:02:16.330> for<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.690> reason<00:02:17.140> but<00:02:17.490> it's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
obviously scared for a reason but it's

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.800 
obviously scared for a reason but it's
just<00:02:18.670> like<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.820> chapter<00:02:22.210> didn't<00:02:22.420> have<00:02:22.570> much

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
just like the chapter didn't have much

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.750 
just like the chapter didn't have much
of<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:23.020> roof<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.830> previous<00:02:24.250> chapters<00:02:24.580> had

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
of a roof that the previous chapters had

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.430 
of a roof that the previous chapters had
either<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.330> guess<00:02:25.600> this<00:02:25.750> week<00:02:25.960> with<00:02:26.110> chapters

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
either I guess this week with chapters

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.590 
either I guess this week with chapters
is<00:02:26.560> weren't<00:02:26.860> all<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.430> exciting<00:02:28.300> the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
is weren't all that exciting the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.540 
is weren't all that exciting the
previous<00:02:28.990> ones<00:02:29.350> were<00:02:29.470> pretty<00:02:29.710> good<00:02:29.890> but<00:02:30.130> this

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
previous ones were pretty good but this

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.880 
previous ones were pretty good but this
one<00:02:30.730> was<00:02:30.880> actually<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.420> bit<00:02:31.600> stale<00:02:31.900> as<00:02:32.110> well<00:02:32.320> not

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890

by tomorrow i'm going to rule and such

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.590 
by tomorrow i'm going to rule and such
so<00:03:02.560> i<00:03:02.860> don't<00:03:03.640> really<00:03:03.670> know<00:03:03.820> what<00:03:04.090> exactly<00:03:04.210> are

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
so i don't really know what exactly are

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.020 
so i don't really know what exactly are
its<00:03:04.780> plans<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.290> i<00:03:05.740> know<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.580> know<00:03:06.820> he's

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
its plans and i know that you know he's

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.790 
its plans and i know that you know he's
not<00:03:07.150> i<00:03:07.210> has<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.600> gourd<00:03:07.900> he<00:03:08.440> might<00:03:08.650> get

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
not i has that gourd he might get

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.410 
not i has that gourd he might get
stronger<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.460> I<00:03:09.550> bring<00:03:09.700> them<00:03:09.880> back<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.210> such

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
stronger and I bring them back and such

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.990 
stronger and I bring them back and such
but<00:03:11.140> overall<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.860> was<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.340> was<00:03:12.430> nice<00:03:12.640> i<00:03:12.790> guess

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
but overall it was it was nice i guess

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.240 
but overall it was it was nice i guess
it<00:03:13.120> was<00:03:13.150> cool<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.600> see<00:03:13.750> mudarra<00:03:14.290> Cavuto<00:03:14.830> that

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
it was cool to see mudarra Cavuto that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.610 
it was cool to see mudarra Cavuto that
was<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> plus<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.970> such<00:03:16.180> but<00:03:16.840> if<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.440> read<00:03:17.560> a

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
was a plus and such but if you read a
