 if you plan to go to 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.540
 crown or san francisco 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.269
 be sure to grab the camera like 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.289
 Researchers assure these photos in 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.600
 the future will become 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.180
 the only way to convey to our 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.720
 great-grandchildren information about many beautiful 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 Mother Nature has already outlined dozens 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.570
 cities that will disappear from the face of the earth 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.329
 people know that san francisco is in 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.030
 seismically dangerous zone and in this city 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.640
 Earthquakes often but 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.340
 horrendous consequences which may 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.129
 lead a powerful disaster is beyond 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.440
 edge of the usual understanding of the citizens 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.590
 experts estimate the probability 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.350
 that in the next 70 years san francisco 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.410
 8 earthquake will happen 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.050
 points on the Richter scale reaches 75 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.329
 percent in san francisco is huge 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.449
 the number of tall buildings that are not 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.060
 stand even 6 points what to talk about 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.909
 Eight late from this city 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.010
 a lot of people are leaving and they are doing right 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.250
 after all, to remain dangerous all the more 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.140
 take root in this city 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.530
 venice is the most romantic city in the world but 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.030
 unfortunately he has no bright future 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.580
 the city has been sinking steadily since 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.680
 grounds and lately the pace 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.409
 dives increased dramatically behind 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.140
 soil level has gone down for the last 50 years 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.140
 at 24 centimeters what is twenty times 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.840
 more than usual today vulnerability 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.299
 Venice is great because this city is like 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.060
 no other depends on the water level 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.670
 over three billion was spent 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.100
 Euro for various protection systems against 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.110
 floods but as it turned out 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.509
 project abandoned by set 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.480
 the reasons for which were corruption 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.300
 from the side 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.300
 mayor and 8 high ranking officials 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.080
 which incidentally arrested on this 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.560
 moment venice kills a huge level 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.600
 crime rape and murder 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.810
 reduced the population of this city almost in 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.450
 3 times Detroit is deservedly named the most 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.390
 dangerous city of usa during the heyday 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.170
 detroit its population reached almost 2 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.600
 million now less than seven hundred thousand 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.400
 moreover in this city the biggest 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.620
 unemployment rate 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.830
 the city is rapidly turning into 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.610
 ghost sad but Russian 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.660
 cities are also on this list 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.450
 administrative center of Ivanovo 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.030
 the region is in serious decline 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.820
 before the city was a large textile 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.120
 the center here came thousands of women

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.570
 the fair sex led 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.150
 what Ivanov began to call 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.360
 cities to me weight after the collapse of the Soviet 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.270
 Union 60 percent of the local population 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.920
 had to tighten their belts tighter growth 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.350
 textile competition 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.200
 the industry as well as the output of the Chinese and 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.690
 Turkish products have undermined the economy 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.390
 Ivanovo low birth rate on the background 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.750
 high mortality poverty crime 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.780
 drug and alcohol abuse 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.190
 infrastructure collapse all this reason 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.980
 destroyed the once thriving city 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.470
 and turned it into a pale shadow 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.930
 worst of all that young people are leaving massively 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.420
 Ivanova and moved to more developed 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.220
 Russian regions 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.500

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.680

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.170
 gradually sinking mexico is located on 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.690
 the bottom of the dried lake which is 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.180
 the main source of drinking water for 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.640

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.910
 exhausted so the future of mexican 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.130

 soil erosion coupled with enhanced 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.239

 swallowed up 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.940
 climate change has already led to 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.730
 raise sea level by more than one 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.320
 meter if the trend continues to

 losing rice fields what is 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.980
 powerful blow to the economy 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.720
 powerful sand dune attack on 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.240
 fertile land leads to 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.550
 the occurrence of a serious problem namely 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.790
 such a danger lurked Malevsky

 over the last century some streets

 this city became real channels

 scientists have no doubt that for

 prevent catastrophic 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.820
 the consequences of this problem need to be addressed 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.070
 as early as possible the worst is that the authorities 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.620
 Thailand seems to be not going at all 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.500
 do something now the city 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.260
 is in real danger at first 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.960
 the place got no city from a whole range 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.300

 millions of cities in the united states 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.830
 people at risk should 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:38.240
 think about changing places 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:41.750
 residence estimated scientists since 1889 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.030
 world ocean level rose by 20 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.670

 occur 45 times faster than 100 years 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.230
 back then there is a growing likelihood 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.890
 severe coastal destruction

 that flood damage during

 the next 15 years 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.920
 almost double the problem 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.890
 can touch dozens of major cities 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.270
 among them los angeles philadelphia

 many of the cities represented quickly 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.070
 will not disappear but here's san francisco and not 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.100
 the floor is worth being afraid because destructive 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.200
 earthquake and volcanic eruption can 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.409
 turn these cities into ruins behind
