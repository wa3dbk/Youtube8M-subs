00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
in from Nitro planes calm and I'm going

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.240 
in from Nitro planes calm and I'm going
to<00:00:39.690> be<00:00:39.780> doing<00:00:39.870> some<00:00:40.290> build<00:00:40.530> reviews<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.160> stuff

of<00:00:41.579> them<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.719> first<00:00:42.930> thing<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.440> got

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.650 

is<00:00:51.950> a<00:00:52.690> j-3<00:00:53.690> cub<00:00:54.200> and<00:00:54.940> this<00:00:55.940> particular<00:00:56.090> model

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
is a j-3 cub and this particular model

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.560 
is a j-3 cub and this particular model
is<00:00:56.810> this<00:00:57.710> black<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.580> yellow<00:00:58.760> version<00:00:59.210> rather

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
is this black and yellow version rather

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.210 
is this black and yellow version rather
than<00:00:59.690> from<00:00:59.810> the<00:00:59.930> standard<00:01:00.290> yellow<00:01:00.560> version<00:01:00.890> I

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
than from the standard yellow version I

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.130 
than from the standard yellow version I
thought<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:02.180> was<00:01:02.270> kind<00:01:02.480> of<00:01:02.540> sharp<00:01:02.780> looking

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
thought it was kind of sharp looking

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.670 
thought it was kind of sharp looking

excuse me and this is a kit form there's
no<00:01:31.130> electronics<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.790> this<00:01:31.940> so<00:01:32.060> we're<00:01:32.180> going<00:01:32.300> to

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
no electronics in this so we're going to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.469 
no electronics in this so we're going to
be<00:01:32.479> putting<00:01:32.690> our<00:01:32.900> own<00:01:33.080> electronics<00:01:33.680> in<00:01:33.830> it<00:01:33.920> and

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
third plane we've got

00:01:48.130 --> 00:02:00.319 
third plane we've got
I<00:01:55.229> am<00:01:56.229> c-47<00:01:57.159> again<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.119> is<00:01:58.299> a<00:01:58.530> RTF<00:01:59.530> plane<00:01:59.829> is

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
I am c-47 again this is a RTF plane is

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.240 
I am c-47 again this is a RTF plane is
radio<00:02:01.329> and<00:02:01.659> everything<00:02:02.049> all<00:02:02.500> ready<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.890> go<00:02:03.009> in

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
radio and everything all ready to go in

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.590 
radio and everything all ready to go in
it<00:02:03.340> just<00:02:03.549> got<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.880> assemble<00:02:04.179> it<00:02:04.299> we're<00:02:04.509> going

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
it just got to assemble it we're going

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.910 
it just got to assemble it we're going
to<00:02:04.689> be<00:02:04.810> doing<00:02:04.899> reviews<00:02:05.320> of<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:05.710> as<00:02:05.890> well

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920

to be doing reviews of that as well
going<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:06.970> be<00:02:07.119> building<00:02:07.689> it<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:07.990> see<00:02:08.800> how<00:02:08.830> that

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
going to be building it and see how that

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:19.860 
going to be building it and see how that
turns<00:02:09.160> out<00:02:13.410> in<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.920> last<00:02:15.069> plane<00:02:18.569> this<00:02:19.569> is<00:02:19.630> an

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
turns out in the last plane this is an

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.750 
turns out in the last plane this is an
airfield<00:02:21.180> p-51<00:02:22.180> Mustang<00:02:22.569> 57<00:02:23.319> inch<00:02:23.470> wingspan

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
airfield p-51 Mustang 57 inch wingspan

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.300 
airfield p-51 Mustang 57 inch wingspan
this<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.060> yellow<00:02:25.209> version<00:02:25.569> right<00:02:25.870> here

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
this is the yellow version right here
