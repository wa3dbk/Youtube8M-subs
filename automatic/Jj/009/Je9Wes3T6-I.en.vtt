00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
think in fact often times there are a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.140 
think in fact often times there are a
lot<00:01:18.540> there<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> lot<00:01:19.920> poorer<00:01:20.250> quality<00:01:20.490> in

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
lot there there a lot poorer quality in

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.060 
lot there there a lot poorer quality in
terms<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.689> image<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.259> well<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:22.830> information

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
terms of image as well as information

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.620 
terms of image as well as information
you<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.520> actually<00:01:23.610> clean<00:01:23.909> from<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.270> fact<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
you can actually clean from in fact the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.899 
you can actually clean from in fact the
only<00:01:24.750> way<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:24.990> really<00:01:25.140> use<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.009> outdoors

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
only way you really use it is outdoors

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.899 
only way you really use it is outdoors
in<00:01:27.150> sunlight<00:01:28.729> but<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.090> back<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.689> his<00:01:30.810> question

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
in sunlight but so back to his question

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.039 
in sunlight but so back to his question
camcorders<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.060> small<00:01:33.360> when<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.600> use<00:01:33.869> it

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
camcorders this small when you use it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.190 
camcorders this small when you use it
like<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.799> traditionally<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.689> actually

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
like this traditionally this is actually

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.450 
like this traditionally this is actually
not<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> most<00:01:37.470> stable<00:01:37.770> which<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.159> hold<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
not the most stable which can hold the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.969 
not the most stable which can hold the
camcorder<00:01:38.960> mainly<00:01:39.960> because<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.530> one

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
camcorder mainly because you have one

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.380 
camcorder mainly because you have one
arm<00:01:41.130> holding<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.820> you're<00:01:41.939> doing<00:01:42.090> this

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
arm holding it and you're doing this

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.880 
arm holding it and you're doing this
even<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.320> against<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.710> face

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
even if you have it against your face

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.830 
even if you have it against your face
you're<00:01:44.460> still<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.850> introduce<00:01:45.090> motion

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
you're still going to introduce motion

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.170 
you're still going to introduce motion
into<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.259> camera<00:01:46.740> through<00:01:46.950> your<00:01:47.130> wrist<00:01:47.399> now

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
into the camera through your wrist now

the head is a fully floating head so if

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.460 
the head is a fully floating head so if
I<00:03:27.670> need<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:28.090> can<00:03:28.299> be<00:03:28.510> couplet<00:03:29.019> right<00:03:29.200> here

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
I need to I can be couplet right here

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.680 
I need to I can be couplet right here
and<00:03:29.799> that's<00:03:29.920> kind<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.310> bowl<00:03:30.609> shape<00:03:30.639> and<00:03:31.630> I

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
and that's kind of a bowl shape and I

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.900 
and that's kind of a bowl shape and I
would<00:03:31.840> be<00:03:31.930> able<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.260> kind<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.670> swing<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.819> around

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
would be able to kind of swing it around

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.650 
would be able to kind of swing it around
depending<00:03:34.660> on<00:03:34.980> what<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.010> need<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.280> shoot<00:03:36.849> now

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
depending on what I need to shoot now

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.360 
depending on what I need to shoot now
the<00:03:37.720> other<00:03:37.959> important<00:03:38.470> thing<00:03:38.620> about<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:39.130> is

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
the other important thing about this is

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.680 
the other important thing about this is
that<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.730> have<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:41.819> relatively<00:03:42.819> fluid<00:03:43.120> motion

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
that I have a relatively fluid motion

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.300 
that I have a relatively fluid motion
when<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:43.900> comes<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.290> swing<00:03:44.500> it's<00:03:44.709> not<00:03:44.889> Jackie

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
when it comes to swing it's not Jackie

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.160 
when it comes to swing it's not Jackie
now<00:03:46.060> if<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.299> get<00:03:46.450> some<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.810> cheaper

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
now if you get some of the cheaper

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.960 
now if you get some of the cheaper
tripods<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.160> people<00:03:48.459> use<00:03:48.609> for<00:03:48.760> still

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
tripods that people use for still

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.390 
tripods that people use for still
cameras<00:03:49.359> as<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:49.870> rotate<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.680> as<00:03:50.859> you<00:03:51.040> as<00:03:51.280> you

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
cameras as you rotate it as you as you

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.099 
cameras as you rotate it as you as you
bind<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:51.760> plastic<00:03:52.269> it<00:03:52.389> starts<00:03:52.660> doing<00:03:52.989> this

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
bind the plastic it starts doing this

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.170 
bind the plastic it starts doing this
it's<00:03:53.530> not<00:03:53.650> what<00:03:53.889> you<00:03:54.040> want<00:03:54.220> what<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:54.760> want<00:03:54.880> is

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
it's not what you want what you want is

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.509 
it's not what you want what you want is

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
a tripod that's stable at the same time

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.729 
a tripod that's stable at the same time
you<00:03:57.669> can<00:03:57.819> still<00:03:58.000> move<00:03:58.530> depending<00:03:59.530> on<00:03:59.620> your

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
you can still move depending on your

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.509 
you can still move depending on your
situation

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
situation

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.699 
situation
now<00:04:00.970> if<00:04:01.329> you're<00:04:01.510> in<00:04:01.599> a<00:04:01.660> situation<00:04:02.169> where<00:04:02.380> say

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
to place you'd want to get a monopod you

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.949 
to place you'd want to get a monopod you
know<00:04:12.579> I've<00:04:12.669> actually<00:04:12.790> seen<00:04:13.120> those<00:04:13.329> being<00:04:13.750> used

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
know I've actually seen those being used

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.070 
know I've actually seen those being used
frequently<00:04:14.560> at

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
frequently at

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.020 
frequently at
for<00:04:15.140> instance<00:04:15.470> where<00:04:15.860> people<00:04:16.250> are<00:04:16.430> sitting

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
for instance where people are sitting

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.699 
for instance where people are sitting
and<00:04:17.180> watching<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.570> presentation<00:04:17.720> of<00:04:18.260> some<00:04:18.440> kind

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
and watching a presentation of some kind

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.229 
and watching a presentation of some kind
they<00:04:18.830> just<00:04:19.010> put<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.280> on<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.459> monopod<00:04:19.910> and

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
they just put it on the monopod and

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.729 
they just put it on the monopod and
they're<00:04:20.600> holding<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.019> so<00:04:21.230> there's<00:04:21.440> not<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:21.560> lot

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
they're holding it so there's not a lot

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.200 
they're holding it so there's not a lot
of<00:04:21.830> range<00:04:21.980> up<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.310> down<00:04:22.400> because<00:04:22.730> the<00:04:22.880> person

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
of range up and down because the person

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.150 
of range up and down because the person
is<00:04:23.300> basically<00:04:23.600> on<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.900> same<00:04:24.140> yep<00:04:24.620> playing<00:04:25.010> the

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
is basically on the same yep playing the

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.000 
is basically on the same yep playing the
whole<00:04:25.310> time<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.780> essentially<00:04:27.290> it's<00:04:27.590> it's<00:04:27.890> the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
whole time and essentially it's it's the

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.890 
whole time and essentially it's it's the
same<00:04:28.190> thing<00:04:28.460> because<00:04:28.640> what<00:04:29.360> I've<00:04:29.450> done<00:04:29.660> is

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
same thing because what I've done is

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.470 
same thing because what I've done is
I've<00:04:30.220> basically<00:04:31.220> took<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.580> take<00:04:31.940> taking<00:04:32.390> the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
I've basically took the take taking the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.510 
I've basically took the take taking the
weight<00:04:32.630> off<00:04:32.840> my<00:04:33.080> arm<00:04:33.230> and<00:04:33.380> putting<00:04:33.650> on<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.340> on

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
weight off my arm and putting on the on

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.210 
weight off my arm and putting on the on
the<00:04:34.670> monopod<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.390> this<00:04:35.840> allows<00:04:36.140> me<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.440> kind

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
the monopod and this allows me to kind

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.250 
the monopod and this allows me to kind
of<00:04:37.310> tighten<00:04:37.670> up<00:04:37.880> on<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.120> shot<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:39.020> I'm<00:04:39.140> gonna

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
of tighten up on a shot and so I'm gonna

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.600 
of tighten up on a shot and so I'm gonna
hold<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.590> from<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.860> top<00:04:40.040> instead<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.430> holding

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
hold it from the top instead of holding

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.890 
hold it from the top instead of holding
it<00:04:40.730> down<00:04:40.910> here<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.180> want<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.450> hold<00:04:41.540> it<00:04:41.690> toward

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
it down here you want to hold it toward

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.840 
it down here you want to hold it toward
the<00:04:41.990> top<00:04:42.170> where<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.500> camera<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:43.010> so<00:04:43.580> you<00:04:43.700> get

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
the top where the camera is so you get

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.700 
the top where the camera is so you get
the<00:04:43.970> most<00:04:44.150> leverage<00:04:44.660> as<00:04:45.110> well<00:04:45.290> as<00:04:45.500> most

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
the most leverage as well as most

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.040 
the most leverage as well as most
stability<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.430> when<00:04:47.210> you're<00:04:47.330> ready<00:04:47.720> to<00:04:47.900> move

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
stability and when you're ready to move

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.840 
stability and when you're ready to move
you<00:04:48.350> can<00:04:48.470> you<00:04:48.740> know<00:04:48.830> keep<00:04:49.040> recording<00:04:49.490> just<00:04:49.580> up

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
you can you know keep recording just up

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.910 
you can you know keep recording just up
and<00:04:50.180> move<00:04:50.330> it<00:04:50.480> where<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:50.810> need<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.200> now<00:04:51.740> it's

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
and move it where you need to now it's

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.710 
and move it where you need to now it's
really<00:04:52.070> important<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:53.030> understand<00:04:53.570> what

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
really important to understand what

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.030 
really important to understand what
you're<00:04:53.870> shooting<00:04:54.080> before<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:54.620> do<00:04:54.770> any<00:04:54.950> of

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
you're shooting before you do any of
