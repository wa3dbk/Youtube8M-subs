in case he has a Garrity's counter which
I<00:00:43.379> kind<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> figured<00:00:43.739> he<00:00:43.920> does<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.399> happens

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
I kind of figured he does and it happens

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.380 
I kind of figured he does and it happens
to<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.850> Celebi<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.510> that's<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.809> yeah<00:00:46.440> block

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
so go for talk because I predict him to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.420

with<00:03:46.090> some<00:03:46.239> damage<00:03:46.629> and<00:03:47.019> I<00:03:47.650> get<00:03:47.769> paralyzed

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
with some damage and I get paralyzed

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.580 
with some damage and I get paralyzed
that's<00:03:49.329> good<00:03:49.599> and<00:03:49.780> bad<00:03:49.959> because<00:03:50.319> he<00:03:50.349> didn't

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
that's good and bad because he didn't

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.780 
that's good and bad because he didn't
get<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.769> see<00:03:50.860> what<00:03:50.980> movie<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.280> was<00:03:51.370> trying<00:03:51.730> to

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
get to see what movie I was trying to

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.970 
get to see what movie I was trying to
use<00:03:52.030> I<00:03:52.209> went<00:03:52.450> for<00:03:52.599> will-o'-wisp<00:03:53.079> just<00:03:53.769> because

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
use I went for will-o'-wisp just because

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.350 
use I went for will-o'-wisp just because
I<00:03:54.040> didn't<00:03:54.310> want<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.489> go<00:03:54.579> for<00:03:54.730> Shadow<00:03:54.910> Ball<00:03:55.090> I

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
I didn't want to go for Shadow Ball I

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.729 
I didn't want to go for Shadow Ball I
knew<00:03:55.599> that<00:03:55.959> since<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.230> didn't<00:03:56.440> have<00:03:56.530> stealth

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
knew that since I didn't have stealth

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.100 
knew that since I didn't have stealth
rocks<00:03:56.950> up<00:03:57.099> yet<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.060> he<00:03:58.269> respects<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:58.930> just

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
rocks up yet and he respects I just

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.020 
rocks up yet and he respects I just
wanted<00:03:59.349> the<00:03:59.470> residual<00:03:59.890> damage<00:04:00.069> on<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.489> worked

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
wanted the residual damage on it worked

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.339 
wanted the residual damage on it worked
out<00:04:01.150> perfectly<00:04:01.599> because<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:01.870> predicted<00:04:02.260> a

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
out perfectly because I predicted a

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.670 
out perfectly because I predicted a
switch<00:04:02.590> there<00:04:02.890> too<00:04:03.220> after<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.269> minus<00:04:04.600> 2<00:04:04.900> goes

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
switch there too after the minus 2 goes

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.500 
switch there too after the minus 2 goes
into<00:04:05.709> that<00:04:06.040> rhyperior<00:04:06.549> tries<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.209> go<00:04:07.299> for<00:04:07.480> the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
into that rhyperior tries to go for the

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.870 
into that rhyperior tries to go for the
crit<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.989> assume<00:04:08.380> with<00:04:08.590> stone<00:04:08.799> edge<00:04:09.040> since

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
crit I assume with stone edge since

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.129 
crit I assume with stone edge since
earthquake<00:04:10.329> has<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.510> same<00:04:10.690> power<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.079> it

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
earthquake has the same power and it

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.500 
earthquake has the same power and it
probably<00:04:11.290> wouldn't<00:04:11.530> miss<00:04:11.850> but<00:04:12.850> even<00:04:13.389> after

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
probably wouldn't miss but even after

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.059 
probably wouldn't miss but even after
life<00:04:13.810> or<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.290> burden<00:04:14.590> is<00:04:14.680> just<00:04:14.859> going<00:04:14.980> to

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
life or the burden is just going to

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.089 
life or the burden is just going to
totally<00:04:15.340> destroy<00:04:15.910> his<00:04:16.660> attack<00:04:17.049> and<00:04:17.859> that<00:04:17.919> does

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
totally destroy his attack and that does

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.610 
totally destroy his attack and that does
nothing<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:19.750> I'm<00:04:19.810> switching<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:20.380> King

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
nothing so I'm switching to the King

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.770 
nothing so I'm switching to the King
predicting<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.370> teeway<00:04:22.150> but<00:04:22.450> he<00:04:22.510> goes<00:04:22.630> for<00:04:22.720> the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
predicting a teeway but he goes for the

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.520 
predicting a teeway but he goes for the
knockoff<00:04:24.000> yeah<00:04:25.000> that's<00:04:25.539> annoying<00:04:25.960> i<00:04:26.229> get<00:04:26.440> up

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
knockoff yeah that's annoying i get up

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.770 
knockoff yeah that's annoying i get up
my<00:04:26.650> stealth<00:04:26.889> rocks<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.360> switching<00:04:28.720> a

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
my stealth rocks and I switching a

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.060 
my stealth rocks and I switching a
combustion<00:04:29.110> because<00:04:29.590> now<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:29.830> he's

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
combustion because now that he's

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.800 
combustion because now that he's
paralyzed<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.669> don't<00:04:30.970> want<00:04:31.120> something<00:04:31.450> setting
