00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:12.610
 Bg Gaming has been conceived with the idea of ​​reaching those who dedicate part of their time 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.279
 free to the world of gaming. Headphones, mice, keyboards or mats are some of the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.949
 products with which it has in its catalog. Stands out in all its range of equipment the bet 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.099
 for a marked gaming design but without shrillness. Of recent form they have put on sale 2 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:39.280
 Headsets that today we bring you to our channel, it's about the Xonar and the Xonar X3. 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.620
 Aesthetically we find two practically identical headsets where it only changes 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.360
 the type of connectivity. With 40 millimeters in diameter and a circumaural design they promise 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.670
 extreme isolation from external noise, although it must be said that once tested, 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.989
 the insulation is adequate but not extreme. Something that does influence the comfort of 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.230
 This type of device is weight and ergonomics and it must be said that in this sense we are 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.060
 with some correct equipment. They are really light and both the ear pads 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.689
 as the superiors convey an adequate sense of quality, all in accordance with 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.329
 the price of both teams. 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.500
 Speaking more specifically about each of the models separately, The Xonar X-3 are multiplatform 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.719
 so we can use them on Windows, Mac, Xbox 360 or PS3, something that many users value 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.929
 positively when playing in different systems. Among its benefits we are 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.320
 with volume control and microphone on the cable with control for this, microphone and 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.869
 gaming mode, a microphone that we can raise and lower although we can not dismantle, connectors 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.039
 RCA and USB and a large cable length of 3.8 meters. 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.200
 The Xonar X3 have an impedance of 32 ohms, sensitivity of 110 decibels 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:03.530
 or a response frequency of 20Hz-20,000 Hz. This part will be recorded with the microphone 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.959
 of the X3 and is that we find for this with a diameter of 6.5 millimeters, a frequency 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.850
 response of 100- 10 kilohertz and a sensitivity of 58 millimeters. Highlight some 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.190
 aspects such as having so many connectors and the length of their cable, which 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.390
 It can mean a certain disorder at the time of its installation and, in addition, we have thrown in 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.000
 There is a lack of more sound power. Even so, we have a benefit headset 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.190
 chords at your price. 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.010
 On the other hand we have the Xonar model which we can use with our operating system 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.260
 Windows, as in tablets, smartphones and PS4, the latter section that should also 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.760
 have contemplated the Xonar-X3. Like the model discussed above, also 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.650
 It incorporates volume control and microphone in the cable, this time without gaming mode. The 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.850
 microphone, with which we recorded this part of the video, is collapsible and, like the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.950
 X3, it is not removable either. This has a response frequency of 100 - 10 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.470
 kilohertz together with a sensitivity of 58 decibels. 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.630
 Its speakers offer a response frequency of between 20 and 20,000 kilohertz along with 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.330
 an impedance of 32 ohms and a sensitivity of 110 decibels. In this model they change 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.770
 some aspects and is that its connectivity is limited only to 1 minijack connector 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.350
 3.5 mm, a cable length of 2.8 meters and a weight of about 280 grams, 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:43.900
 being somewhat lighter than the X3, which reached 340. 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.850
 The Spanish brand B move continues to evolve and is committed to the creation of peripherals 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.380
 oriented to gamers. In addition, it brings all kinds of peripherals closer to all audiences, 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.569
 since not everyone can afford headsets that exceed 70 € in price, offering 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:05.980
 2 headphones that have a sound quality and microphone according to their price. 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.220
 If you would like us to do a more in-depth analysis of one of the two models, 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.080
 Do not hesitate to tell us and we will do so. Remember that they are already available on the web 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.319
 of Pccomponentes, we leave you two links in the description.
