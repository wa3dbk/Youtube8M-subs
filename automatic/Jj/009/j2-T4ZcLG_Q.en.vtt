and<00:03:29.840> stuff<00:03:30.230> like<00:03:30.379> that<00:03:30.439> for<00:03:30.829> so<00:03:31.099> long<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.430> I

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
and stuff like that for so long that I

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.849 
and stuff like that for so long that I
think<00:03:32.060> I<00:03:32.180> might<00:03:32.360> want<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.629> start<00:03:32.930> doing

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
think I might want to start doing

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.250 
think I might want to start doing
something<00:03:34.219> different<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:34.849> know<00:03:35.140> because<00:03:36.140> I

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
something different you know because I

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.800 
something different you know because I
can<00:03:36.469> do<00:03:36.680> different<00:03:37.219> sorts<00:03:37.819> of<00:03:37.939> builds<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.750> I

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
can do different sorts of builds and I

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.830 
can do different sorts of builds and I
can<00:03:39.079> kind<00:03:39.319> of<00:03:39.379> mix<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:40.010> up<00:03:40.159> but<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.239> think<00:03:41.599> it's

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
can kind of mix it up but I think it's

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.610 
can kind of mix it up but I think it's
about<00:03:42.170> time<00:03:42.680> for<00:03:43.099> me<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:44.450> bring<00:03:45.319> something

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620
