aging iPad 2 from last year you won't
really<00:00:17.609> notice<00:00:17.850> much<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.240> difference<00:00:18.270> on

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
really notice much of a difference on

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.090 
really notice much of a difference on
camera<00:00:19.080> I'm<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.650> gonna<00:00:19.800> tell<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:19.980> that

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
camera I'm just gonna tell you that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.050 
camera I'm just gonna tell you that
right<00:00:20.189> now

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
right now

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.830 
right now
I<00:00:21.119> don't<00:00:21.810> even<00:00:21.900> think<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.350> notice<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
I don't even think you can notice the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.839 
I don't even think you can notice the
icons<00:00:24.840> I'm<00:00:25.650> sure<00:00:25.890> they<00:00:26.130> look<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.580> much

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
icons I'm sure they look that much

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.820 
icons I'm sure they look that much
better<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:28.670> basically<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.840> new<00:00:30.990> iPad<00:00:31.439> has<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
better but basically the new iPad has a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.729 
better but basically the new iPad has a
much<00:00:32.489> massively<00:00:33.210> improved<00:00:33.630> screen<00:00:33.989> over<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
much massively improved screen over the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.819 
much massively improved screen over the
iPad<00:00:35.100> 2<00:00:35.600> it's<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.780> much<00:00:37.020> higher<00:00:37.200> resolution

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
iPad 2 it's a much higher resolution

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.459 
iPad 2 it's a much higher resolution
than<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.670> iPad<00:00:38.940> 2<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.690> actually<00:00:39.899> has<00:00:40.140> four

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
than the iPad 2 it actually has four

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.470 
than the iPad 2 it actually has four
times<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.920> amount<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.129> pixels<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.850> old

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
times the amount of pixels that the old

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.760 
times the amount of pixels that the old
iPad<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.079> serve<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.780> does<00:00:46.020> look<00:00:46.410> really

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
iPad you serve so it does look really

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.560 
iPad you serve so it does look really
brilliant<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.489> lot<00:00:47.640> more<00:00:47.789> vibrant<00:00:48.000> for

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
brilliant it's a lot more vibrant for

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.430 
brilliant it's a lot more vibrant for
example<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:49.079> I'm<00:00:49.170> looking<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
example what I'm looking to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.939 
example what I'm looking to
oversaturated<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:51.620> don't<00:00:52.620> think<00:00:52.739> he<00:00:52.800> actually

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
oversaturated I don't think he actually

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.520 
oversaturated I don't think he actually
notices<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.640> camera<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.390> yeah<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.379> is

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
notices on the camera but yeah it is

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.580 
notices on the camera but yeah it is
really<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.399> nice

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
really really nice

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.450 
really really nice

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
so I'm just going to put this away for

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
lot of iPad reviews out there so I'm

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.280 
lot of iPad reviews out there so I'm
just<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.549> try<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.850> focus<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.360> what's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
just going to try and focus on what's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.130 
just going to try and focus on what's
new<00:01:13.939> versus<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> iPad<00:01:15.390> 2<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.810> first<00:01:15.960> thing

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
new versus the iPad 2 the first thing

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.390 
new versus the iPad 2 the first thing
that's<00:01:16.290> new<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.650> course<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> Retina

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
that's new is of course the Retina

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.690 
that's new is of course the Retina
display<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.689> looks<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.229> nice<00:01:19.439> there's<00:01:19.979> 3.1

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
display it looks really nice there's 3.1

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.080 
display it looks really nice there's 3.1
million<00:01:21.210> pixels<00:01:22.220> for<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> resolution<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.790> I

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
million pixels for a resolution of I

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.319 
million pixels for a resolution of I
think<00:01:26.390> 264<00:01:27.390> pixels<00:01:28.229> per<00:01:28.950> inch<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.880> is

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
think 264 pixels per inch which is

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.270 
think 264 pixels per inch which is
really<00:01:30.689> good<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.680> densely<00:01:32.100> packed

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
really good it's not as densely packed

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
really good it's not as densely packed
as<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> iPhone<00:01:33.000> 4s<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> airport<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.259> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
as the iPhone 4s and the airport but it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.670 
as the iPhone 4s and the airport but it
is<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.220> best<00:01:35.369> you'll<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> tablet<00:01:36.680> when

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
is the best you'll see on a tablet when

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.289 
is the best you'll see on a tablet when
you<00:01:37.770> first<00:01:38.009> see<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.310> versus<00:01:38.909> an<00:01:39.030> iPad<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you first see it versus an iPad you

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.730 
you first see it versus an iPad you
might<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:39.689> notice<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.409> look<00:01:40.560> at

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
might not notice but when you look at

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.469 
might not notice but when you look at
the<00:01:40.890> icons<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.460> look<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.700> text<00:01:42.270> for

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the icons and you look at text for

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.030 
the icons and you look at text for
example<00:01:42.570> you'll<00:01:43.380> see<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> text<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
example you'll see that the text is a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.069 
example you'll see that the text is a
lot<00:01:44.250> more<00:01:44.399> sharper<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.720> around<00:01:45.960> it's

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
lot more sharper all around it's

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.109 
lot more sharper all around it's
actually<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.439> sharper<00:01:46.770> than<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> Kindle<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
actually more sharper than the Kindle of

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
actually more sharper than the Kindle of
course<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.509> not<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.750> great<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.829> bright

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
course it's not as great in bright

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.850 
course it's not as great in bright
sunlight<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.090> Kindle<00:01:51.780> ware<00:01:52.259> which<00:01:52.439> uses<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
sunlight as the Kindle ware which uses a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.950 
sunlight as the Kindle ware which uses a
ink<00:01:53.180> but<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> screen<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.810> nice

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
ink but the screen is really nice

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.350 
ink but the screen is really nice
there's<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.290> backward<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.729> still<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> backward

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
there's a backward it's still a backward

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.539 
there's a backward it's still a backward
screen<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.560> doesn't<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.189> well<00:01:59.399> in

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
screen so it doesn't do that well in

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.789 
screen so it doesn't do that well in
sunlight<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.030> otherwise<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.350> think<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.680> is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
sunlight but otherwise I think this is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.980 
sunlight but otherwise I think this is
the<00:02:01.920> best<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.250> get<00:02:02.509> there's<00:02:03.509> really<00:02:03.780> good

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the best you get there's really good

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.410 
the best you get there's really good
color<00:02:04.409> saturation<00:02:05.000> apple<00:02:06.000> says<00:02:06.180> there's<00:02:06.390> been

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
color saturation apple says there's been

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.040 
color saturation apple says there's been
a<00:02:07.160> 44%<00:02:08.160> increase<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.940> think<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.869> color

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
a 44% increase I think and the color

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.440 
a 44% increase I think and the color
saturation<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.830> is

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
saturation so it is

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.559 
saturation so it is
without<00:02:11.870> being<00:02:12.080> too<00:02:12.170> oversaturated<00:02:13.129> at<00:02:13.190> all

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
without being too oversaturated at all

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.759 
without being too oversaturated at all
you<00:02:14.569> get<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.720> lot<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.989> pixels<00:02:15.260> basically

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
you get a lot of pixels basically

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.619 
you get a lot of pixels basically
crammed<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.310> pretty<00:02:16.819> flawless<00:02:17.180> screen

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
crammed to a pretty flawless screen

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.660 
crammed to a pretty flawless screen
right<00:02:18.440> there<00:02:18.470> there's<00:02:19.010> no<00:02:19.160> image<00:02:19.519> noise

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
right there there's no image noise

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.220 
right there there's no image noise
there's<00:02:20.030> no<00:02:20.120> crosstalk<00:02:20.540> there's<00:02:20.870> no<00:02:21.019> visual

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
there's no crosstalk there's no visual

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.479 
there's no crosstalk there's no visual
artifacts<00:02:21.680> anyway<00:02:21.860> there's<00:02:22.010> no<00:02:22.069> ghosting

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
artifacts anyway there's no ghosting

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.600 
artifacts anyway there's no ghosting
everything<00:02:22.879> moves<00:02:23.060> really<00:02:23.239> fast<00:02:24.610> so

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
everything moves really fast so

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.940 
everything moves really fast so
definitely<00:02:26.120> something<00:02:26.480> that's<00:02:26.800> really<00:02:27.800> good

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
definitely something that's really good

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.380 
definitely something that's really good
I<00:02:27.980> don't<00:02:28.069> think<00:02:28.280> any<00:02:28.550> driver<00:02:28.880> manufacturers

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
I don't think any driver manufacturers

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.479 
I don't think any driver manufacturers
will<00:02:29.569> catch<00:02:29.690> up<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.170> screen<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:31.010> that

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
will catch up to the screen it is that

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.830 
will catch up to the screen it is that
good<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.819> main<00:02:31.940> reason<00:02:32.269> I<00:02:32.330> think<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.660> should

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
good the main reason I think you should

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.930 
good the main reason I think you should
stick<00:02:32.989> with<00:02:33.019> your<00:02:33.260> iPad<00:02:33.560> 2<00:02:33.769> was<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.370> new<00:02:34.519> iPad

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
stick with your iPad 2 was the new iPad

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.350 
stick with your iPad 2 was the new iPad
is<00:02:35.300> because<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.500> size<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.220> apps<00:02:37.370> each

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
is because of the size of the apps each

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.740 
is because of the size of the apps each
app<00:02:39.110> now<00:02:39.590> uses<00:02:40.099> all<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.000> apps<00:02:41.120> are<00:02:41.269> updated<00:02:41.330> to

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
app now uses all the apps are updated to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.449 
app now uses all the apps are updated to
use<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.930> built-in<00:02:42.440> display<00:02:42.650> now<00:02:42.920> uses<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.280> high

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
use a built-in display now uses a high

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.370 
use a built-in display now uses a high
resolution<00:02:43.640> image<00:02:43.970> which<00:02:44.569> means<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:45.019> every

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
resolution image which means that every

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.089 
resolution image which means that every
app<00:02:45.500> weighs<00:02:46.099> in<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.370> lot<00:02:46.730> more<00:02:46.940> than<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.590> iPad<00:02:48.920> 2

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
app weighs in a lot more than the iPad 2

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.339 
app weighs in a lot more than the iPad 2
for<00:02:49.280> example<00:02:49.370> an<00:02:49.910> applet<00:02:50.390> weighs<00:02:50.569> like<00:02:50.780> 20<00:02:51.110> MB

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
for example an applet weighs like 20 MB

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.100 
for example an applet weighs like 20 MB
and<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.530> iPad<00:02:51.860> 2<00:02:52.130> might<00:02:52.940> weigh<00:02:53.239> in<00:02:53.299> maybe<00:02:53.989> a

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
and the iPad 2 might weigh in maybe a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.580 
and the iPad 2 might weigh in maybe a
hundred<00:02:54.319> 20<00:02:54.739> MB<00:02:54.950> on<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:56.180> new<00:02:56.900> iPad<00:02:57.079> depending

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
hundred 20 MB on the new iPad depending

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.470 
hundred 20 MB on the new iPad depending
on<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.829> size<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.940> high<00:02:59.060> resolution

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
on the size of the high resolution

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.960 
on the size of the high resolution
images<00:02:59.780> used<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.280> don't<00:03:01.519> know<00:03:01.579> I<00:03:01.819> would

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
images used so I don't know I would

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.270 
images used so I don't know I would
highly<00:03:02.299> recommend<00:03:02.329> not<00:03:02.780> picking<00:03:03.140> up<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.680> 16gb

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
highly recommend not picking up the 16gb

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.559 
highly recommend not picking up the 16gb
version<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.760> new<00:03:04.880> iPad<00:03:05.150> if<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:05.390> are

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
version of the new iPad if you are

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.479 
version of the new iPad if you are
buying<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.500> new<00:03:06.620> iPad<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.099> would<00:03:07.190> definitely

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
buying the new iPad I would definitely

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.910 
buying the new iPad I would definitely
say<00:03:07.670> get<00:03:07.880> at<00:03:08.540> least<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:08.989> 2<00:03:09.170> GB<00:03:09.349> if<00:03:09.680> not<00:03:09.829> the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
say get at least to a 2 GB if not the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.819 
say get at least to a 2 GB if not the
64gb<00:03:10.340> but<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:10.970> is<00:03:11.090> limiting<00:03:11.540> it's<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.590> bit<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.799> a

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
64gb but it is limiting it's a bit of a

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.520 
64gb but it is limiting it's a bit of a
problem<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.750> that's<00:03:14.870> something<00:03:15.110> that<00:03:15.230> should

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
problem so that's something that should

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.270 
problem so that's something that should
note<00:03:15.680> but<00:03:15.920> even<00:03:16.489> if<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.850> apps<00:03:17.239> are<00:03:17.510> not

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
note but even if the apps are not

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.729 
note but even if the apps are not
updated<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.430> leave<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.359> use<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.319> new<00:03:21.440> iPad

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
updated to leave the use of the new iPad

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.039 
updated to leave the use of the new iPad
everything<00:03:22.690> everything's<00:03:23.690> very<00:03:23.810> nicely

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
everything everything's very nicely

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.590 
everything everything's very nicely
upscale<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:25.430> never<00:03:25.730> actually<00:03:26.060> have<00:03:26.569> a

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
upscale so you never actually have a

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.599 
upscale so you never actually have a
problem<00:03:26.870> where<00:03:27.680> anything<00:03:27.920> looks<00:03:28.100> fuzzy<00:03:28.340> for

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
problem where anything looks fuzzy for

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.970 
problem where anything looks fuzzy for
example<00:03:29.980> yeah<00:03:30.980> very<00:03:31.670> good<00:03:31.730> stuff<00:03:32.769> moving<00:03:33.769> on

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
example yeah very good stuff moving on

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.620 
example yeah very good stuff moving on
the<00:03:34.190> camera<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.790> camera<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.209> really<00:03:35.359> nice

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
the camera the camera is really nice

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.809 
the camera the camera is really nice
it's<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.950> can't<00:03:37.130> actually<00:03:37.250> show<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:37.579> right<00:03:37.760> now

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
it's I can't actually show you right now

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.289 
it's I can't actually show you right now
but<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.900> camera<00:03:39.200> is<00:03:39.319> massively<00:03:39.829> improved

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
but the camera is massively improved

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.319 
but the camera is massively improved
versus<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:42.040> iPad<00:03:43.040> 2<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.459> iPad<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.150> had<00:03:44.299> a

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
versus the iPad 2 the iPad you had a

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.640 
versus the iPad 2 the iPad you had a
camera<00:03:44.569> that<00:03:44.780> was<00:03:44.930> less<00:03:45.109> than<00:03:45.260> one<00:03:45.410> megapixel

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
camera that was less than one megapixel

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.920 
camera that was less than one megapixel
here<00:03:46.519> we<00:03:46.700> have<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.880> proper<00:03:47.269> 5<00:03:47.450> megapixel<00:03:47.900> camera

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
here we have a proper 5 megapixel camera

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.620 
here we have a proper 5 megapixel camera
that's<00:03:48.319> being<00:03:48.470> used<00:03:48.739> with<00:03:49.609> aperture<00:03:49.940> of<00:03:50.150> 2.4

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
that's being used with aperture of 2.4

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.680 
that's being used with aperture of 2.4
and<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.799> has<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:51.980> new<00:03:52.220> backpack<00:03:52.690> side

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
and it has a new backpack side

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.199 
and it has a new backpack side
illuminated<00:03:54.319> sensor<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:55.280> pictures<00:03:55.940> come<00:03:56.180> out

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
illuminated sensor so pictures come out

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.210 
illuminated sensor so pictures come out
really<00:03:56.569> nice<00:03:56.780> I'm<00:03:57.500> not<00:03:57.620> a<00:03:57.680> fan<00:03:57.920> of<00:03:58.099> taking

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
really nice I'm not a fan of taking

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.729 
really nice I'm not a fan of taking
pictures<00:03:58.579> on<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:59.720> iPad<00:04:00.079> but<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.349> do<00:04:00.530> get<00:04:00.680> some

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
pictures on the iPad but you do get some

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.430 
pictures on the iPad but you do get some
very<00:04:01.069> nice<00:04:01.310> results<00:04:01.880> on<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.079> iPad<00:04:03.410> for

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
very nice results on the iPad for

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.530 
very nice results on the iPad for
example<00:04:03.680> this<00:04:04.639> was<00:04:04.790> taken<00:04:05.030> on<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.150> iPad

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
example this was taken on the iPad

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.159 
example this was taken on the iPad
yesterday<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.769> does<00:04:07.099> look<00:04:07.370> pretty<00:04:07.609> good

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
yesterday and it does look pretty good

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.140 
yesterday and it does look pretty good
so<00:04:09.169> that<00:04:09.709> is<00:04:09.829> worth<00:04:10.099> noting<00:04:10.280> that<00:04:10.459> it's

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
so that is worth noting that it's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.819 
so that is worth noting that it's
definitely<00:04:11.750> something<00:04:12.079> I<00:04:12.169> really<00:04:12.440> like<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.769> do

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
definitely something I really like I do

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.180 
definitely something I really like I do
like<00:04:13.190> good<00:04:13.639> cameras<00:04:14.030> as<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.269> guys<00:04:14.870> know<00:04:15.190> one

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
more thing that I really liked was the

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.190 
more thing that I really liked was the

there but you get what I mean by this

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.870

make a lot of use of this app or not so
as<00:05:03.260> you<00:05:03.410> see<00:05:03.620> as<00:05:04.010> you<00:05:04.100> can<00:05:04.220> see<00:05:04.340> you<00:05:04.640> do<00:05:04.760> get<00:05:04.880> a

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
as you see as you can see you do get a

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.090 
as you see as you can see you do get a
lot<00:05:05.090> of<00:05:05.180> problems<00:05:05.510> a<00:05:05.780> lot<00:05:06.170> of<00:05:06.260> misspells<00:05:06.680> a<00:05:06.920> lot

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
lot of problems a lot of misspells a lot

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.390 
lot of problems a lot of misspells a lot
of<00:05:07.160> wrong<00:05:07.520> words<00:05:07.960> so<00:05:08.980> it's<00:05:09.980> not<00:05:10.070> very<00:05:10.310> reliable

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
of wrong words so it's not very reliable

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.430 
of wrong words so it's not very reliable
but<00:05:10.850> it<00:05:10.940> is<00:05:11.060> reliable<00:05:11.300> enough<00:05:11.660> to<00:05:11.720> use<00:05:12.050> as<00:05:12.380> a

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
but it is reliable enough to use as a

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.590 
but it is reliable enough to use as a
dictation<00:05:13.400> app<00:05:14.500> what<00:05:15.500> else<00:05:15.680> that<00:05:16.010> I<00:05:16.040> think

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
dictation app what else that I think

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.900 
dictation app what else that I think
lastly<00:05:17.600> it's<00:05:17.900> it's<00:05:18.230> this<00:05:18.530> is<00:05:18.650> a<00:05:18.680> Wi-Fi<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:19.760> 4G

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
lastly it's it's this is a Wi-Fi and 4G

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.980 
lastly it's it's this is a Wi-Fi and 4G
64gb<00:05:22.910> iPad<00:05:23.660> I<00:05:25.150> couldn't<00:05:26.150> use<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.330> 4G<00:05:26.750> because

64gb iPad I couldn't use the 4G because

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.340 
64gb iPad I couldn't use the 4G because
the<00:05:27.080> 4G<00:05:27.350> is<00:05:27.620> only<00:05:27.830> meant<00:05:28.130> to<00:05:28.190> be<00:05:28.250> used<00:05:28.430> in

the 4G is only meant to be used in

the 4G is only meant to be used in

again here in the UK and in Australia
the<00:05:35.060> iPad<00:05:35.480> cannot<00:05:35.960> support<00:05:36.230> it<00:05:36.320> it's<00:05:36.500> only

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
the iPad cannot support it it's only

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.680 
the iPad cannot support it it's only
meant<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:36.890> support<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.760> bands<00:05:37.940> of<00:05:38.120> the<00:05:38.240> US<00:05:38.480> I

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
meant to support the bands of the US I

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.820 
meant to support the bands of the US I
guess<00:05:39.260> it<00:05:40.040> does<00:05:40.220> use<00:05:40.570> it<00:05:41.570> has<00:05:41.690> happily<00:05:42.440> use<00:05:42.680> the

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
guess it does use it has happily use the

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.610 
guess it does use it has happily use the
3G<00:05:43.300> so<00:05:44.300> that's<00:05:44.630> not<00:05:44.720> a<00:05:44.780> problem

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
3G so that's not a problem

3G so that's not a problem
battery<00:05:46.130> life<00:05:46.250> is<00:05:46.310> almost<00:05:46.640> exactly<00:05:46.940> the<00:05:47.150> same

iPad 2

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.770 
iPad 2
it's<00:06:28.289> definitely<00:06:28.819> the<00:06:29.819> best<00:06:30.030> tablet<00:06:30.689> out

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
it's definitely the best tablet out

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.129 
it's definitely the best tablet out
there<00:06:30.840> right<00:06:31.169> now<00:06:32.479> as<00:06:33.479> it<00:06:33.689> is<00:06:33.780> I<00:06:33.810> know<00:06:34.020> it
