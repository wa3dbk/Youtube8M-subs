00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:29.260
 Today I would like to talk about how to set up ac 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:34.960
 If this nad 11 is in the condition as shipped 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:40.010
 As I mentioned earlier, ieee beginning 2.11 pails can not be used 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:45.829
 It is 11 ac of 5 ghz band by doing a certain operation 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.690
 You can use the normal wimax 2+ of the 2.4 ghz band 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.300
 It will be like today 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.559
 I'm talking about how to set up the 11 ac, but here's a guide on how to connect 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.760

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:10.040
 In fact this step it is I am doing until two mountains 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.850
 Anyway , you have to do it by yourself until you try to set the connection destination 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.960
 I want to go 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.470

 So it is when you press the button that will return to this ec page 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.670
 In this way the screen will change this is this in is the same in smart phone in the doctor

 That I mean as such it is like Toka things it can not be used Toka can be used 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.769

 If effective check is tsukukun but it is positive with this, setting returns to original condition 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:34.090

 It is set to be able to use for 5 ghz band in each 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:01.360
 The setting is over 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.350
 Like this, it is the screen of the mab governor here if you make settings 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.460
 You can see a little bit 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:10.960
 Terminal information when this screen changes 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:12.850
 It is said how it comes out and is said to be a function setting It is a set button with this one of the small ones 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.040
 Long press on things

 In the place where the earth is, it's a castle , so please use it outdoors . 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.030
 It will be switched to the mode of the painter one by one by this 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:42.090
 Once raw It is such a feeling 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:44.460
 If it stops, just operate nad 11 at hand to wi-fi 11 ac 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.840

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.790
 I also talk to the smartphone only is it this site hey various ne me 211 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.470
 I can operate it 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.050
 As you can do only with the terminal body, please be careful there only 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.419
 smartphone 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:04.030
 In that say to the operation to switch the place of 11 ac and ordinary of 2.4 ghz 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.449
 A little a in it do annoying that can not be 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.860
 App of smartphone is upgraded and it is said that it should be able to do it 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:14.289
 I think so 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.620
 Lastly , wi-fi's 11 ac is a story in the set video as well 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.190
 I 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:24.490
 But it is the principle to use in the country 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:29.710
 It can not be used outdoors, so be sure to set it when entering a building 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:31.960
 When it comes out to that , let's do the setting of the day before as well, and be fair 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.639
