00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 he's pleased that a total social action plan has presented in more 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.279
 400 pilot cities 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.909
 for now a new gps and the tomtom go 1000 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:12.389
 moreover we will introduce you quickly with the members of this people 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.449
 bourgeois clement here is the new volume 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.060
 I'm not telling you that new products this fall 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.339
 she with a personal status which allows us to have a design 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 very thin the isie so the landscapes do not change let's see we're going out 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.910
 support and hikes were by car we will already start with 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.910
 to talk about car sports is by cart 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.310
 in an alley to a man 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.950
 a mentality 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.280
 it is beautiful with thierry mandon we will show that we propose a 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.920
 personal mistake it's already a pinch and afterwards I'm crying summer 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.800
 do not even after the war we have to shoot strong enough to denounce this 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.910
 indictment is a dream 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.690
 and it's not just the fact that some people call it a business 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.820
 five weeks in the field of foreign affairs s the same thing 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.340
 with the theme with acts 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.440
 this violence has mainly focused on the man in fact the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.250
 russia because who are both a week is good in this is what have 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.150
 does the four designers the raise and they are there because in fact that apple 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.260
 desk stand includes the cable carefully for the voyeur for the premises the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.520
 tam-tam gomila his pc 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.130
 what to do then 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.950
 so here we are going to have a bit of closer no this new gps here 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.820
 Clement I can certainly he knew the connection here but 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.450
 is one 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.410
 cj auto can not stop it at kadima which is bigger which is a lot 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.000
 flatter than the previous ones before it was beautiful but for the speaker 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.730
 with jacques sylla and a finish for the gray metal kck it's nice 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.930
 with a magnifying glass there we see it is to leave it for the magnetic support - 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.560
 because we have to say if we are going to turn 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.130
 it's not that bad just putting men would appreciate showing 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.040
 it's actually an oled screen to make it all a dish 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.420
 it's actually one of the phones on the screen 15 till the end like that 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.189
 so do everything it's really nice 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.840
 and then the novelty is a capacitive screen 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.550
 recommendations for new phones and new smartphones in particular 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.380
 the iphone well I made you silent on the screen is very active acquired 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.400
 made on the finger 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.190
 so here we also go through the refinements of the interface without that 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.039
 m 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.590
 but 6% in March at its peak 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.379
 a new step failed actually 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.279
 cossette concretely the architecture software so that's not seen 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.740
 too much and he also takes the opportunity to retouch interface 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.100
 quoted by the caf and friendly cashed next at half-time and 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.630
 that's probably why the red cross here at least on the roads and I 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.199
 I had never seen 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.879
 in the past there 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:31.919
 we can not do anything 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.069
 here it is that as well as appearing who took office and p6 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.669
 push button brandishing the size of the buttons for speeding and well 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.059
 sure the things the buttons are contextual that is to say that by 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:45.309
 example 6 if we did not plan a course he will not propose us the 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:46.739
 button clear course 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.200
 it really depends on the context 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.379
 they really worked on the simplicity of the interface 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.930
 % and I of what I did here are not bad salaries 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.180
 a cut of the guiding interface will be able to enter a city with the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.700
 betty the best chance that i 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.919
 not to mention the volume at the speed of the car 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.569
 outright there is a good a microbicide based on the advice of all orders 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.680
 at least six beds and the power m 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.410
 40 'torrÃ¨s goal and access hollywood for what I can say is that we can 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.959
 link are from the gps speakers 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.589
 where one wanted to take me about the sound of the vehicle that makes a lot of noise 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.939
 increases right for the second 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.249
 oh yes this shock must be there too so the festive moments er-6n 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.519
 new members remained as they are called so the summaries of 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.400
 find the n1 is a little clearer that the tam-tam announces that at his age 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.049
 this new committee is very very fast for the most 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.219
 fast who have done so far 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:42.149
 we were able to test a bit on the version for livestock here on the stock market 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:44.499
 looked pretty fast but that's good for the state so it can be 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:48.510
 improved so we have to confirm on a patient in our usual tests 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.519
 national place but it's susana not bad for now 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.789
 too many things that make 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.669
 danda so a new interface 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.819
 there the sun 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.129
 we do not necessarily see static but the definition of the cases 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.239
 and much heavier I improved a lot with it the water lands 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.640
 in cities like amsterdam and the performances between them with the various 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.309
 Documents 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:11.989
 the mayor 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.769
 this definition is possible from the environment in which we drive 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.519
 ok I still think that I'm going to just before the meeting 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.870
 wanted to make a small trip 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.200
 is that the novelty too is that live services 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.330
 before it was for three months or six months 3 months of memory for 123 - without 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.250
 previous - 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.410
 a year now it's a year of integrated service to kill and the 12th year 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.499
 before it was so euros per month 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:40.539
 and now his employers and 50 euros for a year so it's very interesting 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.490
 Another important issue is that Tam Tam has strengthened its partnership with 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.729
 vodafone 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.930
 and percent and so vodafone who therefore provides tax sim cards to 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.099
 connected services and makes it a unique theme 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.360
 even in countries where then at the beginning today I think it's this 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.580
 memory country these flows of water and open him 15% and so could not 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.389
 to have stayed at first 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.250
 so we see that we can use these live services 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.189
 for free we do not care must pay more 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:08.779
 in addition to a package and for 100 m 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.460
 and so with vodafone as tobacco covered even countries both engages 

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:13.870
 even to take over countries where 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.349
 the operator is not present 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.279
 we take care of roaming charges and he even talks about going up to 33 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.110
 country 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.889
 so that's really it's really an agreement that was promising and that 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.919
 strengthens for that the position of a father in this area we know that 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.089
 it also allows to give some 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:31.579
 visibility here is a good age think we're going to start over we'll roll 

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:32.699
 a little 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.639
 according to richard buteau surprise in the street after opening fire 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.980
 I hope the quality of the match will undoubtedly have that there is a lot of sun to 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.870
 journalists we are lucky 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.089
 in the month of April the accounting 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:45.809
 the reason for that 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:49.069
 we'll have to beat for second place 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.069
 that's part of it 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.400
 it was his direction 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.430
 we will repeat 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.430
 the conditions are really difficult the master 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.749
 I really had the website training on these new topics as 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:07.370
 gomis sectors that go out in the kiosks of the holidays we have not yet 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.400
 price but also sadness 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.080
 this price will be between 300 to eisenach meaning 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.210
 sunday evening the teachers training race engineer of the day 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.970
 I hope the project ps they were on the program soon
