town<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:17.110> guys<00:02:17.290> who's<00:02:17.830> your<00:02:17.980> driver<00:02:18.269> I'm<00:02:19.269> the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
town so guys who's your driver I'm the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.289 
town so guys who's your driver I'm the
driver<00:02:19.630> doctor<00:02:20.260> I'm<00:02:20.319> aground<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.920> actually<00:02:21.819> got

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
driver doctor I'm aground I actually got

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.270 
driver doctor I'm aground I actually got
inspired<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:23.080> build<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.590> time<00:02:23.799> machine<00:02:23.890> when

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
inspired to build this time machine when

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.650 
inspired to build this time machine when
I<00:02:24.310> slipped<00:02:24.549> off<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.760> toilet<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.390> hit<00:02:25.540> my<00:02:25.630> head

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
I slipped off the toilet and hit my head

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.539 
I slipped off the toilet and hit my head
on<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.959> sink<00:02:26.170> that's<00:02:26.829> when<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.010> discovered<00:02:27.220> the

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
on the sink that's when I discovered the

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.059 
on the sink that's when I discovered the
flux<00:02:27.760> capacitor<00:02:28.440> it's<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.590> guy<00:02:29.769> right<00:02:30.010> here

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
flux capacitor it's this guy right here

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.880 
flux capacitor it's this guy right here
that's<00:02:30.700> what<00:02:30.849> makes<00:02:31.000> time<00:02:31.150> travel<00:02:31.299> possible

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
that's what makes time travel possible

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.580 
that's what makes time travel possible
however<00:02:32.890> we<00:02:33.430> have<00:02:33.459> to<00:02:33.900> initially<00:02:34.900> make<00:02:35.079> create

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
however we have to initially make create

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.100 
however we have to initially make create
the<00:02:35.680> 1.21<00:02:36.160> gigawatts<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.819> electricity<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.900> run

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity to run

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.170 
the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity to run
the<00:02:38.349> flux<00:02:38.620> capacitor<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.640> that's<00:02:39.970> where<00:02:40.150> i

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
the flux capacitor and that's where i

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:49.370 
the flux capacitor and that's where i
came<00:02:40.269> up<00:02:40.480> with<00:02:40.569> mr.<00:02:40.660> fusion

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.300 

you<00:02:50.380> probably<00:02:50.620> looked<00:02:50.920> at<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.100> course
