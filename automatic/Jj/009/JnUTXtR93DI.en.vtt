00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.580
 at the leisurely walk now 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:08.680
 heike with stainless dogs physiotherapeutin 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.870
 and I thought I have you 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.880
 both, so to speak, has our butt and 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.219
 Of course I am a few already 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.800
 would like to have tips so what have 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:22.680
 in the twelve years a few mistakes 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.680
 crept in or generally on what 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.670
 all sides very well-rehearsed team 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.410
 At the moment I really would 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.480
 Not a case like I am here now 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.770
 can help even better says okay here 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.570
 and I have to be careful because 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.220
 even if now cyclists cars 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.810
 he is not interested in anything like that 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.540
 long and it just runs on those 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.970
 over and that's what they wanted 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.480
 many dog â€‹â€‹owners that really 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.420
 such joggers cyclists people that 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.370
 they just have them but they are 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.990
 Do not pay any attention to that 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.550
 which can be as yet traverse from 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.500
 bike if you do not drive 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.470
 puzzling coup the weird running 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.540
 expand and its on for at least 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.860
 I always think that's pretty 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.510
 if you are really a bit too 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.070
 consideration for others 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.700
 people who may not be dogs 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.680
 to have 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.180
 and now when I noticed that someone 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.170
 now for starts in a large arc to 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.780
 make that maybe the dog 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.190
 Just take it aside 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.450
 with small children at the small children 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.070
 they are coming because they are too 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.480
 Unpredictable are white for the dogs 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.510
 you do not always what happens there 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.040
 I think that would be nice if there 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.600
 also more dog owners just once 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.440
 pay attention to it were also times 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.900
 to take 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.520
 for not dog owners maybe will 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.260
 then here in our city the tolerance 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.270
 customer facing the amazon 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.560
 of course nice and that too 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.310
 just a little bit more done 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.340
 become 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.830
 These are, for example, what I notice 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.090
 the dogs do have a very 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.530
 clear language if you are with a 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.270
 dog like me now ten years 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.680
 living together then you have that he 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.300
 someday his language was also very good 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.010
 under control 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.630
 What strikes me, for example, is that 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.680
 he gets older heart when we for example 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.980
 want to drive a car 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.810
 you have my husband always highly praised the 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.000
 car a counter and puts his head 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.830
 between the thighs and do not want 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.350
 jumps you lift him up 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.270
 well it's not good because i think then 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.280
 always well that is too old and will be 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.660
 from the bookstores 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.190
 At some point it is certainly like that 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.470
 Dogs are not that good anymore 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.000
 have jump power and especially at 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.230
 you always see him very beautiful 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.540
 he also has a bit behind 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.550
 Cornerstones of course, too 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.710
 because the knee he sometimes has already 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.320
 his so-called passgang swings his 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.400
 run that's just everything so relief 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.200
 gait around spine or other joints 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.150
 which then has a bit of a pain too 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.500
 of course, and then there it is 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.850
 also very nice if you mouth has the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.010
 actually also indicates that he is 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.680
 just can not do it anymore 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.210
 when jumping off motto out of the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.740
 car out jumps for example there would 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.360
 I always keep the dog away from him 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.280
 many still do it because they do 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.540
 just need to drop like that yes 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.950
 that's actually a lot 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.680
 more stressful for the movement apparatus 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.989
 so to jump up so in fact 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.480
 could help down here the high field 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.010
 more under than nokia try that he 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.620
 as much as possible there alone 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.700
 or maybe you can do the dog 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.790
 yes then teach that he is the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.520
 foremost in the back of the trunk 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.930
 that you just a bit 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.280
 must be movable around the back 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.680
 car then he usually reached 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.959
 already another topic moment is natural 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.810
 so extreme weather julians such 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.760
 extremely hot or extremely cold in winter 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.680
 are there any tips how to contact the customer 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.520
 can make the whole life more comfortable 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.400
 can facilitate 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.530
 So if you have the dog he is on heat 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.420
 of course, it makes perfect sense 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.340
 not exactly in the biggest noon heat 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.370
 to go but maybe very early 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.930
 In the morning 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.390
 or even late in the evening when they are already 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.799
 Some have cooled off a bit 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.900
 of course, that you like in the bathroom 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.180
 next to it you can easily Sunday 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.650
 make a little damp then 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.060
 you have such a small evaporation cold 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.280
 then it will certainly be synonymous 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.890
 ok, and in winter, if it is 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.659
 It's completely cold from a certain age 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.329
 especially if the halt so synonymous problems 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.370
 I'm quite in favor of that 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.829
 that one attracts the dogs arguments 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.540
 and thus the choice if so 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.769
 aching back even gets cold 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.519
 but imagine it then 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.819
 even more mud 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.410
 we can do that too 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.280
 I like to do in the summer is that I am one 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.790
 scissors knife 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.410
 yes, if that's good in our hands 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.359
 so if that's what you get then 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.410
 the feeling has that it would be better 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.660
 I definitely do that 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.150
 one advantage is also that if the 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.310
 are shorter in the fell and are wet because 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.810
 she would like to swim anyway 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.690
 also the kick faster and still one 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.010
 further advantage short fur less 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.990
 housework yes-voices with security yes 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.030
 Great there I would say because my dog 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.680
 is old and a bit too side 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.060
 heat suffers then we go back and 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.860
 The food was a few citizens like 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:05:00.130
 say thank you very much for this insight 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:05:01.160
 in us have given us quite explained 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.730
 funny 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.820
 which is located only arrived here you go 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.820
 Yes 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.630
 but patients can 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.100
 but they are in spite of or 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.100
 he would like
