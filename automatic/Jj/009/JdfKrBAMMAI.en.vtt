is that it's not rolling back you jack

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.230 
is that it's not rolling back you jack
jack<00:01:33.320> isn't<00:01:33.710> sinking<00:01:34.130> in<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.609> the<00:01:34.789> vehicle

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
jack isn't sinking in and the vehicle

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.709 
jack isn't sinking in and the vehicle
wasn't<00:01:35.450> rolling<00:01:35.780> back<00:01:36.229> at<00:01:36.979> all<00:01:37.240> Wow

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
so the safe Jack stabilizer really has

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.600 
so the safe Jack stabilizer really has
made<00:01:42.469> a<00:01:42.530> huge<00:01:42.950> difference<00:01:43.069> here<00:01:43.909> with<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.350> the
