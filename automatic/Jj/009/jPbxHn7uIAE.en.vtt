in there until I saw it till I played

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.910 
in there until I saw it till I played
halo<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.259> that's<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.130> $23<00:01:26.880> value<00:01:27.920> just

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
halo so that's like the $23 value just

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.550 
halo so that's like the $23 value just
saying<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:30.270> 20<00:01:30.540> gig<00:01:30.890> Xbox<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.340> premium<00:01:33.380> 350<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
then the leads for 50

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.820 
then the leads for 50
so<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:36.980> difference<00:01:37.160> is<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.700> 200<00:01:38.180> 270<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.080> 370
