00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.510
 hello friends welcome to a new video 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.189
 of the series on how to create mods in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.010
 minecraft and today we're going to see how we can 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.080
 create achievements very well I'm going to put a 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.550
 example from which I'm going to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.340
 do the tutorial imagine that for 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.070
 chance we have an item is worth a 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.720
 kind of mineral that we want a 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.129
 logo skip us once our 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.480
 inventory is to say how it happens with the 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.070
 diamonds when we take a 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.420
 diamond jumps us an achievement that we have 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.830
 got diamonds and is in our 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.600
 inventory then let's do the same 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.250
 with this item but it's going to be 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 completely customized ie 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.460
 let's create us in our logo 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.470
 for this, what we are going to do to create ourselves 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.510
 previously an item and then we're going to 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.879
 create a new element that will be a 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.559
 achievement is this remember that is the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.390
 name in which you can put any 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.420
 type of name you have to try 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.739
 that is not already registered it has to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.390
 be a name more or less rare a name 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.540
 as in key I for example I'm going to put 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.470
 achievement test 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.840
 but there it is for example let's give it 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.790
 to ok and here we have a preview of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.620
 what is going to be our logo 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.470
 here we have to put the name of the 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.340
 achievement that will be playing with fire by 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.340
 that of the pearlite 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.770
 for example and here we have to put the 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.530
 description and description is how the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.320
 explanation worth here we can put has 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.360
 got 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.400
 but the thorn 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.400
 here we have that we can select the 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.560
 achievement icon the achievement icon can 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.920
 be 1 1 of the mod that we have already done if 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.440
 this one was still beating me from perlita vale is 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.200
 tell me the image of my block and the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.580
 we can put ours but also 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.280
 we can put another one by 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.410
 example I'm going to put the one on the telethon 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.950
 For example, you can put our 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.210
 the work yours but that I'm going to 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.590
 put this one 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.970
 here we have to put if it is 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.130
 independent this means that no 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.920
 you need to fulfill any previous achievement 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.660
 to be able to unblock it is to say by 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.700
 example that as soon as you get priori 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.750
 is the game jumps but for example 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.750
 so that you get 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.610
 the achievement of catching wood previously 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.100
 you must have opened the inventory 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.630
 because that achievement goes first on the line 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.180
 then I'm going to put it that is not 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.640
 independent is worth so that for 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.500
 see how it works 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.900
 but if you want it to be independent what 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.280
 you mark and it's already here we have to put 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.300
 if it's special is to say this the only thing 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.240
 what changes is the form of achievement instead 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.010
 to be square it will be as if it were 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.010
 tips like a cloud with tips 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.569
 I'm going to mark him that yes it is special and 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:54.489
 here where he puts the pre-achievement by 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.290
 so to say we have to put the achievement 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.000
 that will meet previously to be able 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.650
 get this in this case I'm going to 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.220
 put it after opening the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.080
 inventory to give us 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.460
 so you can see what works, let's see 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.560
 go to put the open inventory and 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.570
 let's give it to next and right now 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.860
 we have the achievement very well then once 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.260
 we have done this once we have to 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.390
 link this achievement with this with this 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.160
 item and to link it we have to give it 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.980
 to edit element once it's done 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.990
 let's go through all the 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.000
 configurations and we're going to get here to 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.680
 the list of events this is going to be a 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.140
 small introduction to some tutorials 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.630
 later on they are going to be about this 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.400
 the events is quite dynamic the 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.660
 it really gives the mods a very 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.340
 only 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.260
 for example, what I 'm going to do is going to 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.540
 to be adding an event that is like something 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.920
 what happens after an action for 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.080
 example here we have when the item is 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.520
 in the inventory then this would be 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.280
 where we have to put a 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.660
 event and the event would be that it's going to 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.920
 give an achievement when you are in the 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.870
 inventory but we can use it as as 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.200
 like when we kill a mod with him or what 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.870
 to be 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.250
 well let's give it when it's in 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.959
 the inventory we are going to give you to add 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.540
 event and in this line here we have 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.930
 what to look for to see that it looks good we have 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.340
 what to look for 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.709
 Y 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.650
 get file there are a lot and 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.870
 we want it to be an achievement 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.419
 let's get the achievement here 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.620
 achievement get and let's give event 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.440
 good but first we have to select 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.729
 the achievement that we want you to give us and for 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.100
 we have to go down to the bottom of the 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.930
 everything and look for ours ours 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.020
 will always be or will our achievements be 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:37.020
 in kreator our name and then 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.620
 achievement worth these would be the 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.180
 those already in the game is worth but 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.430
 ours are below all we're going 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.580
 to give it here and we're going to give it to event 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:51.300
 right now we have a 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.490
 a placed event we are going to give next 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.370
 let's give it to next and this is already 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.639
 determined once this is done we could 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.060
 let's try the two modes once 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.520
 finish doing the homework we are going to 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.620
 try it well then let's try the 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.460
 mods very well here we have already the achievement 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.180
 to take the inventory and now we're going to 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.009
 search our our 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.510
 our block that I do not remember where 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:23.700
 I've put our item sorry 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.930
 so I'm going to have to look for it 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.000
 this would be the item that I have placed 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.640
 before we're going to throw it to the ground and like 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.980
 you see as soon as we get it we must 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.009
 jump our logo is worth so what 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.950
 we take and there we have 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.830
 playing with fire 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.290
 Well, I hope you liked it
