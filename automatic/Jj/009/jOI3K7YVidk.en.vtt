00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
as very intuitive user interface so it's

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.860 
as very intuitive user interface so it's
very<00:01:17.410> easy<00:01:17.950> to<00:01:18.070> use<00:01:18.310> unlike<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.150> jxd<00:01:19.690> and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
very easy to use unlike the jxd and
