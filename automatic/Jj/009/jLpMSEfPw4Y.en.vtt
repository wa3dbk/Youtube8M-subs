00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
ThinkPad t 430 which is on the left and

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.360 
ThinkPad t 430 which is on the left and
the<00:00:08.189> t4<00:00:08.610> 30s<00:00:09.059> which<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.719> on<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.990> right<00:00:10.370> these

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
the t4 30s which is on the right these

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.339 
the t4 30s which is on the right these
laptops<00:00:11.610> are<00:00:11.910> pretty<00:00:12.120> similar<00:00:12.509> similar

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
laptops are pretty similar similar

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.090 
laptops are pretty similar similar
except<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.860> fact<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.490> t4<00:00:15.059> 30s<00:00:15.509> is

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
except of the fact that the t4 30s is

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.140 
except of the fact that the t4 30s is
essentially<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> slimmer<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.910> lighter

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
essentially a slimmer and lighter

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.650 
essentially a slimmer and lighter
version<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.350> t<00:00:19.590> 430<00:00:20.160> both<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:21.060> 14<00:00:21.480> inch

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
version of the t 430 both have 14 inch

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.080 
version of the t 430 both have 14 inch
screens<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.289> both<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> lot<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.090> similar

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
screens and both have a lot of similar

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.410 
screens and both have a lot of similar
options<00:00:24.830> but<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.160> shave<00:00:26.550> about<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.820> pound<00:00:27.180> of

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
options but you shave about a pound of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.759 
options but you shave about a pound of
weight<00:00:27.630> off<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.199> t4<00:00:28.619> 30s<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:30.390> about

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
weight off of the t4 30s and it's about

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.760 
weight off of the t4 30s and it's about
2/10<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.859> an<00:00:32.009> inch<00:00:32.099> thinner<00:00:32.510> which<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.770> it

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
2/10 of an inch thinner which is it

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.040 
2/10 of an inch thinner which is it
sounds<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> not<00:00:35.969> much<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.450> actually<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
sounds like a not much but actually it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.459 
sounds like a not much but actually it
does<00:00:37.290> make<00:00:37.469> quite<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> bit<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.980> difference<00:00:38.399> I

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
does make quite a bit of difference I

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.900 
does make quite a bit of difference I
just<00:00:40.469> kind<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.770> closed<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.100> lids<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.640> show<00:00:41.850> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
just kind of closed the lids to show you

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.110 
just kind of closed the lids to show you
here<00:00:42.390> how<00:00:43.309> much<00:00:44.309> thinner<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.180> at<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> front

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
here how much thinner it is at the front

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.250 
here how much thinner it is at the front
there<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> t4<00:00:50.039> 30s<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
there you can see that the t4 30s is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.299 
there you can see that the t4 30s is
noticeably<00:00:52.260> thinner<00:00:52.530> especially<00:00:53.129> at<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
noticeably thinner especially at the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.619 
noticeably thinner especially at the
front<00:00:53.579> there<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> back<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.600> little

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
front there at the back it's a little

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.250 
front there at the back it's a little
less<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.890> difference<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.930> at<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> front

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
less of a difference but at the front

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.760 
less of a difference but at the front
he'll<00:00:58.649> definitely<00:00:58.859> notice<00:00:59.430> it's<00:01:00.210> thinner<00:01:00.770> so

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
he'll definitely notice it's thinner so

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.070 
he'll definitely notice it's thinner so
let's<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.879> assume<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.660> prove<00:01:03.899> we

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
let's just assume it in here to prove we

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.260 
let's just assume it in here to prove we
do<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> t4<00:01:04.920> 30s<00:01:05.339> with<00:01:05.610> us<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.939> case<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
do have a t4 30s with us in case you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.690 
do have a t4 30s with us in case you
doubt<00:01:06.479> me<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:08.159> let's<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.540> 30

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
doubt me and of here let's see for 30

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.010 
doubt me and of here let's see for 30
there<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:12.000> Oh<00:01:12.530> Ruben<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.400> um<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.810> kind

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
there we go Oh Ruben so um I just kind

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990 
there we go Oh Ruben so um I just kind
of<00:01:16.080> wanted<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.400> compare<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.460> screens<00:01:17.880> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of wanted to compare the screens a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.810 
of wanted to compare the screens a
little<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.860> t4<00:01:20.220> 30<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> left

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
little here the the t4 30 on the left

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.890 
little here the the t4 30 on the left
has<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.140> 1366<00:01:22.140> by<00:01:22.229> 768<00:01:22.650> screen<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.640> t4<00:01:24.270> 30s<00:01:24.689> on

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
has the 1366 by 768 screen the t4 30s on

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.880 
has the 1366 by 768 screen the t4 30s on
the<00:01:24.990> right<00:01:25.259> has<00:01:25.500> 1600<00:01:26.220> by<00:01:26.340> 900<00:01:26.939> screen<00:01:27.299> upgrade

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
the right has 1600 by 900 screen upgrade

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.080 
the right has 1600 by 900 screen upgrade
so<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.950> get<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> better<00:01:29.430> resolution<00:01:29.790> over

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so you get a better resolution over

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.350 
so you get a better resolution over
there<00:01:30.270> however<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.990> viewing<00:01:31.290> angles<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
there however the viewing angles and

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.969 
there however the viewing angles and
saturation<00:01:33.360> color<00:01:33.900> accuracy<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.530> about<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
saturation color accuracy are about the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.130 
saturation color accuracy are about the
same<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.880> push<00:01:36.240> them<00:01:36.420> back<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.810> you'll<00:01:36.960> see

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
same if I push them back here you'll see

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.679 
same if I push them back here you'll see
the<00:01:37.290> colors<00:01:37.619> will<00:01:37.860> distort<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:39.540> these

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the colors will distort because these

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.880 
the colors will distort because these
are<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:39.990> IPS<00:01:40.470> displays<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:43.590> about<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
are not IPS displays and it's about the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.280 
are not IPS displays and it's about the
same<00:01:44.070> degree<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.490> distortion<00:01:44.790> they're<00:01:45.290> both

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
same degree of distortion they're both

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.410 
same degree of distortion they're both
our<00:01:46.500> mat<00:01:46.710> screens<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.549> you're<00:01:47.820> not<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
our mat screens so you're not going to

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.260 
our mat screens so you're not going to
get<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.600> bunch<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.990> glare<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> reflection

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
get a bunch of glare and reflection

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.639 
get a bunch of glare and reflection
which<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> good<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:51.780> office<00:01:52.079> environments

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
which is good for office environments

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.620 
which is good for office environments
such<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.159> where<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:54.090> see<00:01:54.270> there's<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> lot

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
such as this where you see there's a lot

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.109 
such as this where you see there's a lot
of<00:01:54.720> strong<00:01:54.990> overhead<00:01:55.500> lighting<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:56.280> terms<00:01:56.909> of

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
of strong overhead lighting in terms of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.080 
of strong overhead lighting in terms of
ports<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.840> differences<00:01:58.439> well<00:01:58.920> there's<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.700> lot

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
ports and differences well there's a lot

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.850 
ports and differences well there's a lot

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
action really is for this notebook you

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.180 
action really is for this notebook you

so really little bit ports on the back
there<00:03:17.400> overall<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.910> do<00:03:18.090> get<00:03:18.239> one<00:03:18.390> more<00:03:18.540> USB

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
there overall you do get one more USB

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.949 
there overall you do get one more USB
2.0<00:03:19.350> port<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.920> T<00:03:20.190> 430<00:03:20.670> versus<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.209> t4<00:03:21.570> 30s

2.0 port on the T 430 versus the t4 30s
if<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.070> makes<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.400> difference<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.000> it's

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
if that makes a difference to you it's

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.280 
if that makes a difference to you it's
worth<00:03:25.140> considering<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.900> do<00:03:28.020> have<00:03:28.140> an

let's<00:03:38.910> see<00:03:39.120> some<00:03:39.390> other<00:03:39.450> differences<00:03:39.989> we<00:03:40.140> can

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
let's see some other differences we can

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.150 
let's see some other differences we can
mention<00:03:40.500> here<00:03:41.030> Bozz<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.920> mentioned<00:03:43.920> before

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
mention here Bozz I mentioned before

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.300 
mention here Bozz I mentioned before
about<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.340> weight<00:03:44.820> difference<00:03:45.680> is<00:03:46.680> kind<00:03:47.220> of

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
about the weight difference is kind of

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.270 
about the weight difference is kind of
go<00:03:47.489> ahead<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:48.019> demonstrate<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.680> actual

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
go ahead and demonstrate the actual

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.750 
go ahead and demonstrate the actual
weight<00:03:50.400> itself<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:52.260> will<00:03:52.350> notice<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.860> if<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.130> go

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
weight itself you will notice it if I go

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.880 
weight itself you will notice it if I go
ahead<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.030> look<00:03:54.269> at<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.480> back<00:03:54.630> of<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.959> t<00:03:55.290> 430

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
ahead and look at the back of the t 430

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.479 
ahead and look at the back of the t 430
here<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.459> has<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.269> 9<00:03:57.900> cell<00:03:58.170> baton<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:58.830> it's<00:03:59.370> going

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
here it has a 9 cell baton so it's going

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.270 
here it has a 9 cell baton so it's going
to<00:03:59.550> be<00:03:59.610> pretty<00:03:59.820> happy<00:04:00.090> with<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:02.010> do<00:04:02.250> have

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
to be pretty happy with this you do have

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.520 
to be pretty happy with this you do have
more<00:04:02.700> battery<00:04:03.030> options<00:04:03.390> for<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.600> t<00:04:03.780> 430<00:04:04.260> so

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
more battery options for the t 430 so

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.160 
more battery options for the t 430 so
you<00:04:04.590> can<00:04:04.830> get<00:04:05.360> smaller<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.600> four<00:04:06.930> cell<00:04:07.140> I

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
you can get smaller the four cell I

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.949 
you can get smaller the four cell I
believe<00:04:07.500> in<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.769> six<00:04:08.130> cell<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.730> then<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.720> nine

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
believe in a six cell and then the nine

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.990 
believe in a six cell and then the nine
cell<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.680> nine<00:04:10.830> cell<00:04:11.070> sticks<00:04:11.370> out<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:11.910> you

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
cell the nine cell sticks out and you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.330 
cell the nine cell sticks out and you
can<00:04:12.120> get<00:04:12.209> up<00:04:12.300> to<00:04:12.330> 15<00:04:13.080> hours<00:04:13.440> with<00:04:13.650> this<00:04:13.800> the

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.180 

b6l<00:04:19.340> should<00:04:19.670> be<00:04:19.820> flush<00:04:20.090> with<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.390> back<00:04:21.190> with

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
b6l should be flush with the back with

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.570 
b6l should be flush with the back with
the<00:04:22.430> t4<00:04:22.850> 30s<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.720> just<00:04:23.960> get<00:04:24.250> one<00:04:25.250> battery

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
the t4 30s you just get one battery

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.840 
the t4 30s you just get one battery
option<00:04:26.030> or<00:04:26.270> two<00:04:26.930> but<00:04:27.230> they're<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.500> same<00:04:27.850> same

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
option or two but they're the same same

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.730 
option or two but they're the same same
size<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.300> they<00:04:29.390> don't<00:04:29.600> stick<00:04:29.810> out<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:30.050> the

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
size and they don't stick out so the

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.860 
size and they don't stick out so the
nine<00:04:30.950> cell<00:04:31.190> battery<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.760> 2.30<00:04:32.450> is<00:04:32.600> five

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
nine cell battery this 2.30 is five

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.440 
nine cell battery this 2.30 is five
point<00:04:33.170> one<00:04:33.350> pounds<00:04:33.830> or<00:04:34.100> 5.2<00:04:34.820> pounds

to one a 14 inch screen the t4 30s is

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.660 
to one a 14 inch screen the t4 30s is
definitely<00:05:03.140> the<00:05:03.260> way<00:05:03.350> to<00:05:03.380> go
