time for say elementary my dear two time

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.950 
time for say elementary my dear two time
five<00:01:50.050> percent<00:01:50.470> yeah<00:01:51.479> now<00:01:52.479> he<00:01:52.540> wants<00:01:52.930> to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
five percent yeah now he wants to

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.219 
five percent yeah now he wants to
multiply<00:01:53.500> two<00:01:53.560> times<00:01:54.360> 174<00:01:55.360> or<00:01:55.869> some<00:01:56.050> big

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
multiply two times 174 or some big

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.260 
multiply two times 174 or some big
number<00:01:56.500> like<00:01:56.619> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
number like that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.960 
number like that
two<00:01:58.270> times<00:01:58.649> 174<00:01:59.649> equals<00:02:00.100> two<00:02:00.310> times<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.790> hundred

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
two times 174 equals two times a hundred

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.719 
two times 174 equals two times a hundred
plus<00:02:01.420> two<00:02:01.810> times<00:02:02.080> seventy<00:02:02.800> plus<00:02:02.979> two<00:02:03.460> times

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
plus two times seventy plus two times

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.400 
plus two times seventy plus two times
four<00:02:04.149> that's<00:02:04.509> all<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.520> two<00:02:06.580> times<00:02:07.080> 174<00:02:08.080> equals

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
four that's all so two times 174 equals

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.320 
four that's all so two times 174 equals
200<00:02:08.979> plus<00:02:09.220> 140<00:02:10.060> plus<00:02:10.239> eight<00:02:10.600> are<00:02:11.850> 348<00:02:12.850> it's

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
200 plus 140 plus eight are 348 it's

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.360 
200 plus 140 plus eight are 348 it's
