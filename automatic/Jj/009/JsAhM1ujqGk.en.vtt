like<00:02:38.989> yeah<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.230> material<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.709> pretty<00:02:40.890> see

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
like yeah the material is pretty see

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.180 
like yeah the material is pretty see
through<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.459> both<00:02:41.519> sides<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.739> like

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
through on both sides and this is like

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.170 
through on both sides and this is like
more<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.560> plasticky<00:02:46.560> material<00:02:47.220> i<00:02:47.310> guess<00:02:47.519> but

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
more of a plasticky material i guess but

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.560 
more of a plasticky material i guess but
both<00:02:48.420> sides<00:02:48.450> are<00:02:49.110> very<00:02:49.170> stretchy<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.570> this

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
both sides are very stretchy and this

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.360 
both sides are very stretchy and this
one<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:51.930> kind<00:02:52.350> of<00:02:52.470> more<00:02:52.650> cottony<00:02:53.190> but

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
one is just kind of more cottony but

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.000 
one is just kind of more cottony but
it's<00:02:53.519> still<00:02:53.670> stretchy<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.300> same<00:02:54.709> really<00:02:55.709> like

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.670 
of them it's the same different mac has
this<00:03:07.650> butterfly<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.750> measurements<00:03:10.440> were

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
this butterfly and the measurements were

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.090 
this butterfly and the measurements were
just<00:03:11.130> right<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.900> was<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.530> right<00:03:13.739> link

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
just right and it was the right link

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.509 
just right and it was the right link
which<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.880> amazing<00:03:15.510> because<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.410> guess<00:03:17.130> all<00:03:17.459> of

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
which is amazing because I guess all of

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.880 
which is amazing because I guess all of
the<00:03:17.880> shirts<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.079> guess<00:03:19.260> asian<00:03:19.590> girls<00:03:19.739> are

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
the shirts like I guess asian girls are

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.030 
the shirts like I guess asian girls are
shorter<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.850> all<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.390> shirts<00:03:21.660> are<00:03:22.040> shorter

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
shorter so all of the shirts are shorter

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.000 
shorter so all of the shirts are shorter
but<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.120> right<00:03:24.570> link<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.230> again

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.490 
picture of a saucer or something so I
was<00:05:29.390> thinking<00:05:29.480> that<00:05:29.900> was<00:05:30.050> like<00:05:30.170> a<00:05:30.200> bigger

was thinking that was like a bigger
plate<00:05:30.890> maybe<00:05:32.740> so<00:05:33.740> when<00:05:33.920> you<00:05:34.010> this<00:05:34.190> stuff<00:05:34.430> you

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
plate maybe so when you this stuff you

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.210 
plate maybe so when you this stuff you
must<00:05:35.240> remember<00:05:35.990> how<00:05:36.440> much<00:05:36.590> you<00:05:36.650> paid<00:05:36.770> for<00:05:36.980> it

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
how much material costs how much they're

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.570 
how much material costs how much they're
paying<00:05:43.970> their<00:05:44.390> workers<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.710> the<00:05:46.010> output<00:05:46.220> on
