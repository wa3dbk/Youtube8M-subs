00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.549
 First you open the ten escaped 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.549
 offender 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.790
 Here you can now find an info cafÃ© 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.930
 many more times we do groups 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.680
 we succeed here 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:28.189
 Here are the five films 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:35.010
 as commercial points the whole files 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:37.920
 i take it the reform because you have the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.270
 battery so above but wants to see everything 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.610
 We want to open then 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 jfp does it by itself 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:52.460
 then we have to decide where 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.460
 want to save here 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.440
 folder I did not synonymous 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:13.390
 Politics make the online team created 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:17.229
 Show in eg baku go 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:21.840
 then the way will be best for him 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:24.119
 So say for the folder 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.360
 you just have to pack again 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:33.640
 then go here to mediateks extraction 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.860
 extract more wrong then we do that 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:43.540
 lasts now for a while here you can 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.780
 on the lakes are the dancing pictures 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.440
 be counted 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.440
 even the sounds will not be there 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.440
 to get 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.350
 which is why no sound at all 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.950
 so 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.650
 after that is done 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.319
 can one open the sounds here eg 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.750
 I can not hear anything here 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:29.879
 so get a tip of the concept 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.730
 that one here that I do not either 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.450
 make stored are simply batteries in 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.900
 Baku and then it all went to all 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.900
 other 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.009
 [Music] 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:57.690
 it may have stopped now 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:03:01.300
 just the sounds for calling 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:05.800
 where you can adjust other side 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.820
 there is there so we go but 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.180
 here again 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.460
 Pictures shows that batteries in the ground 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.010
 we are allowed to exchange this here 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:20.170
 april symbolen we already have 1 and me 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.470
 wanted to do it now like the green ones 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.700
 So here because I do not know black 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.960
 We 've done a lot here 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:36.220
 Cents directly into the race your apothecary 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:39.070
 Call now to take again 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.590
 I know you if prepared then know 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:46.240
 I have already prepared the pictures 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:49.330
 Prepared image change and make it there 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.410
 we just go out and have four here 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.430
 Pictures you can see up here are 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.430
 it will be different soon 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.269
 that does not have to be the case with the black sea 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.930
 I think I should have been white 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.930
 would and therefore probably would have 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.829
 the annual production 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.829
 to arrive 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.270
 Also here it looked done today 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.480
 so 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.320
 now all this has ploder dark 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.320
 to join 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.290
