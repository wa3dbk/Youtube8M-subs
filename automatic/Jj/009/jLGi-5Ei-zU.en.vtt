I thought pritch pritch put in a great

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.170 
I thought pritch pritch put in a great
shift<00:04:12.159> because<00:04:12.489> he<00:04:12.579> was<00:04:12.699> getting<00:04:12.819> out<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.150> the

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
shift because he was getting out to the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.699 
shift because he was getting out to the
fall<00:04:13.479> back<00:04:13.689> when<00:04:13.900> he<00:04:13.989> needed<00:04:14.319> to<00:04:14.500> and

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
fall back when he needed to and

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.099 
fall back when he needed to and
obviously<00:04:15.669> l<00:04:16.449> on<00:04:16.659> the<00:04:16.750> right<00:04:16.900> done<00:04:17.079> a

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
obviously l on the right done a

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.810 
obviously l on the right done a
fantastic<00:04:17.349> job<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:17.919> Scotty<00:04:18.340> when<00:04:18.519> he<00:04:18.609> came<00:04:18.760> on
