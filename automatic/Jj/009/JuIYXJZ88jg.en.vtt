00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hello everyone, let's try to remove this 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.649
 gear here with this motor from 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.210
 printer canon 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.880
 we have a metal gear planted 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.839
 apparently on hot or just because she 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.510
 we are not withdrawn but together here 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.359
 I will eat a little and maybe with 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.020
 the help of this puller is to do everything 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.020
 still succeed 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:44.440
 I don't know how I can do it 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:49.570
 but I want to try there on our shaft 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.570
 unfortunately there is no center 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.290
 so getting in trouble 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:28.050
 the little one gives in to it 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:38.280
 you can see he has already succumbed to us 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:46.830
 Sorry, we have a small cone 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:51.509
 enough well then it will be released until 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.880
 will turn on but I have nothing to put there so 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.800
 could be full can be put a ball 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.580
 or else that you are a stripper to remove it from us 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:11.000
 already moved so will go already easily i 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.000
 I do like this a screwdriver 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.530
 so we took off 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.530
 gears and now we can here 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.540
 press down the cartridge and so the puller 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.280
 my failed to remove this gear 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:34.700
 then we will think differently take 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.930
 such a bursting key in this way 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.000
 fix 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.950
 here I am a little hammer so simple 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.360
 holding a little beat in his hand. you can 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.350
 moved and now it must be knocked out 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:56.750
 further for this i will take my new ones 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.750
 sand and twist in a vice 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.550
 and we'll just knock out 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.980
 that's all 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.720
 Here is our little motor 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:37.820
 went out well and now you can 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:40.760
 use with any chamber wanted 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.980
 put a cartridge on it on shaft 3 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.960
 millimeter but he didn't get in here because 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:56.720
 shaft but here on this big patroness 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:04:07.520
 not 3 millimeters show uncomfortable here are three 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:12.080
 and spring 17 is exactly three by three 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:17.600
 inside one probably need to do 317 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:21.610
 micrometers but that's not terrible extreme 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.460
 case you can just turn it on and there 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:32.270
 sandpaper a little bit here to remove these a couple 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:34.850
 fotochek and then we will patron 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:39.410
 well i need smarter so already these sur le 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:43.370
 lac much well if need be i will 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:46.340
