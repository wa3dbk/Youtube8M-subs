 well you're going to have to rethink a bit 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.420
 because people walk 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.490
 what they do 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.880
 Every person does things because 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.760
 he moves away from something that scares him that he has given him he will

 or because it comes close to what you want and need 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.460
 if there is not something that you are going to give pain like for example 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.970
 boys if every ten products that are sold fail to place without costs 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.780
 additional 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.369
 percent to kill and land 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.829
 refused to carry out the remodeling is because it is for the company to have 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.510
 profitability this could be the basis obviously that is much better than 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.050
 you find fudge I guess if the seller 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.210
 going to sell that extra product for your company is important 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.900
 and if the green sprout company 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.970
 by likewise union makes damien was imported for the rewarding of good 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.120
 way 3 ap omen that approaches kate now only to a moderate commitment 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.149
 we talk about 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.010
 love commitment 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.929
 compassion or mercy 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.680
 percent the commitment of him so that it is not protocolized achieved 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.130
 If there is not something that motivates you here, sell it 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.679
 I would like you to reflect on 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.809
 because although I say I would have to do that here you are offering 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.710
 to get away from a punishment that I can put 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.910
 or for fences any prize you can get can raise something of and not 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.549
 because I do not have a margin but for me it's important, good, it's important 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.860
 premier or somehow look guys we go to the use 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.290
 a contest could not give commission on this but within those that continue as 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.950
 minimum in the month when placing eta eta additional fruits I will choose we are going to 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.140

 something motivated some way and is on how to take it same way that does not 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.800
 You can blame the client who does not buy you, you can not blame the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.280
 seller that is not motivated football has to find something that motivates 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.079
 so work think how the hell ago 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.020
 that is motivated 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.670
 ivo karlovic and reward that behavior or if you want to punish them for not having it 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.939
 I suggest you reward positive behavior and not punish the negative
