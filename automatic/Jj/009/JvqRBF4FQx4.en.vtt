00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.930
 2 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.389
 hi everyone knows and derka 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.050
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.970
 new video to make money at 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.710
 infinity pretty quickly on five 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.970
 online so for once it's not 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.010
 a bitche town because it's just a 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.810
 game mode that was created by rockstar 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.180
 or you really win a lot 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.280
 money so to go in this mode of 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.780
 game there is a race in scooter nerves 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.030
 so without you going to end up at 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.950
 same place as me in the video as 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.420
 I show it on the map or if you 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.040
 are very far at the other end of the 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.490
 map eh ben you will just have to do 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.710
 start 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.270
 you go in a line activities 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.250
 host an activity and you will do 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.560
 created by rockstar you go in the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.840
 races and you will choose the race 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.070
 what is called channel passage so 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.610
 once you have chosen this 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.110
 race 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.090
 so you go the advertised is by the 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.050
 Then, you have to invite the 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.149
 maximum of people 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.440
 so a fortis and your friends or people 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.410
 you have met online 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.910
 it should preferably be 8 because the more the 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.040
 radio players the more you will win 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.840
 money so now the video is going 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.390
 to be set I would have a few subscribers with 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.720
 me and strangers so we will turn 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.000
 seven 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.080
 but imagine if you are at 8 eh ben 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.450
 this is where you will gain the maximum 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.310
 money and so once you are 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.990
 enough players advise you at least 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.520
 to be 5 in the party before throwing 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.049
 so we were seven once 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.400
 you announce the party eh ben you 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.830
 will just have to do the normal run no 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.540
 so the race lasts about five minutes 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.979
 at the two rounds so I advise you 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.560
 to not touch the settings but it's 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.540
 just the two rounds and so here after 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.760
 it will take about five minutes to 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.290
 finish the race because there are two laps and 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.700
 once you finish it eh ben 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.740
 you will be able to see that you are going 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.750
 really make a lot of money for 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.369
 a race card you won about 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.939
 thirty thousand or even forty thousand 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.740
 dollars 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.420
 every five minutes because the race 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.920
 lasts about five minutes so the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.090
 first will win about thirty thousand 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.030
 or forty thousand dollars 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.549
 if you are 8 of course and the last 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.170
 will earn a minimum of $ 5000 so that's 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.240
 really huge anyway for a 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.189
 activity because usually geeks 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.450
 money can you earn about 100 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.670
 thousand dollars every five minutes 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.319
 but it's true that the silver church there 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.319
 may be at risk of being banned 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.879
 but in addition and well 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.379
 have time to duplicate 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.730
 cars and everything is still 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.719
 long manipulations that have enough 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.790
 enervating 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.810
 while this little race that lasts 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.159
 about five minutes 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.049
 well you'll just have to do it 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.549
 journey he asks you to do and 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.829
 once you arrive first or 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.030
 even last one eh ben you'll be able 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.010
 see that you will win anyway 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.359
 a lot of money so me in the video 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.159
 we were only 7 years old were not even 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.969
 not 8 and I still won more than 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.629
 32000 from the cross and the last to win 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.370
 4900 something like that 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.659
 so it's really a beautiful 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.249
 little race that is really 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.799
 accessible to all people because 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:45.180
 you unlock it at level 1 more 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.469
 you have no risk of banishment 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.480
 because it's not a glitch it's rather 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.159
 a game mode that was a little abused 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.409
 by rockstar and I think in the 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.750
 following days well they will go down 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.280
 xp and money this game mode there 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.260
 is in any case I advise you 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.269
 really enjoy it before this mode 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.739
 of play either patch and win 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.819
 practically more money 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.919
 so that's the story of this little 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.790
 video will have pleased you nice is not of 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.109
 put a little bit of them for this 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.209
 famous game mode that is really 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.829
 and give you an appointment for 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.569
 next glitch videos on call of 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.980
 duty or on jcat that will arrive 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.280
 quarter without a machine and kill all the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.729
 world 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.729
 bye
