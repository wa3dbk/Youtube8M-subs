00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
End and so if I ever encroached upon the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.090 
End and so if I ever encroached upon the
northern<00:00:49.170> end<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> beach<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.860> would<00:00:49.950> get

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
northern end of the beach I would get

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
northern end of the beach I would get
harassed<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.640> intimidated<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.420> threatened

harassed and intimidated and threatened

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.660 
harassed and intimidated and threatened
but<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.620> really<00:00:52.860> bred<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> lot<00:00:53.579> of

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
but that really bred a lot of

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.189 
but that really bred a lot of
competitiveness<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.480> me<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.899> stood<00:00:55.140> up

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
competitiveness in me because I stood up

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
competitiveness in me because I stood up
for<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> believed<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.340> stood<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
for what I believed in I stood up and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.529 
for what I believed in I stood up and
fight<00:00:57.090> against<00:00:57.960> those<00:00:58.230> guys<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> think

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
fight against those guys so I think

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.819 
fight against those guys so I think
competitiveness<00:01:00.539> was<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.050> ingrained<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.710> me

world champion or an eight times world

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.229 
world champion or an eight times world
champion<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:34.540> that's<00:02:35.170> why<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.560> chose<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.239> to

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
quit because I'm not a quitter

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.380 
quit because I'm not a quitter
definitely<00:02:44.739> not<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.519> she<00:02:45.579> accepts<00:02:46.269> the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
definitely not and so she accepts the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.789

challenge of surfing one of the

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.920 
challenge of surfing one of the
gnarliest<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.579> scariest<00:02:49.180> waves<00:02:49.450> in<00:02:49.750> the

I<00:04:30.950> think<00:04:31.950> women's<00:04:32.280> surfing<00:04:32.550> isn't<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.240> natural

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
I think women's surfing isn't a natural

I think women's surfing isn't a natural
competitive<00:04:34.430> environment<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.580> think<00:04:35.730> you<00:04:36.690> know
