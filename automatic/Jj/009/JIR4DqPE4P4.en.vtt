this tutorial will demonstrate how to

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.480 
this tutorial will demonstrate how to
join<00:00:03.780> knitted<00:00:04.290> pieces<00:00:04.529> together<00:00:04.980> as<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.279> go

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
join knitted pieces together as you go

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.900 
join knitted pieces together as you go
I'm<00:00:06.120> working<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.259> hat<00:00:07.589> which<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.010> actually

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
I'm working on a hat which is actually

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.870 
I'm working on a hat which is actually
made<00:00:09.269> in<00:00:09.300> one<00:00:09.809> long<00:00:10.110> spiral<00:00:10.800> with<00:00:11.580> each

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
made in one long spiral with each

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.999 
made in one long spiral with each
successive<00:00:12.540> tier<00:00:12.990> being<00:00:13.259> joined<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.920> the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
successive tier being joined to the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.000 
successive tier being joined to the
previous<00:00:14.429> tier<00:00:14.820> as<00:00:15.030> its<00:00:15.330> knit<00:00:15.619> now<00:00:16.619> before<00:00:16.920> we

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
previous tier as its knit now before we

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.890 
previous tier as its knit now before we
actually<00:00:17.190> get<00:00:17.490> started<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:18.119> want<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.750> analyze

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
actually get started I want to analyze

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.840 
actually get started I want to analyze
where<00:00:19.590> we're<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.250> little<00:00:20.460> bit<00:00:20.609> and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
where we're going just a little bit and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.900 
where we're going just a little bit and
so<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.750> going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> look<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.189> these<00:00:23.310> chain

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
so I'm going to look for these chain

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.250 
so I'm going to look for these chain
bring<00:00:24.150> your<00:00:24.300> attention<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.779> these<00:00:24.900> chain

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
bring your attention to these chain

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.849 
bring your attention to these chain
stitches<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.730> are<00:00:26.849> actually<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.289> selvage

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
stitches that are actually the selvage

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.609 
stitches that are actually the selvage
edge<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.279> slip<00:00:29.550> stitches<00:00:30.150> from<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.170> previous

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
edge to slip stitches from the previous

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.340 
edge to slip stitches from the previous
tier<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.630> I'm<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> actually<00:00:34.050> be

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350

stitches together the slip stitch and
the<00:01:22.960> picked-up<00:01:23.170> stitch<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:25.240> I'm<00:01:25.479> going<00:01:25.720> to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
the picked-up stitch now I'm going to

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.750 
the picked-up stitch now I'm going to
work<00:01:26.080> back<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.950> we'll<00:01:30.070> demonstrate<00:01:30.280> it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
work back and then we'll demonstrate it

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.120 
work back and then we'll demonstrate it
again<00:01:31.030> now<00:01:31.810> I'm<00:01:32.080> actually<00:01:32.410> knitting

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
again now I'm actually knitting

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.749 
again now I'm actually knitting
backwards<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:35.110> rather<00:01:35.470> than<00:01:35.650> purling<00:01:36.250> so

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
backwards here rather than purling so

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.100 
backwards here rather than purling so
that<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:36.910> don't<00:01:37.119> have<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.450> turn<00:01:37.660> my<00:01:37.869> work

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
that I don't have to turn my work

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.290 
that I don't have to turn my work
because<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:39.190> spiral<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:40.710> hmm<00:01:41.910> actually<00:01:42.910> only

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
because the spiral is hmm actually only

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.870 
because the spiral is hmm actually only
eight<00:01:43.570> stitches<00:01:43.900> across<00:01:44.140> I<00:01:44.800> would<00:01:45.490> have<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.759> be

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
eight stitches across I would have to be

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.460 
eight stitches across I would have to be
turning<00:01:46.240> every<00:01:46.540> eight<00:01:46.690> stitches<00:01:46.990> which<00:01:47.290> would

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
turning every eight stitches which would

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.800 
turning every eight stitches which would
get<00:01:47.590> super<00:01:48.130> tedious<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:49.360> now<00:01:49.479> I'm<00:01:49.540> just<00:01:49.600> going

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
get super tedious so now I'm just going

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.440 
get super tedious so now I'm just going
to<00:01:49.840> work<00:01:49.990> back<00:01:50.670> again<00:01:51.670> I'm<00:01:51.880> going<00:01:52.150> to<00:01:52.210> work

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
to work back again I'm going to work

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.530 
to work back again I'm going to work
until<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.869> only<00:01:53.050> have<00:01:53.259> one<00:01:53.530> stitch<00:01:53.830> left<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
until I only have one stitch left and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.870 
until I only have one stitch left and
then<00:01:58.540> I'm<00:01:58.690> going<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:58.960> slip<00:01:59.500> that<00:02:00.009> last<00:02:00.340> stitch

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
then I'm going to slip that last stitch

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.490 
then I'm going to slip that last stitch
knitwise<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:03.070> this<00:02:03.850> selvage<00:02:04.360> edge<00:02:04.600> tends<00:02:05.320> to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
knitwise now this selvage edge tends to

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.440 
knitwise now this selvage edge tends to
curl<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.009> inside<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.060> lot<00:02:07.180> of<00:02:07.210> times

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
curl to the inside so a lot of times

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.850 
curl to the inside so a lot of times
you're<00:02:07.540> going<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.690> have<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.990> coax<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.470> towards

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
you're going to have to coax it towards

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.100 
you're going to have to coax it towards
you<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.340> make<00:02:09.550> sure<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.119> get<00:02:10.360> the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
you to make sure that you get the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.750 
you to make sure that you get the
outside<00:02:11.620> leg<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.130> don't<00:02:12.310> pick<00:02:12.490> up<00:02:12.610> the
