00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
let's have a look at a measure to it

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.220 
let's have a look at a measure to it
sounds<00:00:06.960> like<00:00:07.080> this

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.030 

okay<00:00:15.230> so<00:00:15.290> if<00:00:15.500> you<00:00:15.590> remember<00:00:15.860> from<00:00:15.889> the

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
okay so if you remember from the

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.710 
okay so if you remember from the
baseline<00:00:16.430> video<00:00:16.850> we're<00:00:17.029> just<00:00:17.210> simply<00:00:17.450> moving

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720

with a thumb jumping a string once again
playing<00:00:27.320> D<00:00:27.619> string<00:00:28.090> our<00:00:30.609> index<00:00:31.609> finger<00:00:31.910> is

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
playing D string our index finger is

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.720

string<00:00:36.670> okay<00:00:37.989> and<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.050> timing<00:00:39.260> for<00:00:39.470> this<00:00:39.620> one

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
string okay and the timing for this one

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.979 
string okay and the timing for this one
is<00:00:40.250> one<00:00:40.879> and<00:00:41.300> two<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.199> three<00:00:42.790> four<00:00:43.790> one<00:00:44.690> and

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
is one and two and three four one and

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:55.180 
is one and two and three four one and
two<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:45.949> three<00:00:46.010> four<00:00:47.559> 1234<00:00:50.979> okay<00:00:51.979> I<00:00:54.100> find<00:00:55.100> it

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
two and three four 1234 okay I find it

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.340 
two and three four 1234 okay I find it
very<00:00:55.250> very<00:00:55.489> useful<00:00:55.970> to<00:00:56.119> put<00:00:56.330> our<00:00:56.540> pieces

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
very very useful to put our pieces

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.890 
very very useful to put our pieces
together<00:00:57.739> slowly<00:00:58.220> but<00:00:58.489> surely<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.030> let's<00:00:59.600> try

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
together slowly but surely so let's try

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.719 
together slowly but surely so let's try
and<00:01:00.049> join<00:01:00.229> section<00:01:00.769> one<00:01:00.979> with<00:01:01.159> hopefully

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
and join section one with hopefully

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.060 
and join section one with hopefully
comfortable<00:01:02.210> with<00:01:02.330> now<00:01:02.510> into<00:01:03.440> into<00:01:03.890> bar

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
comfortable with now into into bar

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.850 
comfortable with now into into bar
number<00:01:04.309> two<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:05.000> let's<00:01:05.210> try<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:05.600> do<00:01:05.720> that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
number two and let's try and do that

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
number two and let's try and do that
three<00:01:06.860> four

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.029 

okay<00:01:22.810> so<00:01:22.869> that's<00:01:23.109> a<00:01:23.229> major<00:01:23.380> one<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:23.859> measure

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
okay so that's a major one and measure

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.090 
okay so that's a major one and measure
too<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.810> just<00:01:26.020> remember<00:01:26.140> they<00:01:26.469> time<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.890> for

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
too so just remember they time you for

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.590 
too so just remember they time you for
these<00:01:27.219> words<00:01:27.520> one<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.899> two<00:01:29.289> and<00:01:29.590> three<00:01:29.710> four

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
these words one and two and three four

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.139 
these words one and two and three four
and<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:33.130> new<00:01:33.369> measure<00:01:33.640> one<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:34.780> two<00:01:35.319> three

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
and this new measure one and two three

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.069 
and this new measure one and two three
four<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.950> basic<00:01:39.399> trying<00:01:39.729> with<00:01:40.149> in<00:01:40.299> sort<00:01:40.899> of<00:01:40.959> a

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
four so basic trying with in sort of a

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:54.740 
four so basic trying with in sort of a
melody<00:01:41.530> on<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.890> top<00:01:42.130> strings<00:01:42.490> now

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.740 

okay<00:01:55.750> once<00:01:56.110> again<00:01:56.440> clean<00:01:57.130> outs<00:01:57.400> now<00:01:58.150> squeaking

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
okay once again clean outs now squeaking

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.400 
okay once again clean outs now squeaking
and<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.050> bottom<00:01:59.350> string<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:01.690> in<00:02:02.050> flowing

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
and the bottom string and in flowing

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:10.250 
and the bottom string and in flowing
once<00:02:03.400> again<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:03.940> must<00:02:04.060> flour<00:02:04.450> dough<00:02:04.690> it<00:02:04.870> to<00:02:04.960> be

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.880 

wait<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.560> be<00:02:11.980> almost<00:02:12.360> one<00:02:13.360> phrase<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:14.680> don't

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
wait to be almost one phrase we don't

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.530 
wait to be almost one phrase we don't
want<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.070> be<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.580> any<00:02:15.670> kind<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.060> movement<00:02:16.209> up

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
want to be in any kind of movement up

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:28.940 
want to be in any kind of movement up
and<00:02:16.660> down<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.930> neck<00:02:17.020> for<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.290> listeners

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.650 

okay<00:02:29.950> once<00:02:30.400> we<00:02:30.550> get<00:02:30.640> more<00:02:30.820> of<00:02:30.940> this<00:02:31.060> down<00:02:31.300> or

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
okay once we get more of this down or

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.000 
okay once we get more of this down or
the<00:02:31.840> complete<00:02:32.170> piece<00:02:32.410> then<00:02:32.650> we'll<00:02:32.770> look<00:02:32.890> at

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
the complete piece then we'll look at

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.000 
the complete piece then we'll look at
dynamics<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.660> measure<00:02:34.900> 2<00:02:35.200> i'm<00:02:35.440> john
