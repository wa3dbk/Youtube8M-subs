00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.710
 Today I wanted something 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.730
 tell the guardian attitude that the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:18.680
 quail stall which had not built the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:23.160
 has dimensions of 1 meter wide 40 55 high 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.090
 I have the price pressure or food dish 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.929
 however there is the purely feed 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.650
 I hold six quails per cage 56 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.320
 quail 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.300
 I think that by the size and for the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.030
 number okay that is not 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.820
 Mass keeping no wire bow where 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.550
 the birds overrun 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.760
 I have you in the double floor 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.180
 can take off to clean 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.140
 here at Barthle sand comes home 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.300
 Buy and stick here 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.180
 was able to refer to there 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.630
 They usually also hold the eggs 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:13.049
 laid out floor with straw and 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:18.840
 sawdust are the way to get the water away 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:24.180
 here will have eaten then 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.000
 wings for me personally with the best 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.030
 for three years tinkering here and took 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.210
 the second floor the birds look 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.990
 feel good 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:43.649
 So I have no problems in there 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.149
 every day ten to eleven eggs for 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.649
 they eat pellets with me 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:53.250
 So put more pellets of 19% 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.649
 raw protein as green stuff you get 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.030
 dandelion is the dandelion with me 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:03.110
 grass what you prefer 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.900
 and now and then there are only times 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.170
 not a bit waste so with green stuff 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.560
 You should not exaggerate 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.250
 less is more then you can 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.140
 get diarrhea and 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.050
 Diarrheal diseases are deadly and 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.650
 that's why with caution 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:30.890
 they enjoy getting ready to run 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:34.060
 normal water and the size of the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.330
 You have to ask once a week 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.890
 cleanse behind big development so 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.660
 you see no one is scared the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.510
 movies of course need just beautiful too 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.489
 but sees cut here the form with 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.340
 the beautiful of the sun the much light 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:59.480
 you need yes one says 14 hours of light 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.569
 and 16 degrees outside temperature mean 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.769
 Birds are the usual swap for his 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:09.940
 and that's why there is daily 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.890
 fresh eggs at the feed conversion 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.380
 I had that last year because I've got 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.260
 I from normal mail on injury 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.459
 That's what I wanted so much on 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.049
 at the beginning there must be 50 50 mission on 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.870
 when you start the feed conversion 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.000
 otherwise they would be with the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.739
 and that could happen again 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.510
 take a few days to start again 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.310
 so if you have a feed conversion 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:42.440
 makes 50 50 mission so loud experience 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.510
 50 as normal for me and half 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.190
 the other half as pellets and then 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.160
 that works so synonymous take my birds 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.859
 That's good at this pellets and you have one 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.560
 no dust and, above all, they look 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.290
 then the fall in the food and the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.230
 then the most is a cage 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.280
 in it and that you do not want that one 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.580
 I want you to eat everything 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.810
 and that works with the fans super man 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.050
 It can also be a bit lucky for him 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.030
 usually do that with the feed 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.290
 contain 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.040
 that's why you do not necessarily have to 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:21.650
 if the birds but then 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.500
 I should get diarrhea now 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.010
 50 then you should know the list 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.770
 to give oatmeal 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.750
 that should do that away again and 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.100
 medications while meditating I am 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.160
 always a thing you want the 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.030
 That's why people like to eat something like that 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.850
 natural 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.210
 you can see the movies nice and friendly 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.450
 As I said you have no it is already 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.290
 a somewhat ethical attitude as if one 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.419
 the birds are running over books and 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.830
 they do not fight, no electricity is at stake 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.930
 nothing more and you can do that bit 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.889
 Too bad we have everything as said 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:08.130
 total thoughts on the water is accepted 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.710
 We are not elected when we ask 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.110
 just write 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.520
 I stand with advice and did the job 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.520
 Till then
