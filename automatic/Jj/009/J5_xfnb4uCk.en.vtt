00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
a set of clip-in extensions and I bought

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.619 
a set of clip-in extensions and I bought
the<00:00:46.500> ones<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:47.039> black<00:00:47.340> because<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.360> hair<00:00:48.539> is

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the ones in black because my hair is

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.720 
the ones in black because my hair is
really<00:00:48.840> black<00:00:49.200> there's<00:00:49.950> some<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.460> red

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
really black there's some like red

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
really black there's some like red
highlights<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> sunlight<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.530> it's

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
highlights in the sunlight but it's

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.830 
highlights in the sunlight but it's
mostly<00:00:53.100> black<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.270> matches<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
mostly black so I think this matches the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.869 
mostly black so I think this matches the
most<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> go<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.579> clip

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
most so I'm going to go with this clip

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.500 
most so I'm going to go with this clip
and<00:00:57.000> extension<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.649> hair<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.280> 100%<00:00:59.510> human

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.900 
and extension so this hair is 100% human
hair<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.559> love<00:01:01.859> human<00:01:02.370> hair<00:01:02.520> extensions

because<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.840> curl<00:01:04.470> them<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.979> can

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
because you can curl them you can

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
because you can curl them you can
straighten<00:01:05.640> them<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.390> anything<00:01:06.720> with

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
straighten them you can do anything with

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
straighten them you can do anything with
them<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:07.890> why<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> always<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:08.970> human

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
them so that's why I always go for human

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.570 
them so that's why I always go for human
extensions<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.040> why<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.549> little

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
extensions and that is why it's a little

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.090 
extensions and that is why it's a little
more<00:01:11.970> expensive<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.290> looks<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.770> real

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
more expensive but it looks really real

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.210 
more expensive but it looks really real
no<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.760> tell<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.619> own<00:01:16.860> hair

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
no one can tell if that's your own hair

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.780 
no one can tell if that's your own hair
or<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.790> extensions<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:19.460> this<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
or you have extensions on so this is

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.929 
or you have extensions on so this is
about<00:01:21.150> 18<00:01:21.659> inches<00:01:21.689> long<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:23.310> usually<00:01:23.520> buy

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
about 18 inches long and I usually buy

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.899 
about 18 inches long and I usually buy
18<00:01:24.330> interest<00:01:24.720> cuz<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.920> around<00:01:26.610> my

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
18 interest cuz that's just around my

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.030 
18 interest cuz that's just around my

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040
