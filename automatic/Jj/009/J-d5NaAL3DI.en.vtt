00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.520 
head that I want to come out in the
record<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.540> always<00:02:21.690> start<00:02:21.840> from<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.200> point

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
record so always start from that point

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.589 
record so always start from that point
of<00:02:22.650> view<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.920> then<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.129> find<00:02:23.400> songs<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.060> try<00:02:24.540> to

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
of view and then I find songs and try to

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.030 
of view and then I find songs and try to
find<00:02:24.750> well<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.140> sound<00:02:25.349> fits<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> song<00:02:25.890> and

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
find well this sound fits the song and

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.410 
find well this sound fits the song and
then<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:26.220> evolves<00:02:26.520> as<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:26.970> get<00:02:27.090> into<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
then it evolves as you get into the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.000 
then it evolves as you get into the
studio<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.080> get<00:02:28.260> into<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.560> studio<00:02:28.739> with

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
studio and you get into the studio with

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.800 
studio and you get into the studio with
these<00:02:29.220> great<00:02:29.459> musicians<00:02:29.610> who<00:02:30.150> play

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
these great musicians who play

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.240 
these great musicians who play
fantastically<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.950> start

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
fantastically and you start

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.740 
fantastically and you start
brainstorming<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:33.120> things<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.540> start

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
brainstorming on things and you start

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.660 
brainstorming on things and you start
playing<00:02:33.870> these<00:02:34.170> songs<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.739> then<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.430> sort<00:02:35.550> of

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
playing these songs and then it sort of

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.180 
playing these songs and then it sort of
grows<00:02:36.000> into<00:02:36.330> its<00:02:36.569> own<00:02:36.750> sort<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.140> thing<00:02:37.769> after

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
grows into its own sort of thing after

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.699 
grows into its own sort of thing after
that<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.970> think<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.510> first<00:02:40.080> song<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.440> we

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
that and I think the first song that we

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.250 
that and I think the first song that we
cut<00:02:41.010> was<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> song<00:02:41.550> called<00:02:41.819> dust<00:02:42.300> on<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:43.140> new

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
cut was a song called dust on the new

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.800 
cut was a song called dust on the new
album<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:44.099> it<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.370> sort<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.610> laid<00:02:44.879> down<00:02:45.180> just

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
album and it just sort of laid down just

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.740 
album and it just sort of laid down just
a<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.349> know<00:02:46.739> sonically<00:02:47.430> an<00:02:47.760> attitude<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.360> this

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
a I know sonically an attitude that this

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.210 
a I know sonically an attitude that this
record<00:02:49.110> was<00:02:49.200> going<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:49.920> think<00:02:50.129> the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
record was going to have and I think the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.589 
record was going to have and I think the
rest<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.580> record<00:02:50.910> sort<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.180> followed<00:02:51.480> that

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
rest of the record sort of followed that

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.979 
rest of the record sort of followed that
attitude<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.319> there's<00:02:53.069> a<00:02:53.129> lot<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.370> different

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
attitude and there's a lot of different

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.300 
attitude and there's a lot of different

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.250 
the landscape of my career you'll see a
broad<00:03:02.489> variety<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:03.000> music<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.870> i<00:03:03.959> think<00:03:04.019> on

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
broad variety of music that i think on
