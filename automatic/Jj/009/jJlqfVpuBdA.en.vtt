00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.350

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.400

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.940
 as for our services 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.440
 we have 89 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.590
 when he was mclaren-mercedes boss click on the button 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.030
 start 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.740
 palermo is online 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.110
 at bundaberg 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.220
 until an armed robbery 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.920
 for the others 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.750
 Clermont met him 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.420
 to conclude I want them to have entered Wednesday without pressure we have 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.920
 can not wait for it to turn 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.159
 that was the same time as his counter 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.159
 the tropics and on actions 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.639

 I love animals 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.979
 this is said 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.339
 for its hundredth stabilization 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.899
 but more 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.059
 so we must not be wrong what remains to be done 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.119
 even without a shot 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.030

 do not saturate compare for example already reported

 the caliber of 1430 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:46.049
 so in fact it's mostly a late match so far point to follow 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.169
 now you have to go over the question 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.419
