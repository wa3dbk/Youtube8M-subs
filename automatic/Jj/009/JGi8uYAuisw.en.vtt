Republicans and Democrats and everybody

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.880 
Republicans and Democrats and everybody
like<00:01:58.539> Pete's<00:01:58.899> in<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.229> world<00:01:59.439> it's<00:01:59.710> that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
like Pete's in the world it's that

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.429 
like Pete's in the world it's that
simple<00:02:00.220> like<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.909> good<00:02:01.240> economy<00:02:01.630> does<00:02:02.200> make<00:02:02.409> a

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
simple like a good economy does make a

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.779 
simple like a good economy does make a
difference<00:02:02.770> whether<00:02:03.009> you're<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.250> Democrat<00:02:03.280> a

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
difference whether you're a Democrat a

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.449 
difference whether you're a Democrat a
Republican<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:05.380> think<00:02:05.649> he's<00:02:05.799> talked<00:02:06.220> that

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
Republican and I think he's talked that

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.180 
Republican and I think he's talked that
way<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:07.000> think<00:02:07.479> Republicans<00:02:08.200> now<00:02:08.440> believe<00:02:08.979> he's

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
way I think Republicans now believe he's

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.119 
way I think Republicans now believe he's
going<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.489> be<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:09.910> way
