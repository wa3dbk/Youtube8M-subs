00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.860
 hello tv spectators welcome 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.160
 on the second day the frankfurter 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.110
 Musikmesse 2014 you at the stand of the 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.240
 accord and I am very happy that it 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.130
 a follower gives for the fertilizer 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.540
 core tm 12 probably the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.210
 Most already knows from the field 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.280
 jÃ¼rgen there's something new one excel 12 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.350
 yes, it took a while 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.430
 all the more but it has to be completely 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.039
 especially much effort we have given 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.870
 created a new monitor in the thin 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:40.130
 chord world has long waited for that 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.520
 fertilizer cortex m 12 is 111 monitor with 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.510
 a coax rufer 12 inches coax shore the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.360
 also in its efficiency 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.739
 clearly above the predecessor light and 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.850
 Of course we used everything 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.460
 we in our house in technology 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.020
 dominate in this great monitor 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.390
 now to install what you have today 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.219
 We always have to build a self 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.930
 port box without display we should not 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.370
 do more because the user has to 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.290
 really fast and easy to use 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.759
 Can and this slide switch cinema 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.680
 what had previously always kept as 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.079
 we do not want any more so we have that 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.240
 aleks m exactly what equipped 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.829
 we expect a display where 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.020
 we stop all sorts of things 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.520
 can make a two way self- power 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.859
 Monitor can offer how to get different 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.119
 presets we even have a preset like 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.279
 a monitor should sound when 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.679
 guitarist he has presets for us 

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:26.689
 Delay application if you are in one 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.149
 high stand situation like here a very 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.829
 Good country poured around it on the tripod 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.409
 to put yes we also have in 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.329
 this case so he positioned if 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.789
 the box on the tripod is I think 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.600
 looks very very sexy and 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.509
 Nevertheless 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.119
 all possibilities of setting at the 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.570
 Side does not allow down or anyhow 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.400
 behind 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.100
 that works great that 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.869
 The idea behind it was a coaxial one 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.610
 to build it smaller and smaller 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.500
 compact to brands compactness and 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.899
 weight play an increasingly important role 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.820
 and we stayed under 15 kilos with 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.680
 this monitor in this 12 inch 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.610
 Variation that's a great thing 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.070
 and that's exactly what ours is 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.090
 The user group wants to want one 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.310
 powerful lightweight cabinet 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.289
 with the possibilities sometimes as full 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.150
 Range to work on a book tripod 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.280
 or maybe in processions too 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.260
 manage as the old one could 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.610
 the different inputs are managed 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.410
 can we have two come the boxes 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.790
 to enter the possibility of change 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.650
 we can do this triangle 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.420
 Of course we can also signal that 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.400
 send out signal we can do that too 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.630
 simply forward the signal and we 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.920
 have the possibilities of 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.420
 smart dsps quite a few processes 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.769
 in things I now in detail so 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.120
 can not explain now but it should 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.560
 Everybody just try it out 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.299
 funny so scope 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.280
 actually from the monitoring for musicians 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.110
 towards a multimedia box with cinch 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.700
 input someone made presentation then 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.690
 is it also yes there is a whole 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.549
 simple example that nowadays 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.019
 maybe it's always difficult though 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.489
 say we have a marathon run 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.090
 to a small stretch up 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.470
 become 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.450
 then you come with a lot of power amplifiers 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.070
 quite a lot of digital controllers and quite 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.380
 many xlr cables or one takes completely 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.910
 many km 12 and said the first will be 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.560
 built up crawl signal 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.480
 It will then be on this signal 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.070
 the teachers I give up against a hundred 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.930
 meter further at the next on each 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.640
 after what the track allows to the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.310
 teacher continues to go on 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.890
 Continue to finish the installation or 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.500
 at least here marathon runners online 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.200
 mobile applications to the musician 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.130
 supply be accurately already available 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.900
 We probably will in two weeks 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.950
 we have available we are yes 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.420
 actually in the claim that this 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.010
 want to have betrayed everything immediately 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.630
 but does not always work with the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.670
 date of the music fair may be over the 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.940
 speak price yes we may cost 1000 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.530
 69 euros including vat 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.640
 as recommended retail price 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.020
 Thank you so much always somehow 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.910
 Precisely , we have nothing else 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.320
 booked and if you want more 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.920
 Questions have to be answered 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.110
 should 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.110
