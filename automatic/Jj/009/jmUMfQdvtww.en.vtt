00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
certain amount of experience but you

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.230 
certain amount of experience but you
don't<00:00:16.770> want<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.980> add<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.340> much<00:00:17.490> water<00:00:17.850> that's

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
don't want to add so much water that's

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.769 
don't want to add so much water that's
just<00:00:18.570> creating<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.289> very<00:00:19.500> soupy<00:00:20.070> mix<00:00:20.600> but<00:00:21.600> then

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
just creating a very soupy mix but then

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.109 
just creating a very soupy mix but then
you<00:00:21.930> don't<00:00:22.170> want<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.830> stiff<00:00:23.340> either<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:24.060> know

on a really tight enough water so

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.380 
on a really tight enough water so
usually<00:00:26.609> what<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.420> use<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> hose<00:00:29.390> and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
usually what I do is just use a hose and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.200 
usually what I do is just use a hose and
I<00:00:30.510> my<00:00:30.689> next<00:00:31.109> tip<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.529> only<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.489> little<00:00:33.059> bit

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
I my next tip I only have a little bit

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:43.060 
I my next tip I only have a little bit
of<00:00:33.300> water<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:35.090> mix<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.780> basically<00:00:41.329> as<00:00:42.329> you

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
of water I mix it and basically as you

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.340 
of water I mix it and basically as you
get<00:00:44.070> closer<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:45.120> theirs<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.170> have

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
get closer to theirs you think you have

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.150 
get closer to theirs you think you have
enough<00:00:46.379> water<00:00:47.390> less<00:00:48.390> water<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.230> time<00:00:52.160> but

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
enough water less water and the time but

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.840 
enough water less water and the time but
don't<00:00:53.399> worry<00:00:53.960> if<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.350> end<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:56.039> too<00:00:56.340> soupy

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
don't worry if you end up with too soupy

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.849 
don't worry if you end up with too soupy
a<00:00:56.879> mix<00:00:57.149> too<00:00:57.360> much<00:00:57.539> water<00:00:57.809> mm-hmm<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.739> you've

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
a mix too much water mm-hmm and you've

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.069 
a mix too much water mm-hmm and you've
got<00:00:59.039> more<00:00:59.219> too<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.180> got<00:01:00.329> more<00:01:00.510> concrete

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
got more too and you got more concrete

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.030 
got more too and you got more concrete
handy<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.559> always<00:01:01.890> add<00:01:02.039> more<00:01:02.070> concrete

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
handy you can always add more concrete

the<00:02:23.470> concrete<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:24.130> took<00:02:24.310> more<00:02:24.670> than<00:02:24.730> four<00:02:24.880> bags

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
the concrete it took more than four bags

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.650 
the concrete it took more than four bags
for<00:02:25.750> 40-pound<00:02:26.290> bags<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.800> fill<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.270> 16<00:02:28.270> inches

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
for 40-pound bags to fill this 16 inches

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.449 
for 40-pound bags to fill this 16 inches
wide<00:02:28.930> about<00:02:29.350> four<00:02:29.620> inches<00:02:30.040> four<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> half

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
inches high and 33 inches long i guess

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.710 
inches high and 33 inches long i guess
so<00:02:35.980> took<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.190> little<00:02:36.400> longer<00:02:36.670> than<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.239> little

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
so took a little longer than a little

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.750 
so took a little longer than a little
more<00:02:37.900> concrete<00:02:38.170> than<00:02:38.380> i<00:02:38.560> thought<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:38.800> would<00:02:38.980> so

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
more concrete than i thought it would so

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.199 
more concrete than i thought it would so
now<00:02:39.940> once<00:02:40.810> it's<00:02:40.989> all<00:02:41.170> in<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:42.430> want<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.760> mix<00:02:42.910> up

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.550 
top of the concrete so see but I'm a
little<00:03:19.980> over<00:03:20.160> here<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.610> corner<00:03:21.560> that'll

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
little over here in the corner that'll

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.530 
little over here in the corner that'll
add<00:03:22.709> just<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.160> little<00:03:23.190> more<00:03:23.610> concrete<00:03:26.510> sit<00:03:27.510> in

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
add just a little more concrete sit in

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.309 
add just a little more concrete sit in
with<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.049> rest<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.500> concrete<00:03:30.319> it's

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
with the rest of the concrete it's

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.750 
with the rest of the concrete it's
already<00:03:33.079> see<00:03:34.079> we<00:03:34.230> might<00:03:34.379> be<00:03:34.590> liable<00:03:35.129> little

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
already see we might be liable little

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.930 
already see we might be liable little
slow<00:03:36.150> over<00:03:36.480> here<00:03:40.129> and<00:03:41.129> I'm<00:03:41.250> going<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.519> strike

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
slow over here and I'm going to strike

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.339 
slow over here and I'm going to strike
off<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.450> top<00:03:44.269> this<00:03:45.269> will<00:03:45.480> help<00:03:45.629> smooth<00:03:46.109> off

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
off the top this will help smooth off

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.839 
off the top this will help smooth off
the<00:03:46.590> top<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:46.859> also<00:03:47.420> consolidate<00:03:49.700> concrete<00:03:50.700> at

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
the top and also consolidate concrete at

00:03:50.849 --> 00:04:04.860 
the top and also consolidate concrete at
the<00:03:50.970> top

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:17.160 

except<00:04:05.870> for<00:04:06.410> in<00:04:07.220> order<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:12.730> hello<00:04:14.410> come<00:04:15.410> back

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
except for in order to hello come back

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.319 
except for in order to hello come back
just<00:04:18.170> give<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.530> little<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.769> few<00:04:19.040> taps<00:04:19.329> that

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
just give it a little a few taps that

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.960 
just give it a little a few taps that
way<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.630> concrete<00:04:21.350> any<00:04:21.680> bubbles<00:04:22.400> that<00:04:22.610> are<00:04:22.670> on

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
way to concrete any bubbles that are on

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.770 
way to concrete any bubbles that are on
the<00:04:23.120> face<00:04:23.360> is<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:24.290> one<00:04:27.940> who's<00:04:28.940> there<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.600> air

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
the face is the one who's there the air

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.460 
the face is the one who's there the air
will<00:04:29.930> come<00:04:30.140> out<00:04:31.420> and<00:04:32.420> it'll<00:04:32.750> consolidate

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
will come out and it'll consolidate

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.710 
will come out and it'll consolidate
concrete<00:04:34.070> on<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.340> face<00:04:37.150> so<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.180> think<00:04:38.390> that's

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
concrete on the face so I think that's

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.580 
concrete on the face so I think that's
about<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:39.050> for<00:04:39.260> now<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.980> little<00:04:40.670> later<00:04:41.590> when

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
about it for now a little later when

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.460 
about it for now a little later when
it's<00:04:42.880> setting<00:04:43.880> up<00:04:44.060> I'll<00:04:44.750> come<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:45.350> I'll

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
it's setting up I'll come and I'll

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.380 
it's setting up I'll come and I'll
smooth<00:04:46.010> it<00:04:46.130> out<00:04:46.280> a<00:04:46.340> little<00:04:46.610> more<00:04:46.880> what's<00:04:47.180> it

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
smooth it out a little more what's it

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.730 
smooth it out a little more what's it
setting<00:04:47.750> up<00:04:47.900> just<00:04:48.169> give<00:04:48.320> it<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.590> little

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
setting up just give it a little

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.920 
setting up just give it a little
smoother<00:04:49.280> finish<00:04:49.490> on<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:50.000> with<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:50.390> trowel<00:04:50.720> and

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
smoother finish on the with a trowel and

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.900 
smoother finish on the with a trowel and
effect<00:04:51.290> on<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.560> top<00:04:52.240> all<00:04:53.240> right<00:04:53.419> yeah
