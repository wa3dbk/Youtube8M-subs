back<00:00:09.630> up<00:00:09.840> on<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.140> generator<00:00:10.590> elbow

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
back up on the generator elbow

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.330 
back up on the generator elbow
and<00:00:11.760> everything<00:00:12.180> and<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.900> did<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:13.920> running

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
and everything and I did have it running

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.280 
and everything and I did have it running
a<00:00:14.460> little<00:00:14.700> bit<00:00:14.820> ago<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.360> bled<00:00:15.840> all<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> air<00:00:16.260> out

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
a little bit ago I bled all the air out

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.500 
a little bit ago I bled all the air out
of<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> injection<00:00:17.070> pump<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.520> stuff<00:00:17.760> from

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
of the injection pump and stuff from

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.210 
of the injection pump and stuff from
when<00:00:18.689> I<00:00:18.750> had<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.080> apart<00:00:19.380> doing<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.800> bearings

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
when I had it apart doing the bearings

00:00:20.220 --> 00:01:54.020 
when I had it apart doing the bearings
so<00:00:21.349> I'll<00:00:22.349> fire<00:00:22.770> it<00:00:22.800> up

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.550 

there's<00:01:55.030> still<00:01:55.240> some<00:01:55.540> bearing<00:01:55.930> noise<00:01:56.110> but

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
there's still some bearing noise but

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.180 
there's still some bearing noise but
this<00:01:56.740> time<00:01:57.010> it's<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.400> generator<00:01:59.070> sounds<00:02:00.070> like

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
this time it's a generator sounds like

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.650 
this time it's a generator sounds like
that<00:02:00.370> one<00:02:00.550> mighty<00:02:00.730> got<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> little<00:02:01.240> rusty<00:02:01.570> at

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
that one mighty got a little rusty at

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.530 
that one mighty got a little rusty at
one<00:02:01.810> time<00:02:02.080> too<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.790> I<00:02:03.820> guess<00:02:04.120> that'll<00:02:04.420> be<00:02:04.510> a

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
one time too and so I guess that'll be a

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:17.380 
one time too and so I guess that'll be a
project<00:02:05.080> for<00:02:05.260> another<00:02:05.500> day<00:02:05.770> but<00:02:06.550> alrighty

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.450 

you
