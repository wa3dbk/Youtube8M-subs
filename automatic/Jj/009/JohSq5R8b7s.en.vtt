temporary addendum as you can see it's

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.160 
temporary addendum as you can see it's
been<00:02:12.010> clearly<00:02:12.430> backwards<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.510> catches<00:02:14.049> in

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
been clearly backwards and catches in

been clearly backwards and catches in
the<00:02:14.260> forward<00:02:14.620> direction<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.959> funny

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
the forward direction and the funny

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.750 
the forward direction and the funny
thing<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.769> put<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.010> on<00:02:18.190> backwards<00:02:18.580> when

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
thing is is I put this on backwards when

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.509 
thing is is I put this on backwards when
I<00:02:18.790> left<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.120> at<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.269> store<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.569> begin<00:02:19.780> with<00:02:20.519> yes
