okay this is the latest update on the
CNC<00:00:03.860> build<00:00:04.930> from<00:00:05.930> the<00:00:06.049> previous<00:00:06.439> videos

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
CNC build from the previous videos

CNC build from the previous videos
you'll<00:00:07.009> remember<00:00:07.279> the<00:00:07.609> water-cooled<00:00:08.090> spindle

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:09.009 
you'll remember the water-cooled spindle

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.940 
you'll remember the water-cooled spindle
just<00:00:10.009> made<00:00:10.639> a<00:00:10.969> couple<00:00:11.150> of<00:00:11.240> changes<00:00:11.299> here

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
just made a couple of changes here

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.740 
just made a couple of changes here
rather<00:00:12.950> than<00:00:13.040> feeding<00:00:13.370> it<00:00:13.549> from<00:00:13.820> an<00:00:14.389> external

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
rather than feeding it from an external

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.830 
rather than feeding it from an external
fish<00:00:15.379> tank<00:00:15.650> pump<00:00:16.060> i've<00:00:17.060> actually<00:00:17.300> rigged<00:00:17.660> up

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
fish tank pump i've actually rigged up

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.439 
fish tank pump i've actually rigged up
what<00:00:18.830> was<00:00:19.039> a<00:00:19.070> drink<00:00:19.970> bottle<00:00:21.250> a<00:00:22.250> little

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
what was a drink bottle a little

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.880 
what was a drink bottle a little
radiator<00:00:23.529> with<00:00:24.529> a<00:00:25.010> 4-inch<00:00:25.699> fan<00:00:25.970> behind<00:00:26.330> it<00:00:26.890> and

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
radiator with a 4-inch fan behind it and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.990 
radiator with a 4-inch fan behind it and
a<00:00:28.369> tiny<00:00:28.580> little<00:00:28.929> centrifugal<00:00:29.929> pump<00:00:30.640> so<00:00:31.640> we've

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
a tiny little centrifugal pump so we've

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.360 
a tiny little centrifugal pump so we've
got<00:00:32.210> output<00:00:33.640> into<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:34.730> pump<00:00:35.980> off<00:00:36.980> to<00:00:37.280> the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
got output into the pump off to the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.090 
got output into the pump off to the
spindle<00:00:38.950> returned<00:00:39.950> from<00:00:40.130> the<00:00:40.250> spindle

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
spindle returned from the spindle

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.480 
spindle returned from the spindle
radiator<00:00:43.780> yeah

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
radiator yeah

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.820 
radiator yeah
and<00:00:46.490> back<00:00:46.780> so<00:00:47.780> I<00:00:47.840> got<00:00:47.990> a<00:00:48.020> total<00:00:48.170> volume<00:00:48.410> of

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
and back so I got a total volume of

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.070 
and back so I got a total volume of
probably<00:00:49.460> less<00:00:49.670> than<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.910> liter

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
probably less than a liter

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.220 
probably less than a liter
it's<00:00:51.710> just<00:00:51.950> water<00:00:52.660> probably<00:00:53.660> changed<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.020> some

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
it's just water probably changed to some

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.690 
it's just water probably changed to some
decent<00:00:54.530> coolant<00:00:54.890> but<00:00:55.010> it's<00:00:55.190> just<00:00:55.280> water<00:00:55.550> at

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
decent coolant but it's just water at

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.130 
decent coolant but it's just water at
the<00:00:55.760> moment<00:00:55.790> with<00:00:56.180> some<00:00:56.330> green<00:00:56.540> food<00:00:56.780> dye<00:00:56.840> in

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
the moment with some green food dye in

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.380 
the moment with some green food dye in
it<00:00:57.460> so<00:00:58.460> if<00:00:59.300> I<00:00:59.480> fire<00:01:00.020> up<00:01:00.760> you<00:01:01.760> should<00:01:02.000> be<00:01:02.090> able<00:01:02.210> to

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
it so if I fire up you should be able to

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.630 
it so if I fire up you should be able to
see<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.690> lines<00:01:02.930> actually<00:01:03.230> Prime<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:04.430> then

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
see the lines actually Prime and then

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.720 
see the lines actually Prime and then
the<00:01:04.730> pump<00:01:04.910> run

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.550 

oh<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:11.680> we<00:01:11.800> go<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:13.390> that's<00:01:13.540> it

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
oh there we go and that's it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.420 
oh there we go and that's it
strategy<00:01:16.549> nicely<00:01:16.909> back<00:01:17.090> into<00:01:17.329> the<00:01:17.479> movie<00:01:18.320> ball

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.570 

and<00:01:23.000> then<00:01:23.210> switch<00:01:23.510> her<00:01:23.690> off<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:28.340> should

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
and then switch her off and you should

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.300 
and then switch her off and you should
just<00:01:28.700> be<00:01:28.820> able<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.180> see<00:01:29.450> there<00:01:29.690> is<00:01:29.720> it<00:01:30.310> siphons

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
just be able to see there is it siphons

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.820 
just be able to see there is it siphons
back<00:01:32.080> doesn't<00:01:33.080> seem<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.380> present<00:01:33.680> any

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
back doesn't seem to present any

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.430 
back doesn't seem to present any
problems<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:36.850> there<00:01:37.850> we<00:01:37.940> go<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:38.870> no<00:01:39.050> more<00:01:39.170> big

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
problems and there we go so no more big

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.080 
problems and there we go so no more big
external<00:01:39.890> water<00:01:40.040> tank<00:01:40.340> it's<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.550> closed<00:01:40.760> system

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
external water tank it's a closed system

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.140 
external water tank it's a closed system
so<00:01:41.300> no<00:01:42.140> loss<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.610> don't<00:01:43.670> have<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.000> worry

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
so no loss and I don't have to worry

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.480 
so no loss and I don't have to worry
about<00:01:44.300> dealing<00:01:44.810> swarf<00:01:45.260> or<00:01:45.560> sawdust<00:01:46.370> or

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
about dealing swarf or sawdust or

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.610 
about dealing swarf or sawdust or
anything<00:01:46.640> finishing<00:01:47.090> up<00:01:47.210> in<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.260> court

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.070 

second<00:01:51.620> change<00:01:52.510> had<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.540> bit<00:01:53.690> of<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.810> discussion

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
second change had a bit of a discussion

second change had a bit of a discussion
regarding<00:01:54.619> had<00:01:55.160> he<00:01:55.250> exiled<00:01:55.700> shop-vac<00:01:56.360> well

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
regarding had he exiled shop-vac well

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.080 
regarding had he exiled shop-vac well
the<00:01:57.410> simple<00:01:57.740> answer<00:01:57.800> was<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.700> stick<00:01:58.910> it<00:01:59.000> in

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
the simple answer was you stick it in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.020 
the simple answer was you stick it in
another<00:01:59.300> room<00:01:59.740> so<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.890> shop<00:02:01.040> vacs<00:02:01.310> kneel<00:02:01.550> on

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
another room so the shop vacs kneel on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.510 
another room so the shop vacs kneel on
the<00:02:02.390> other<00:02:02.510> side<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:02.960> wall<00:02:04.570> feeding<00:02:05.570> in

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
the other side of the wall feeding in

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.690 
the other side of the wall feeding in
cyclone<00:02:07.520> extractor<00:02:08.060> man<00:02:09.050> is<00:02:09.229> underneath<00:02:09.700> and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
cyclone extractor man is underneath and

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.000 
cyclone extractor man is underneath and
then<00:02:11.920> running<00:02:12.920> up<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:14.200> ready<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.320> go<00:02:15.500> down
