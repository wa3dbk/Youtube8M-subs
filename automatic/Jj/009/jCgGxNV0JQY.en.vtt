PVC pipe which represents our y-axis and
our<00:00:09.840> x-axis<00:00:10.730> you<00:00:11.730> call<00:00:11.940> from<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.210> board<00:00:12.450> we've

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
our x-axis you call from the board we've

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.540 
our x-axis you call from the board we've
got<00:00:12.929> quadrant<00:00:13.469> 1<00:00:14.130> 2<00:00:14.610> 3<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.719> 4<00:00:16.430> however<00:00:17.430> we're

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
got quadrant 1 2 3 and 4 however we're

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.070 
got quadrant 1 2 3 and 4 however we're
going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.730> flip<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:17.970> around<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.810> face

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
going to flip it around so I can face

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.830 
going to flip it around so I can face
the<00:00:19.230> camera<00:00:19.910> which<00:00:20.910> will<00:00:21.060> make<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.359> quadrant

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the camera which will make this quadrant

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.380 
the camera which will make this quadrant
1<00:00:22.080> 2<00:00:22.650> 3<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.730> 4<00:00:24.830> now<00:00:25.830> pay<00:00:26.430> close<00:00:26.699> attention

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
1 2 3 and 4 now pay close attention

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.540

furthermore<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:07.080> spoke<00:01:07.320> about<00:01:07.470> earlier<00:01:07.560> by

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
furthermore as we spoke about earlier by

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.030 
furthermore as we spoke about earlier by
rotation<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.549> lacking<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:10.260> turn<00:01:10.380> away<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
rotation is lacking I can turn away and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160 
rotation is lacking I can turn away and
send<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.030> right<00:01:12.240> shoulder<00:01:12.570> back<00:01:12.750> that's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
send this right shoulder back that's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.899 
send this right shoulder back that's
going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.409> be<00:01:13.650> good<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:14.430> more<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.850> more

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
going to be good I get more and more

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.120 
going to be good I get more and more
narrow<00:01:15.180> harder<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.869> harder<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.200> hit<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.590> my

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
narrow harder and harder to hit as my

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.789 
narrow harder and harder to hit as my
target<00:01:17.549> area<00:01:17.790> gets<00:01:17.939> smaller<00:01:18.799> unfortunately

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
target area gets smaller unfortunately

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.249 
target area gets smaller unfortunately
i'm<00:01:20.009> taking<00:01:20.400> rotation<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> left<00:01:21.780> hand<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
further back from the action which means

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.230 
further back from the action which means
it's<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.280> take<00:01:26.430> longer<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.790> longer<00:01:26.939> for

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
it's going to take longer and longer for

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.670 
it's going to take longer and longer for
it<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> come<00:01:27.540> around<00:01:27.720> giving<00:01:28.229> my<00:01:28.320> opponent
