want<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.460> go<00:02:22.610> bigger<00:02:23.120> which<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:23.960> my<00:02:24.140> bigger

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
want to go bigger which so my bigger

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.800 
want to go bigger which so my bigger
transformers<00:02:25.220> I'll<00:02:26.120> show<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.420> quick<00:02:26.600> trick

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
transformers I'll show you a quick trick

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.950 
transformers I'll show you a quick trick
and<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.710> would<00:02:27.890> go<00:02:28.070> this<00:02:28.430> way<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:28.730> take<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
and I would go this way so take the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.410 
and I would go this way so take the
bracket<00:02:30.410> pieces<00:02:30.830> we<00:02:31.040> have<00:02:31.280> these<00:02:31.760> guys<00:02:32.090> and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
bracket pieces we have these guys and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.380 
bracket pieces we have these guys and
put<00:02:33.350> one<00:02:33.740> on<00:02:33.860> each<00:02:33.890> side<00:02:34.010> like<00:02:34.520> this<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.030> then

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
put one on each side like this and then

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.230 
put one on each side like this and then
get<00:02:35.630> another<00:02:35.840> one<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:37.160> put<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.460> on<00:02:37.580> top<00:02:37.850> and

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
get another one and put it on top and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.950 
get another one and put it on top and
then<00:02:38.900> get<00:02:39.310> like<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.340> one<00:02:40.670> by<00:02:40.850> two<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.450> put<00:02:41.900> it

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
then get like a one by two and put it

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.460 
then get like a one by two and put it
here

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
here

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.740 
here
and<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:43.190> gives<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.580> almost<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:44.120> Travis<00:02:44.480> brick

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
and that gives you almost a Travis brick

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.230 
and that gives you almost a Travis brick
but<00:02:44.990> now<00:02:45.170> your<00:02:45.410> two<00:02:46.130> by<00:02:46.340> two<00:02:46.400> on<00:02:46.580> every<00:02:46.880> side

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
but now your two by two on every side

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.450 
but now your two by two on every side
instead<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.960> one<00:02:48.140> by<00:02:48.290> one<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.800> then<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.310> can

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
instead of one by one and then you can

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.170 
instead of one by one and then you can
work<00:02:49.670> as<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.390> model<00:02:50.770> build<00:02:51.770> onto<00:02:52.190> there<00:02:52.460> so<00:02:53.090> you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
work as a model build onto there so you

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.510 
work as a model build onto there so you
can<00:02:53.420> do<00:02:53.510> things<00:02:53.810> like<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.620> like<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:54.980> do<00:02:55.250> this

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
can do things like I like to do this

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.810 
can do things like I like to do this
like<00:02:55.880> put<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.180> mouth<00:02:56.420> guard<00:02:56.450> on<00:02:56.900> sort<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.820> you

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
like put a mouth guard on sort of you

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.510 
like put a mouth guard on sort of you
can<00:02:58.970> make<00:02:59.120> eyes<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:02.180> know<00:03:02.300> use<00:03:03.520> translucent

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
can make eyes you know use translucent

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.170 
can make eyes you know use translucent
pieces<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.920> can<00:03:07.040> get<00:03:07.190> really<00:03:07.489> creative<00:03:07.790> of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
pieces you can get really creative of

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.680 
pieces you can get really creative of
what<00:03:08.330> you're<00:03:08.450> going<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.630> do<00:03:08.780> here<00:03:10.209> you<00:03:11.209> can<00:03:11.420> put

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
you know you can detail up the sides

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.820 
you know you can detail up the sides
kind<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.310> things<00:03:16.760> like<00:03:16.850> this<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.510> or<00:03:18.350> any<00:03:18.530> kind

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
kind of things like this on or any kind

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.140 
kind of things like this on or any kind
of<00:03:18.860> piece<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.250> want<00:03:19.520> you<00:03:19.730> know<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.880> could<00:03:20.060> do

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
things like this you can make more

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.470 
things like this you can make more
antennae<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:25.700> know<00:03:25.820> something<00:03:26.209> like<00:03:26.330> an

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
antennae I you know something like an

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.660 
antennae I you know something like an
Optimus<00:03:26.870> Prime<00:03:27.260> looking<00:03:27.860> head<00:03:28.100> something

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
Optimus Prime looking head something

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.910 
Optimus Prime looking head something
like<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:30.140> can<00:03:30.320> put<00:03:30.350> all<00:03:30.530> kinds<00:03:30.560> of

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
like this you can put all kinds of

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.640 
like this you can put all kinds of
things<00:03:31.160> on<00:03:31.340> on<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:31.940> head<00:03:32.180> gear<00:03:32.600> if<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.470> don't

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
things on on the head gear if you don't

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.920 
things on on the head gear if you don't
want<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:33.920> face<00:03:34.220> card<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:35.090> always<00:03:35.270> go<00:03:35.630> and

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
want a face card you can always go and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.550 
want a face card you can always go and
this<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.800> one<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.100> tricks<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:37.489> use<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.820> lot

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
this is one of the tricks I use a lot

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.699 
this is one of the tricks I use a lot
you<00:03:39.560> put<00:03:39.860> on<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.610> jumper<00:03:40.970> plate<00:03:41.239> like<00:03:41.630> that

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
you put on the jumper plate like that

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.050 
you put on the jumper plate like that
get<00:03:42.709> one<00:03:42.890> of<00:03:42.980> these<00:03:43.100> pieces<00:03:43.459> with<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.820> ratchet

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
get one of these pieces with the ratchet

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.810 
get one of these pieces with the ratchet
it<00:03:44.720> makes<00:03:44.900> kind<00:03:45.080> of<00:03:45.230> like<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.380> nose<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:46.100> then

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
it makes kind of like a nose and then

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.970 
it makes kind of like a nose and then
get<00:03:47.120> like<00:03:47.360> a<00:03:47.390> cheese<00:03:47.780> slope<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:50.239> then<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:50.540> get

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
get like a cheese slope and then you get

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.280 
get like a cheese slope and then you get
ahead<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.459> that's<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.480> basis<00:03:53.900> for<00:03:53.930> like

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
ahead and that's the basis for like

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.140 
ahead and that's the basis for like
Megatron<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:55.040> things<00:03:55.280> like<00:03:55.459> that<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:56.060> these

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
Megatron and things like that so these

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.790 
Megatron and things like that so these
again<00:03:56.390> these<00:03:56.540> are<00:03:56.690> just<00:03:56.750> some<00:03:57.050> basic<00:03:57.080> ideas

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
again these are just some basic ideas

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.550 
again these are just some basic ideas
obviously<00:03:58.040> armor<00:03:58.760> up<00:03:58.880> helmet<00:03:59.480> I<00:03:59.660> mean<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.410> can

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
obviously armor up helmet I mean I can

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.430 
obviously armor up helmet I mean I can
do<00:04:00.650> all<00:04:00.860> kinds<00:04:01.250> of<00:04:01.340> things<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:02.810> can<00:04:02.840> put<00:04:03.230> this

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
do all kinds of things you can put this

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.550 
do all kinds of things you can put this
2<00:04:04.040> by<00:04:04.190> 2<00:04:04.220> jumper<00:04:04.640> plate<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:05.600> do<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.320> kind

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
2 by 2 jumper plate on and do you kind

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.220 
2 by 2 jumper plate on and do you kind
of<00:04:07.600> like

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
of like

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.200 
of like
kind<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.290> like<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:11.740> or<00:04:12.220> Megatron<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:13.060> like<00:04:13.150> a

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
kind of like that or Megatron is like a

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.270 
kind of like that or Megatron is like a
big<00:04:13.450> helmet<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:14.140> I've<00:04:14.260> done<00:04:14.440> in<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.680> past<00:04:14.860> so

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
big helmet that I've done in the past so

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.060 
big helmet that I've done in the past so
hopefully<00:04:16.180> this<00:04:16.270> gives<00:04:16.300> you<00:04:16.510> some<00:04:16.720> ideas<00:04:17.170> some

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
hopefully this gives you some ideas some

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.270 
hopefully this gives you some ideas some
tricks<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:18.700> how<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.440> basically<00:04:20.440> build<00:04:20.830> heads

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
tricks on how to basically build heads

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.160 
tricks on how to basically build heads
and<00:04:21.610> I<00:04:21.970> like<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.270> always<00:04:22.390> put<00:04:22.630> them<00:04:22.750> on<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.900> ball

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
and I like to always put them on a ball
