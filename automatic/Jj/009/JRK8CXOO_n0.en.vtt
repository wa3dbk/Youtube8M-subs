00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.140
 powerful anyway look at the my 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.450
 potatoes olive oil is this 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.390

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.880
 extraordinary in the sky actually 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.920
 it's the little crust of salt that floats 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.479
 above the water in the sun we 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.729
 recovers only a very very fine palette 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.950
 so he has very little oil salt and 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.780
 this is the main part of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.790

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.789
 potatoes like that we could see 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.439
 bake quietly then they 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.240

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.429
