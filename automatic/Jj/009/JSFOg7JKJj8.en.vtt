00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.080
 Hello 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.920
 today we will continue the series figure 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.929
 human 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.839
 We're going to draw a nose 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.630
 but it's just not going to be step by step 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.180
 because we are developing the dvd 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.310
 face drawing class 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.980
 we already have the duty to introduce 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.960
 very explanatory drawing and now we 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.619
 we are developing the series of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.809
 face drawings on dvd and it will be well 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.570
 explanatory even with step by step 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.840
 we will show the elements of the nose eye 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.960
 whole face mouth so here we go 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.239
 will only make a quick drawing but 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.210
 using all the techniques that we 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.530
 we have learned so far with line shape 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.010
 proportion composition and shading and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.680
 I'll use hb pencils to get started. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 I will pass 2b 4b 6b and finish akon 9b 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.840
 We'll start here with pencils as well. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.580
 clarinet and a nose seen from the front 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.729
 we do not put a line 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 we just put shading then 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.580
 here is the shadow on the side of the nose 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.930
 here the nostrils the nostrils are more 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.890
 dark 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.890
 a wolf near the nose 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.320
 At first we did not see much of the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.799
 shading because we are 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.880
 using hb pencil which is the tone of 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.420
 crystal clear 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.500
 as the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.100
 drawing 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.990
 we are changing pencils and then the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.689
 drawing begins to appear 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.000
 so at the beginning it gets even clearer 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.509
 that shadow as I told you 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.009
 we do not do here would be strong lines 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.009
 only one over increase 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.530
 we go slowly 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:26.159
 the darkest part of the nose seen from 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:28.680
 front would be the marinas and will depend 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:34.139
 much of how we are seeing this 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:40.560
 nose if it's sides and front like 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:43.799
 is the position on increase by remembering 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.209
 that the part of the face lighter than we 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:51.449
 have is exactly the nose because it is the 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:57.900
 higher part more prominent than we 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:03:03.060
 we have in the face that for now I am 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:08.840
 with hd and from now on I'll start 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.840
 I'll change pencils until I get to 9 b 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.440
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.220
 do not forget to sign up for our 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.260
 channel 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.260
 a big kiss and see you later
