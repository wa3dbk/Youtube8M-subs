peaceful by the way I always do that to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.969 
peaceful by the way I always do that to
start<00:01:18.509> out<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:18.960> once<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.350> house<00:01:19.680> made

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
start out and then once at my house made

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:31.490 
start out and then once at my house made
I<00:01:20.509> go<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:22.369> normal<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:29.420> finding<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.570> dungeon<00:01:31.259> in

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
I go to normal so finding a dungeon in

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
I go to normal so finding a dungeon in
under<00:01:32.130> 10<00:01:32.820> seconds<00:01:34.610> okay<00:01:35.610> pretty<00:01:36.090> much<00:01:36.240> crap

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
under 10 seconds okay pretty much crap

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.330 
under 10 seconds okay pretty much crap
but<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.229> guess<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:37.950> okay<00:01:39.950> at<00:01:40.950> least<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.220> can
