00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
the highest road in the US I felt like I

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.660 
the highest road in the US I felt like I
was<00:02:22.230> as<00:02:23.230> soon<00:02:23.350> as<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.590> hopped<00:02:23.830> off<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.220> bike<00:02:24.430> I

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
was as soon as I hopped off that bike I

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.960 
was as soon as I hopped off that bike I
felt<00:02:25.420> like<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.660> was<00:02:25.810> planting<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.610> flag<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.940> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
felt like I was planting a flag in the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.510 
felt like I was planting a flag in the
ground<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.860> know<00:02:29.950> like<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.280> had

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.330 

I<00:02:32.610> had<00:02:33.270> made<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.650> know<00:02:34.770> just<00:02:35.160> big

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
I had made this you know just big

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.790

achievements<00:02:35.970> personal<00:02:36.900> achievement

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.620 

and<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.610> think<00:02:41.850> part<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> reason<00:02:42.210> why<00:02:42.600> I

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
and I think part of the reason why I

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.630 
and I think part of the reason why I
take<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:43.170> many<00:02:43.290> videos<00:02:43.710> is<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.070> share<00:02:44.430> that

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
take so many videos is to share that

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.760 
take so many videos is to share that
because<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.600> often<00:02:46.440> can't<00:02:46.790> express<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:47.910> to

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
because I often can't express that to

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.750 
because I often can't express that to
you<00:02:49.770> know<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.160> know<00:02:50.220> I'm<00:02:50.310> always<00:02:50.460> on<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.670> road

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
you know you know I'm always on the road

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.440 
you know you know I'm always on the road
alone<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.390> can't<00:02:51.780> express<00:02:51.990> that<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.380> anyone

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.880 

so<00:02:57.959> making<00:02:58.890> these<00:02:59.040> videos<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.730> know<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.890> it's

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
like I'm talking to someone else and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.790 
like I'm talking to someone else and
feels<00:03:06.480> like<00:03:06.599> I<00:03:06.750> have<00:03:06.870> company<00:03:07.319> feels<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.709> I

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
feels like I have company feels like I

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.850 
feels like I have company feels like I
have<00:03:07.890> someone<00:03:08.190> there<00:03:08.340> with<00:03:08.550> me<00:03:08.730> as<00:03:08.849> I'm

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
have someone there with me as I'm

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.900 
have someone there with me as I'm
throughout<00:03:10.860> my<00:03:11.010> travels

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.390 

so<00:03:17.480> going<00:03:18.020> back<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.320> my<00:03:20.620> new<00:03:21.620> sensations<00:03:22.280> of

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
so going back to my new sensations of

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.010 
so going back to my new sensations of
loneliness<00:03:22.850> on<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.270> road<00:03:23.450> for<00:03:23.720> my<00:03:23.810> previous

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
loneliness on the road for my previous

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.460 
loneliness on the road for my previous
videos<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.800> think<00:03:25.340> one<00:03:25.550> of<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.730> reasons<00:03:26.090> why

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
videos I think one of the reasons why

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.580 
videos I think one of the reasons why
this<00:03:27.470> feeling<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.070> stronger<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:30.410> this

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
this feeling is stronger and this

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.970 
this feeling is stronger and this
