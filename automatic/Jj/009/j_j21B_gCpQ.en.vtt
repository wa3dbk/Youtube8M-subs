00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.330 

it<00:01:10.570> starts<00:01:11.110> up<00:01:11.290> really<00:01:11.740> nicely<00:01:14.040> runs<00:01:15.040> really

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
it starts up really nicely runs really

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.220 
it starts up really nicely runs really
well<00:01:16.710> -<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:18.040> suspension<00:01:18.640> it's<00:01:19.230> obviously
