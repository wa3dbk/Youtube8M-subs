00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.160
 very good people here you have the third 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.719
 special weapon of zombies analyze the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.760
 detail in this case is going to be the howl 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.500
 winter or winter fury if you are 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.540
 improved although we all know it as 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.550
 the ice of faith is to say that the 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.619
 maps in which you are files and verdÃº 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.419
 that black ops 1 and the design is very 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.939
 similar to the laser is a gun if 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.800
 revolver style very much like the 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.689
 mobility is quite high is a weapon 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.850
 very light that allows us to move very 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.040
 fast when it comes to bringing the zombies together and 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.930
 the ammunition that you have to improve are 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.570
 six magazine and 24 spare bullets 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.460
 and nine of loader and 36 of spare if 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.960
 this weapon is improved as 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.490
 main feature has to 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.860
 freeze the zombies as you can see 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.570
 shoot that ice cube that at 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.910
 freezer where it makes them explode and the 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.760
 mata how to use that I 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.230
 I recommend is that until a round 25 more 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.050
 or less can we count the zombies 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.930
 normal and shoot the law with question 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.229
 of 456 bullets as we will kill the surge 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.030
 and the next from the 25 because I 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.860
 I think it's good to combine it 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.720
 with asserting what is what 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.980
 we would weaken them a little 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.320
 ice tail with about 567 shots 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.270
 and finish them off with lightning like doing 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.220
 that the truth that moves very fast and 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.170
 you will never miss hammer ammunition 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.090
 Pretty announcements but you're going to 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.320
 manage much better when it comes to 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.640
 use it with an instant low already 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.010
 You see that you do not have to worry much 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.020
 since it has enough range and 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.090
 it's just going together as you can 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.930
 without any fear since at the moment 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.970
 that shoot 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.460
 all those that you have ahead are going to 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.880
 die the advantages that this weapon has 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.590
 They are leaving bonuses and even 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.300
 a round 20 more or less that can 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.860
 save ivis as it caused me to 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.960
 encierren vale not in this case is not 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.700
 my failure provoked him but good so that 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.920
 you see that if they lock us we can 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.350
 shoot death and we will take off 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.510
 all the zombies from before disadvantages 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.640
 which has the most important one 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.730
 I would highlight more is that from a 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.320
 round 35-40 still combining it with the 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.210
 laser costs of killing worth and without 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.730
 combine the already is a special weapon that 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.040
 it's pretty shit I can say it clear 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.960
 because it helps us to raise rounds to 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.480
 from a round 40 or so is 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.910
 quite depressing to try to climb 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.380
 rounds with that weapon in very low rounds 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.080
 we can kill all the 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.690
 a shot would be before a round 10 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.790
 something like that we could kill the 24 zombies 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.500
 you can not damage yourself with the weapon 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.030
 difference from other special weapons with 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.130
 those that yes that you can damage yourself and you have 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.900
 to be more careful and unlike 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.610
 of the laser although it looks a lot like the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.350
 you have to use it the same as ballast 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.010
 that you shoot the zombie stones for 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.840
 because it is an explosive weapon 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.370
 and the ice does not have to shoot two 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.470
 feet you have to shoot directly at 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.790
 zombie since he's arming explosively 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.700
 So, it's interesting to shoot the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.019
 zombies directly there I will put you 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.939
 a way in which you are going to be able 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.829
 slow down a zombie and be able to pull 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.930
 quieter box such is something similar 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.430
 to leave it lame but good if you can not 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.560
 leave it lame because you do not have grenades or 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.239
 because you could not because you can 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.159
 slow it down with ice without reaching 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.470
 kill him and pull box quieter and 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.180
 do what you want to do without having to 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.400
 zombie running and attached to our 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.470
 back give two camps 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.840
 the range of the weapon is quite high 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.640
 although it seems that no and I after 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.159
 very much to try the arrival with the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.200
 conclusion that harm equal to the 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.540
 zombies that you have right in front like the 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.159
 which has about 5 or 6 meters if it enters 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.439
 within their range will damage them equally 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.750
 if it does not hurt more those who have more 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:33.120
 close as it may be other souls about 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.489
 all machine guns and weapons 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.890
 normal bullets to kill the doctor 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.720
 we're going to need more than 9 bullets in the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.060
 charger that comes when we improve it 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.680
 So we need to help us buy 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.120
 the climb used some laser shot 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.609
 because if not in one go we're not going to 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.579
 I can kill him and I'll leave you too 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.290
 some pieces in the rom of 52 in which 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.810
 I spend practically almost all 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.670
 ammunition and in round 61 in which I 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.500
 there is a zombie and I take the opportunity to see 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.000
 how much stamina does that tombi and the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.590
 it's true that he left me the entire loader 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.599
 be the charger did not let me ammo 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.879
 whole of the weapon and apart I have to 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.230
 finish it off with two or three 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.230
 ammunition that will be about ten 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.480
 chargers or eight mtl chargers for 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.889
 finish killing him because the fangs 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.079
 they are very very hard already about what I 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.329
 I mean that when it comes to uploading probes 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.009
 It will not interest us like I'm not going to 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.530
 give a 4 and still it seems too much 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.379
 since this weapon from round 35 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.669
 or round 38 over there it becomes 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.740
 practically unusable because 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.479
 we would need more than half of the 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.849
 ammunition to kill a surge and that 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.219
 for a special weapon is a person 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.439
 fucking shit talking clear so nothing 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.509
 you see a pretty basic weapon but 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:41.219
 well it 's a special weapon to tell me 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.569
 the comments that you think is a 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:44.879
 trash gun but good you have to 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.990
 know nothing more kids a greeting and 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.990
 I hope you like the chao
