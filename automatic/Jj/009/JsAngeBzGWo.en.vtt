00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.660
 we did not expect this little sun 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.980
 today with the wind that party 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.290
 it's really nice to learn 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.810
 tides sell it hoping we'll have it 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.130
 until the end I left the small 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.540
 thermal village of saint laurent 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.550
 baths on the edge of the Ardèche 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.379
 southern to a few kilometers to 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.379
 trouble lozère and the Cevennes 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.920
 my goal back up along the 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.469
 terminal to its throats 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.729
 beyond the small hamlet of the same on this 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.460
 slope of saint laurent baths 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.420
 it's a whole new plant universe 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.100
 welcomes the beginning of the hike 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.289
 then there radical change of atmosphere 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.489
 compared to the ardeche that we could see 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.869
 in the hiking book we saw 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.589
 the ardeche the chestnuts and 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.479
 chestnut 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.399
 now here is the softwood that 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.909
 takes over with the appearance of 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:15.649
 fir trees and is not enough fun yet 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.149
 more incredible are dried dantesque 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.460
 in which the rays of the 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.960
 sun is struggling to pass and the route of the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.960
 gr 72 makes its way 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.720
 and then we pass the crest and there the decor 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.340
 still changes at all others the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.319
 resident and gives way to a huge 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.350
 beech forest where the light floods to 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.149
 new space on the floor and the 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.069
 path a thick carpet of leaves 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.369
 in which one distinguishes 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.780
 but yes of the snow the proof that he has 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.140
 well done cold these last days on 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.359
 the ardeche a temperature looks good 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.210
 the bottom of this little valley much the 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.280
 stream of sweet beautiful 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.080
 yes then we come to a place 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.080
 a little wet and snatch 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.599
 after these small waterfalls 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.610
 I find the sun a little higher 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.840
 on the other side this part of 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.700
 the route is simply 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.700
 fairy under the colors of autumn 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.480
 waterfalls and torrents are 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.480
 legion all the way 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.250
 special mention to the brook of prata a 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.550
 denied that we can cross way givet 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.550
 I love how cushy way risk 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.349
 in the second case we will avoid this 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.680
 time to finish the buttocks in the water 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.940
 jelly 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.160
 it's much better I'm pursuing my 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.340
 path on the gr 72 and crosses in progress 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.930
 road an old building in ruins to 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.700
 hardly believable but I realize he 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.650
 these are not some dilapidated walls 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.790
 but of a whole abandoned hamlet and 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.950
 hidden by the forest that dwelt here 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.860
 who was doing your why to have left 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.690
 when the answers to these questions 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.160
 these are these dumb and buried stones 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.450
 by the vegetation that now have them 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.510
 the trail ends up leaving the canopy 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.220
 of the forest does distinguish the line followed 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.830
 through the terminal that winds through the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.209
 relief trees emerge over 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.980
 shadow and betray the passage 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.660
 imminent barrier 1000 meters 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.370
 altitude 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.140
 up there on the hill the bell tower of a 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.350
 church and house roof ad 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.790
 the arrival at the small hamlet on board the 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.709
 inhabitants of terminals are called the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.180
 dickens boroughs and bourniquel 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.459
 there is not much left of it 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.480
 only a small quarantine lives 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.569
 the village in the year 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.049
 my terminals are also and especially 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.510
 famous gorges and the gorges of the bourne 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.620
 then certainly dangerous access but he 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.260
 be aware that summer here is the 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.730
 paradise for canyoning enthusiasts but 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.680
 also bathers because there is 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.319
 here two beautiful masks we will go 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.330
 see that a little bit cooler and for 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.099
 start we can only be hit by 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.900
 the huge pilliero show that bars the entrance 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.030
 gorges is on whose side 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.280
 appears an old dungeon that makes me 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.540
 strangely think of that of the chasm of 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.459
 helm in the lord of the rings 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.230
 Ardèche version obviously comes to 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.150
 the entrance of the gorges the terminal is still 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.919
 a river with a quiet and peaceful look 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.810
 it's a bit further upstream than she 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.609
 begins to get excited at the favor of 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.609
 passage that you cash and rugged 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.850
 until it ended up being big and 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.850
 big job 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.469
 the path goes up the flanks in 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.139
 direction of the chambons and cross a 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:39.060
 area devastated by a fire the 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.620
 remember last August when 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.419
 firefighters and canadair had painfully 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.960
 fight to contain a fire that ravaged 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.759
 nearly 45 hectares life continues 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.180
 nevertheless his way to the image of this 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.729
 caterpillar that I missed to crush mom 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.300
 it's amazing I spend my notebook 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.830
 right out I will not have time 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.749
 to go further today it takes 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.310
 consider turning back to avoid 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.090
 to completely redo the same 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.069
 course 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.289
 I propose an alternative solution 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.849
 so for the return two possibilities 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.620
 to take the same path as to go 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.099
 here at the crossroads of the 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.689
 Croisette 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.039
 opt for the path that goes through 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.210
 coste lanyard and will also bring you back 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.439
 saint laurent baths 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.879
 for my part I chose a solution 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:19.740
 faster is teleportation 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.430
 I hope you enjoyed this hike 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.430
 in next 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.630
 in the next episode hiking book 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.300
 takes you into the mysterious woods of 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.160
 the peninsula of castel jean a 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.289
 a real labyrinth with an atmosphere 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.150
 hauntingly 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.340
 I met clement of the association 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.720
 discover by walking and you will do 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.210
 also discovered the chassezac gorges 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:53.560
 before diving into the bowels of 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.560
 the earth to follow from November 23 on 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.099
 www.carlabrunisarkozy.org cards or 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.729
 neighborhood of the cross makes crossroads of 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:06.289
 the croisette take it take the 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.820
 path to cost longe who you 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.800
 will also bring back to saint laurent the 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.070
 well yeah that's this solution is it 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.070
 show 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.669
 I do not know how strongly this 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:20.550
 issue so if you want to look pretty 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.619
 disappear in fact yeah wait 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.999
 brigitte great idea i have a great idea 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:27.719
 I hope it trembles more 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.719
 shortly
