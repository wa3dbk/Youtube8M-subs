00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.319 
the ace of swords and the aces are all
relative<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.680> new<00:02:01.860> beginnings<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.790> swords<00:02:03.180> in

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
relative to new beginnings the swords in

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.080 
relative to new beginnings the swords in
particular<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:05.369> all<00:02:05.520> about<00:02:05.549> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
particular are really all about of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.540 
particular are really all about of
things<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:06.960> n

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
things that have n

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.150 
things that have n
either<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.880> conflict<00:02:09.660> or<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.110> strife<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.979> out

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
either in conflict or in strife and out

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.110 
either in conflict or in strife and out
of<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.370> conflict<00:02:12.980> growth<00:02:13.980> emerges<00:02:14.730> new

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
of that conflict growth emerges new

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.750 
of that conflict growth emerges new
beginnings<00:02:15.660> emerge<00:02:16.080> things<00:02:16.650> are<00:02:16.890> restarted

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
beginnings emerge things are restarted

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.120 
beginnings emerge things are restarted
so<00:02:18.000> it's<00:02:18.150> kind<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:20.450> comparable<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:22.130> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
so it's kind of like comparable to the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.060 
so it's kind of like comparable to the
rise<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.670> phoenix<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.600> know<00:02:24.860> where<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
rise of the phoenix you know where the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.150 
rise of the phoenix you know where the
bird<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:27.000> destroyed<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:27.930> he<00:02:28.530> rises<00:02:28.800> out<00:02:29.100> of

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
bird is destroyed and he rises out of

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.630 
bird is destroyed and he rises out of
his<00:02:29.430> ashes<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.390> think<00:02:30.870> that's<00:02:31.110> very<00:02:31.640> relative

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
his ashes I think that's very relative

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.360 
his ashes I think that's very relative
to<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.350> ace<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.980> swords

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
to this a so you have this ace of swords

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.390 
to this a so you have this ace of swords
and<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.810> really<00:02:37.170> about<00:02:37.380> new<00:02:37.800> beginning

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
and this is really about new beginning

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.830 
and this is really about new beginning
so<00:02:38.550> there<00:02:38.700> may<00:02:38.850> be<00:02:38.880> new<00:02:39.210> beginnings<00:02:39.720> in

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
so there may be new beginnings in

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.100 
so there may be new beginnings in
relationships<00:02:40.830> if<00:02:41.190> something<00:02:42.180> has<00:02:42.390> ended<00:02:42.959> or
