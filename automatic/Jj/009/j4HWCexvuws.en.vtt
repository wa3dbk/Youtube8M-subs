00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.449 
hassle to take off actually had to get
like<00:02:59.489> I'm<00:02:59.760> what<00:03:00.239> was<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.840> end<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.980> bobby

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
like I'm what was it the end of a bobby

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.060 
like I'm what was it the end of a bobby
pin<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:03.360> get<00:03:03.540> my<00:03:03.720> phone<00:03:04.020> out<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.770> case

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
pin to get my phone out of this case

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.220 
pin to get my phone out of this case
because<00:03:05.520> this<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.880> plastic<00:03:06.480> right<00:03:06.600> here<00:03:06.930> and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
because this is plastic right here and

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.440 
because this is plastic right here and
it<00:03:07.380> doesn't<00:03:07.530> have<00:03:07.800> any<00:03:08.070> give<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.000> so

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
it doesn't have any give on it so

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.449 
it doesn't have any give on it so
ultimately<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:10.380> was<00:03:10.739> like<00:03:10.890> I'm<00:03:11.040> not<00:03:11.160> gonna<00:03:11.310> put

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
ultimately I was like I'm not gonna put

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.040 
ultimately I was like I'm not gonna put
my<00:03:11.610> phone<00:03:11.820> back<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.300> here<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.660> does<00:03:12.810> have<00:03:13.020> a

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
my phone back in here it does have a

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.930 
my phone back in here it does have a
nice<00:03:13.230> little<00:03:13.410> felt<00:03:13.770> lining<00:03:14.040> but<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:14.580> wish<00:03:14.790> it

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
nice little felt lining but I wish it

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.280 
nice little felt lining but I wish it
would<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.150> had<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.300> little<00:03:15.630> give<00:03:15.840> right<00:03:16.140> in

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
would have had a little give right in

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.900

here<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.739> way<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:16.920> could<00:03:17.040> take<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.340> off<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.700> lot

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
here that way I could take it off a lot

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.120 
here that way I could take it off a lot
easier<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.660> did<00:03:18.989> come<00:03:19.140> with<00:03:19.350> directions<00:03:19.920> on

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
easier it did come with directions on
