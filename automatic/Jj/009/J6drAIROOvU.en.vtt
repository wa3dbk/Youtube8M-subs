00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
first and then we'll break it down ok so

first and then we'll break it down ok so
this<00:00:42.989> move<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.410> done<00:00:43.680> fast<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.280> slow

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
this move can be done fast or slow

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.430 
this move can be done fast or slow
depending<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:45.300> mood<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:46.140> first<00:00:46.350> I'm

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
depending on your mood but first I'm

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.360 
depending on your mood but first I'm
going<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> show<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.070> looks<00:00:47.219> like

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
going to show you what it looks like

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.209 
going to show you what it looks like
again<00:00:47.760> nice<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.690> slow<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.070> really

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
again nice and slow so you can really

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.950 
again nice and slow so you can really
start<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> process<00:00:51.239> how<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.420> mechanics<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
start to process how the mechanics of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
start to process how the mechanics of
the<00:00:52.020> movement<00:00:52.140> work<00:01:03.830> your<00:01:04.830> first<00:01:05.280> hand<00:01:05.640> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the movement work your first hand is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.730 
the movement work your first hand is
opposite<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> direction<00:01:06.720> your<00:01:07.200> hoop<00:01:07.380> spins

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
opposite the direction your hoop spins

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.890 
opposite the direction your hoop spins
so<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.640> right<00:01:08.820> Hubert<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.750> left

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
so if your right Hubert it's your left

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.230 
so if your right Hubert it's your left
hand<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.409> if<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:10.680> are<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.070> lefty<00:01:11.729> /<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.060> your

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
hand and if your are a lefty / it's your

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.679 
hand and if your are a lefty / it's your
right<00:01:12.420> hand<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:14.490> stands<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.000> reason<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.390> your

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
right hand it stands to reason that your

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.600 
right hand it stands to reason that your
second<00:01:16.020> hand<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> same<00:01:16.830> side<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.400> as

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
second hand is on the same side then as

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.760 
second hand is on the same side then as
the<00:01:17.790> direction<00:01:18.000> your<00:01:18.210> hoop<00:01:18.390> spins<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.259> we

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the direction your hoop spins so we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.520 
the direction your hoop spins so we
start<00:01:20.100> off<00:01:20.189> any<00:01:20.400> first<00:01:20.970> hand<00:01:21.299> halo<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:24.530> from

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
start off any first hand halo and from

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.440 
start off any first hand halo and from
here<00:01:26.009> we're<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> start<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.060> turn<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.360> our

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
here we're going to start to turn in our

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.380 
here we're going to start to turn in our
natural<00:01:27.930> direction<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.650> want<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.009> notice

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
natural direction and we want to notice

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.499 
natural direction and we want to notice
when<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.040> palm<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> hand<00:01:33.000> open<00:01:33.390> up

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
when we see the palm of the hand open up

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.640 
when we see the palm of the hand open up
that's<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.110> our<00:01:34.229> window<00:01:34.500> of

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that's going to be our window of

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.030 
that's going to be our window of
opportunity<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:36.090> place<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.780> elbow<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.470> into

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
opportunity to place the elbow up into

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.300 
opportunity to place the elbow up into
the<00:01:38.159> hoop<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.840> hoop<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.740> float

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the hoop the hoop is going to float

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.050 
the hoop the hoop is going to float
right<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:43.170> below<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.710> elbow<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
right there just below the elbow so you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.560 
right there just below the elbow so you
can<00:01:45.360> continue<00:01:45.979> to<00:01:46.979> float<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.000> position

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
can continue to float in this position

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.440 
can continue to float in this position
as<00:01:48.689> long<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.619> maintain<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:50.280> speed<00:01:50.490> as

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
as long as you maintain your speed as

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.120 
as long as you maintain your speed as
soon<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.930> slow<00:01:52.140> down<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> hoop<00:01:52.649> will<00:01:52.799> drop

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
soon as you slow down the hoop will drop

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.120 
soon as you slow down the hoop will drop
into<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:53.729> hand<00:01:54.119> which<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.810> then<00:01:55.229> use<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
into your hand which you then use to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.830 
into your hand which you then use to
press<00:01:56.369> back<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.060> away<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.570> your<00:01:57.659> natural

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
press back and away in your natural

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.389 
press back and away in your natural
direction<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> let's<00:01:59.640> try<00:01:59.909> that<00:01:59.939> again

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
direction so let's try that again

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.270 
direction so let's try that again
beginning<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.670> our<00:02:03.119> first<00:02:03.540> hand<00:02:03.810> halo<00:02:04.280> turning

beginning in our first hand halo turning

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.570 
beginning in our first hand halo turning
in<00:02:05.399> our<00:02:05.490> natural<00:02:05.640> direction<00:02:06.439> look<00:02:07.439> up<00:02:07.649> notice

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
in our natural direction look up notice

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.609 
in our natural direction look up notice
when<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.149> see<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> palm<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:09.929> hand<00:02:10.050> that
