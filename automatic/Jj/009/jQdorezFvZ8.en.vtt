00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello I have now you are in today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.060
 we will help choose the sd card that 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.690
 more suited to your needs 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.690
 we started 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.580
 [Music] 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.250
 when buying an sd card 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.200
 you must take into account two aspects 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.029
 same that you would have to contemplate if you 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.250
 were you to buy another device from 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.100
 storage whether it was a card 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.800
 microsd a pendrive or even a disk 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.779
 hard first storage 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.669
 here you will have to assess what data 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.829
 you want to save and what will be the capacity 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.989
 what you need so you will have to 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.360
 calculate what is the storage that 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.340
 it suits you anyway too 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.920
 it is true that the price difference 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.320
 between the different capacities to day of 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.830
 today it is little therefore in case of doubt 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.780
 the biggest on the other hand there's that 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.180
 take into account the speed of 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.190
 data transmission is likely to 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.440
 when you go to buy the sd card 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.810
 ask you what kind you want it 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.240
 well the class symbolizes the 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.340
 speed at which the data is passed is 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.610
 say that the higher the class 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.380
 faster will be transmitted these is by 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.240
 what you have sometimes appreciated 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.040
 a significant price difference 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.170
 between two cards that have the same 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.820
 capacity and that may even reach 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.310
 be of the same brand 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.710
 but eye in the case of class 10 by 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.120
 example that is the highest there are several 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.320
 speeds so keep that in mind 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.810
 [Music] 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.970
 well once treated these aspects 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.340
 let's explain what the sd card is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.290
 that you have to choose surely 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.960
 will recommend the fastest because 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.000
 you will have a better quality but not false 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 in the case of a camera of photos by 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.619
 example, quality will not depend on the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.240
 card that we buy then what 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.060
 you have to do is look what is the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.680
 Write speed of your device 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.570
 for example in the case of a camera 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.729
 photos with a maximum speed of 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.860
 writing of 4 megabytes per second with 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.020
 buy a Class 4 compliant 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.210
 this speed will already have more than 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.680
 leftovers is to say so we want a 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.300
 card that can work at 10 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.789
 megabytes per second if the device 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.459
 that we use can never get the 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.229
 maximum performance in the event that 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.090
 look for the writing speed of your 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.070
 device and do not find it by 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.590
 no side be aware of the following 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.320
 advice if your camera is compact and makes 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.690
 photos in jpg format do not need a 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.390
 high writing speed therefore 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.760
 look only at the capacity and in 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.769
 the price of the card but in the case 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.299
 that you have a reflex camera or a 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.950
 professional video camera is 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.000
 recommended a minimum of classes 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.230
 so that it can work without problems 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.239
 [Music] 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.980
 Now that you know the most important thing 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.440
 let's explain two other aspects 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.209
 more you can take into account the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.610
 first is to differentiate between the two 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.250
 card types ie if it is sd or 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.980
 sdhc the difference between both is 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.319
 basically the internal architecture that 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.690
 in the case of the sdhc it offers a reading 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.510
 much more optimized than the current sd 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.910
 On the other hand you could also assess the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.980
 possibility of buying an sd card 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.989
 with wifi you may have never heard 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.060
 talk about this possibility but there are 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.920
 sd cards with the same appearance as 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.510
 the rest but inside 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.670
 It incorporates besides the unit 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.400
 storage a small antenna and a 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.750
 microprocessor to make it work and 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.489
 so that this type of 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.930
 cards you wonder then 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.180
 mainly to transmit 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.760
 pictures instantly to your 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.500
 smartphone tablet or pc and now the big 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.180
 question all the cameras are 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.670
 compatible with this type of card 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.069
 unfortunately there are not many that 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.840
 yes but not all of this is because the 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.299
 microprocessor and the antenna that 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.160
 we mentioned before they consume an extra 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.540
 energy that not all devices 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.269
 They are capable 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.670
 through its sd slot well we wait 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.950
 I could have helped you with this advice 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.079
 in the description you can see some 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.540
 links that we leave with the sd cards 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.400
 recommended by tecno nauta for another 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.870
