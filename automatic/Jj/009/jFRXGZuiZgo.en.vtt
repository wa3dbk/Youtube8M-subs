00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
I've really enjoyed that art it's the

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.619 
I've really enjoyed that art it's the
kind<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.400> car<00:02:51.609> that<00:02:51.639> you<00:02:51.819> can<00:02:52.060> drive<00:02:52.420> with<00:02:52.480> a

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
kind of car that you can drive with a

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.059 
kind of car that you can drive with a
little<00:02:52.900> power<00:02:53.049> oversteer<00:02:53.650> which<00:02:53.920> is

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
little power oversteer which is

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.729 
little power oversteer which is
something<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.459> like<00:02:54.489> doing<00:02:55.389> yeah<00:02:56.049> in<00:02:56.200> fact<00:02:56.409> keep

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
something I like doing yeah in fact keep

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:57.929 
something I like doing yeah in fact keep
this<00:02:56.859> quiet<00:02:57.099> I<00:02:57.310> like<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.579> better<00:02:57.730> than<00:02:57.879> the

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
this quiet I like it better than the

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.990 
this quiet I like it better than the
Corvette<00:02:58.180> terms<00:02:59.079> of<00:02:59.260> handling<00:02:59.530> the<00:03:00.159> CTSV<00:03:00.639> is

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
Corvette terms of handling the CTSV is

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.830 
Corvette terms of handling the CTSV is
well<00:03:01.239> balanced<00:03:02.280> minimal<00:03:03.280> understeer<00:03:03.909> it's

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
well balanced minimal understeer it's

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.020 
well balanced minimal understeer it's
pretty<00:03:05.290> easy<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.709> not<00:03:06.010> get<00:03:06.280> loose<00:03:06.669> with<00:03:06.909> the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
pretty easy to not get loose with the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.610 
pretty easy to not get loose with the
throttle<00:03:07.359> but<00:03:07.870> that's<00:03:08.109> just<00:03:08.200> cuz<00:03:08.409> it's<00:03:08.560> so

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
throttle but that's just cuz it's so

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.949 
throttle but that's just cuz it's so
powerful<00:03:08.919> so<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.519> had<00:03:09.639> to<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:10.030> had<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.389> slow<00:03:10.689> my

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
powerful so I had to I had to slow my

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.429 
powerful so I had to I had to slow my
throttle<00:03:11.409> foot<00:03:11.620> down<00:03:12.000> feed<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.480> in<00:03:13.780> roll<00:03:14.139> it

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
throttle foot down feed that in roll it

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.250 
throttle foot down feed that in roll it
in<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.760> worked<00:03:15.969> really<00:03:16.090> really<00:03:16.449> well<00:03:16.719> it

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
in and that worked really really well it

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.099 
in and that worked really really well it
has<00:03:17.319> a<00:03:17.530> lot<00:03:17.829> of<00:03:18.010> braking<00:03:18.489> power<00:03:18.699> they<00:03:19.689> did<00:03:19.930> get

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
has a lot of braking power they did get

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.509 
has a lot of braking power they did get
warm<00:03:20.349> and<00:03:20.469> started<00:03:20.769> getting<00:03:20.949> smelly<00:03:21.280> but

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
warm and started getting smelly but

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.920 
warm and started getting smelly but
again<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.790> think<00:03:22.120> that's<00:03:22.299> because<00:03:22.449> they're<00:03:22.719> new

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
again I think that's because they're new

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.199 
again I think that's because they're new
I'll<00:03:23.590> bet<00:03:23.889> if<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.099> went<00:03:24.310> back<00:03:24.370> out<00:03:24.669> again<00:03:25.030> it

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
I'll bet if I went back out again it

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.280 
I'll bet if I went back out again it
probably<00:03:25.449> wouldn't<00:03:25.780> do<00:03:25.900> that

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
probably wouldn't do that

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.289 
probably wouldn't do that
the<00:03:26.889> pebble<00:03:27.250> stayed<00:03:27.549> up<00:03:27.699> it<00:03:27.849> stopped<00:03:28.090> really

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
the pebble stayed up it stopped really

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.080 
the pebble stayed up it stopped really
well<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:29.439> car<00:03:29.680> turns<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.280> really<00:03:30.609> well<00:03:30.790> but<00:03:31.000> in

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
well the car turns in really well but in

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.659 
well the car turns in really well but in
a<00:03:31.180> predictable<00:03:31.719> fashion<00:03:32.010> it's<00:03:33.010> not<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.280> soft

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
a predictable fashion it's not a soft

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.839 
a predictable fashion it's not a soft
car<00:03:34.060> it's<00:03:34.510> it's<00:03:34.810> controlled<00:03:35.379> not<00:03:36.280> harsh<00:03:36.579> but
