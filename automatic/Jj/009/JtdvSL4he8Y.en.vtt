00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.900
 very good all about welcoming a 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.940
 new video of order I am both a physicist 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.370
 and I come to talk about a cliché of zero 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.740
 the murderer that allows us to kill 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.439
 some enemies in particular from just one 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.210
 shot or few shots this cliché 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.650
 is going to be based on a skill in the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.730
 that we will have to put at least one 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.590
 point to make it and the one the only 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.869
 inconvenient that the enemies that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.840
 we have to kill in this way they have 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.480
 than having a turret or a kind 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.250
 of extra body stuck to the body this 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 what does it mean for example this one that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.600
 we are going to leave now bunker as it has 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.640
 several turrets we will be able to kill him from 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.860
 one or a few shots at the same time 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.420
 I'm wearing a white bandit submachine gun 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.750
 something that does not hurt at these levels 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.720
 but nothing possible for it you will see that I 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.010
 approached he shot the turret and 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.210
 good is already dead 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.559
 to see this trick the only thing they need 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.490
 is or has a turret attached to the 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.659
 body was going to be based on the skill 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.610
 borer for never how are they called 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.110
 Spanish I'm sorry because it has a name 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.630
 a bit strange there are times that I'm 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.310
 shooting robots and I do not do them 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.740
 no harm because of course a submachine gun 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.970
 they go white and I do not know anything about damage and 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.500
 He hopes to prove to that he was not 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.119
 using any kind of trick to 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.250
 increase the damage to weapons or anything 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.229
 because otherwise I would not have had time to 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.390
 change anything between shooting the bunker 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.340
 and it's not that I already killed him now 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.259
 taught here this is the skill that I have 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.390
 been using is called borer and what 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.159
 which is that your bullets can 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.440
 traverse the enemies and if they give you a 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.200
 enemy after crossing it have it 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.750
 a double or 100% more damage 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.130
 twice a year what does this mean 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.649
 because if they have a turret or something 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.330
 stuck to the body when we shoot it is 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.289
 as a kind of failure of the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.420
 developers and it seems that as 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.670
 the two bodies so close together is as if 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.920
 when crossing the two they were 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.360
 going through continuously like this we would 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.880
 that they went through like a thousand times 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.080
 million times what I know is that I'm 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.360
 shooting at a tower of a 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.770
 super buff builder and pum you 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.750
 it took away practically all of life from 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.820
 few shots and you will say but they are 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.840
 normal they carry a sniper and he is 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.980
 zero 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.950
 Well , look look at the level 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.720
 sniper goes level 25 tries 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.360
 take some life from a builder 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.210
 bastard with a level sniper 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.190
 25 when they are at level 80 is that 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.270
 it's impossible but not with this trick what 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.400
 only thing that we are going to need is that 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.490
 have a turret or something stuck there 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.220
 traveled to the torque dcc engine that 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.170
 takes a motorcycle with two turrets stuck 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.370
 I get the first not do well is 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.640
 it took a little life but when I 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.910
 I get to do well and all my life outside 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.459
 we're going to be able to do this trick with 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.500
 several bosses for example the last boss 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.970
 Tropic dif I do not usually sell call 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.670
 because he is a super complicated man 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.050
 it has a lot of ones and zeros 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.880
 only with shooting him between the body 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.350
 from above and the body below it 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.880
 we removed a lot of life and here now 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.380
 same I did not have it with slash if I 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.750
 I would have had with him the glory he killed 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.260
 one shot 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.570
 we can even kill some bosses 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.780
 of raid good alone only to one 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.580
 that I know is hyper yus and peru not 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.340
 I know if it opens and who is if you have 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.459
 played to captain scarlett's tlc 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.920
 It is safer for you to know that 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.290
 sir to that super raid boss so super 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.970
 difficult we can not load it with a shot 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.130
 nothing else can even be killed in a 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.980
 shot with a level 1 weapon but I do not 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.840
 I gave me a level 25 weapon 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.850
 who now decides so to speak is 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.370
 similar since I did not feel like 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.560
 catch me a level 1 weapon did not have 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.720
 I want to go back to level 1 to look for a 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.489
 weapon here come saturn that if you do not 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.620
 can kill him with a shot nothing more if 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.200
 you do perfectly, although it costs a lot 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.959
 and here we are definitely with 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.520
 empires the dry boss of said is 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.030
 for this it is much more difficult you have 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.280
 to use the singularity grenades 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.500
 to attract the other robots near 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.330
 him and leave him trapped between the four 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.730
 robots because if you leave it with a hole 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.680
 free when you shoot him he will move and 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.970
 it's going to come out so what you have to 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.950
 to do is to shoot 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.500
 stay behind the beam is so that 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.850
 the exclusion is initial that makes us 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.290
 It hurts to get as close as possible to him 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.420
 throw a singularity behind it so that 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.280
 the two of back join one ahead 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.740
 so that the two in front come together and 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.780
 a one in the middle or a couple so that all 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.360
 they stay very close from now and you see that 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.660
 so all life was with a weapon of 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.900
 level 25 wing 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.880
 and good if you want if you want to continue 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.370
 Failing, you can go out the door 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.720
 and enter will be there again I hope 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.400
 that you liked the video if you like it already 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.050
 you know you can give a like comment if 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.120
 you have some suggestions and subscribe 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.560
 for more I'll leave the twitter of the channel 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.150
 description so you can pass me the 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.010
 legendary to those present that you go 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.360
 getting and if I have enough 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.700
 images I'll make a compilation more 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.200
 go ahead and so somehow you can 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.460
 participate in some of my videos already 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.930
 what do I do the videos for you 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.330
 so you can participate in some 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.510
 way you have a good day and until the 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.510
 next
