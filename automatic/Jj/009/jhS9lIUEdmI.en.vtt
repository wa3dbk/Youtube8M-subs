00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
think there is a big north/south divide

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.320 
think there is a big north/south divide
well<00:01:19.890> yeah<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.430> mean<00:01:20.550> I<00:01:20.670> tell<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.120> I<00:01:21.210> think

well yeah I mean I tell you what I think

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.910 
well yeah I mean I tell you what I think
Georgie's<00:01:21.810> would<00:01:21.960> say<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.230> a<00:01:22.350> southerner<00:01:22.770> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
Georgie's would say to a southerner that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.980 
Georgie's would say to a southerner that
they<00:01:23.010> don't<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.670> advantages<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.660> our

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
they don't have the advantages of our

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.650 
they don't have the advantages of our
disadvantages<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.730> I<00:01:26.760> think<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.300> a<00:01:27.330> huge

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
disadvantages so I think there is a huge

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.570 
disadvantages so I think there is a huge
division<00:01:28.050> really<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.620> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> northerners

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
division really and in the northerners

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.000 
division really and in the northerners
are<00:01:29.760> like<00:01:30.240> John<00:01:30.480> says<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.960> think<00:01:31.620> they're<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.830> bit

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
are like John says I think they're a bit

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.440 
are like John says I think they're a bit
chippy<00:01:32.370> there<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.730> bit<00:01:32.910> of<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.060> chip<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.330> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
chippy there is a bit of a chip on the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.670 
chippy there is a bit of a chip on the
shoulder<00:01:33.480> they<00:01:33.870> do<00:01:33.930> think<00:01:34.260> they've<00:01:34.380> had<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> bit

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
shoulder they do think they've had a bit

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
shoulder they do think they've had a bit
of<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.860> hard<00:01:35.070> time<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.970> all<00:01:36.119> stems<00:01:36.479> from<00:01:36.660> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
of a hard time it's all stems from the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.210 
of a hard time it's all stems from the
Industrial<00:01:37.410> Revolution<00:01:37.440> when<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.010> was<00:01:38.100> the

but<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:43.560> was<00:01:43.680> taken<00:01:44.100> away<00:01:44.190> from<00:01:44.310> them<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.150> I

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
but it was taken away from them so I

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.469 
but it was taken away from them so I
think<00:01:45.300> there<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.660> kind<00:01:45.900> of<00:01:46.050> a<00:01:46.110> residual<00:01:47.479> semi

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
think there is kind of a residual semi

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.600 
think there is kind of a residual semi
lower<00:01:48.750> than<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> South<00:01:49.440> -<00:01:49.650> Tonino<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.460> mean

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
lower than of the South - Tonino I mean

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.010 
lower than of the South - Tonino I mean

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
anyone would want to be and I'm right

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.009 
anyone would want to be and I'm right
that's<00:02:20.910> very<00:02:21.000> much<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.450> case<00:02:21.750> with<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
that's very much the case with the

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.509 
that's very much the case with the
country<00:02:22.350> as<00:02:22.440> well<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:22.830> think<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.190> fact

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
country as well and I think the fact

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.820 
country as well and I think the fact
that<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:23.910> John<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.330> Pauline<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.709> know

only trouble is I mean do you believe in

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.319 
only trouble is I mean do you believe in
the<00:02:52.870> north-south<00:02:53.290> divide<00:02:53.760> well<00:02:54.760> oddly<00:02:55.120> enough

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
the north-south divide well oddly enough

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.869 
the north-south divide well oddly enough
our<00:02:56.079> readers<00:02:56.560> are<00:02:56.590> almost<00:02:57.189> all<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.609> south

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
our readers are almost all in the south

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.000 
our readers are almost all in the south
and<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.269> I'm<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.719> is<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.930> shameless<00:02:59.260> bid<00:02:59.739> for

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
and so I'm this is a shameless bid for

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.179 
and so I'm this is a shameless bid for
the<00:03:00.069> northern<00:03:00.459> reader<00:03:00.760> because<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:02.409> think<00:03:02.980> that

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
the northern reader because I think that

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.949 
the northern reader because I think that
we<00:03:03.669> need<00:03:03.790> all<00:03:03.999> these<00:03:04.120> are<00:03:04.329> ladies<00:03:04.719> in<00:03:04.870> the

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
we need all these are ladies in the

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.959 
we need all these are ladies in the
north<00:03:05.139> there<00:03:05.290> are<00:03:05.409> ladies<00:03:05.650> everywhere<00:03:06.370> being

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:06.969 
north there are ladies everywhere being

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.119 
north there are ladies everywhere being
a<00:03:07.030> lady<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.480> not<00:03:07.689> where<00:03:07.870> you're<00:03:08.019> born<00:03:08.230> or<00:03:08.590> how

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
a lady is not where you're born or how

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.349 
a lady is not where you're born or how
rich<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.549> are<00:03:09.579> or<00:03:09.879> where<00:03:09.969> you<00:03:10.090> went<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.329> school

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
rich you are or where you went to school

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.330 
rich you are or where you went to school
it's<00:03:10.750> an<00:03:10.870> attitude<00:03:11.169> and<00:03:11.620> but<00:03:12.129> I<00:03:12.159> think

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
it's an attitude and but I think

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.879 
it's an attitude and but I think
northern<00:03:12.730> South<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.419> also<00:03:13.930> an<00:03:14.049> attitude<00:03:14.230> and

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
northern South is also an attitude and

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.069 
northern South is also an attitude and
what<00:03:15.639> I've<00:03:15.819> noticed<00:03:16.060> about<00:03:16.419> this<00:03:16.689> is<00:03:16.900> that

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
what I've noticed about this is that

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.229 
what I've noticed about this is that
people<00:03:17.349> are<00:03:17.469> proudly<00:03:17.799> northern<00:03:18.519> but<00:03:18.969> no<00:03:19.090> one

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
people are proudly northern but no one

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.000 
people are proudly northern but no one
close<00:03:19.419> around<00:03:19.750> saying<00:03:20.019> I'm<00:03:20.199> a<00:03:20.260> southerner

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
close around saying I'm a southerner

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.709 
close around saying I'm a southerner

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
myself but I don't go around saying I

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.099 
myself but I don't go around saying I
you<00:03:38.620> know<00:03:38.739> I<00:03:38.979> come<00:03:39.250> from<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.759> southwest<00:03:40.109> well

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
though maybe I should and I think that

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.429 
though maybe I should and I think that
part<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.389> reason<00:03:43.720> is<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:44.169> the<00:03:44.259> north

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 
part of the reason is is that the north

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.869 
part of the reason is is that the north
want<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.769> keep<00:03:44.919> the<00:03:45.069> North<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.459> themselves

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.210

to life sooo really you know
it<00:04:42.409> gives<00:04:42.589> us<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.800> bit<00:04:42.919> of<00:04:43.039> color<00:04:43.219> town<00:04:43.430> this

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.950 
it gives us a bit of color town this
country<00:04:43.909> it's<00:04:44.029> almost<00:04:44.210> them<00:04:44.389> is<00:04:44.509> it<00:04:44.629> a<00:04:44.719> mock

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
think it can be a mock thing and in you

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.469 
think it can be a mock thing and in you
know<00:04:48.919> it's<00:04:49.099> like<00:04:49.219> rival<00:04:49.610> football<00:04:49.999> teams<00:04:50.270> in

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.320 
the sense isn't it and of course we do
like<00:04:52.069> to<00:04:52.099> maintain<00:04:52.369> that<00:04:52.729> rivalry<00:04:53.119> but<00:04:53.270> I

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330
