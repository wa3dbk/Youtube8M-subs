00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
 [Applause] 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.490
 very happy to be with you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:15.330
 I actually came tonight so at the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:17.390
 request of my friend andré good it short the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.609
 little guy who were there the season 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.830
 so he's the one who finally asked me 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 it's not short, it does not matter 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.689
 since they just wanted me 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.430
 testify the I that I give that I 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:38.000
 make the living testimony of 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:43.110
 all that laughter actually came 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.219
 pick me up by taxi 2 2 by 2 1 kg and 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.670
 who brought me financially 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.129
 sorry then so much for me it's very 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.800
 precisely even the chapter that I do not 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.050
 did not want to address because of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.170
 the indecency of certain figures which this 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.439
 that laughter brought me on the plane 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:08.430
 therapeutic and especially in the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.930
 extent to which the functions 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.590
 of what is spiritually there 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.540
 the effectiveness of this 2 6 transported to 2 to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.430
 2 3 5 years 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:27.190
 no good father good driving license 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.300
 within to find there several 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:36.040
 times 7 this testimony in honor of 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:40.000
 of Andre who is small and that's it's in 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.510
 relying on this on this pedestal that I have 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.070
 conquered he had a notion that 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:52.150
 previously had never stirred me the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:57.640
 hand and that is there clarity in them 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:02.380
 ideas and yet you know the word 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.110
 to Bergson Henri Bergson says says nothing 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.350
 since he is 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.030
 died very, very frankly, deceased 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.530
 but he said he saw more exactly 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:22.260
 wrote finally we believe to take place who 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:26.520
 says the mechanics and that's a word 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:32.070
 very boy said cries to the 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:36.570
 art mechanics to a laugh can not 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:42.870
 to afford is this install 7 to 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:44.610
 so much so that no but of course then 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.230
 obviously people came to tell me 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.980
 right now but only we 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.380
 as long as this son does not have us 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.360
 have also found many times 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.770
 the them so I told them already 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.920
 I told them started by saying hello 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.580
 before unpacking 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.750
 and that's where they got closer 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.000
 and I tell them frankly me if 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.450
 laughter like like bergson the beautiful 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.480
 had wanted to be passed on and they have 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.640
 immediately retorted but but 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.290
 but then there I was a lot 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.540
 more net 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.860
 Thursday I do not understand a word of 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.260
 all your salads but for my part and 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.610
 that's where I really wanted 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.700
 precisely find a little this 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.049
 concept built into holidays based 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.420
 that is to say four more times 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.420
 when your bombs had taken over 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.610
 la France 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.290
 well I would have been unable but 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.120
 so unable to you for example from 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.140
 expose you let's put it relativity 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.100
 restricted and with laughter 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.700
 Well, I'm here so I'll tell you 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.800
 a few words give it this final 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.170
 finalization of relativistic theory 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.830
 gently restricted and you will see 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.810
 that everything 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.200
 everything will be in your name if you 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.959
 please because I get signed in 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.790
 backstage yes okay 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.760
 so I'm being warned that it's not up to 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.680
 what do we do if this is their first 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.030
 expectations of state rates 2 me do not 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.330
 do not mix everything I beg you 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.830
 let me explain this 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.370
 let's suppose a keeping so you take a 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.890
 guy in a train an idea in a 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.000
 train then of course if it's a 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.210
 French train hurt in point the bowl 1 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.550
 since 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.789
 hi and is very expensive he is going to have 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.330
 two hours late and if he wants to drink 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.400
 a beer 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.800
 it must be half an hour 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.349
 tail to the bar car and when he 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.900
 happens there is no more good beer then 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.389
 that's a phenom einstein has gone to 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.759
 pretty much totally next to this 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:09.009
 reality there in his theory there is 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.620
 virtually no trace of beer a 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.580
 few 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.520
 a hint of foam to all fart 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.979
 like as bergson was saying bergman 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.979
 and therefore keeping in a good train 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.270
 said he's not good any other you in 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.150
 take another one that is not in the 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.120
 train him and he is well not intended 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.470
 crappy and those already this 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.940
 that we call a little bit relative 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.129
 that is to say, I'm relatively 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.470
 better than you who are 2 but they do not get 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:41.470
 do not speak so be careful this is where 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:45.220
 comes the phenomenon of so it takes 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:48.419
 suppose this train and avoid a name not 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.419
 glazed in sarthe 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.729
 it's a joke that always has 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:58.020
 success in sarthe 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:02.159
 but glazed convoys of 11 euros 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:05.009
 top of the ceiling of 7 of this department 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.939
 of seven car cars trains a 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.180
 tac lamp 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:10.620
 that's fine then 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.509
 that's where I'm going to ask you not to 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:19.169
 not lose the thread the lamp a moment 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:21.090
 given it comes to him or what does the ray 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:26.699
 bright he goes in a straight line 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:29.529
 unless the market but it is not 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.779
 since there is no high beer 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:33.999
 then unparalleled einstein did not 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:38.169
 suspected of others in a straight line 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:41.289
 gold for whoever is in the train the 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:43.709
 lille the light went on 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.709
 ah ah 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.580
 but for the other also a moment 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.930
 given and here you begin to understand 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:57.980
 the light comes down on the floor 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.870
 the train well so for the one who is 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:05.390
 in the train of light is aisles 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:09.080
 the hall to and the for the other as the 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:13.760
 Train went over him to the Swiss 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:18.220
 the light went from there to the see is 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.220
 so yet in the at the same time 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:25.550
 Diallo said that the light of a 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:29.780
 built everything and the other said they were 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:31.940
 alive and three strokes or other 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.450
 against not prohibiting blows after 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.070
 eight minutes ended filigno 

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:39.230
 world says jonathan of love yes it's 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.510
 finished beating well relaxed valais 

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:44.090
 in your lodge well glued at least two 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.830
 MPs did not finish further 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.020
 among them did not drag for me yes 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.000
 but why françois cuckoo it's over 

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.500
 finished at eight minutes united you understand 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.890
 that you understand I had finished cousin 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.990
 decided 

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:57.850
 hello to you did you have infinite 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.850
 left head or clear paulet for the game
