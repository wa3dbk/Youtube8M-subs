00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.440
 hi everyone I 'm full of your 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.330
 installed and today we are going to prepare some 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.370
 roasted corncobs that is another those recipes 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.620
 perfect to do during the summer 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.870
 this method that we are going to use is a 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.669
 my favorites there are many but I 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.950
 I prefer this because we are going to leave 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.170
 leaves so that the cob leaves more 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.090
 juicy and have a lot more flavor like 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.920
 always in the sixth recipe can they 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.410
 find at the end of the video and in the 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.940
 information box and this video is 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.340
 a collaborative that I'm doing with 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.050
 my friend rose from the channel there hardware 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.210
 schepis and in his video 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.330
 rossi is going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.950
 pork scorched to the chin so 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.870
 I 'm going to leave the link for that video 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.790
 in the information box as 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.579
 also the link of your channel because 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.579
 has many recipes that are 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.579
 spectacular 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.280
 as I said earlier we are going to 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.800
 leave the leaves of the cob but with 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.760
 a pair of scissors we are going to remove the tips and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.760
 the top part 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.860
 yes 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.670
 and now we are going to remove the sheets but 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.920
 not completely let's leave more or 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.899
 less a space of an inch or two 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.899
 centimeters and a half at the bottom 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.800
 Y 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.060
 Y 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.990
 and finally we are going to remove all 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.159
 those threads or the hairs or the beard that 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.159
 they come inside the cob 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.240
 and then we're going to soak the ears 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.420
 in a pot with water or a bucket with water 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.430
 and we leave them there for 1 to 2 hours to 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.360
 that the leaves of the ears absorb 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.360
 well all that water 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.810
 and finally we are going to make the ears 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.270
 over medium heat for about 4 to 5 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.640
 minutes per side is very important 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.319
 of turning the ears around every four 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.319
 five minutes so they do not burn 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.260
 i 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.510
 in the end we clean the ears well 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.070
 We remove most of the leaves and 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.270
 we serve with our butter 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.270
 favorite and with salt 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:57.319
 and that's how simple they prepare 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:59.420
 delicious roasted corncobs and they are not 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.880
