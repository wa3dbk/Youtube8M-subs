very many magazines you're going to work
for<00:01:11.490> newspapers<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.360> opposed<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.810> magazines

the<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.010> type<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> modeling<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:15.119> is

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the the type of modeling you do is

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.969 
the the type of modeling you do is
different<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> requirements<00:01:16.860> are

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
different so the requirements are

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.010 
different so the requirements are
different<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.909> sometimes

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
different so you sometimes

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.080 
different so you sometimes
since<00:01:19.799> you're<00:01:19.979> modeling<00:01:20.280> clothes<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.880> come

from the department store you're not

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.249 
from the department store you're not
necessarily<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.330> need<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.810> sample

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
necessarily do you need to be sample

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.260 
necessarily do you need to be sample
size<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.890> that's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.880> bit<00:01:27.060> different

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
size so that's a little bit different

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.300 
size so that's a little bit different
sometimes<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.170> don't<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.280> know
