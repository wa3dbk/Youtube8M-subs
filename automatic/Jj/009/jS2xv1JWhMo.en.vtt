00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
laptop so you can find that if you're in

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.109 
laptop so you can find that if you're in
the<00:01:57.180> default<00:01:57.540> or<00:01:57.630> whatever<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.159> let's<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.060> on

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the default or whatever so let's get on

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.999 
the default or whatever so let's get on
with<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> rug<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
with this so we have a rug here and

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.350 
with this so we have a rug here and
that's<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.399> little<00:02:02.549> idea<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> bedroom

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
that's just a little idea for a bedroom

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.990 
that's just a little idea for a bedroom
I<00:02:03.659> think<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:03.960> that's<00:02:04.079> kind<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.500> similar<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
I think that that's kind of similar to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.059 
I think that that's kind of similar to
what<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.780> would<00:02:06.810> see<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.590> lot<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.799> bedrooms

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
what you would see in a lot of bedrooms

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.240 
what you would see in a lot of bedrooms

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.360 
just is great for like a table and I
don't<00:04:41.290> know<00:04:41.380> like<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:41.710> could<00:04:41.860> be<00:04:41.889> modern<00:04:42.250> it

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
don't know like it could be modern it

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.180 
don't know like it could be modern it
might<00:04:42.520> not<00:04:42.639> be<00:04:43.050> you<00:04:44.050> guys<00:04:44.290> can<00:04:44.530> decide<00:04:44.620> and

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
might not be you guys can decide and

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.710 
might not be you guys can decide and
here's<00:04:45.580> our<00:04:45.699> island<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.270> I<00:04:46.300> know<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.540> could

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
here's our island and I know you could

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.360 
here's our island and I know you could
probably<00:04:46.930> do<00:04:47.110> this<00:04:47.260> before<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.650> update<00:04:47.889> but

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
probably do this before the update but

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.850 
probably do this before the update but
that's<00:04:48.760> fine<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.360> then<00:04:50.289> we<00:04:50.410> have<00:04:50.560> some<00:04:50.770> of

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
that's fine and then we have some of

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.590 
that's fine and then we have some of
these<00:04:51.010> and<00:04:51.490> then<00:04:51.639> these<00:04:51.820> new<00:04:52.090> blocks<00:04:52.389> right

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
these and then these new blocks right

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.409 
these and then these new blocks right
here<00:04:53.050> are<00:04:53.260> good<00:04:53.500> four<00:04:53.860> pillars<00:04:54.460> and<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:55.210> thought

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
here are good four pillars and I thought

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.360 
here are good four pillars and I thought
it<00:04:55.630> would<00:04:55.750> be<00:04:55.960> nice<00:04:56.139> to<00:04:56.380> use<00:04:56.590> those<00:04:56.830> in<00:04:57.160> the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
it would be nice to use those in the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.090 
it would be nice to use those in the
kitchen<00:04:57.789> because<00:04:58.530> sometimes<00:04:59.530> you<00:04:59.650> see<00:04:59.889> that

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
kitchen because sometimes you see that

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.379 
kitchen because sometimes you see that
and<00:05:00.400> I<00:05:00.490> don't<00:05:00.639> know<00:05:00.699> it<00:05:00.820> kind<00:05:00.970> of<00:05:01.000> closes<00:05:01.330> it

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
and I don't know it kind of closes it

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.330 
and I don't know it kind of closes it
off<00:05:01.539> and<00:05:01.690> it<00:05:01.780> looks<00:05:01.900> nice<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.889> then<00:05:03.220> the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
off and it looks nice and then the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.250 
off and it looks nice and then the
