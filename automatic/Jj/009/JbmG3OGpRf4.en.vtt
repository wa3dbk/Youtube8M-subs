the confidence of the cons line it's a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.000 
the confidence of the cons line it's a
direct<00:00:15.900> repaint<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.920> original<00:00:17.550> skids<00:00:19.010> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
direct repaint of the original skids and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.500 
direct repaint of the original skids and
here<00:00:20.850> he<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.060> with<00:00:21.619> tuner<00:00:22.619> mudflap<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.510> just

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
here he is with tuner mudflap and just

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.320 
here he is with tuner mudflap and just
like<00:00:24.660> tuner<00:00:24.990> mudflap<00:00:26.390> he<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:29.330> direct

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
like tuner mudflap he is a a direct

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.410 
like tuner mudflap he is a a direct
repaint<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.550> earlier<00:00:32.550> version<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.059> skids

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
repaint of the earlier version of skids

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.680 
repaint of the earlier version of skids
and<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.530> think<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.460> mudflap<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.510> well

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and I think just like mudflap as well

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.740 
and I think just like mudflap as well
there<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:38.309> guy's<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> lot<00:00:38.940> better<00:00:39.239> than<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
there this guy's a lot better than the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.440 
there this guy's a lot better than the

this<00:00:42.750> guy<00:00:42.930> check<00:00:43.170> out<00:00:43.320> my<00:00:43.440> review<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.800> him<00:00:44.489> on

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
this guy check out my review of him on

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.020 
this guy check out my review of him on
my<00:00:44.820> channel<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.600> he<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.989> definitely

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
my channel and I think he I definitely

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.360 
my channel and I think he I definitely
think<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.210> he<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.690> better<00:00:48.930> than<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
think that he is better than the the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.040 
think that he is better than the the
first<00:00:50.640> mudflap<00:00:51.440> in<00:00:52.440> terms<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.860> paint<00:00:53.960> even<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
first mudflap in terms of paint even the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.040 
first mudflap in terms of paint even the
tightness<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> joints<00:00:56.340> much<00:00:56.910> better<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
tightness of the joints much better the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.889 
tightness of the joints much better the
same<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.350> true<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.969> nurse<00:01:00.149> kids<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.719> can

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
same is true for to nurse kids if I can

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.429 
same is true for to nurse kids if I can
just<00:01:01.079> stand<00:01:01.260> him<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:03.140> yeah

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
just stand him up yeah

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.910 
just stand him up yeah
his<00:01:05.400> green<00:01:05.790> color<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.900> think<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.260> lot<00:01:07.590> better

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
his green color is I think a lot better

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.130 
his green color is I think a lot better
a<00:01:08.040> lot<00:01:08.189> more<00:01:08.369> striking<00:01:09.180> than<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.630> original

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
a lot more striking than the original

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.210 
a lot more striking than the original
which<00:01:10.260> I'm<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> show<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.799> know<00:01:11.010> you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
which I'm going to show you know you

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.490 
which I'm going to show you know you
know<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> few<00:01:12.210> seconds<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.409> can

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
know what in a few seconds so as you can

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.980 
know what in a few seconds so as you can
see<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.670> color<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.240> green<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> lot

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
see that the color the green is a lot

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.530 
see that the color the green is a lot
darker<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.549> this

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.380 

metallic<00:01:25.189> orangey<00:01:27.320> gold<00:01:28.320> or<00:01:28.770> orangey<00:01:29.549> tangent

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
metallic orangey gold or orangey tangent

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.170 
metallic orangey gold or orangey tangent
a<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:31.079> bit<00:01:31.200> orange<00:01:31.619> pale<00:01:32.310> orange<00:01:32.579> metallic

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
a little bit orange pale orange metallic

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
a little bit orange pale orange metallic
pale<00:01:33.479> orange<00:01:33.720> color<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.439> his<00:01:35.009> limbs<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.890> some

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
pale orange color on his limbs and some

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.310 
pale orange color on his limbs and some
effect<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.600> green<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> lot

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
effect I think this green is a lot

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.490 
effect I think this green is a lot
closer<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> one<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> movie<00:01:42.290> but<00:01:43.290> but

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
closer to the one in the movie but but

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.039 
closer to the one in the movie but but
who<00:01:43.979> knows<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.420> wanna<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.899> one

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
who knows I I really wanna know this one

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.649 
who knows I I really wanna know this one
is<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.490> think<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.820> movie<00:01:48.060> color<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.420> somewhere

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
is I think the movie color is somewhere

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.100 
is I think the movie color is somewhere
in<00:01:48.780> between<00:01:48.899> these<00:01:49.680> two<00:01:49.979> shades<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> can't

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
in between these two shades but I can't

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.539 
in between these two shades but I can't
be<00:01:52.229> too<00:01:52.259> sure<00:01:52.439> about<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.250> anyway

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
be too sure about that but anyway

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.550 
be too sure about that but anyway
they're<00:01:54.060> exactly<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> same<00:01:54.630> same<00:01:55.110> gimmick

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
they're exactly the same same gimmick

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.179 
they're exactly the same same gimmick
same<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.880> alive<00:01:57.680> head-bobbing<00:01:58.680> gimmick<00:01:58.979> and

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
