00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.690 

starting<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.500> gain<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.160> little<00:03:41.310> sweat<00:03:41.670> going

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
starting to gain a little sweat going

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.610 
starting to gain a little sweat going
here

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:04:03.800 

a<00:03:49.709> little<00:03:50.580> forming<00:03:50.970> around<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.209> eyelids

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.059 

I<00:04:03.900> mean<00:04:04.500> after<00:04:04.650> having<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.190> seven<00:04:05.459> pot<00:04:05.640> brown

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
I mean after having the seven pot brown

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.350 
I mean after having the seven pot brown
this<00:04:08.069> is<00:04:08.220> nowhere<00:04:08.430> as<00:04:08.580> hot<00:04:08.790> as<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.970> seventh<00:04:09.239> top

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
this is nowhere as hot as a seventh top

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:17.590 
this is nowhere as hot as a seventh top
brown

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.449 

trying<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.440> determine<00:04:18.709> right<00:04:19.010> now<00:04:19.190> if<00:04:19.310> it's

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
trying to determine right now if it's

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.820 
trying to determine right now if it's
Pete<00:04:22.900> it's<00:04:23.900> certainly<00:04:24.200> not<00:04:24.350> getting<00:04:24.680> any

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
Pete it's certainly not getting any

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.320 
Pete it's certainly not getting any
hotter<00:04:25.540> so<00:04:27.040> I'm<00:04:28.040> basically<00:04:28.400> concluding<00:04:29.180> right

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
hotter so I'm basically concluding right

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.239 
hotter so I'm basically concluding right
now<00:04:29.510> that<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:29.840> Pete

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:35.249 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:39.259 

so<00:04:36.109> again<00:04:37.109> this<00:04:37.259> is<00:04:37.379> another<00:04:37.939> another<00:04:38.939> great

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:39.269 
so again this is another another great

too bad um

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.950 
too bad um
yeah<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:20.400> pepper<00:05:20.970> has<00:05:21.180> long<00:05:21.389> since<00:05:21.630> peaked

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
yeah the pepper has long since peaked

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.190 
yeah the pepper has long since peaked
it's<00:05:25.070> it's<00:05:26.150> nowhere<00:05:27.150> near<00:05:27.180> as<00:05:27.480> hot<00:05:27.660> as<00:05:27.810> before

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
it's it's nowhere near as hot as before

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.520 
it's it's nowhere near as hot as before
so<00:05:29.480> it<00:05:30.480> peaked<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.810> while<00:05:31.020> back<00:05:31.230> I<00:05:33.530> actually

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530

thought this is going to be a little
hotter<00:05:36.380> but<00:05:39.950> the<00:05:40.950> main<00:05:41.130> thing<00:05:41.190> those<00:05:41.700> the
