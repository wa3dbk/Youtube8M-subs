00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.130
 hello friends how about making a chocolate 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.590
 at home is not a very complicated process 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.330
 but if it takes time, so today 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.470
 in the kitchen of alimerka I will teach you 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.480
 to prepare a chocolate mousse 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.760
 white that is done in a moment and you go 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.019
 to see above it takes egg so the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.939
 you can take it easy in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.599
 any time of year the ingredients 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.059
 we need 35 grams of clouds 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.610
 75 grams of white chocolate about 25 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.469
 grams of butter with salt and 150 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.180
 milliliters of whipping cream so 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.680
 first thing we have to do is put 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.340
 a little bit of boiling water in a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.370
 saucepan with about 2 tablespoons 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.380
 It's enough 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.420
 well and this we put on a gentle fire 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.420
 and we add the clouds 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.559
 white chocolate 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.070
 and the butter 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.230
 and now we have to remove until it 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.700
 always melt on very soft heat to 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.030
 that we do not get burned and chocolate or 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.030
 clouds 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.460
 if you like chocolate a little more 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.290
 intense you can do it without problem with 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.040
 a dark chocolate with chocolate 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.600
 milk 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.369
 the only thing you can be playing a little with 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.110
 the amount of clouds you put a little 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.390
 more of clouds since like chocolate 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.680
 black is less sweet you put some 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.810
 few more that to taste 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.810
 let's now beat the cream a little 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.540
 it does not have to be mounted very firm 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.430
 that thickens a bit is enough 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.670
 with the blender we will give you a 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.670
 bit 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.400
 well, this is already 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.220
 and now we simply have to 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.500
 incorporate the cream into the mixture 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.970
 chocolate we will make it very soft 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.970
 so that the cream does not get too low 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.599
 with movement always enveloping we go 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.599
 mixing it little by little 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.410
 and we already have the cream with the cream 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.600
 chocolate well mixed and now 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.180
 simply in the goals or little 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.810
 where you want to serve it we are going to throw it 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.810
 will compile 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.459
 before putting it in the fridge we are going to 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.459
 cover it with a little bit of end paper 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.959
 all right 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.230
 Y 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.520
 and we 're going to leave him a few hours 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.900
 Ideally, you did it for the 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.780
 night and the next day I would be 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.770
 perfect but good with about 23 hours already 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.770
 will be ready to eat 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.910
 we already have a list of our muse carries 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.920
 a couple of hours in the fridge 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.069
 and now we can already is ready to 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.780
 eat 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.780
 I'm going to show what texture it has 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.230
 you'll see how spongy it is 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.640
 it remains perfect remember that this 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.050

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.819
