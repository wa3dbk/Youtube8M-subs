00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.180 
chin has nice solid protection there's
an<00:03:18.049> extra<00:03:18.290> kind<00:03:18.409> of<00:03:18.530> little<00:03:18.709> bent<00:03:18.890> for<00:03:19.069> some

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
an extra kind of little bent for some

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.500 
an extra kind of little bent for some
air<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.430> get<00:03:19.549> through<00:03:19.609> on<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.000> bottom<00:03:20.180> here<00:03:20.480> I

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
air to get through on the bottom here I

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.720 
air to get through on the bottom here I
think<00:03:20.780> that's<00:03:20.959> what<00:03:21.109> that<00:03:21.290> is<00:03:21.500> I'm<00:03:22.310> not<00:03:22.370> too

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
think that's what that is I'm not too

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.960 
think that's what that is I'm not too
crazy<00:03:23.000> about<00:03:23.269> this<00:03:23.660> style<00:03:24.160> but<00:03:25.160> it<00:03:25.730> was<00:03:25.849> the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
crazy about this style but it was the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.190 
crazy about this style but it was the
only<00:03:26.090> one<00:03:26.299> they<00:03:26.389> had<00:03:26.599> and<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:26.870> thought<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.109> was

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
only one they had and I thought it was

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.390 
only one they had and I thought it was
kind<00:03:27.349> of<00:03:27.410> worth<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.769> try<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.010> anyway

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
kind of worth it to try it anyway

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.180 
kind of worth it to try it anyway
$190<00:03:29.389> all<00:03:29.540> in<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.500> I'm<00:03:30.560> gonna<00:03:30.650> try<00:03:30.859> this<00:03:30.919> thing

increments so now that I have the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.710 
increments so now that I have the
headgear<00:04:46.490> on<00:04:46.880> let<00:04:47.060> me<00:04:47.180> give<00:04:47.300> you<00:04:47.420> a<00:04:47.450> quick

where<00:04:55.610> I've<00:04:55.850> broken<00:04:56.210> it<00:04:56.420> in<00:04:56.540> I<00:04:56.720> feel<00:04:56.930> like<00:04:57.050> I<00:04:57.140> do

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
where I've broken it in I feel like I do

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.360 
where I've broken it in I feel like I do
need<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.560> break<00:04:57.740> in<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.950> little<00:04:58.100> bit<00:04:58.220> it's<00:04:58.310> a

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
need to break in a little bit it's a

need to break in a little bit it's a
little<00:04:58.400> bit<00:04:58.820> stiff<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.870> pulls<00:05:00.170> my<00:05:00.410> chin<00:05:00.710> up<00:05:01.010> a

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
little bit stiff it pulls my chin up a

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.860 
little bit stiff it pulls my chin up a
little<00:05:01.310> bit<00:05:01.670> it's<00:05:01.850> not<00:05:02.060> necessarily

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
little bit it's not necessarily

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
comfortable but I can feel that it'll

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.310 
comfortable but I can feel that it'll
break<00:05:04.910> in<00:05:05.150> with<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.360> little<00:05:05.630> bit<00:05:05.750> of<00:05:05.780> use<00:05:06.050> and

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.480 
thing in a little bit does it be great
here's<00:05:45.200> a<00:05:45.230> question<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.710> lot<00:05:45.830> of<00:05:45.950> people<00:05:46.160> have

here's a question a lot of people have

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.130 
here's a question a lot of people have
and<00:05:46.880> it's<00:05:47.090> not<00:05:47.270> necessarily<00:05:47.690> a<00:05:47.840> deal-breaker

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
and it's not necessarily a deal-breaker

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.600 
and it's not necessarily a deal-breaker
for<00:05:48.590> me<00:05:48.740> I'm<00:05:48.860> gonna<00:05:48.980> do<00:05:49.160> it<00:05:49.250> for<00:05:49.340> the<00:05:49.430> first

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
for me I'm gonna do it for the first

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.420 
for me I'm gonna do it for the first
time<00:05:49.850> now<00:05:50.060> but<00:05:50.240> how<00:05:50.480> easy<00:05:50.810> is<00:05:51.080> it<00:05:51.110> to<00:05:51.440> unlatch

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
time now but how easy is it to unlatch

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.540 
time now but how easy is it to unlatch
this<00:05:53.030> boa<00:05:53.410> technology<00:05:54.410> not<00:05:54.590> with<00:05:54.980> a<00:05:55.010> boxing

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
a clumsy instrument

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.370 
a clumsy instrument
but<00:06:04.360> this<00:06:04.480> is<00:06:04.630> a<00:06:04.660> little<00:06:04.870> bit<00:06:05.020> more<00:06:05.110> delicate

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
but this is a little bit more delicate

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:12.930 
but this is a little bit more delicate
so<00:06:05.770> let's<00:06:05.920> see<00:06:06.100> how<00:06:06.220> that<00:06:06.430> works<00:06:07.290> love<00:06:11.940> velcro

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
so let's see how that works love velcro

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.680 
so let's see how that works love velcro
latch<00:06:13.290> love<00:06:14.290> by<00:06:14.620> the<00:06:14.650> way<00:06:15.240> highly<00:06:16.240> recommend

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
latch love by the way highly recommend

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.950 
latch love by the way highly recommend
it

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
it

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.260 
it
so<00:06:17.800> here<00:06:17.980> it<00:06:18.040> goes<00:06:18.220> I'm<00:06:18.490> going<00:06:18.610> to<00:06:18.670> take<00:06:18.910> this

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:29.090 

super<00:06:22.270> easy<00:06:22.470> completely<00:06:26.790> yeah<00:06:27.790> that's<00:06:28.210> easier

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
super easy completely yeah that's easier

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.410 
super easy completely yeah that's easier
that<00:06:30.100> was<00:06:30.220> easier<00:06:30.610> than<00:06:30.910> taking<00:06:31.060> off<00:06:31.330> a

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
that was easier than taking off a

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.500 
that was easier than taking off a
regular<00:06:31.780> headgear<00:06:32.170> def<00:06:32.470> one<00:06:32.800> hand<00:06:33.100> easy<00:06:33.910> you

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
regular headgear def one hand easy you

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.000 
regular headgear def one hand easy you
don't<00:06:34.600> have<00:06:34.750> to<00:06:35.050> unlatch<00:06:35.380> anything<00:06:35.890> you<00:06:35.950> just

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
don't have to unlatch anything you just

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.500 
don't have to unlatch anything you just
pull<00:06:36.340> the<00:06:36.460> button<00:06:36.610> and<00:06:36.820> pull<00:06:37.030> the<00:06:37.060> thing<00:06:37.330> off

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
pull the button and pull the thing off

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.960 
pull the button and pull the thing off
so<00:06:37.750> that's<00:06:38.320> a<00:06:38.500> plus<00:06:38.740> there<00:06:39.010> it<00:06:39.310> wasn't<00:06:39.700> like<00:06:39.850> I

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
so that's a plus there it wasn't like I

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.300 
so that's a plus there it wasn't like I
said<00:06:40.240> a<00:06:40.480> make<00:06:40.750> or<00:06:40.900> break<00:06:40.960> as<00:06:41.560> far<00:06:41.920> as<00:06:42.040> to<00:06:42.190> how

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
said a make or break as far as to how

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.060 
said a make or break as far as to how
good<00:06:42.580> I<00:06:42.990> eventually<00:06:43.990> think<00:06:44.560> the<00:06:44.710> thing<00:06:44.920> will

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
good I eventually think the thing will

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.910 
good I eventually think the thing will
be<00:06:45.190> once<00:06:45.460> I<00:06:45.550> have<00:06:45.670> a<00:06:45.700> more<00:06:46.000> informed<00:06:46.510> decision

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920 
be once I have a more informed decision

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.910 
be once I have a more informed decision
but<00:06:47.920> uh<00:06:48.270> it<00:06:49.270> definitely<00:06:49.930> is<00:06:50.320> a<00:06:50.380> cool<00:06:50.740> little
