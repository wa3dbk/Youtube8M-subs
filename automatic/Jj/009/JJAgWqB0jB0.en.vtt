coming<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.850> from<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> campaign<00:02:27.420> map<00:02:27.630> well<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
coming in from the campaign map well it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.330 
coming in from the campaign map well it
will<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.380> certain<00:02:28.650> objectives<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> complete

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
will have certain objectives to complete

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.000

now<00:02:30.300> those<00:02:30.810> objectives<00:02:31.290> we've<00:02:31.470> loosened<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
now those objectives we've loosened the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.949 
now those objectives we've loosened the
coupling<00:02:32.400> between<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.910> two<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.390> they<00:02:33.810> as

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
coupling between the two so that they as

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.410 
coupling between the two so that they as
now<00:02:34.140> should<00:02:34.620> be<00:02:34.769> more<00:02:34.920> flexible<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.150> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
now should be more flexible so that is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.060 
now should be more flexible so that is
if<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:36.840> completely<00:02:37.290> outnumbered<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
if it's completely outnumbered on the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
attack it might be a bit defensive or

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.380 
attack it might be a bit defensive or
vice<00:02:40.890> versa<00:02:41.160> if<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:41.910> massively

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
vice versa if it's massively

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.300

overpowering<00:02:43.019> on<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.170> defense<00:02:43.500> in<00:02:43.920> might<00:02:44.160> be

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
overpowering on the defense in might be

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.759 
overpowering on the defense in might be
aggressive<00:02:44.730> okay<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.360> as<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.530> see<00:02:46.650> now

using my cavalry from a hidden position

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.960 
using my cavalry from a hidden position
I'm<00:04:39.530> hoping<00:04:40.039> this<00:04:40.159> is<00:04:40.310> attacking<00:04:40.729> what<00:04:40.820> will

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
I'm hoping this is attacking what will

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.550 
I'm hoping this is attacking what will
work<00:04:41.150> on<00:04:41.360> some<00:04:41.750> occasion<00:04:42.110> if<00:04:42.229> you've<00:04:42.380> got

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
work on some occasion if you've got

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.010 
work on some occasion if you've got
speed<00:04:42.830> yes<00:04:43.190> awesome<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.389> AI<00:04:44.510> can<00:04:44.780> actually

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
speed yes awesome so the AI can actually

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.510 
speed yes awesome so the AI can actually
be<00:04:45.080> taken<00:04:45.380> by<00:04:45.740> surprise<00:04:45.800> it's<00:04:46.250> not<00:04:46.310> going<00:04:46.460> to
