00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
training and it teaches them that you're

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580 
training and it teaches them that you're
pleased<00:01:20.399> with<00:01:20.580> what<00:01:20.759> they've<00:01:20.909> done<00:01:21.440> by<00:01:22.440> giving

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
pleased with what they've done by giving

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.300

them the tree I use a treat bag you look
a<00:01:26.399> bit<00:01:26.430> silly<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.020> find<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.830> very<00:01:28.860> useful

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
a bit silly but I find it very useful

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.490 
a bit silly but I find it very useful
and<00:01:29.580> because<00:01:30.539> it<00:01:30.810> means<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.049> don't<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.229> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and because it means I don't have to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.370 
and because it means I don't have to
come<00:01:32.159> around<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.549> pockets<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.200> once<00:01:34.200> you've

next<00:03:03.180> step<00:03:03.330> establish<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.170> your<00:03:04.349> dog<00:03:04.500> is

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
next step establish and your dog is

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.040 

next<00:03:28.800> step<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.130> set<00:03:29.640> back<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.210> you're<00:03:30.870> going
