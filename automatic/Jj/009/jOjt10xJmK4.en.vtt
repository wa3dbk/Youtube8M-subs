00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:20.220
 probably hard to find a man who 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.210
 would remember your childhood with 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.789
 pleasure well, that is, of course there are 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:33.600
 completely pathological circumstances 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:36.989
 and family plan and public and i 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.239
 For example, I believe that Sergei Vladimirovich 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.910
 Mikhalkov 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.320
 even in the most advanced years hardly 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.500
 recalled 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:54.809
 homeless period of his childhood with 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:57.210
 tenderness but so rare and grave 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.800
 exceptions only prove the rule 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.570
 childhood we all like and their and how 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:11.070
 someone else's rule well, there are of course exceptions 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.740
 like childfree movement but this is already 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.420
 rather psychiatric department 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.420
 pass hardly 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.770
 a significant proportion of people will want to return to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.189
 his childhood and repeat it though 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:35.670
 that childhood is not only a trial era 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:40.400
 mistakes that of course we in childhood 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:44.250
 forgive but we ourselves then often 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:50.670
 remember these mistakes with horror in me 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:54.090
 for example, there are a couple of episodes in childhood 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.719
 which I under no circumstances 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.810
 I would not like to repeat and there is still 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.020
 several episodes that you can of course 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.959
 relive but really do not want to but 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.440
 fortunately nature gives us the opportunity 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.250
 worry in 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:20.090
 yeah childhood and adulthood 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.080
 the term infantile behavior is just 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.450
 indicates such a possibility when 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.590
 adult in general then the person behaves 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.630
 quite childish and since 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:44.080
 our childhood is a very difficult period 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:47.690
 period when we learn a lot of new 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.330
 actually the whole world gradually comprehend 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.130
 learn yourself in this world like to enter a 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.710
 then even 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.540
 extract some benefits from it 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:06.760
 it is clear that the extension of this one 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:10.700
 child state of comprehending the world and 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:16.880
 survival in the world in general can even be 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:19.510
 very useful to become me myself often 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.940
 accused of infantilism 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:29.870
 mainly when a renewed my 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.959
 quite childish curiosity so what 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:38.120
 sin to conceal the same childish unwillingness 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:42.380
 reckon with generally accepted norms yet and 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.380
 as long as the utility of these norms is not 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.220
 tested in my own skin but i 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:53.769
 I believe that without such a child 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:59.080
 approach to the world I would have long ago 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:03.250
 stopped in its development and hardly 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.980
 could say anything really 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:11.060
 new fresh to others actually even 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.110
 that I so willingly participate in 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.359
 intellectual games which though 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:22.870
 intellectual but still games it 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:26.740
 may also be related 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.160
 protracted childhood and in my opinion it 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.979
 even useful at least as far as I am 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.710
 I can judge by the part accessible to me 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.860
 statistics people succeeded in 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.710
 mind games 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.360
 much more often the average goes 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.470
 turn out to be successful in other types 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.729
 activities 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:53.889
 but it's understandable that children's curiosity and 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:57.010
 childish desire to comprehend the world is far 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:00.510
 not the only thing we experience in 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:05.490
 childhood childhood irresponsibility 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:08.770
 such is understandable and explainable in 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:12.120
 children who just don't understand yet 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.190
 how complicated the world is and accordingly not 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.280
 understand the consequences of their actions and 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.770
 can not answer for these consequences but 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.330
 such as children with no responsibility at 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.639
 an adult at least 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.410
 dangerous at best dangerous for him 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.599
 of himself 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.620
 but unfortunately much more dangerous for 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.039
 surrounding 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.880
 I think anyone who is watching me now 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:43.169
 easily remember at least 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.630
 least one frank example 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:49.410
 infantilism of a person occupying 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.400
 very high state post 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:56.699
 having visited 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:06:00.960
 over the past 20 years on quite a few 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:06.370
 very high government positions and 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:09.699
 will figure out what the consequences of this 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.190
 infantile irresponsibility will not 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:16.050
 list these effects exactly 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:20.410
 because we can all observe 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:25.320
 not too naked eye but understandable 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:28.470
 what is the reverse side of the same 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.780
 infantilism i'm naturally not 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.860
 going to give any recipes 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.400
 struggle with infantilism 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.870
 if only because I personally do not 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:45.639
 interested in this fight but I suppose 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:49.120
 what should at least be aware 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.300
 the existence of two sides of immaturity 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.250
 this 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:58.569
 and the ability for quick progress and not 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:01.310
 ability to evaluate 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:06.020
 destructive effects of their own 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:09.379
 action is it possible to completely separate these 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:13.210
 two sides apart I don't know but by 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:15.830
 at least I try myself 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.560
 calculate the consequences of their 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.710
 own actions of what and all my 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:25.029
 viewers suspect themselves benton 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.029
 criminal record I wish
