00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.769
 planet silencers 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.800
 removal of particulate filter on cars 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.800
 bmw x5 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.120
 This particulate filter will be removed from 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:52.670
 shells and coal he is given to whom 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:56.769
 mounting from on systems and output 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.769
 system removed from the car 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.560
 given mount mount carbon black 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.150
 filter 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.150
 car body 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.610
 then a diesel particulate filter along with flutes and 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.190
 connective detail retrieved 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.320
 this particulate filter consists 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:30.350
 immediate exact logic and 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:34.200
 catalyst after extraction on corrugation 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.970
 found damage 2 and will also 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.120
 changed to the soot body 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.120
 filter 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:54.020
 parts of the housing share the filter clogged and 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.200
 lost its performance 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.200
 metal catalyst 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.670
 work is capable and will be left in 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:09.960
 casing exhaust particulate filter 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.960
 the case is cut a hole 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.220
 through this hole the particulate filter will 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.220
 ruined 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.240
 and extracted speed 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.290
 all parts by the belly and drawn 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.710
 all cut parts of the body are black 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.210
 the filter is assigned to you too 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.260
 anchored triangle carved out 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.260
 particulate filter housing 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:11.040
 metal catalyst 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.400
 blown by the air it will stay in 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.400
 housing 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.900
 collect the particulate filter housing 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.760
 the old corrugation was cut and replaced by 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.489
 new 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.890
 bob vs interlock provided with 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.200
 stainless steel internal layer 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.319
 become 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.680
 all seams of the particulate filter housing 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.680
 boil thoroughly 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.380
 set thermal protection and fix 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.380
 on the case 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.560
 installed new gopro extract particulate 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.390
 vitalizer filter remained in the housing 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.870
 particulate filter housing mounted on 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.870
 regular place 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.680
 secure 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.680
 to regular attachment points 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.640
 there is 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.640
 install pathos system 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.130
 connecting pipe is applied 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.130
 sealant 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:53.040
 then exhaust system parts 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.040
 connect clamped screw 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:01.490
 exhaust system repair is over 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.490
 panel is installed bottom 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.860
 warranty on all work performed and 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.860
 installed components on carador
