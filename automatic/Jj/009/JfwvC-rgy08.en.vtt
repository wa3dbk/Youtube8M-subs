00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
live inside the bag with a napkin method

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.420 
live inside the bag with a napkin method
for<00:00:28.810> two<00:00:28.930> weeks

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430

like right now
okay<00:00:44.710> here's<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.820> feed<00:00:46.059> has<00:00:46.570> wrapped<00:00:47.079> in<00:00:47.379> here

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
okay here's the feed has wrapped in here

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:58.979 
okay here's the feed has wrapped in here
and<00:00:53.429> okay<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.960> as<00:00:56.140> you<00:00:56.260> can<00:00:56.409> see<00:00:56.469> um<00:00:57.839> so<00:00:58.839> it's

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
kind of expecting this this over here is

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.290 
kind of expecting this this over here is
the<00:01:01.329> root<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.890> you<00:01:03.039> can<00:01:03.219> see<00:01:03.429> it<00:01:03.550> has<00:01:03.760> some

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
the root as you can see it has some

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.930 
the root as you can see it has some
little<00:01:04.479> hairs<00:01:04.870> in<00:01:05.140> here<00:01:05.500> that's<00:01:06.460> part<00:01:06.729> of<00:01:06.790> the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
little hairs in here that's part of the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.410 
little hairs in here that's part of the
root<00:01:07.590> my<00:01:08.590> previous<00:01:09.010> mango<00:01:09.490> by<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:09.940> second

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
root my previous mango by the second

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.210 
root my previous mango by the second
week<00:01:10.540> was<00:01:11.170> already<00:01:11.440> starting<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:11.890> grow<00:01:12.100> the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
week was already starting to grow the

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.570 
week was already starting to grow the
root<00:01:12.370> but<00:01:12.549> I<00:01:12.610> planted<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.150> right<00:01:13.180> away<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:15.010> I

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
root but I planted it right away so I

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.370 
root but I planted it right away so I
didn't<00:01:16.180> really<00:01:16.390> see<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:16.540> root<00:01:16.780> because<00:01:17.020> he

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
didn't really see the root because he

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.520 
didn't really see the root because he
was<00:01:17.500> under<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.130> soil<00:01:18.340> with<00:01:18.730> this<00:01:18.880> one<00:01:19.030> well<00:01:19.540> as

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
was under the soil with this one well as

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.170 
was under the soil with this one well as
you<00:01:20.680> can<00:01:20.830> see<00:01:20.950> it's<00:01:21.040> over<00:01:21.190> there<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:21.790> that's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
you can see it's over there so that's

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.570 
you can see it's over there so that's
the<00:01:22.390> wave<00:01:22.600> where<00:01:22.780> it<00:01:22.870> grows<00:01:23.050> and<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:24.400> is<00:01:24.550> a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
the wave where it grows and this is a

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.890 
the wave where it grows and this is a
little<00:01:24.910> stem<00:01:25.180> that's<00:01:25.420> supposed<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:25.840> be

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
little stem that's supposed to be

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.130 
little stem that's supposed to be
growing<00:01:26.200> so<00:01:26.560> what<00:01:26.680> we're<00:01:26.830> gonna<00:01:26.950> do<00:01:27.190> today<00:01:27.400> is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
growing so what we're gonna do today is

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.200 
growing so what we're gonna do today is
in<00:01:29.140> this<00:01:29.410> container<00:01:30.190> that<00:01:30.370> I<00:01:30.550> were<00:01:30.790> prepared

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
in this container that I were prepared

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.930 
in this container that I were prepared
which<00:01:31.510> was<00:01:31.750> a<00:01:32.140> water<00:01:32.860> container<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.580> just

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
which was a water container I just

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.330 
which was a water container I just
filled<00:01:34.570> it<00:01:34.690> with<00:01:34.720> some<00:01:35.020> compost<00:01:35.410> and<00:01:35.890> some

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
filled it with some compost and some

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.960 
filled it with some compost and some
worm<00:01:36.610> casting<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.780> soil<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.730> what<00:01:39.730> you<00:01:39.850> do

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
worm casting and soil and what you do

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.250 
worm casting and soil and what you do
with<00:01:40.120> a<00:01:40.150> mango<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.890> just<00:01:42.130> lay<00:01:42.760> it<00:01:42.820> like<00:01:42.970> that

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
with a mango you just lay it like that

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.450 
with a mango you just lay it like that
well<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.380> other<00:01:44.530> one<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.800> light<00:01:45.130> like<00:01:45.430> that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
well the other one I light like that

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.160 
well the other one I light like that
that's<00:01:45.970> all<00:01:46.120> you<00:01:46.210> have<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.450> do<00:01:46.570> in<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:47.050> root

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
that's all you have to do in the root

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.040 
that's all you have to do in the root
will<00:01:47.350> find<00:01:47.560> its<00:01:47.710> way<00:01:47.800> with<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:48.970> one<00:01:49.050> because

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
will find its way with this one because

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.280 
will find its way with this one because
the<00:01:50.290> roots<00:01:50.500> already<00:01:50.950> out<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:53.140> what

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
the roots already out I think that what

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.430 
the roots already out I think that what
I'm<00:01:53.380> gonna<00:01:53.500> do<00:01:53.800> is<00:01:54.010> just<00:01:55.860> likely<00:01:56.860> very<00:01:57.820> good

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
I'm gonna do is just likely very good

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.130 
I'm gonna do is just likely very good
just<00:01:59.440> like<00:01:59.650> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
just like that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.250 
just like that
and<00:02:01.800> so<00:02:02.220> what<00:02:02.820> I'm<00:02:03.030> telling<00:02:03.330> you<00:02:03.510> it<00:02:03.960> doesn't

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
and so what I'm telling you it doesn't

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.310 
and so what I'm telling you it doesn't
really<00:02:04.410> need<00:02:04.910> soil<00:02:05.910> on<00:02:06.240> top<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.140> it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
really need soil on top of it and if it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.010 
really need soil on top of it and if it
does<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.830> it's<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.149> little<00:02:09.360> bit<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.720> that

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
does it it's just a little bit that that

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.250 
does it it's just a little bit that that
you<00:02:10.710> might<00:02:10.920> want<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.460> put<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.760> top<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.260> you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you might want to put on top of it you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.050 
you might want to put on top of it you
see<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.530> blend<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.130> smart<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.640> there

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
see this blend is really smart and there

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.060 
see this blend is really smart and there
it<00:02:15.210> will<00:02:15.300> find<00:02:15.600> its<00:02:15.750> way<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.350> what<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.890> have

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
it will find its way and what I have

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.160 
it will find its way and what I have
learned<00:02:17.100> since<00:02:17.520> last<00:02:17.760> time<00:02:18.030> it's<00:02:18.750> good<00:02:19.080> to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
learned since last time it's good to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.160 
learned since last time it's good to
have<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.550> kind<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.610> deep<00:02:20.880> container<00:02:21.330> because

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
have a kind of deep container because

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.590 
have a kind of deep container because
the<00:02:22.320> root<00:02:22.560> grows<00:02:23.720> long<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.140> down<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
the root grows long and down so in the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.300 
the root grows long and down so in the
meantime<00:02:27.780> while<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> grows<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> good

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
meantime while it grows this is a good

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.940 
meantime while it grows this is a good
container<00:02:29.550> maybe<00:02:29.940> later<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.300> will<00:02:30.450> just

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
container maybe later I will just

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.890 
container maybe later I will just
transplant<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.100> into<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.400> bigger<00:02:32.610> one<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.030> well

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
of leaves coming out new leaves these

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.400 
of leaves coming out new leaves these
are<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.940> old<00:04:09.090> leaves<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.780> ones<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.080> had

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
are the old leaves the ones that had

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.970 
are the old leaves the ones that had
first<00:04:10.739> were<00:04:11.160> removed

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
first were removed

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.460 
first were removed
when<00:04:12.550> transplanting<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.930> suffered<00:04:14.349> a

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
when transplanting and it suffered a

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.039 
when transplanting and it suffered a
little<00:04:14.709> bit<00:04:14.830> of<00:04:14.950> shock<00:04:15.280> about<00:04:16.120> a<00:04:16.150> week<00:04:16.690> and

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
little bit of shock about a week and

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.009 
little bit of shock about a week and
then<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.220> started<00:04:18.639> showing<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.299> growth<00:04:19.690> again

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
then it started showing the growth again

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.400 
then it started showing the growth again
so<00:04:20.859> basically<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.310> think<00:04:21.579> it<00:04:21.700> was<00:04:21.850> because<00:04:22.810> of

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
so basically I think it was because of

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.159 
so basically I think it was because of
the<00:04:23.710> transplanting<00:04:24.400> while<00:04:24.610> he<00:04:25.169> stabilized

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
the transplanting while he stabilized

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.680 
the transplanting while he stabilized
again<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.889> well<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.370> has<00:04:27.520> good<00:04:27.880> food<00:04:28.120> and

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
again and well it has good food and

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.750 
again and well it has good food and
fertilizer<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.919> all<00:04:30.040> that<00:04:30.250> stuff<00:04:30.550> so

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
fertilizer and all that stuff so

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.700 
fertilizer and all that stuff so
hopefully<00:04:31.450> we'll<00:04:32.020> see<00:04:32.139> what<00:04:32.290> happens<00:04:32.590> in

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
hopefully we'll see what happens in

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.520 
hopefully we'll see what happens in
