00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.710
 which we can advance to all 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.300
 obviously because if a machine also 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.369
 is the option to fall overboard and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.449
 hitting a relaxing bath that also 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.550

 that is something that can not be allowed in 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.770
 is our society today because 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.330
 go say we mean go back and that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.920
 society encourages us to be competitive 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.750

 the important thing really I shut up for 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.010
 rest a second you know go back to 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.079
 to the game ring also known as 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.810
 good roads we are on a bridge 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.870

 the wall of vo lad appears because I 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.209
 they are going to basically catch us because of it we see 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.200
 over here with careful without worth and 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.030

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.629
 stripper slowly the speed of a 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:50.330
 turtle and I fall explanation has its 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:53.150
 uncle it seems that when you concentrate you 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.080
 they come out but things therefore do not 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.810
 study for exams that do not 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.670
 brain goes but please has seen and has 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.629
 been saying we have killed is the karma 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.900

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.160
 has escaped because if enough 20 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.269
 because I get to do with trias and tunes 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.280
 obviously, people take advantage of my 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.900
 nonsense and that I was but quiet 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.950

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.310
 going forward 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.880
 so far as 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.350
 little by little we go up the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.140
 bridge i have it i got it i got it what 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:41.330
 I have I have it and we are already here 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.620

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.760
 backwards 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.960

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.060
 behind we are down here we caught this 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.070

 anything we put us here it arrived 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.130
 this little point we are missing three points of 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.320
 control to finish the race we 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.479
 we get through that detour, we turn 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:35.740

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.550
 from the global point of view and 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:49.150
 inverted end to finish 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.150
 very cool ethical 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.780
