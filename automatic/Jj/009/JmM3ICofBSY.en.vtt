you have a core or you have a unit
that's<00:00:45.800> malfunctioned<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.980> you'd<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that's malfunctioned and you'd like to

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
have it repaired might as well have a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.360 
have it repaired might as well have a
working<00:00:51.600> unit<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:52.230> your<00:00:52.260> shelf<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.949> order<00:00:53.160> for

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
working unit on your shelf in order for

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.520 
working unit on your shelf in order for
you<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.670> able<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.140> replace<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.199> immediately

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you to be able to replace it immediately

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.670 
you to be able to replace it immediately
and<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.489> needed<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:57.690> would<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.140> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and as it needed that would be one and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.349 
and as it needed that would be one and
probably<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.160> most<00:00:59.340> common<00:00:59.730> scenario<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
probably the most common scenario the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.790 
probably the most common scenario the
second<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> unit<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.649> has

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
second is that you have a unit that has

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.399 
second is that you have a unit that has
failed<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.660> you're<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.930> remove<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
failed and you're going to remove it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.130 
failed and you're going to remove it
from<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:06.030> live<00:01:06.299> without<00:01:06.540> that

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
from there and you can live without that

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.219 
from there and you can live without that
door<00:01:07.830> being<00:01:08.010> operable<00:01:08.810> for<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> amount<00:01:10.170> of

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
door being operable for the amount of

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.020 
door being operable for the amount of
time<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.710> takes<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.610> repaired

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
time that it takes to get it repaired

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.940 
time that it takes to get it repaired
that's<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:12.780> always<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> case<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that's not always the case because you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.469 
that's not always the case because you
generally<00:01:14.220> can't<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> door<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.270> of

generally can't take a door out of

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.380 
generally can't take a door out of
service<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.189> wait<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> repair<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.270> we

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
service and wait for the repair and we

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.060
