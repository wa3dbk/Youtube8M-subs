 we have a cubic hello for you 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.379
 there is not a cubic case at all 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.420
 that one company made me very 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.220
 advantageous offer and now my blog 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.000
 will no longer be dedicated to the desktop 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.089
 games are too boring and mainstream him 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.650

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:53.930

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.690

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.859

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:08.810
 most favorite and most requested by you 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.119
 board game monopoly unfortunately 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.789
 our program budget was not enough for 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.300
 the full version of this game will therefore have to 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.280
 settle for a compact script we 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.950
 you also did not write 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.710
 and also tells me that in two 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.690
 minutes we turn off the light so nafig 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.270
 See these insertion video let's in 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.710
 the game will talk about and so similar game 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.369
 monopoly 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.890
 this is the real deep complex 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.189
 variable economic strategy for 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.890
 those who love big hardcore games 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.840
 there is no place Randa no place cube 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.939
 Do not pay attention that they are here on 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.950
 the box painted them just inside 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.250
 put speak can't be 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.409
 board games pes cubes and so in this 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.450
 board game in this deepest 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.820
 most sophisticated ancient tuned 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.600
 strategies you will have to buy 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.200
 real estate 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.729
 game takes cash 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.929
 electronic payments and bank cards and 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.120
 many other payment methods 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.549
 to make a move in this game is not necessary 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.920
 throwing dice is just too banal and 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.170
 uninteresting need to calculate complicated 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.290
 long mathematical formula with 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.269
 logarithms is a formula and will show on 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.380
 how many steps can move in 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.920
 given move your character as 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:35.680
 gaming chips by the way here you can choose 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.069
 iron hat ship car boots and 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.280
 the dog 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.950
 what does the dog in this group 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.489
 inanimate objects I personally concept 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.180
 I have not 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.879
 so here stepping on the real estate cell 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.129
 players need to pay the owner of this 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.670
 real estate pay as I said 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.430
 can 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.170
 own wallet money if 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.079
 you player cash does not remain 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.260
 he will probably have to pledge 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:06.889
 the car at the apartment may be 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.069
 give something out of clothes and so in 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:12.519
 general in this game you can go to jail 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:17.269

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:20.419
 getting caught on bribes even even 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.030
 give money to charity in 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:25.069
 general monopoly is what kind of game 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.459
 Well, you can just ohrenet by 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.519

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.519
