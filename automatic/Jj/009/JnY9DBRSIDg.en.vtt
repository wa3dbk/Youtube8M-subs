00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.980
 boys are doing a performance 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.080
 very big plus they have to do a thousand 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.849
 things and then our darlings 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.830
 Special guests are outside but 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.360
 look like this is that you live in this moment 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.370

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.370
 the pod we're going to talk for some 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.610
 A) Yes 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:42.199
 It's very cool, it's not very good 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.660

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.170
 they have the entrance 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.250
 from here 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.870
 since Friday what has happened which is 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.289
 his impression as a fan of this 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.289

 right now, I'm expecting a lot 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.210
 things because the truth has made us 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.890
 expect too much and I think they owed him 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.260
 have given more importance to the band 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.000
 because they come from another country and I think 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.000

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.170
