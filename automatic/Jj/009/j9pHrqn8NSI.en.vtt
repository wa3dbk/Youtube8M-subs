00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.730
 theo told us great news this morning 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.779
 his sporting career 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.570
 the midfielder currently 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.120
 reflects their severe knee injury goltz 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.710
 namely the office and the future 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.789
 well that after this season I stop this 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.439
 Of course I will not go anymore of course 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.910
 so that people play that to me 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.250
 See more on the field 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.650
 which is actually the news so that you 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.480
 that you stop spinning for a long time 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.480
 that choice 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 it is not too bad actually I have whole 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.149
 long thought of you know I'm going this is now 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.010
 play a few more games because 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.809
 it went well with rehabilitation so I had 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.000
 you know something like that if that works then 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.070
 I can be a nice way closure 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.420
 then the driver got over it and that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.719
 has actually been the point that it 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.410
 to cut me a little and noticed 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.360
 vitesse too 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.090
 and then they are right in action 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.430
 come and have a conversation with me 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.199
 and we came out so I stay 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.160
 active anyway for the next five years 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.359
 so remains yes in a different role 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.789
 no longer as a soccer player 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.489
 and what do you do I go I scouting 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.560
 I'm going I'm going to work that will make the throws themselves 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.510
 parts of my work will just lie there 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.159
 i also go nice part i go with the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.260
 talents of the from vitesse between those 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.780
 have a talent group and there I will 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.430
 also start giving trainings there 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.259
 I will also be shown 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.729
 do you need a trainer's diploma for this? 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.369
 he also get it 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.100
 my first instance not like me 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.360
 you have a team yourself one goes and ate it 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.310
 nic you might be a trainer 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.759
 I would never have that but 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.380
 as 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.329
 specialists train as midfielder 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.630
 this is not necessary for midfielders 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.049
 and can I do without paper this went 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.210
 is becoming 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.540
 scout is it cold for us or the youth 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.830
 the first team first team and and 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.960
 youth 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.870
 here the limit is likely 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.120
 to the boys of a year 15 16 to 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.670
 up to 18 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.250
 it suited your ambitions to her 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.050
 otherwise I had this not something I was 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.730
 disagree with this 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.450
 yes i really like we also from the field 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.700
 so not every day on the field again 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.020
 timon have the fashion see it now 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.270
 maybe just a few more years 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.679
 not for the time being and just when I got this one 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.200
 position were offered when I had 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.760
 kind of yes this is what i want and 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.520
 yes I now have the time in the coming months 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.940
 to order for there she was kind to 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.070
 to watch 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.150
 a year and a half ago, our kiwi returned 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.220
 on the Arnhem nest 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.990
 after successful outings at fc 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.430
 twente and ajax 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.380
 sew the vitesse or make a wish come true 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.180
 us and still learn to finish in arnhem 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.050
 close I'm glad I could 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.520
 conclude that that first only yes it 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.500
 is a pity that I met the prices 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.910
 have picked up at other clubs and me 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.860
 would have liked to continue testing also one 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.470
 prize you won but that is unfortunately 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.150
 unfortunately not successful and your period 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.040
 your second period does not say earlier moment 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.730
 that you can go back a year and a half ago 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.730
 how did you experience it? 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.350
 then positive means too many players 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.440
 Experience was always fun 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.390
 so we get to know many boys yes 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.610
 vitesse is in calmer waters 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.650
 ground of course to na 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.720
 after i left the play was over 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.970
 position 1415 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.530
 in the end it got a little better with it 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.900
 again position 9 or 8 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.730
 but yes now you play along to the top 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.050
 places and that is always nice that 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.370
 you again european marriages play 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.620
 for my club maybe that test is 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.750
 needed and your first period the us is long 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.480
 ago as a young man i only 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.920
 how do you look back there if they like them 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.980
 perhaps the nicest period 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.600
 goal then you just come in somewhere 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.840
 that runs and I am so audio player too 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.459
 juror point you stop forest 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.320
 source my thumb I started with that 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.070
 And that is something you what you do 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.690
 never forget because you are taught 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.670
 actually from the car and nowadays 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.730
 That is quite different in the head when I 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.680
 when it first came to play I think 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.260
 four five youngsters in the team in the s 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.330
 were old boys and the direction 30 already 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.550
 and that is new now you have turned around 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.500
 a 2 players of 30 and the western whole 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.319
 very young so the football is different 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.010
 but that is no less 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.780
 become 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.740
 who first come family link to the titie 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.740
 connection groove 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.640
 jansen has a nice kick is the 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.640
 left shoe which demonstrates 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.660
 wishing bol.com new or centi 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.490
 but I am seeing that people were only 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.680
 that was a pretty tab 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.169
 so I can imagine that we want them to be the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.590
 two but two voice 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.620
 and then I jumped in the arms of 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.139
 pothuizen yes ours played in total 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.600
 2 min 42 matches in yellow black 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.669
 in which he scored 23 times 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.530
 he does not enter a prize pool in arnhem 0 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.389
 enschede and amsterdam 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.090
 in 2010 arnhemse 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.550
 public favorite up to 120 and two years 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.110
 later in 2012 with ajax 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.080
 yes the highlight that especially the first 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.160
 was a difficult year for me a lot 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.710
 happened 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.449
 and that after such a year you do something like that 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.340
 I could have achieved beautiful things there 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.080
 so proud of that is absolutely me 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.699
 Highlights and yes I will San Diego 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.780
 highlights year played champion 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.090
 become 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.560
 we played almost everything important 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.919
 also been second ate of season so 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.509
 no i am positive about that 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.830
 about that price again a golden shoe 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.419
 best games won 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.740
 yes then as a year thereafter my best 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.810
 I think so 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.370
 stick the only yes I think I am on 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.310
 number ten have played and want 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.289
 decisive was to become films and yes that is 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.620
 I think I hit my best football 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.620
 to race
