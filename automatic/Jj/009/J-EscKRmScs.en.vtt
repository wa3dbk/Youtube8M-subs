narrow<00:03:31.030> one<00:03:31.330> lil<00:03:31.540> Jaffe<00:03:31.870> what<00:03:32.290> do<00:03:32.380> we<00:03:32.440> learn

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
narrow one lil Jaffe what do we learn

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.940 
narrow one lil Jaffe what do we learn
from<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.910> we<00:03:33.910> learnt<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.390> we<00:03:34.620> we<00:03:35.620> really

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
from that we learnt that we we really

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.740 
from that we learnt that we we really
should<00:03:36.190> really<00:03:36.760> should<00:03:36.970> not<00:03:37.240> stay<00:03:37.450> off<00:03:37.600> the

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
should really should not stay off the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.880 
should really should not stay off the
guess<00:03:37.930> when<00:03:38.140> we<00:03:38.260> were<00:03:38.350> at<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.530> we<00:03:38.680> had<00:03:38.770> them

there dadless shouldn't chase back

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.660 
there dadless shouldn't chase back
that's<00:03:41.170> really<00:03:41.470> about<00:03:41.530> what<00:03:41.830> about<00:03:42.070> to<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.520> was

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
that's really about what about to it was

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.630 
that's really about what about to it was
to<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:42.970> we<00:03:43.770> we<00:03:44.770> work<00:03:44.980> we<00:03:45.190> weren't<00:03:45.400> good<00:03:45.610> for

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
to it we we work we weren't good for

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.220 
to it we we work we weren't good for
thats<00:03:45.940> for<00:03:46.240> a<00:03:46.270> win<00:03:46.450> we<00:03:46.630> was<00:03:46.750> definitely<00:03:46.930> good

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
thats for a win we was definitely good

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.450 
thats for a win we was definitely good
for<00:03:47.290> one<00:03:47.560> or<00:03:47.710> two<00:03:47.740> all<00:03:47.920> they<00:03:48.070> weren't<00:03:48.280> good

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
think really we gotta learn to basically

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.060 
think really we gotta learn to basically

brentford<00:05:11.940> again<00:05:12.680> what<00:05:13.680> you<00:05:13.800> think<00:05:13.980> about<00:05:16.340> the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
brentford again what you think about the

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.000

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
most most he'd need okay but I know he

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.480 
most most he'd need okay but I know he
does<00:05:20.190> um<00:05:21.000> if<00:05:21.510> you<00:05:21.690> want<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.990> go<00:05:22.140> home<00:05:23.040> if<00:05:23.220> we<00:05:23.340> get

does um if you want to go home if we get

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.700 
does um if you want to go home if we get
good<00:05:23.580> enough<00:05:23.700> fee<00:05:23.940> for<00:05:24.120> him<00:05:24.210> then<00:05:24.390> then<00:05:24.750> go<00:05:24.960> we

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
good enough fee for him then then go we

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.740 
good enough fee for him then then go we
should<00:05:25.890> have<00:05:25.980> won<00:05:26.130> tell<00:05:26.670> me<00:05:26.850> should<00:05:27.570> we<00:05:27.660> add

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
should have won tell me should we add

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.890 
should have won tell me should we add
room<00:05:27.990> or<00:05:28.380> should<00:05:28.590> we<00:05:28.680> ever<00:05:28.770> lost<00:05:28.980> a<00:05:29.900> point

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
room or should we ever lost a point

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.450 
room or should we ever lost a point
would<00:05:31.140> have<00:05:31.230> been<00:05:31.320> fair<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.920> think<00:05:32.100> we<00:05:32.340> had

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
would have been fair I think we had

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.280 
would have been fair I think we had
plenty<00:05:32.820> of<00:05:32.940> chances<00:05:33.000> I<00:05:33.600> think<00:05:33.900> we've<00:05:33.990> by<00:05:34.110> that

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
plenty of chances I think we've by that

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.570 
plenty of chances I think we've by that
of<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.440> rest<00:05:34.590> of<00:05:34.710> season<00:05:34.830> will<00:05:35.040> be<00:05:35.130> fine<00:05:35.310> I

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
of the rest of season will be fine I

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.820 
of the rest of season will be fine I
think<00:05:36.150> we'll<00:05:36.290> finish<00:05:37.290> in<00:05:37.500> a<00:05:37.560> comfortable

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
think we'll finish in a comfortable

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.010 
think we'll finish in a comfortable
position<00:05:38.000> but<00:05:39.000> listen<00:05:39.180> we're<00:05:39.720> not<00:05:39.810> gonna

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
hey ho what can we do we should have

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.050 
hey ho what can we do we should have
scored<00:06:08.550> a<00:06:08.670> few<00:06:09.500> it's<00:06:10.500> won<00:06:10.680> those<00:06:10.800> games<00:06:11.060> just

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
scored a few it's won those games just

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.420 
scored a few it's won those games just
one<00:06:12.210> of<00:06:12.270> those<00:06:12.360> what<00:06:12.570> happens<00:06:13.320> as<00:06:13.920> long<00:06:13.980> as<00:06:14.280> we

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
one of those what happens as long as we

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.190 
one of those what happens as long as we
we<00:06:14.880> start<00:06:15.150> putting<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.420> bullion<00:06:15.690> in<00:06:15.840> it<00:06:15.990> I

we start putting the bullion in it I

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.160 
we start putting the bullion in it I
think<00:06:16.830> we<00:06:17.190> shouldn't<00:06:17.640> plate<00:06:17.880> a<00:06:18.150> bar<00:06:18.450> I<00:06:18.690> think

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
think we shouldn't plate a bar I think

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.650 
think we shouldn't plate a bar I think
we<00:06:19.260> should<00:06:19.290> have<00:06:19.910> Tommy<00:06:20.910> Smith<00:06:23.390> brush<00:06:24.390> fits

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
we should have Tommy Smith brush fits

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.440 
we should have Tommy Smith brush fits
