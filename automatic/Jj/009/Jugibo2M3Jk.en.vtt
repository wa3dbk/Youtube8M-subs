00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.180
 miami 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.130
 hello 'break' type I am brenda and today 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.040
 I bring you a craft because the other 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.140
 day I was ordering my room was 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.060
 cleaning and I was taking out the things that 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.009
 I no longer wanted or I no longer needed 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.110
 then it occurred to him to make some 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.420
 boxes to organize will comment and 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.670
 viscous and the truth is that they are very 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.440
 easy to make and they are super cute 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.739
 so that's why I wanted to teach them 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.820
 so let's start let's go to 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.670
 need cardboard boxes 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.010
 scissors 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.730
 Spray paint of the color you want 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.989
 saw pink choose a silicone gun and 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.989
 ribbon to decorate 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.080
 The first thing I did was to see where I wanted to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 put my box and made a fair line 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.960
 of the size that I wanted it to be for 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.960
 then cut it 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.510
 i 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.800
 and 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.880
 and well afterwards with the help of a 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.340
 rule I made a line so that at the moment 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.340
 to cut it I'll be super straight 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.780
 and then yes and later with my figueres the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.780
 cut and ready 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.439
 then I went to the garden and put a 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.229
 trash bag so as not to mess up my 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.830
 I started to paint my boxes with the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.830
 spray paint 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.780
 and well I'll give you some ideas of how 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.599
 you can decorate your boxes and I the first 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.540
 I put this pink lace that is like 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.330
 elastic was the most real thing around and I took 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.160
 an artificial flower and I stuck it on the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.160
 front part with silicone 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.390
 and the second box is super easy just 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.670
 grab a lamarre pink ribbon around 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.250
 and I made a nice little bow on the part 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.260
 in front to make it look good and 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.340
 I also glued it with silicon so that 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.340
 move from its place 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.500
 and for the last box I took these accounts 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.130
 of some bracelets that they had when I was 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.490
 small and I put it on a pink ribbon 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.620
 and then tie it around the box 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.560
 taking care that the account will be in the 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.900
 part of forward and I stuck it with silicon 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.900
 also for as long as he moved and ready 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.570
 and that's how my boxes were in 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.030
 seriously you have to do them because they are very 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.320
 easy and all insurance materials 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.320
 you already have them in your house 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.050
 comment in the bottom part which of the 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.050
 three designs you liked more 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.740
 in the first box I put all the 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.740
 lipstick 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.520
 in the second I put all the things of your 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.100
 Water 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.860
 and in the last one I put my masks 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.370
 creams my hair products and things 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.810
 for that style and then I put them in 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.810
 a piece of furniture that is in my room 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.430
 it was all because of today's video I hope that 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.710
 they liked it and that it serves them to 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.230
 order your things if they do this 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.060
