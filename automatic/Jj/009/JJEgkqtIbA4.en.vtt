00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
fine yeah it is true that the action

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.690 
fine yeah it is true that the action
sequences<00:02:17.870> are<00:02:18.049> so<00:02:18.230> busy<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.280> can't<00:02:19.580> get

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
sequences are so busy that you can't get

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.520 
sequences are so busy that you can't get
involved<00:02:20.090> another<00:02:20.299> too<00:02:20.600> hard<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.989> follow<00:02:21.170> it's

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
involved another too hard to follow it's

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.470 
involved another too hard to follow it's

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
five balls on the machine at the same

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.479 
five balls on the machine at the same
time<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.880> as<00:02:26.870> for<00:02:27.350> Clooney<00:02:27.799> as<00:02:27.920> Batman<00:02:27.950> you

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
time and as for Clooney as Batman you

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.250 
time and as for Clooney as Batman you
know<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.850> realized<00:02:29.299> this<00:02:29.480> time<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.930> doesn't

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
know I realized this time it doesn't

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.840 
know I realized this time it doesn't
matter<00:02:30.440> who<00:02:30.620> plays<00:02:30.830> Batman<00:02:31.310> right<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.700> think
