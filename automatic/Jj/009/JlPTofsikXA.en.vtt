creating the packaging two years ago I
was<00:00:52.120> supporting<00:00:52.600> a<00:00:52.660> band<00:00:52.900> much<00:00:53.290> louder<00:00:53.589> than

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
me and a couple of days into the long

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.229 
me and a couple of days into the long
tour<00:00:56.170> realized<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.250> I<00:00:57.280> had<00:00:57.430> to<00:00:57.550> do<00:00:57.670> something

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
tour realized that I had to do something

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.350 
tour realized that I had to do something
to<00:00:58.449> make<00:00:58.780> my<00:00:58.960> sound<00:00:59.170> bigger<00:00:59.559> I<00:01:00.239> started<00:01:01.239> making

to make my sound bigger I started making

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.610 
to make my sound bigger I started making
one<00:01:01.690> string<00:01:01.989> pickups

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
one string pickups

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.590 
one string pickups
this<00:01:03.129> meant<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.430> rather<00:01:03.730> than<00:01:04.000> drenching<00:01:04.510> my

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
this meant that rather than drenching my

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.600 
this meant that rather than drenching my
guitar<00:01:04.930> with<00:01:05.110> effects<00:01:05.440> I<00:01:05.770> could<00:01:06.370> use<00:01:06.490> an

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
guitar with effects I could use an

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.270 
guitar with effects I could use an
octave<00:01:06.909> pedal<00:01:07.120> on<00:01:07.420> just<00:01:07.990> one<00:01:08.170> string<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:08.740> add

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
octave pedal on just one string and add

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.420 
octave pedal on just one string and add
a<00:01:09.310> bass<00:01:09.580> guitar<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.479> my<00:01:10.630> acoustic<00:01:10.900> sound

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.340 

after<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> few<00:01:17.670> experiments<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.570> realized<00:01:19.110> that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
after a few experiments I realized that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.109 
after a few experiments I realized that
this<00:01:19.650> was<00:01:19.860> something<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.820> lot<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
this was something that a lot of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.539 
this was something that a lot of
guitarists<00:01:21.869> would<00:01:22.080> find<00:01:22.409> very<00:01:22.650> useful<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
guitarists would find very useful and

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.840 
guitarists would find very useful and
those<00:01:24.060> early<00:01:24.110> prototypes<00:01:25.110> eventually<00:01:26.070> turned

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
those early prototypes eventually turned

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.560 
those early prototypes eventually turned
into<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.299> submarine<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.909> submarine<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.540> a
