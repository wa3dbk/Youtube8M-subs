so<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.650> my<00:00:01.829> first<00:00:02.460> attempt<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.629> make<00:00:03.810> a

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
so this is my first attempt to make a

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.270 
so this is my first attempt to make a
video<00:00:04.110> on<00:00:05.330> YouTube<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.359> explain<00:00:06.930> some<00:00:07.770> basic

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
video on YouTube to explain some basic

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.060 
video on YouTube to explain some basic
concepts<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.940> neurosciences<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.740> want<00:00:11.010> to

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
concepts of neurosciences and I want to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.150 
concepts of neurosciences and I want to
dedicate<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.730> failure<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.330> Sal<00:00:12.599> Khan<00:00:13.160> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
email the other day and got this idea

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.960 
email the other day and got this idea
from<00:00:20.760> as<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.750> how<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.230> could<00:00:22.590> teach<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.580> medical

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
from as to how I could teach my medical

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.630 
from as to how I could teach my medical
students<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.510> residents<00:00:25.310> some<00:00:26.310> simple

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
students and residents some simple

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.179 
students and residents some simple
concepts<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.180> neurosciences<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.890> don't

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
concepts of neurosciences so I don't

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.450 
concepts of neurosciences so I don't
have<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> blackboard<00:00:31.219> the<00:00:32.219> tablet

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
have a have a blackboard the tablet

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.400 
have a have a blackboard the tablet
which<00:00:33.270> i'll<00:00:33.420> probably<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.840> at<00:00:33.899> some<00:00:34.170> point

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
which i'll probably get at some point

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.139 
which i'll probably get at some point
but<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:36.270> very<00:00:36.329> amateur<00:00:37.850> attempt<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
but this is my very amateur attempt to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.970 
but this is my very amateur attempt to
try<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> explain<00:00:39.719> some<00:00:40.410> concepts<00:00:40.890> of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
try to explain some concepts of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.220 
try to explain some concepts of
neurosciences<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:42.629> we're<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.050> talk

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
neurosciences so we're going to talk

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.520 
neurosciences so we're going to talk
about<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.559> pillory<00:00:44.100> light<00:00:44.430> reflex<00:00:45.530> so

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
about the pillory light reflex so

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.799 
about the pillory light reflex so
imagine<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.579> your<00:00:48.149> eye<00:00:50.629> this<00:00:51.629> is

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
imagine that this is your eye this is

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.599 
imagine that this is your eye this is
right<00:00:53.960> high-end<00:00:54.960> assistant<00:00:55.530> left<00:00:55.649> i'm<00:00:58.609> so

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
right high-end assistant left i'm so

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.330 
right high-end assistant left i'm so
what<00:00:59.789> happens<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.690> will<00:01:01.199> shine<00:01:01.530> light<00:01:01.980> into

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
what happens when will shine light into

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.190 
what happens when will shine light into
the<00:01:03.000> eye<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.850> natural<00:01:06.180> response<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the eye the natural response is that the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.710 
the eye the natural response is that the
item<00:01:07.590> stretched<00:01:07.920> right<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.360> called<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
item stretched right so it's called the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.670 
item stretched right so it's called the
pupillary<00:01:10.110> light<00:01:10.470> response<00:01:11.310> or<00:01:11.549> light<00:01:11.880> reflex

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
pupillary light response or light reflex

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
pupillary light response or light reflex
but<00:01:13.680> how<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.010> does<00:01:14.220> happen<00:01:14.430> what's<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
but how this does happen what's the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.289 
but how this does happen what's the
science<00:01:15.720> behind<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:17.700> when<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.030> shine

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
science behind this so when we shine

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.899 
science behind this so when we shine
light<00:01:18.570> into<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.900> eye<00:01:19.310> there<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> sense<00:01:20.700> here

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
light into the eye there is a sense here

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.660 
light into the eye there is a sense here
here<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:22.290> sensors<00:01:22.710> called<00:01:22.950> read<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
here and the sensors called read in and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.080 
here and the sensors called read in and
i'm<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.090> call<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.759> slide<00:01:26.909> is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
i'm going to call it on so this slide is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.399 
i'm going to call it on so this slide is
sensed<00:01:27.420> by<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> retina<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.850> all<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.150> these

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
sensed by the retina and all of these

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.319 
sensed by the retina and all of these
reflexes<00:01:31.409> all<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:32.100> are<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.850> sensory

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
reflexes all they are is a sensory

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.140 
reflexes all they are is a sensory
perception<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.650> water<00:01:34.950> feedback<00:01:35.579> loop<00:01:35.880> in

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
perception and a water feedback loop in

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.319 
perception and a water feedback loop in
order<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> motor<00:01:37.380> response<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:39.060> from

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
order to get a motor response so from

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.569 
order to get a motor response so from
the<00:01:39.509> sensor<00:01:39.960> called<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> retina<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:42.270> impulse

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
the sensor called the retina the impulse

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.920 
the sensor called the retina the impulse
travels<00:01:44.840> in<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.320> nerve<00:01:46.530> fibers<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.930> optic

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
travels in the nerve fibers of the optic

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.010 
travels in the nerve fibers of the optic
nerve<00:01:48.960> i'm<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> call<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> Oh<00:01:50.189> end<00:01:50.579> or

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
nerve i'm going to call it Oh end or

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.719 
nerve i'm going to call it Oh end or
it's<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.350> second<00:01:53.310> cranial<00:01:54.240> nerve<00:01:55.729> through

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
it's the second cranial nerve through

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.520 
it's the second cranial nerve through
the<00:01:56.880> optic<00:01:57.210> nerve<00:01:58.009> these<00:01:59.009> impulses<00:02:00.140> then<00:02:01.140> go

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the optic nerve these impulses then go

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.120 
the optic nerve these impulses then go
into<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.100> structure<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> brain<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:04.130> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
into the structure of the brain in the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.930 
into the structure of the brain in the
midbrain<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:07.229> structure<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.039> called

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
midbrain and this structure is called

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.490 
midbrain and this structure is called
the<00:02:09.119> protected<00:02:09.959> area

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the protected area

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.100 
the protected area
in<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.979> isn't<00:02:11.340> my<00:02:11.550> breath<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:12.990> is

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
in this isn't my breath so this is

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.040 
in this isn't my breath so this is
another<00:02:13.350> sensor<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:15.330> from<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.750> protected

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
another sensor so from the protected

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.360 
another sensor so from the protected
area<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:20.130> next<00:02:20.550> impulse<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:22.410> sent<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.980> another

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
area the next impulse is sent to another

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.270 
area the next impulse is sent to another
structure<00:02:25.850> which<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:27.060> called<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:28.590> Edinburgh

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
structure which is called the Edinburgh

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.790 
structure which is called the Edinburgh
Festival<00:02:29.459> nucleus<00:02:30.380> i'm<00:02:31.380> going<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> call<00:02:31.770> it

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
Festival nucleus i'm going to call it

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.240 
Festival nucleus i'm going to call it
ewn<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.050> airing<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.530> small<00:02:34.770> nucleus

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
ewn and the airing of the small nucleus

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.270 
ewn and the airing of the small nucleus
is<00:02:36.120> part<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.800> oculomotor<00:02:38.580> complex<00:02:40.100> as<00:02:41.100> the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.680 
iris so when this muscle contracts what
you<00:04:09.930> get<00:04:10.110> is<00:04:10.320> purely<00:04:10.799> contraction<00:04:11.519> that's<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
you get is purely contraction that's the

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.069 
you get is purely contraction that's the

whole pathway another important concept

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.820 
whole pathway another important concept
is<00:04:16.560> when<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.100> shine<00:04:17.459> light<00:04:17.910> in<00:04:18.180> one<00:04:18.539> eye<00:04:18.830> not

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
trix bar this pupil constriction so this

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.640 
trix bar this pupil constriction so this

from<00:05:07.949> the<00:05:08.069> protected<00:05:08.580> area<00:05:08.940> not<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.569> the<00:05:09.719> same

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
from the protected area not to the same

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.950 
from the protected area not to the same
side<00:05:10.409> but<00:05:11.129> to<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.430> opposite<00:05:11.759> side<00:05:12.030> so<00:05:12.930> you

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
side but to the opposite side so you

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.749 
side but to the opposite side so you
also<00:05:13.440> have<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:14.240> medic<00:05:15.240> nervous<00:05:15.569> for<00:05:15.810> nucleus

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
also have a medic nervous for nucleus

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:22.429 
also have a medic nervous for nucleus
which<00:05:17.759> is<00:05:17.940> here<00:05:18.330> on<00:05:18.539> the<00:05:18.599> left<00:05:19.529> side<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:21.439> these

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:22.439 
which is here on the left side and these

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:24.290 
which is here on the left side and these
fibers<00:05:22.949> are<00:05:22.979> in<00:05:23.219> these<00:05:23.490> are<00:05:23.639> all<00:05:23.759> fibers<00:05:24.150> and

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
fibers are in these are all fibers and

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.499 
fibers are in these are all fibers and
this<00:05:24.449> is<00:05:24.569> called<00:05:24.779> the<00:05:24.900> posterior<00:05:25.259> commissure

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
this is called the posterior commissure

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.909 
this is called the posterior commissure
so<00:05:27.509> then<00:05:27.659> the<00:05:27.779> more<00:05:27.960> respond<00:05:28.379> starts<00:05:28.770> from

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
so then the more respond starts from

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.249 
so then the more respond starts from
here<00:05:29.150> so<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.210> have<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.840> preganglionic

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
here so you have the preganglionic

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.730 
here so you have the preganglionic
fibers<00:05:32.039> parasympathetic<00:05:32.550> fibers<00:05:33.440> in<00:05:34.440> the

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
fibers parasympathetic fibers in the

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.540 
fibers parasympathetic fibers in the
third<00:05:35.039> nerve<00:05:36.379> this<00:05:37.379> is<00:05:37.560> again<00:05:37.860> you<00:05:38.009> see<00:05:38.250> lyric

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
third nerve this is again you see lyric

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.920 
third nerve this is again you see lyric
any<00:05:38.759> of<00:05:39.229> these<00:05:40.229> are<00:05:40.440> post<00:05:40.680> can<00:05:40.919> Yannick<00:05:41.250> fibers

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
any of these are post can Yannick fibers

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.829 
any of these are post can Yannick fibers
in<00:05:42.930> shock<00:05:43.710> ciliary<00:05:44.190> nerves<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.839> they

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:45.839 
in shock ciliary nerves and they

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:47.899 
in shock ciliary nerves and they
stimulate<00:05:46.349> the<00:05:46.500> muscle<00:05:46.889> which<00:05:47.759> is

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
stimulate the muscle which is

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.480 
stimulate the muscle which is
tentatively<00:05:48.479> in<00:05:48.839> the<00:05:49.020> arrows<00:05:49.319> and<00:05:49.529> you<00:05:50.370> get

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
tentatively in the arrows and you get

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.670 
tentatively in the arrows and you get
contraction<00:05:51.000> of<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.120> people<00:05:51.509> so<00:05:52.289> this<00:05:52.500> is<00:05:52.650> a

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
contraction of the people so this is a

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.430 
contraction of the people so this is a
direct<00:05:52.979> people<00:05:53.310> are<00:05:53.520> a<00:05:53.550> response<00:05:54.000> and<00:05:54.440> this

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
direct people are a response and this

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.240 
direct people are a response and this
free<00:05:56.430> tacky<00:05:56.669> loop<00:05:56.909> is<00:05:57.169> called<00:05:58.169> the<00:05:58.680> consensual

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
free tacky loop is called the consensual

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.190 
free tacky loop is called the consensual
people<00:05:59.759> in<00:05:59.849> response<00:06:01.069> thank<00:06:02.069> you
