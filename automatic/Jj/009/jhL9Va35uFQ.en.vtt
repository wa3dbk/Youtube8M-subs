00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.389
 Hello Hello 

00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.049
 I'll show you today how to play swimming against others online 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.570
 and I'm already a suit that's why I think I'm relatively short 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.320
 and who the while I play a little games 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.660
 Explain how the game even works so the opponent also works 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.949
 Do not feel disturbed because I'm so slow 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.099
 In the evening, the goal of the game is to swim, even in real life 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.320
 Percent a higher score than the opponent to achieve so you hold his 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.390
 Lifebuoys keeps his three dear ones 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.489
 and that's what it's about 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.300
 Waldmann I take a priori as concentrating at the same time is not at all 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.320
 so easy 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.910
 as soon as I have a lower score at the end of the game 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.720
 As the opponent, I lose one of my lifebuoys of any of my lives 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.569
 and secondly, I've lost all three of them 

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:48.219
 and if I lose again then I lost the whole game and 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:49.360
 may 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.610
 "Sitting in the corner crying or whatever 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.950
 mm what am I doing now? 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.420
 good question 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.580
 I think I'll postpone you can push even if the opponent 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.390
 now pushes too he gets new maps 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 unfortunately does not do that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.310
 but that's great, too 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.370
 if you have three different colors so if you have a Kate one 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.430
 CatenaÂ® advice done so that the opponent believes 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.350
 I have pretty much three boys normally one collected 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.710
 I have different colors now 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.000
 different colors but just one 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.150
 Cartoon art one says that does not matter at all 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.630
 that's why I'm shoving now and I've got 30 units buzzing that one has then 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.590
 namely, the opponent also has 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.290
 but I win because I have the boys and the tens of course under that 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.049
 Bow lie 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.350
 that's a rare situation but that's why I won 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.030
 so and now I decide 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.900
 I am now the cards give that means I get three cards that 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.170
 by either keeping it 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.590
 or I can just apply for new cards 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.469
 I do not know which three new cards will be waiting for me 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:50.820
 that's why 2 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.700
 Ladies though may be three different Faber second at maybe changes center 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.990
 then with lady or 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.990
 my opponent lays still takes it 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.450
 Maybe I would rather have wanted to record 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.789
 Of course, you can never know a yacht before, but that's how good it is in the middle 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.620
 not that now I would say heights 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.530
 although that is not bad at all 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.840
 Namely you can also exchange all cards normally ostrich layer Amano 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.489
 one card each against one from the Main 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.810
 but I can also just change everyone as I do now 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.799
 will 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.260
 So now I have two kings that so fine and good 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.700
 times 20 points on the hand so believes that it is not good 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.700
 because then they will probably have good score knock namely that 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.310
 in the op 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.710
 if I knock then the opponent may push again or old all 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.319
 Swap cards Roger Heidt swap a card but it will be revealed 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.750
 What you each have Huber bad luck you lose if you're lucky wins 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.429
 you 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:47.280
 but so good 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.559
 she seems to have won now 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:53.680
 three eighth because I lose because 30 Loss loses against 30 completely 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:54.809
 but scarce 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:58.879
 comes number 4 but there are a few special situation I do not know if I have the 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.399
 now it is possible to provoke into it, for example, Schnautz 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.399
 is enough when the man 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.219
 and 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.040
 m what's left over the previous year that is needed on the ACE three 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.189
 Hand this is very unlikely because there are three assists 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:27.999
 Nokia's throughout the game 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.459
 that's why it's rare 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.780
 Year and I Schiele now at this point 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.029
 but if envy the fire comes then 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.949
 you win automatically and the opponent or hold the opponents you can stop too 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.139
 With up to six players playing the lent all put in each case 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.510
 and that comes but Haiti said extremely rarely in front of head then you may 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.950
 I'm glad knocking at this point is not so bad at 30 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.210
 this one could write 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.879
 and I win very close 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.129
 because she does not have 30 30 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.229
 yes and I think I'm still playing a bit here 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.109
 and maybe I will not win around and maybe he will play now 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.229
 swimming and soon you will see here on skill7 com 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.579
 come
