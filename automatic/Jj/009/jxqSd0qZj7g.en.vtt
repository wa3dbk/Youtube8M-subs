thing about these guys though is they
like<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.069> hang<00:03:09.370> out<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.940> surf<00:03:10.180> here

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
like to hang out and the surf here

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.369 
like to hang out and the surf here
and<00:03:12.340> more<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.390> waves<00:03:13.599> smashed<00:03:14.049> into<00:03:14.260> the

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
and more the waves smashed into the

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.569 
and more the waves smashed into the
ground<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:15.629> liquify<00:03:16.629> there's<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.109> male<00:03:17.579> the

ground and liquify there's a male the

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.629 
ground and liquify there's a male the
young<00:03:18.730> male<00:03:18.939> and<00:03:19.930> where<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.829> wage<00:03:21.010> liquefy

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
young male and where the wage liquefy

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.119 
young male and where the wage liquefy
the<00:03:21.700> sand<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.989> these<00:03:23.290> guys<00:03:23.590> have<00:03:23.859> to<00:03:23.980> orient

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
the sand and these guys have to orient

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.089 
the sand and these guys have to orient
themselves<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:24.969> that<00:03:25.120> their<00:03:25.530> head<00:03:26.530> is<00:03:26.739> facing

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
themselves so that their head is facing

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.990 
themselves so that their head is facing
I<00:03:27.489> believe<00:03:28.530> away<00:03:29.530> from<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.829> water<00:03:30.040> it's

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
I believe away from the water it's

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.149 
I believe away from the water it's
either<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.359> or<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.719> other<00:03:31.750> way<00:03:31.959> around<00:03:32.260> if

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
either that or the other way around if

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.819 
either that or the other way around if
they're<00:03:33.370> not<00:03:33.489> clerkly<00:03:33.879> oriented<00:03:34.540> or<00:03:34.829> they're

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
they're not clerkly oriented or they're

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.240 
they're not clerkly oriented or they're
perpendicular<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.090> waves<00:03:38.250> predators

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
perpendicular to the waves predators

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.580 
perpendicular to the waves predators
pretty<00:03:39.549> much<00:03:39.669> picked<00:03:39.939> them<00:03:40.090> off<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:41.230> they<00:03:41.379> have

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
pretty much picked them off so they have

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.140 
pretty much picked them off so they have
to<00:03:41.739> be<00:03:41.829> facing<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.280> right<00:03:42.430> way<00:03:42.459> each<00:03:42.669> time<00:03:42.819> the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
to be facing the right way each time the

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.429 
to be facing the right way each time the
wave<00:03:43.269> goes<00:03:43.540> out<00:03:43.780> it's<00:03:44.079> very<00:03:44.230> vulnerable

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 
wave goes out it's very vulnerable

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.879 
wave goes out it's very vulnerable
otherwise<00:03:45.129> these<00:03:45.819> guys<00:03:46.090> will<00:03:46.299> filter<00:03:46.480> feed

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
otherwise these guys will filter feed

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.119 
otherwise these guys will filter feed
they<00:03:47.889> also<00:03:48.099> need<00:03:48.719> that<00:03:49.719> liquefied<00:03:50.290> sand<00:03:50.739> so

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
they also need that liquefied sand so

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.490 
they also need that liquefied sand so
they<00:03:51.280> can<00:03:51.430> burrow<00:03:51.669> real<00:03:52.090> fast<00:03:52.419> into<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:52.989> and

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
they can burrow real fast into it and

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.780 
they can burrow real fast into it and
they<00:03:53.620> practically<00:03:54.099> swim<00:03:54.400> through<00:03:54.669> that

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
they practically swim through that

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:07.600 
they practically swim through that
little<00:03:55.030> bikes<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.480> its<00:03:55.629> really<00:03:55.840> cool<00:03:56.019> stuff

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.170

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.500 
liquefied sand okay I just have an
opportunity<00:04:31.100> to<00:04:31.190> do<00:04:31.370> so<00:04:31.640> and<00:04:31.670> actually<00:04:31.970> make
