00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.360 

oh<00:00:00.089> no<00:00:01.020> it's

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:04:04.800 

you

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.250 

mantra<00:04:05.800> and<00:04:05.950> faster<00:04:06.580> this<00:04:07.030> water<00:04:07.390> is<00:04:07.750> topping

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
mantra and faster this water is topping

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.880 
mantra and faster this water is topping
me<00:04:08.470> haha<00:04:09.340> darling<00:04:09.940> now<00:04:10.450> come<00:04:10.780> out<00:04:10.900> let's<00:04:11.650> go

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
me haha darling now come out let's go

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:20.699 
me haha darling now come out let's go
home<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:12.160> learn<00:04:12.489> more<00:04:12.849> about<00:04:13.020> refraction

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.090 

hmm<00:04:21.699> so<00:04:22.030> Jimmy<00:04:22.539> you<00:04:22.750> could<00:04:22.960> not<00:04:23.110> run<00:04:23.410> fast<00:04:23.830> in

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
hmm so Jimmy you could not run fast in

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.390 
hmm so Jimmy you could not run fast in
water<00:04:24.370> correct<00:04:25.120> yeah<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:26.320> can<00:04:26.680> run<00:04:26.889> much<00:04:27.370> faster

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
water correct yeah I can run much faster

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.290 
water correct yeah I can run much faster
otherwise<00:04:28.620> hmm<00:04:29.620> let's<00:04:30.220> see<00:04:30.370> why<00:04:30.970> could<00:04:31.270> you

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
otherwise hmm let's see why could you

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.290 
otherwise hmm let's see why could you
not<00:04:31.389> run<00:04:31.840> fast<00:04:32.199> in<00:04:32.470> water<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:33.550> know<00:04:33.759> water<00:04:34.120> is

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
not run fast in water you know water is

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.749 
not run fast in water you know water is
more<00:04:34.750> dense<00:04:35.080> than<00:04:35.350> air<00:04:35.560> you<00:04:36.130> have<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.400> run

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
more dense than air you have to run

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.420 
more dense than air you have to run
against<00:04:37.330> air<00:04:37.539> while<00:04:37.990> on<00:04:38.169> ground<00:04:38.560> but<00:04:39.310> your

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
against air while on ground but your

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.020 
against air while on ground but your
speed<00:04:39.910> is<00:04:40.150> less<00:04:40.690> in<00:04:40.930> water<00:04:41.169> because<00:04:41.979> the<00:04:42.610> water

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
speed is less in water because the water

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.279 
speed is less in water because the water
is<00:04:43.389> denser<00:04:43.840> than<00:04:44.289> air<00:04:44.620> so<00:04:45.389> CNC<00:04:46.389> happens<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:47.110> the

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
is denser than air so CNC happens to the

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.310 
is denser than air so CNC happens to the
light<00:04:47.470> when<00:04:48.039> it<00:04:48.250> enters<00:04:48.729> water<00:04:49.210> from<00:04:49.810> air<00:04:50.080> it

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
light when it enters water from air it

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.770 
light when it enters water from air it
speed<00:04:50.830> becomes<00:04:51.280> less<00:04:51.639> and<00:04:51.940> its<00:04:52.150> direction

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
speed becomes less and its direction

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.980 
speed becomes less and its direction
changes<00:04:53.289> let's<00:04:54.190> do<00:04:54.430> one<00:04:54.759> more<00:04:54.870> experiment<00:04:55.870> to

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
changes let's do one more experiment to

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.780 
changes let's do one more experiment to
understand<00:04:56.530> it<00:04:56.650> more

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.900 

Hey

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.150 

put<00:05:06.910> this<00:05:07.120> pencil<00:05:07.690> in<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:08.170> glass<00:05:08.440> of<00:05:08.620> water

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.870 

while<00:05:12.850> this<00:05:13.450> also<00:05:13.780> looks<00:05:14.140> bad<00:05:14.530> but<00:05:15.400> we<00:05:15.640> know

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
while this also looks bad but we know

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.570 
while this also looks bad but we know
for<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.450> fact<00:05:16.720> that<00:05:16.870> pencil<00:05:17.500> is<00:05:17.680> actually<00:05:18.340> not

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
for the fact that pencil is actually not

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.900 
for the fact that pencil is actually not
bent<00:05:18.940> it<00:05:19.210> is<00:05:19.780> refraction<00:05:20.590> let's<00:05:21.400> look<00:05:21.640> at<00:05:21.790> it

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
bent it is refraction let's look at it

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.740 
bent it is refraction let's look at it
in<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.360> details

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.160 

see<00:05:28.230> the<00:05:28.740> light<00:05:29.040> reaching<00:05:29.820> the<00:05:29.970> eye<00:05:30.000> is<00:05:30.570> coming

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
see the light reaching the eye is coming

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.990 
see the light reaching the eye is coming
from<00:05:31.470> a<00:05:31.620> different<00:05:31.980> direction

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
from a different direction

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.740 
from a different direction
yeah<00:05:33.600> because<00:05:34.440> light<00:05:34.800> changes<00:05:35.340> its<00:05:35.550> direction

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
yeah because light changes its direction

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.740 
yeah because light changes its direction
then<00:05:36.750> it<00:05:36.930> travels<00:05:37.170> from<00:05:37.620> air<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:38.190> water<00:05:38.420> yes<00:05:39.450> it

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
then it travels from air to water yes it

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.920 
then it travels from air to water yes it
enters<00:05:40.320> from<00:05:40.530> one<00:05:40.830> medium<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.370> another<00:05:41.750> so<00:05:42.750> it

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
enters from one medium to another so it

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.620 
enters from one medium to another so it
changes<00:05:43.440> direction<00:05:44.160> due<00:05:44.460> to<00:05:44.670> difference<00:05:45.420> and

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
changes direction due to difference and

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.380 
changes direction due to difference and
density<00:05:46.230> of<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.710> two<00:05:46.890> mediums<00:05:47.370> this<00:05:48.090> is

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
density of the two mediums this is

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.500 
density of the two mediums this is
refraction<00:05:48.960> so<00:05:49.800> guys<00:05:50.100> now<00:05:50.670> you<00:05:50.730> understand

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
refraction so guys now you understand

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.050 
refraction so guys now you understand
refraction<00:05:52.290> now<00:05:52.860> time<00:05:53.850> for<00:05:53.880> some<00:05:54.180> homework

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
refraction now time for some homework

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.370 
refraction now time for some homework
it<00:05:57.060> is<00:05:57.270> easy<00:05:58.490> okay<00:05:59.490> the<00:06:00.000> whole<00:06:00.120> book<00:06:00.630> is<00:06:00.840> to

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
it is easy okay the whole book is to

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.650 
it is easy okay the whole book is to
take<00:06:01.650> a<00:06:01.680> pencil<00:06:02.100> and<00:06:02.340> put<00:06:02.790> it<00:06:02.940> in<00:06:03.120> a<00:06:03.210> glass<00:06:03.390> of

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
take a pencil and put it in a glass of

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.590 
take a pencil and put it in a glass of
water<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.460> remember<00:06:05.460> that<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:05.970> bending<00:06:06.480> of

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
water and remember that the bending of

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.260 
water and remember that the bending of
the<00:06:06.660> pencil<00:06:07.230> is<00:06:07.410> due<00:06:07.770> to<00:06:07.950> refraction<00:06:08.280> and<00:06:08.790> your

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
the pencil is due to refraction and your

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.990 
the pencil is due to refraction and your
