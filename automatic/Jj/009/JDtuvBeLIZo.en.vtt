00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.490

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.570
 approximately got a gram and a little 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:24.420

 2 carrots and and take one chicken rink 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.750
 generally initially cooked with meat 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.809
 lamb most recipes 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.300
 but I met a recipe with chicken 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.899
 for example, and my girlfriend's blood is prepared with 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.750
 chicken meat and also I met with 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.809
 add more vegetables 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.660
 potatoes here so you can to your 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.719
 discretion do i cook from here 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.399
 These products can also take any 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.170
 seasoning to taste salt pepper basically 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.579
 you can do just a word because 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.530
 improved chili very bright taste I understood 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.780
 At first I knew right away when 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.630
 tried it fresh it looks like they 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.020
 little molly could be sweeter 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.890
 only a bit but when it is prepared in 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.439
 hot 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.880
 the taste becomes softer such 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.799
 pleasantly sweet noble way out 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.740
 he also has to make tea but 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.630
 brewed not from fresh and dried and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.850
 with Panama even with seeds or 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.159
 flowers he had something there as a flood 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.900
 plain tea and give it as y 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.829
 large water baby that is 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.610
 everywhere they say that against colic 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.520
 kids 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.600
 Here is such a little water as a matter of fact fennel 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.540
 relative of dill 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.390
 as you see by this action it 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.579
 exactly such well and generally henkel very 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.340
 useful weed and if you can 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.870
 calmly bear the smell of anise and and 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.710
 good to add to salads a little bit 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:05.460
 Well, let's start cooking arapas 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.190
 whose hair of the Arabs dinner we separate ourselves 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.810
 sprigs with more thin 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.560
 with thinner little stalk from more 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.200
 massive just like in ordinary 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.650
 going through dill massive throwing away 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.660
 there are just branches with a part of more 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.570
 juicy and thin stalk 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.760
 sprigs of fennel need to cut at 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.200
 grounds where there is thicker to the river 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.080
 I cut about a centimeter and 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:42.840
 a little further by 23 centimeters that you were 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:47.120
 small sprigs of onions from a place named either 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.120
 cut into small cubes 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:57.280
 carrot and onion cut into cubes 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:04.330
 pour the vegetables in the heated vegetable 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:07.150
 butter and fry on low heat 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.970
 cut chicken fillet into small ones 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.970
 diced and add to vegetables 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.140
 fry on low heat 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.330
 practically ready to cook 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.520
 chicken I got fried I probably 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.470
 add a little chain up chicken on 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.570
 the chicken itself 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.570
 also a little cool chicken 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:43.790
 shuffle add 77 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.990
 add seasonings optional salt 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.640
 pepper but apparently he still something pleases 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.380
 you with less very bright in itself 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:03.030
 taste and add somewhere 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:08.780
 half a cup of water covered with a lid 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:11.400
 what are you whisk rides like this 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.740
 cooked dish in sochi 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.620
 Optionally you can add at the end 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:21.810
 cooking still tomatoes cut small 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:25.470
 cubes also out of habit some 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.320
 Turks add a little water with 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.220
 diluted tomato paste for color but 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.830
 for me so glad sochi is very tasty by itself 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.260
 yourself without tomato paste and even tomato 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.800
 I did not add 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.710
 I have been preparing for about 25 minutes 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:47.340
 this well boiled it mitchell on 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.570
 the taste has become very nice and sweetly sweet 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.080
 with a delicate aroma 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.360
 this bright anise taste is gone 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.790
 which was fresh grass 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.840
 softened by all sorts of different became thin and 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.630
 pleasant aroma 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.980
 so even if you tried fennel 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.110
 or know about what he has too 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.950
 sharp aroma and think that it is not 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:12.780
 enjoy try cooking it 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.340
 hot it will be and so useful 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.730
 as he has many useful properties and 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.250
 very tasty you will like to serve 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.830
 the dish can be built with a family voice 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.790
 Natural very many dishes from 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.760
 green vegetables 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.520
 yes yes with yogurt you can replace 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.560
 sour cream 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.050
 oblige any tap love or get along 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.620
 without it , you can also submit any 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.650
 garnish 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.409
 I have this laptop list pilaf that is 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:42.460
 rice garnish and not several 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:45.210
 memorable for decoration as you see 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.720
 the dish really looks a bit like 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:52.389

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.729

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.479
