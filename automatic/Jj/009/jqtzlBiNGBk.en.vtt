00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
getting a bead on him you'd get pressure

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.420 
getting a bead on him you'd get pressure
he<00:01:07.409> would<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.710> find<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.040> way<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> escape

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
