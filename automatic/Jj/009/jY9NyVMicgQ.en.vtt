00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.010 
like that whole world and made design
and<00:01:50.130> art<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.539> tangible

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and art and all that like a tangible

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:03.670 
and art and all that like a tangible
thing

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.550 

my<00:02:04.680> mindset<00:02:05.100> as<00:02:05.760> far<00:02:06.000> as<00:02:06.090> painting<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:07.140> pretty

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
my mindset as far as painting is pretty

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.410 
my mindset as far as painting is pretty
design<00:02:08.399> early<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.149> really

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
design early and that I like really

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.750 
design early and that I like really
think<00:02:09.630> about<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.380> like<00:02:10.730> know<00:02:11.730> that

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
think about I have to like know that

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.070 
think about I have to like know that
what<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.570> kind<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.870> look<00:02:13.020> like

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
what it's going to kind of look like

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.340 
what it's going to kind of look like
before<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.650> start<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:16.140> my

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
before I start and so that's like my

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.980 
before I start and so that's like my
design<00:02:16.850> mind<00:02:17.850> working<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.390> do<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.810> mean

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
design mind working and do it I mean

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.940 
design mind working and do it I mean
that's<00:02:19.080> why<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.320> like<00:02:19.410> these<00:02:19.680> paintings

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
that's why I like these paintings

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.650 
that's why I like these paintings
because<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:21.120> do<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.360> collage

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
because it's like I can do the collage

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.970 
because it's like I can do the collage
and<00:02:21.690> kind<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.200> think<00:02:22.380> about<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.770> it's<00:02:22.860> really

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
and kind of think about it it's really

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.070 
and kind of think about it it's really
graphic<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.210> can<00:02:24.690> use<00:02:24.810> all<00:02:24.990> these

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
graphic and I like I can use all these

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.070 
graphic and I like I can use all these
elements<00:02:25.290> from<00:02:25.770> all<00:02:26.280> my<00:02:26.670> design<00:02:26.970> jobs<00:02:27.270> and

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
elements from all my design jobs and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.600 
elements from all my design jobs and
then<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.350> like<00:02:28.440> very<00:02:28.710> methodical<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.430> can

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
then it's like very methodical I can

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.890 
then it's like very methodical I can
like<00:02:29.730> make<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.030> into<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.210> painting<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.720> kind

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
like make it into a painting and I kind

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.340 
like make it into a painting and I kind
of<00:02:30.960> like<00:02:31.110> whole<00:02:31.650> process<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.160> that
