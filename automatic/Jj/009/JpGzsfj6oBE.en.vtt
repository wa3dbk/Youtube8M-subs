 just open a sliding door 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.210

 what did you do that virus has actually come 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:20.949
 when I came to live here it has made so much impression on me in the meantime 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.469
 The Netherlands decided to but 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.249
 to make one of them 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.439
 in the meantime I hope that this has gotten out of hand 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.260
 as being me 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.399
 last year 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:34.149
 myself can incur a discount done the fall so this resulted in me 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.010
 become exclusive offers for the Benelux 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.829

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.659
 who know and that is just 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.530
 she as a dog, but certainly people from and the us 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.530
 but you see it look 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.709
 form 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.779
 in the 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.779
 the complaints come I of course have you 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:01.299
 So 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.189
 and that he is the turning point that we have that kind of beating 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.989
 and that is very unfortunate i could have suggested to be please that is 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.379
 anyway you always walk 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.900
 so no permanent companion already abroad becomes a press statement this 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.989
 is the investigation being held it is admittedly in the attic what happened in it 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.209
 first year if this year you may have the break in the quiet lie however 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.589
 as the party at the bottom 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:32.129

 he talks to drink a lot of water like his 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.459
 social plan to talk further but I have another opinion 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.119
 come 9 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:49.119

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.699
 he was arrested after he had an end time of 28 degrees that day 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:58.969
 instructions from 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.299
 who sat down that is the case then he can unite into a small one 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.179
 become 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:05.650
 show it 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.549
 she advises 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.529
 the water glass is a puddle and crystal clear that there is a reason if it should ever be 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.669

 this is with filter installation 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.129
 because the larger installations optimally skyhook out 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.490
 turn small fish into very large ones 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.249

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.080

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.719
 We continue to point to the lookout 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:50.599
