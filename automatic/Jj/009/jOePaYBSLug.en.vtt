00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
first because socialist is basically a

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.090 
first because socialist is basically a
stepping<00:06:34.370> stone<00:06:35.440> to<00:06:36.440> communism<00:06:37.190> I<00:06:39.040> should<00:06:40.040> I

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
stepping stone to communism I should I

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.860 
stepping stone to communism I should I
really<00:06:40.400> need<00:06:40.520> to<00:06:40.580> start<00:06:40.730> get<00:06:40.880> my<00:06:41.150> railroads

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
because I think this is where my main

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.740 
because I think this is where my main
population<00:06:45.050> is<00:06:45.830> wait<00:06:46.640> are<00:06:46.940> you<00:06:47.030> just<00:06:47.210> know
