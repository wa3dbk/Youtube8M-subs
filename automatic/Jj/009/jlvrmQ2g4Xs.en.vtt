00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
these units are more effective and and

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.459

on<00:00:43.559> top<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:43.980> hill<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.430> map<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.820> really

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
on top of this hill on this map I really

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.540 
on top of this hill on this map I really
dislike<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:46.320> map<00:00:46.530> doesn't<00:00:47.190> make<00:00:47.340> much<00:00:47.520> sense

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
dislike this map doesn't make much sense

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.420 
dislike this map doesn't make much sense
but<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.440> sometimes<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.010> fun<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.309> try

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
but you know sometimes it's fun to try

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.799 
but you know sometimes it's fun to try
and<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:50.850> opponent<00:00:51.210> off<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> hill<00:00:51.570> so

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and get your opponent off the hill so

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.299 
and get your opponent off the hill so
whatever<00:00:52.170> I'll<00:00:52.379> take<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> challenge

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
whatever I'll take the challenge

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.910 
whatever I'll take the challenge
so<00:00:53.969> my<00:00:54.300> pikemen<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.870> obviously<00:00:55.410> hold<00:00:55.620> his<00:00:55.739> men

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
so my pikemen can obviously hold his men

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.139 
so my pikemen can obviously hold his men

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
Praetorian cab bogged down back here

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.380 
Praetorian cab bogged down back here
that<00:04:11.050> I'll<00:04:11.200> eventually<00:04:11.709> beat<00:04:12.100> but<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.150> see

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
that I'll eventually beat but you see

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.940 
that I'll eventually beat but you see
he's<00:04:13.660> now<00:04:13.840> got<00:04:14.020> a<00:04:14.050> Praetorian<00:04:14.530> cab<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.860> go

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
he's now got a Praetorian cab to go

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.830 
he's now got a Praetorian cab to go
around<00:04:15.190> my<00:04:15.280> flank<00:04:15.550> so<00:04:15.790> check<00:04:16.209> this<00:04:16.329> out<00:04:16.510> I

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
around my flank so check this out I

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.840 
around my flank so check this out I
think<00:04:17.290> this<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.620> an<00:04:17.709> important<00:04:18.130> piece<00:04:18.640> of<00:04:18.669> the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
think this is an important piece of the

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.039 
think this is an important piece of the
battle<00:04:19.120> for<00:04:19.269> me<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.419> point<00:04:19.600> out<00:04:19.750> kind<00:04:19.989> of

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
battle for me to point out kind of

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:20.970 
battle for me to point out kind of
what's<00:04:20.200> going<00:04:20.410> on<00:04:20.500> I'm<00:04:20.560> gonna<00:04:20.650> put<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:20.890> in<00:04:20.950> a

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
what's going on I'm gonna put it in a

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.659 
what's going on I'm gonna put it in a
slow<00:04:21.220> motion

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
slow motion

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.850 
slow motion
so<00:04:22.419> my<00:04:22.570> light<00:04:22.720> peltasts<00:04:23.140> are<00:04:23.320> still<00:04:23.560> doing

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
so my light peltasts are still doing

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.320 
so my light peltasts are still doing
what<00:04:23.950> they<00:04:24.100> do<00:04:24.160> best<00:04:24.250> which<00:04:24.550> is<00:04:24.669> exchanging

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
what they do best which is exchanging

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.450 
what they do best which is exchanging
fire<00:04:25.540> with<00:04:25.750> his<00:04:25.960> his<00:04:26.500> javelins<00:04:26.950> my<00:04:27.130> guys<00:04:27.280> have

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
fire with his his javelins my guys have

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
fire with his his javelins my guys have
better<00:04:27.580> shield<00:04:27.910> strength

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
better shield strength

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.450 
better shield strength
so<00:04:28.960> although<00:04:29.169> going<00:04:29.560> for<00:04:29.740> cheap<00:04:29.890> javelins<00:04:30.340> was

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
so although going for cheap javelins was

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.040 
so although going for cheap javelins was
probably<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:30.820> smart<00:04:31.060> move<00:04:31.180> by<00:04:31.510> my<00:04:31.630> opponent

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
probably a smart move by my opponent

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.659 
probably a smart move by my opponent
it's<00:04:32.470> still<00:04:32.680> gonna<00:04:32.800> be<00:04:32.950> hard<00:04:33.160> for<00:04:33.220> him<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.490> deal

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
it's still gonna be hard for him to deal

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.520 
it's still gonna be hard for him to deal
with<00:04:33.700> my<00:04:33.970> own<00:04:34.000> but<00:04:34.720> at<00:04:34.810> least<00:04:34.900> he<00:04:35.080> didn't<00:04:35.290> spend

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
with my own but at least he didn't spend

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.780 
with my own but at least he didn't spend
a<00:04:35.590> lot<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.830> money<00:04:36.010> here<00:04:36.220> they<00:04:36.340> gets<00:04:36.490> easily

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
a lot of money here they gets easily

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.940 
a lot of money here they gets easily
killed<00:04:37.060> now<00:04:37.840> is<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.140> time<00:04:38.320> when<00:04:38.440> my<00:04:38.560> opponent

killed now is the time when my opponent

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.730 
killed now is the time when my opponent
is<00:04:39.040> in<00:04:39.220> trouble<00:04:39.400> because<00:04:39.610> look<00:04:40.169> my<00:04:41.169> scythe

out and he even used Rako on it too
which<00:06:26.200> again<00:06:26.440> is<00:06:26.620> smart<00:06:26.950> my<00:06:27.130> opponents<00:06:27.520> trying

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
which again is smart my opponents trying

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.630 
which again is smart my opponents trying
hard<00:06:28.060> here<00:06:28.390> and<00:06:28.650> he<00:06:29.650> made<00:06:29.800> a<00:06:29.830> few<00:06:30.040> key<00:06:30.220> mistakes

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
hard here and he made a few key mistakes

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.030 
hard here and he made a few key mistakes
but<00:06:30.880> I<00:06:31.150> like<00:06:31.630> the<00:06:31.780> way<00:06:31.900> his<00:06:32.080> build<00:06:32.380> his<00:06:32.710> Roman

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
but I like the way his build his Roman

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.430 
but I like the way his build his Roman
build<00:06:33.250> was<00:06:33.400> actually<00:06:33.820> was<00:06:34.720> actually<00:06:35.020> focused

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
build was actually was actually focused

build was actually was actually focused
around<00:06:35.590> trying<00:06:35.980> to<00:06:36.070> counter<00:06:36.430> this<00:06:36.580> meta<00:06:36.850> build

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
around trying to counter this meta build

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.120 
around trying to counter this meta build
that<00:06:37.270> he<00:06:37.390> expected<00:06:37.900> from<00:06:38.110> me<00:06:38.260> I<00:06:38.440> did<00:06:38.740> bring<00:06:39.010> it

that he expected from me I did bring it

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.700 
that he expected from me I did bring it
he<00:06:39.310> expected<00:06:39.850> it<00:06:39.910> and

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
he expected it and

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.590 
he expected it and
he<00:06:41.860> he<00:06:42.190> tried<00:06:42.490> to<00:06:42.640> counter<00:06:42.970> it<00:06:43.090> and<00:06:43.330> it's

he he tried to counter it and it's

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.810 
he he tried to counter it and it's
really<00:06:43.840> that<00:06:43.930> mistake<00:06:44.470> here<00:06:44.800> by<00:06:45.490> leaving

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
really that mistake here by leaving

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.970 
really that mistake here by leaving
those<00:06:45.940> chariots<00:06:46.480> able<00:06:47.230> to<00:06:47.350> just<00:06:47.530> get<00:06:47.740> it<00:06:47.860> his

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
those chariots able to just get it his

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.350 
those chariots able to just get it his
men<00:06:48.190> over<00:06:48.460> here<00:06:48.640> if<00:06:48.760> he<00:06:48.850> would<00:06:48.940> have<00:06:49.000> just<00:06:49.060> left

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
men over here if he would have just left

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.510 
men over here if he would have just left
one<00:06:49.780> Praetorian<00:06:50.320> cab<00:06:50.530> here<00:06:50.770> continued<00:06:51.400> the

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
one Praetorian cab here continued the

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.550 
one Praetorian cab here continued the
flanking<00:06:51.940> movement<00:06:52.360> over<00:06:52.540> here<00:06:52.810> it<00:06:53.440> would

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
flanking movement over here it would

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.320 
flanking movement over here it would
have<00:06:53.620> put<00:06:53.980> me<00:06:54.130> under<00:06:54.400> a<00:06:54.430> pretty<00:06:54.700> major<00:06:54.910> threat

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
have put me under a pretty major threat

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.820 
have put me under a pretty major threat
because<00:06:55.660> then<00:06:55.810> this<00:06:55.930> cab<00:06:56.170> fight<00:06:56.470> probably

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
because then this cab fight probably

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.590 
because then this cab fight probably
would<00:06:56.920> have<00:06:56.980> gone<00:06:57.100> against<00:06:57.490> me<00:06:57.580> as<00:06:57.670> well<00:06:57.880> so

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
would have gone against me as well so

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.320 
would have gone against me as well so
that<00:06:58.810> was<00:06:58.900> definitely<00:06:59.080> a<00:06:59.490> strategic<00:07:00.490> error<00:07:00.730> on

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
that was definitely a strategic error on

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.820 
that was definitely a strategic error on
my<00:07:01.510> opponents<00:07:01.900> part<00:07:02.050> there<00:07:02.230> that<00:07:02.380> really<00:07:02.530> kind

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
my opponents part there that really kind

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.710 
my opponents part there that really kind
of<00:07:02.920> handed<00:07:03.190> me<00:07:03.310> the<00:07:03.430> game<00:07:03.640> his<00:07:04.330> Praetorian
