moon when you try and see small objects
that<00:01:10.020> are<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> good<00:01:10.350> distance<00:01:10.770> away<00:01:10.979> especially

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that are a good distance away especially

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.399 
that are a good distance away especially
when<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.270> less<00:01:12.510> light<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.290> becomes

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
when they have less light it becomes

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.789 
when they have less light it becomes
much<00:01:13.920> more<00:01:14.220> difficult<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.880> resolve<00:01:15.799> for

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
much more difficult to resolve for

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.890 
much more difficult to resolve for
example<00:01:17.280> here<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> best<00:01:18.240> photo<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.869> have

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
example here is the best photo we have

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.590 
example here is the best photo we have
of<00:01:19.140> Pluto<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> celestial<00:01:21.119> body<00:01:21.450> in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
of Pluto and this is a celestial body in

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.450 
of Pluto and this is a celestial body in
our<00:01:21.780> own<00:01:21.930> solar<00:01:22.259> system<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.920> relatively

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
our own solar system and relatively

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.960 
our own solar system and relatively
close<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:24.090> 4.2<00:01:24.960> billion<00:01:25.409> kilometres<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
close at 4.2 billion kilometres so the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.730 
close at 4.2 billion kilometres so the
reason<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.509> take<00:01:27.689> an<00:01:27.810> amazing<00:01:27.900> image<00:01:28.530> of

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
reason we can take an amazing image of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.460 
reason we can take an amazing image of
Andromeda<00:01:29.210> 2.5<00:01:30.210> million<00:01:30.659> light<00:01:31.049> years<00:01:31.079> away

Andromeda 2.5 million light years away

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.679 
Andromeda 2.5 million light years away
is<00:01:31.920> because<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:32.729> looking<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:33.150> an<00:01:33.240> object

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
is because we are looking at an object

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.980 
is because we are looking at an object
that<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.930> an<00:01:34.049> estimated<00:01:35.570> 260,000<00:01:36.570> light<00:01:36.750> years

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that is an estimated 260,000 light years

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.640 
that is an estimated 260,000 light years
