00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
connectivity and buffering problems with

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.059 
connectivity and buffering problems with
the<00:00:05.879> YouTube<00:00:06.330> app<00:00:06.509> which<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.500> built-in<00:00:08.010> with

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
the YouTube app which is built-in with

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.890 

naturally<00:00:16.949> loading<00:00:17.670> up<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.880> video<00:00:18.029> will<00:00:18.510> take<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
naturally loading up a video will take a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.759 
naturally loading up a video will take a
few<00:00:19.109> seconds<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> load<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:21.619> but<00:00:22.619> what's

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
few seconds to load up but what's

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.050 
few seconds to load up but what's
happening<00:00:23.130> right<00:00:23.220> now<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:23.850> trying

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
happening right now is that it's trying

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.269 
happening right now is that it's trying
to<00:00:24.150> buffer<00:00:26.269> and<00:00:27.769> you'll<00:00:28.769> notice<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.130> it's

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
to buffer and you'll notice that it's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.580 
to buffer and you'll notice that it's
buffering<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> little<00:00:30.390> white

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
buffering you see the little white

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.069 
buffering you see the little white
progress<00:00:31.590> bar<00:00:31.800> feeling<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.960> can

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
progress bar feeling up so you can

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.369 
progress bar feeling up so you can
barely<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:38.270> according<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> most<00:00:39.510> users<00:00:40.020> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
barely see it according to most users a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.740 
barely see it according to most users a
youtube<00:00:40.890> app<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.670> YouTube<00:00:42.120> videos<00:00:42.420> should

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
youtube app or YouTube videos should

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.510 
youtube app or YouTube videos should
pretty<00:00:43.379> much<00:00:43.469> load<00:00:43.829> up<00:00:44.040> almost

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
pretty much load up almost

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.630 
pretty much load up almost
instantaneously<00:00:45.770> or<00:00:46.770> within<00:00:46.980> 5<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.489> 10

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
instantaneously or within 5 to 10

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.940 
instantaneously or within 5 to 10
seconds<00:00:48.059> at<00:00:48.149> least<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> case

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
seconds at least but that's not the case

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.479 
seconds at least but that's not the case
right<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:53.329> I'll<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.390> play<00:00:54.690> whatever

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
right here I'll just play whatever

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:02.060 
right here I'll just play whatever
buffer<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.699> now<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.649> seems<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> be

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
buffer just now so it seems to be

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:11.420 
buffer just now so it seems to be
playing<00:01:02.809> normally<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:10.159> again<00:01:11.159> I'm<00:01:11.280> just

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
playing normally now again I'm just

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.910 
playing normally now again I'm just
turned<00:01:11.610> into<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.939> street<00:01:15.439> so<00:01:16.439> seems<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:16.830> if

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
turned into the street so seems as if

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:26.520 
turned into the street so seems as if
the<00:01:17.159> video<00:01:17.400> looking<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> way

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.860 

trying<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.590> play<00:01:27.680> catch-up<00:01:28.010> here<00:01:28.750> it's<00:01:29.750> gonna

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
trying to play catch-up here it's gonna

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:47.620 
trying to play catch-up here it's gonna
run<00:01:30.140> out<00:01:30.260> of<00:01:30.290> buffering<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:47.090> usually<00:01:47.420> that's

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
run out of buffering so usually that's

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.830 
run out of buffering so usually that's
what<00:01:47.990> happens<00:01:49.300> this<00:01:50.300> is<00:01:50.360> what<00:01:50.570> used<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.780> happen

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
what happens this is what used to happen

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.370 
what happens this is what used to happen
me<00:01:51.530> moles<00:01:51.770> basically<00:01:52.730> all<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.000> time<00:01:53.380> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
me moles basically all the time the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.750 
me moles basically all the time the
video<00:01:54.500> will<00:01:54.740> just<00:01:54.770> stop<00:01:55.070> playing<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.700> I'd

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
video will just stop playing and I'd

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.460 
video will just stop playing and I'd
have<00:01:55.910> to<00:01:56.030> wait<00:01:56.600> for<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.900> buffer<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.260> little

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
have to wait for it to buffer a little

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.520 
have to wait for it to buffer a little
bit<00:01:57.560> more<00:01:58.450> so<00:01:59.450> it's<00:01:59.570> really<00:01:59.630> really<00:02:00.080> annoying

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
bit more so it's really really annoying

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.130 
bit more so it's really really annoying
and<00:02:00.970> I've<00:02:01.970> seen<00:02:03.550> forums<00:02:04.660> support<00:02:05.660> forms<00:02:05.990> of

I<00:03:01.000> now<00:03:02.000> have<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.180> different<00:03:02.630> DNS<00:03:03.019> IP<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:06.040> now

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
I now have a different DNS IP and now

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.550 
I now have a different DNS IP and now
that<00:03:07.340> I've<00:03:07.640> changed<00:03:08.209> that<00:03:08.570> we<00:03:09.200> should<00:03:09.380> note

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
that I've changed that we should note

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.820 
that I've changed that we should note
it's<00:03:09.769> drastically<00:03:11.440> improved<00:03:12.440> results<00:03:14.800> so<00:03:15.800> I

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
it's drastically improved results so I

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.130 
it's drastically improved results so I
from<00:03:16.730> now<00:03:16.880> on<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.360> should<00:03:17.420> be<00:03:17.600> able<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.750> load<00:03:17.989> up

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
from now on I should be able to load up

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.310 
from now on I should be able to load up
any<00:03:18.290> video<00:03:18.650> almost<00:03:19.810> instantaneously<00:03:23.320> you'll

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
any video almost instantaneously you'll

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.920 
any video almost instantaneously you'll
notice<00:03:24.739> faster<00:03:25.519> load<00:03:25.760> times<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.660> you're<00:03:26.810> not

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
notice faster load times and you're not

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.090 
notice faster load times and you're not
gonna<00:03:27.019> run<00:03:27.260> into<00:03:27.440> any<00:03:27.470> more<00:03:27.590> buffering

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
gonna run into any more buffering

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.930 
gonna run into any more buffering
problems

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.940 

so<00:03:32.510> there<00:03:32.660> we<00:03:32.810> go<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.080> video<00:03:33.350> just<00:03:33.590> loaded

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
so there we go the video just loaded

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.730 
so there we go the video just loaded
it's<00:03:34.370> buffering<00:03:34.790> pretty<00:03:35.240> quickly<00:03:35.740> I'm

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
it's buffering pretty quickly I'm

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.050 
it's buffering pretty quickly I'm
guessing<00:03:37.250> that's<00:03:37.340> how<00:03:37.580> fast<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:38.000> should

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
guessing that's how fast it should

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:46.240 
guessing that's how fast it should
buffer<00:03:39.430> if<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.610> see<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.910> white<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.100> looks

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
buffer if you see the white so it looks

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.220 
buffer if you see the white so it looks
like<00:03:46.280> it's<00:03:46.490> buffering<00:03:46.790> pretty<00:03:47.090> well<00:03:47.300> let's

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
like it's buffering pretty well let's

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.100 
like it's buffering pretty well let's
try<00:03:48.410> another<00:03:48.560> random<00:03:49.010> video<00:03:49.960> so<00:03:50.960> I'm<00:03:51.020> gonna

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
try another random video so I'm gonna

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:59.730 
try another random video so I'm gonna
haven't<00:03:51.440> tried<00:03:53.500> let's<00:03:55.330> check<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:56.480> one<00:03:56.540> out

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.930 

naturally<00:04:00.740> again<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.130> takes<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.430> few<00:04:01.580> seconds

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
naturally again it takes a few seconds

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.370 
naturally again it takes a few seconds
to<00:04:02.000> load<00:04:02.150> up<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.720> am<00:04:05.840> on<00:04:05.990> a<00:04:06.020> cable

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
to load up and I am on a cable

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.230 
to load up and I am on a cable
connection<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:07.340> that<00:04:07.490> helps<00:04:07.760> Tazewell<00:04:10.210> so<00:04:11.210> I

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
connection so that helps Tazewell so I

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.920 
connection so that helps Tazewell so I
load<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:11.630> up

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.010 

buffering<00:04:14.930> pretty<00:04:15.320> fast<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:17.870> all

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
buffering pretty fast and this is all

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.729 
buffering pretty fast and this is all
because<00:04:18.290> I<00:04:18.470> changed<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.920> DNS<00:04:19.310> server<00:04:20.180> IP<00:04:20.739> I'm

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
because I changed the DNS server IP I'm

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.750 
because I changed the DNS server IP I'm
using<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.220> different<00:04:22.550> DNS<00:04:22.850> IP<00:04:24.490> so<00:04:25.490> let's<00:04:25.640> try

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
using a different DNS IP so let's try

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.850 
using a different DNS IP so let's try
one<00:04:25.940> more<00:04:25.970> video

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.520 

most<00:04:30.860> of<00:04:30.950> these<00:04:31.040> feature<00:04:31.280> videos<00:04:31.670> I<00:04:32.530> usually

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
most of these feature videos I usually

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.500 
most of these feature videos I usually
have<00:04:33.800> problems<00:04:33.980> with<00:04:37.210> hopefully<00:04:38.210> this<00:04:38.360> one

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
have problems with hopefully this one

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:46.300 
have problems with hopefully this one
loads<00:04:38.750> up<00:04:38.900> quickly

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.670 

so<00:04:46.910> naturally<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:47.450> does<00:04:47.630> take<00:04:47.900> 5<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.530> 10

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
so naturally it does take 5 to 10

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.500 
so naturally it does take 5 to 10
seconds

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
seconds

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.430 
seconds
buffer<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.570> little<00:04:50.750> bit<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:50.990> then<00:04:51.110> start

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
buffer a little bit and then start

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:59.370 
buffer a little bit and then start
playing<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:57.590> YouTube<00:04:57.950> app<00:04:58.100> isn't<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.520> most

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
playing the YouTube app isn't the most

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.610 
playing the YouTube app isn't the most
how<00:05:00.380> should<00:05:00.590> I<00:05:00.650> say<00:05:00.889> it's<00:05:01.070> stable<00:05:01.490> either<00:05:02.620> it

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
how should I say it's stable either it

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.430 
how should I say it's stable either it
does<00:05:03.830> get<00:05:04.070> a<00:05:04.100> little<00:05:04.370> glitchy<00:05:08.110> it<00:05:09.110> buffered

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
does get a little glitchy it buffered

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.810 
does get a little glitchy it buffered
quite<00:05:09.710> a<00:05:09.740> lot<00:05:10.040> already<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.400> don't<00:05:10.520> know<00:05:10.669> why

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
quite a lot already I don't know why

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:24.060 
quite a lot already I don't know why
it's<00:05:10.940> not<00:05:11.000> gonna<00:05:11.630> untie<00:05:11.900> automatically<00:05:12.680> play

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:34.110 

let<00:05:25.070> me<00:05:25.100> call<00:05:25.370> up<00:05:25.400> one<00:05:25.730> more<00:05:25.940> video

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.500 

and<00:05:34.210> I<00:05:34.810> should<00:05:34.990> say<00:05:35.020> that<00:05:35.320> this<00:05:35.530> is<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.710> 3GS<00:05:36.510> you

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
and I should say that this is a 3GS you

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.560 
and I should say that this is a 3GS you
can<00:05:37.630> tell<00:05:37.780> from<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:38.020> percentage<00:05:38.470> meter<00:05:39.430> and<00:05:39.729> I

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
can tell from the percentage meter and I

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.610 
can tell from the percentage meter and I
should<00:05:40.780> charge<00:05:40.930> my<00:05:41.080> battery<00:05:41.440> it<00:05:41.590> seems<00:05:43.620> so

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
should charge my battery it seems so

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.120 
should charge my battery it seems so
naturally<00:05:44.979> YouTube<00:05:45.340> app<00:05:45.520> does<00:05:46.830> slow<00:05:47.830> down<00:05:48.100> a

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
naturally YouTube app does slow down a

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.180 
naturally YouTube app does slow down a
bit<00:05:48.250> so<00:05:48.970> let's<00:05:49.180> try<00:05:49.510> another<00:05:49.660> video<00:05:53.190> something

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
bit so let's try another video something

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.330 
bit so let's try another video something
I<00:05:54.340> haven't<00:05:54.580> tried<00:05:54.790> yet<00:05:55.860> see<00:05:56.860> if<00:05:56.919> it'll<00:05:57.040> load<00:05:57.250> up

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
I haven't tried yet see if it'll load up

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:07.980 
I haven't tried yet see if it'll load up
automatically<00:06:03.479> come<00:06:04.479> on<00:06:04.660> don't<00:06:04.990> fail<00:06:05.290> me<00:06:06.990> so

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
automatically come on don't fail me so

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.219 
automatically come on don't fail me so
it's<00:06:08.110> buffering<00:06:08.380> pretty<00:06:09.010> quickly<00:06:09.250> now<00:06:09.370> we

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
it's buffering pretty quickly now we

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:21.050 
it's buffering pretty quickly now we
should<00:06:11.229> start<00:06:11.620> playing<00:06:11.919> right<00:06:12.220> now

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.910 

any<00:06:22.060> minute<00:06:22.210> now<00:06:22.830> let's<00:06:23.830> started<00:06:24.100> playing<00:06:25.920> so

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:26.920 
any minute now let's started playing so

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.440 
any minute now let's started playing so
basically<00:06:27.370> my<00:06:28.060> YouTube<00:06:28.420> problems<00:06:28.870> have<00:06:29.140> been

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
basically my YouTube problems have been

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.240 
basically my YouTube problems have been
diminished<00:06:31.470> all<00:06:32.470> I<00:06:32.560> had<00:06:32.740> to<00:06:32.830> do<00:06:32.980> was<00:06:33.160> this

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
diminished all I had to do was this

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:39.630 
diminished all I had to do was this
change<00:06:33.610> the<00:06:33.910> DNS<00:06:35.220> server<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:38.370> you<00:06:39.370> can<00:06:39.490> just

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
change the DNS server and you can just

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.260
