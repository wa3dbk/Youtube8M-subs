not supposed to because that's the
Vulcan<00:02:40.590> way<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.600> movie<00:02:42.900> he's<00:02:43.079> always

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
Vulcan way but in this movie he's always

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.960 
Vulcan way but in this movie he's always
emotional<00:02:43.739> have<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.310> guys<00:02:44.400> ever<00:02:44.579> noticed

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
emotional have you guys ever noticed

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.699 
emotional have you guys ever noticed
that<00:02:45.030> like<00:02:45.269> Spock<00:02:45.989> in<00:02:46.170> these<00:02:46.290> movies<00:02:46.530> is

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
that like Spock in these movies is

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.699 
that like Spock in these movies is
either<00:02:46.920> angry<00:02:47.430> mad<00:02:47.880> upset<00:02:48.570> or<00:02:48.870> he's<00:02:49.350> kind<00:02:49.620> of

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
either angry mad upset or he's kind of

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.110 
either angry mad upset or he's kind of
pretending<00:02:50.160> like<00:02:50.190> he's<00:02:50.459> not<00:02:50.609> mad

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
pretending like he's not mad

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.180 
pretending like he's not mad
so<00:02:51.540> pretty<00:02:51.720> much<00:02:51.810> he's<00:02:52.109> very<00:02:52.470> emotional<00:02:52.769> even

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
so pretty much he's very emotional even

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.680 
so pretty much he's very emotional even
though<00:02:53.340> Vulcans<00:02:53.760> technically<00:02:54.269> are<00:02:54.420> but<00:02:54.600> I'm
