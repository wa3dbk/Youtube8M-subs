00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
would not try to start it we'll probably

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.880 
would not try to start it we'll probably
have<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.110> look<00:01:13.320> at<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> lot<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
have to do is look at a lot of the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.260 
have to do is look at a lot of the
electric<00:01:14.189> components<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.909> know<00:01:15.000> there's<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
electric components you know there's a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.670 
electric components you know there's a
lot<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> things<00:01:15.659> want<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> engine<00:01:16.500> on

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
lot of things want to do the engine on

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.130 
lot of things want to do the engine on
this<00:01:17.250> car<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.970> control<00:01:18.659> module<00:01:18.810> especially

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
this car the control module especially

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
this car the control module especially
mounted<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.000> got

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
mounted right here so if this got

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.749 
mounted right here so if this got
damaged<00:01:21.689> well<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> likely<00:01:22.290> will<00:01:22.680> not<00:01:22.890> start<00:01:23.220> if

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
damaged well it likely will not start if

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.910
