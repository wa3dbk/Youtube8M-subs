00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 what we are preparing today then today 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.900
 we prepare a raw meat rent prey to 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.000
 a dish of great tradition 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.559
 piedmontese 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.080
 first we start from the matter 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.990
 first a staircase that the most part 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.010
 tender of the rear of the breed 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.869
 Piedmontese is the most I do what 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.410
 which allows him to play at it in 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:32.059
 this case we played with the 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.980
 rather particular combinations and I 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.500
 I called it ciocco ville is a game of 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.690
 words between meat and chocolate let's go 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.930
 now beating finely with a knife 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.140
 this meat sending it cut into 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.630
 small squares to eliminate those 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.610
 which are the scents now 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.270
 seen and reviewed by 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:58.660
 of minced meat machine by 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.660
 this we get 1 sfornino 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.490
 it is flavored 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.950
 yes we are now entering in his 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.990
 inside the cocoa beans the beans that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.560
 we use are the cryonic beans it is 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.270
 the top 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.039
 as regards cocoa beans 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.609
 just think that in nature they are 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:29.729
 present these in the measure of only 0 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.439
 0 0 1 percent so it's the top 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.409
 just think that mature point 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.039
 practically in absolutely quantity 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.859
 small and this Sunday in his case 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.840
 inside with a percentage of ta of butter 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.450
 cocoa really paltry so it's a lot 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.530
 very very bitter that marries 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.209
 nicely speaking very well with 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.840
 dida vaccaro data accuracy the right 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:56.939
 aromatic hint of those ones 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.219
 those completely atypical and subtleties 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.189
 far from a classic from a classic one 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.509
 by nature we have wet with now 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.849
 us from a robust oil is an oil 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.510
 scalable an oil whose producer is 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.720
 call or areas in san giorgio is an oil 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.750
 full powerful big big fat 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.250
 city ​​demand great power to give me 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.950
 give yourself the right acidity 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.590
 to dilute that bitterness of 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.150
 of the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.739
 but he says cabbage of the Pope is called 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.739
 turn out these molds 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.000
 I am then now we come with 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.400
 of the operation then only the sides 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.860
 we put some flowers of salt are gods 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.900
 pure crystals and this Welsh salt 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.450
 has organized to the serene because this 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.870
 salt because it gives you a reminder of a di 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.700
 a vegetable then over 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.700
 let's go with a crispy bread leaf 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.040
 above this threshold 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.180
 a froth obtained to then arises with 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.770
 nitrogen is obtained from unequal percentages 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.650
 of cream and milk mixed and cooked with 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.480
 about a third of its component 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.250
 then put parmesan arises is 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.560
 served cold so let's say 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.140
 unstructured a parmesan 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.930
 from the cocoa beans I used earlier 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.580
 this chocolate grate that gives me 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.490
 therefore some institutions a little more 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.350
 honeyed so to say why 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.020
 let us remember that the initial phase is very much 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.910
 very loving a simple final color 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:44.680
 of thyme flowers and one more color 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.680
 yellow for a little radionics 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.550
