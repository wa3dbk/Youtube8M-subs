 today he already knows the gestures 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.520
 baker's daily newspapers 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.529
 iconic at least obvious 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.529
 until this night about 3 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.090
 the choice of learning for the future has 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.890
 did a long time ago it was no longer 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.809
 to find his way I always said 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.430
 that I wanted to make a good crp when I 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.699
 love you did not know it too much in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.620
 what 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.500
 and after I discovered the bakery 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.629
 little by little and suddenly that brought me here 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.699
 I discovered the place is ok 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.589
 bakery ie it's a job 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.160
 of work I do not win much it's 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.750
 normal but me it's already huge because 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.010
 that I have for now I have nothing to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.199
 pay and I think that's what 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.329
 motivates young people also forward one 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.110
 pay at the end of the month for for wise 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.600
 to have fun 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.399
 this remuneration amounts to 25% of the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.800
 smic for young people of dany age in 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.960
 first year a sum that believes everything 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.030
 throughout learning training 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.770

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.810
 silly with the development that we 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.630

 have trained in our stores because 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.929
 that after five years on the taught the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.399
 firefighter roll training is pretty much 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.520
 buckled they are offered a post of 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.340
 employee or even a few years later 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.929
 like the store manager here who 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.399
 today is well in the process of 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.619
 buy the boutiques in his own name 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.599

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.910
 take over this bakery from margency 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.440

 all young people who participate in 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.489
 training an everyday job 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:57.959
 do not know the world of work 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.630
 you have to explain everything to them 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.220
 the work of the teams 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.270

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.220
 is going well at work 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.660

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.280

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.869
 days every day to pick them up 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.580
 explain them small details because 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.410
 that sometimes they do not understand where they 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.900

 craft that come not just because 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.099

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.329
