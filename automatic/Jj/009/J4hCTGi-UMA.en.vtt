00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:15.269
 Haetneundeyo only yesterday received a bedding pad so today mvp player 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.480
 I would like to ask you a big box with the order of Chosun. Hello. Hi. 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.960
 4 It is still a game that shows the stability of the won or the player. 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.099
 I'll ask Jesus showed Iooked specialties lull ask 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.810
 Well, once you do this, 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.810
 I thought it was a reading. 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:39.800
 I get to be a little careless when with my little ah the last order for the players tell their labor 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.110
 Have spent a little rest in the victory that Victory 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:49.820
 The writing experience to get the dead Oh yeah that seems a little careless 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:53.059
 Tomorrow is now the last cj before 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.570
 I showed a better picture than today. 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.440
 I'm doing this because I'm going to change this to the 4th floor, 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.120
 Tomorrow is a score of 4 that matches the name of our sk telecom t1 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.670
 I do not overwhelming Map 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.320
 Yes, sir. 4 I'm still memorable yesterday . 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.470
 You came out with it. 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.149
 4 won the players do a Mac today, it'll prevent so called paddle 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:21.289
 You showed me. 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:24.800
 When I studied teranjeon rather than you've come to really study now 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.350
 I'm confident that I'm not in the spot player in the world . 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.550
 so 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.140
 I am 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.280
 If you look at what Terran is doing, it's like I'm crying. 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.010
 Visible 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.240
 I just saw what I wanted and I really 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:48.640
 So I'm just watching you seen this weakness transparent VHS all unemployed are not the faces 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:52.360
 I wanted to do it . 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.690
 It was last year when I was in the Gangnam area after the previous year . 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.690
 What I wanted to see was a rewarding Gangnam style dance. 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:04.570
 4 Can you show me again 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:09.429
 Which one Oh how to spend it on the dollar How much I owe it to myself 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:14.110
 I think I need to get a little bit thin in the past . 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:17.020
 The theme of this project is to learn mechanic works again. 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.220
 I think the strike will learn to paddle Karim cap cheotbang 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.360
 Tibia or something to be aware of Please let me know 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:29.050
 Like always halved immature to Mecca deuldeon 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:34.930
 I do not think this is going to happen tomorrow . 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:37.420
 Dongyou will surely write to thank you not your last but finally the ticket to the finals 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.450
 I have a problem with that. 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:47.050
 I'd appreciate it if you could. 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:52.780
 It's good when we prepare for the playoffs originally 4 0 0 4 4 neatly 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:57.250
 I climbed up fast and got a faster rate. 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:01.750
 Or it's such a little unexpected to some top line 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:08.500
 I think it's getting a little tough fighting. 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:10.060
 We want our team members to grow up so individual, 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.190
 I think I did . 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.370
 Since yesterday, but we seem to be able to defeat just one dock connection 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:24.269
 I think yesterday's increase, I was glad to personally lead 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:28.360
 * When you look at the win, so the final cj of tomorrow 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:34.120
 I will be able to interview this part-time person in an overwhelming manner. 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:37.510
 I have four good word byeonsa 4 will be more inclined interview last four defeats 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.410
 Sk Telecom will be the stimulus that was a very big role to t1 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.360
 The same 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:46.680
 I also really like that one would expect doeneundeyo sk telecom players to win today, 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.680
 I'd like a big round of applause again. 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.920
 Yes. I'll finish the interview here.
