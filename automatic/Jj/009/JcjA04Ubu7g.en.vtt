00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 as they are in this opportunity we are going to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.020
 cook good hamburgers just to 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.429
 the plate full of proteins full of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.290
 just of carbohydrates which 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.130
 they will allow you to be much more 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.299
 quick if I told you I was in 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.680
 recipes live at this moment is something 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.080
 very simple but you can be 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.310
 physically in your house quietly if 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.930
 you can ask your parents for you 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.390
 buy or if you want transcribing 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.570
 only then only yourself so today 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.250
 we're going to mention is beef 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.630
 intensely from fat so let's see 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.820
 if we have a little accompanies 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.910
 and here we have a bit already with another half 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.720
 that basically is minced meat would be 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.150
 the same thing that we buy a record of this 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.070
 says this only to make this video 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.380
 and they put it directly to crusher and 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.380
 directly begins to have the flesh of 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.030
 this way so good firstly what 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.140
 what they do is sort a little here like 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.570
 I'm eating all the time 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.730
 logically a bit of software is based 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.250
 the camera right here close so that 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.050
 can you see how I do it if I commented 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.670
 that this is something very simple can you 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.910
 do at home quietly instead 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.620
 to buy the homemade hamburgers that 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.630
 supposedly they are homemade to which they say 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.700
 for example for you and so on that guy 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.369
 capacity of reality is not home the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.410
 burger is just made 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.119
 directly the factory that they do 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.210
 directly with additives with 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.250
 preservatives and others which does not 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.610
 be as healthy as it really seems 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.470
 even though they are shown wearing a 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.390
 cover that says rich in proteins and 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.460
 others in the life of this is not like that if 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.460
 this he does only to sell 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.229
 practically good observe the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.729
 burgers this way we're going to 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.560
 spend on one side of the other in that 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.180
 simple that is is much more 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.230
 healthy to buy them made in 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.120
 head like this 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.540
 logically sometimes in the butchery of 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.550
 neighborhood times yes but good is much 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.790
 better do the same when evoking the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.790
 condiments 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.400
 condiments we have two types of 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.830
 condiments here parsley and others besides 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.600
 to choose a little process that 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.399
 parsley and garlic if we put it a little 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.049
 over 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.569
 just a little but with a little 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:16.010
 different taste and richer is 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.010
 again the camera carefully 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.990
 we put them that way now we go with the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.490
 iron leaving the beans 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.890
 let's use an iron with a chin 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.630
 instead they do not know if it is better not to 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.100
 there is nothing richer truth 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.440
 it is true that we have to lose 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.560
 that warms up a little yes because in 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.970
 actually being this cold is possible 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.990
 that the meat sticks 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.030
 if later it costs us a bit of 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.590
 revolt but well let's see the 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.750
 instant as I had previously eaten 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.190
 noodles I just have the dance of 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.840
 special occupied a moment ago if 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.740
 We were going to put the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.280
 burgers 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.280
 now 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.410
 good as I was telling you surely 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.480
 several people who are thinking but 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.550
 like carbohydrates burgers in 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.920
 reality because of protein the meat 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.990
 I commented that the meat has a bit of 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.300
 fat, although it's not all good fat 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.750
 if they have entresemana fats help 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.160
 have more energy so good the protein 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.810
 is to get from each of these 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.060
 burgers would be enough to 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.520
 be able to do physical exercise at home 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.830
 quietly or from gyms and we're going to 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.780
 see that the fire is not very strong 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.780
 and I'm going to leave the camera over here 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.750
 very well 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:48.470
 and back to a protein ration 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.930
 pretty good and great videos that 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.510
 I say you have to do between five or six 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.600
 meals per day 4 eat could according to 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.180
 well this would be a meal between 6 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.700
 known as a meal if you want 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.500
 you can be one to eat or during 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.860
 moment and then later if it's music 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.030
 It would be like two meals but accompanying 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.800
 to the schedules and a hamburger 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.960
 full pressure but take a little bit of 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.170
 lettuce in a little cheese cheese by 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.540
 health if you are not healthy by health 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.430
 as much as others yes but it's actually 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.950
 a rich cheese and a good system of 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.410
 proteins yes 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.840
 and also to become accommodated those who 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.790
 they have no power to the bread if they can 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.980
 eat on the plate and also with some 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.840
 ration can also be corn or 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:40.490
 corn country may be because not a little 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.470
 rice and other rice and meat is a 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.840
 excellent convention has been all 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.860
 the energy and the meats of what this 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.860
 muscle shape yes 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:59.110
 the diet of today's first day 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:03.080
 noodles with meat sauce potent well 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:06.200
 this food pretty well and then 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.360
 I was eating for the snack with 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.680
 Protein step without protein base 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.680
 serum 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.419
 quiet did not pass protein with a couple of 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.900
 cookies to say have saved quite 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.120
 good 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.470
 and it's good from now on and start 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.630
 make videos of this type 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.000
 directly counting what I do because 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.160
 I do not know about you but I'm tired 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.840
 tell me directly if you have to 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.060
 do this this where do you have to do 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.580
 that way eat that but not what 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.280
 show if they vote only on some 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.710
 or another meal that's why I decided to do this 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.980
 type of videos to do a live in 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.020
 I live so they can talk 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.640
 remember that the 28th will come to 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.830
 being friends youtube so I hope 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.360
 count on you I know there are several 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:54.000
 people from mexico colombia venezuela from 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.100
 Spain and Argentina that will be 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.480
 Seeing me without good I want to tell 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.480
 with you so you can see me too 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.000
 the relationship between this type of 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.020
 burgers and those that are bought by 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.009
 example for you 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.009
 as if the pain 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:20.020
 now we put this type of hamburgers 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.240
 they can not here up there that says they have 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.030
 many proteins true but this 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.610
 it only helps an asterisk by 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.879
 of course we are not informed that it is 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.639
 just the foods of the same type 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:35.409
 this tells us that they are not going to be 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.960
 proteins of the same quality as what 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:40.539
 would this be because these cables where 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.360
 vaccine this meat is processed from that 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:45.699
 step of the change according to a team that 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.680
 add the preservative so that it does not 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:49.000
 beat so that it does not get bad without 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.320
 provision here I would take it 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.270
 logically 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.690
 It also has the same taste additives 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.540
 It has flavorings which if you have 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:02.200
 realized of course when you eat 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.090
 clean a common floor 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.430
 a cut of meat does not have the same 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.650
 flavor of hamburgers the example 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.550
 cooked the modest abandons for example 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.320
 yes 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.690
 although I really like the food 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.600
 you value, I think that any action that 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:19.140
 could everyone could catch any 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.140
 moment of the day 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.160
 but it does not really come to meat if 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.560
 you make a cut of meat does not have 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.840
 the same taste of everyone because 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.950
 is full of things and is totally 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.520
 processed to say 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:36.860
 well let's televise the purity 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.870
 and then continue talking about the topic of 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.229
 strategies and I will say organizing the 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.229
 situation
