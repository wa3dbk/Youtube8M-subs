00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
Galaxy s4 and this one's a bit of a

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.770 
Galaxy s4 and this one's a bit of a
doozy<00:00:14.980> basically<00:00:15.980> they've<00:00:16.940> added<00:00:17.570> some

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:17.780 
doozy basically they've added some

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.840 
doozy basically they've added some
features<00:00:17.930> they've<00:00:18.620> cleaned<00:00:19.550> up<00:00:19.730> the

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
features they've cleaned up the

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.670 
features they've cleaned up the
interface<00:00:20.120> a<00:00:20.270> little<00:00:20.630> bit<00:00:20.780> as<00:00:21.200> you<00:00:21.320> can<00:00:21.380> see<00:00:21.590> up

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
interface a little bit as you can see up

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.020 
interface a little bit as you can see up
at<00:00:21.770> the<00:00:21.800> top<00:00:21.860> here<00:00:22.280> in<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.430> notification

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.030 
at the top here in the notification

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.610 
at the top here in the notification
shape<00:00:23.210> there's<00:00:23.390> now<00:00:23.480> a<00:00:23.510> trainer<00:00:23.870> translucent

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 
shape there's now a trainer translucent

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.580 
shape there's now a trainer translucent
area<00:00:24.980> this<00:00:25.730> transparency<00:00:26.570> it<00:00:27.050> looks<00:00:27.230> kind<00:00:27.470> of

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
area this transparency it looks kind of

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.260 
area this transparency it looks kind of
fetching<00:00:27.950> it<00:00:28.220> all<00:00:28.340> gives<00:00:28.580> a<00:00:28.670> bit<00:00:28.880> of<00:00:28.940> a<00:00:29.000> depth

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
fetching it all gives a bit of a depth

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.620 
fetching it all gives a bit of a depth
of<00:00:29.480> field<00:00:29.720> effect<00:00:30.080> but<00:00:30.890> also<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:32.150> interface

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
of field effect but also the interface

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.100 
of field effect but also the interface
is<00:00:33.220> incredibly<00:00:34.220> quick<00:00:34.840> things<00:00:35.840> have

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
is incredibly quick things have

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.960 
is incredibly quick things have
tightened<00:00:36.829> up<00:00:36.920> quite<00:00:37.220> a<00:00:37.250> bit<00:00:37.550> a<00:00:37.579> lot<00:00:37.790> of<00:00:37.880> the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
tightened up quite a bit a lot of the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.370 
tightened up quite a bit a lot of the
interface<00:00:38.329> lag<00:00:38.510> seems<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:38.840> have<00:00:38.930> disappeared

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
interface lag seems to have disappeared

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.229 
interface lag seems to have disappeared
completely<00:00:39.590> which<00:00:40.100> is<00:00:40.250> really<00:00:40.700> nice<00:00:40.850> to<00:00:41.090> see

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
completely which is really nice to see

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.790 
completely which is really nice to see
we'll<00:00:41.810> have<00:00:41.930> to<00:00:42.050> wait<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.320> see<00:00:42.440> how<00:00:42.620> that

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
we'll have to wait and see how that

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.620 
we'll have to wait and see how that
works<00:00:43.070> out<00:00:43.220> over<00:00:43.460> time<00:00:43.790> but<00:00:44.000> it's<00:00:44.150> promising

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
works out over time but it's promising

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.660 
works out over time but it's promising
at<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.810> moment<00:00:45.110> now<00:00:45.590> also<00:00:45.950> of<00:00:46.070> interest<00:00:46.190> is

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
at the moment now also of interest is

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.130 
at the moment now also of interest is
they<00:00:47.000> seem<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.300> be<00:00:47.390> getting<00:00:47.480> a<00:00:47.750> bit<00:00:47.989> more

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
they seem to be getting a bit more

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.010 
they seem to be getting a bit more
control<00:00:48.560> over<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.920> memory<00:00:49.160> usage<00:00:49.489> as<00:00:49.640> well

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
control over the memory usage as well

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.240 
control over the memory usage as well
obviously<00:00:51.020> background<00:00:51.620> tasks<00:00:51.860> will<00:00:51.980> kick

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
obviously background tasks will kick

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.860 
obviously background tasks will kick
back<00:00:52.280> in<00:00:52.640> now<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.030> start<00:00:53.239> filling<00:00:53.450> up<00:00:53.600> memory

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
back in now and start filling up memory

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.080 
back in now and start filling up memory
again<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:54.410> it's<00:00:54.530> good<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:54.710> see<00:00:55.010> that<00:00:55.090> overall

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
again but it's good to see that overall

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.760 
again but it's good to see that overall
they<00:00:56.329> are<00:00:56.360> making<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:56.960> few<00:00:57.140> improvements<00:00:57.380> here

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
they are making a few improvements here

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.380 
they are making a few improvements here
on<00:00:57.890> how<00:00:58.010> much<00:00:58.130> memory<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:58.520> device<00:00:58.790> is<00:00:59.000> using

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
on how much memory the device is using

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.920 
on how much memory the device is using
now<00:01:00.260> one<00:01:00.680> of<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.890> other<00:01:01.070> really<00:01:01.700> interesting

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
now one of the other really interesting

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.270 
now one of the other really interesting
features<00:01:02.930> whoops<00:01:03.350> let<00:01:03.710> me<00:01:03.739> come<00:01:04.129> into

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
features whoops let me come into

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.230 
features whoops let me come into
settings<00:01:04.790> is<00:01:06.340> if<00:01:07.340> we<00:01:07.580> come<00:01:07.760> into<00:01:07.880> more<00:01:08.060> in<00:01:08.180> the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
settings is if we come into more in the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.980 
settings is if we come into more in the
application<00:01:08.720> manager<00:01:09.010> we<00:01:10.010> now<00:01:10.340> have<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.840> just

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
application manager we now have it just

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.539 
application manager we now have it just
pick<00:01:12.170> something<00:01:12.470> suitable<00:01:13.130> let's<00:01:13.340> go<00:01:13.460> over

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
pick something suitable let's go over

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.450 
pick something suitable let's go over
that<00:01:13.580> one<00:01:13.760> we<00:01:14.720> now<00:01:14.810> have<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:14.990> move<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.619> SD<00:01:16.159> card

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
that one we now have a move to SD card

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.609 
that one we now have a move to SD card
option<00:01:17.000> available<00:01:17.240> in<00:01:17.659> here<00:01:17.840> now<00:01:18.260> I'm<00:01:18.500> having

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
option available in here now I'm having

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.800 
option available in here now I'm having
a<00:01:18.770> few<00:01:18.920> problems<00:01:19.100> getting<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.610> working<00:01:19.790> but<00:01:20.630> it

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
a few problems getting it working but it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.600 
a few problems getting it working but it
is<00:01:20.930> promising<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:21.680> we<00:01:21.740> do<00:01:21.979> have<00:01:22.190> that<00:01:22.220> there

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
is promising that we do have that there

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.180 
is promising that we do have that there
what<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.270> found<00:01:23.630> is<00:01:23.960> some<00:01:24.380> apps<00:01:24.560> can<00:01:24.680> be<00:01:24.890> moved

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
what I found is some apps can be moved

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.090 
what I found is some apps can be moved
to<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.460> SD<00:01:25.760> others<00:01:26.240> can't<00:01:26.600> but<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.260> some<00:01:27.799> cases

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
to the SD others can't but in some cases

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.800 
to the SD others can't but in some cases
I'm<00:01:28.340> finding<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:28.909> can't<00:01:29.299> actually<00:01:29.510> move

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
I'm finding that I can't actually move

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.080 
I'm finding that I can't actually move
them<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.290> SD<00:01:30.590> card<00:01:30.619> at<00:01:31.040> all<00:01:31.280> let<00:01:31.850> me<00:01:31.909> just

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
them to the SD card at all let me just

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.270 
them to the SD card at all let me just
see<00:01:32.180> if<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.330> can<00:01:32.450> find<00:01:32.720> one<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.380> had<00:01:33.710> earlier

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
see if I can find one that I had earlier

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.179 
see if I can find one that I had earlier
on<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:34.970> this<00:01:35.119> one<00:01:35.299> will<00:01:35.530> supposedly<00:01:36.530> move<00:01:37.070> to

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
on so this one will supposedly move to

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.020 
on so this one will supposedly move to
the<00:01:37.310> SD<00:01:37.549> card

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
the SD card

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.250 
the SD card
there<00:01:38.330> we<00:01:38.479> go<00:01:38.600> it's<00:01:38.750> actually<00:01:38.990> done<00:01:39.110> it<00:01:39.200> this

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
there we go it's actually done it this

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.870 
there we go it's actually done it this
time<00:01:39.320> fantastic<00:01:40.189> although<00:01:40.610> I'm<00:01:40.729> not

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
time fantastic although I'm not

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.730 
time fantastic although I'm not
completely<00:01:41.119> sure<00:01:41.390> why<00:01:41.630> it's<00:01:42.200> only<00:01:42.439> some

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
completely sure why it's only some

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.859 
completely sure why it's only some
applications<00:01:43.400> that<00:01:43.580> do<00:01:43.970> seem<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.509> be<00:01:44.689> able<00:01:44.780> to

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
applications that do seem to be able to

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.499 
applications that do seem to be able to
move<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.259> SD<00:01:45.560> others<00:01:45.920> not<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:46.640> much<00:01:46.820> but

it's<00:03:47.140> pretty<00:03:47.290> difficult<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.680> tell<00:03:47.859> at<00:03:47.950> this

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
it's pretty difficult to tell at this

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.130 
it's pretty difficult to tell at this
point<00:03:48.159> but<00:03:48.579> you<00:03:49.060> know<00:03:49.180> we'll<00:03:49.420> play<00:03:49.930> around

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
point but you know we'll play around

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.949 
point but you know we'll play around
with<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.500> HDR<00:03:50.920> video<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:52.180> see<00:03:52.420> whether<00:03:52.629> that

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
with the HDR video and see whether that

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.420 
with the HDR video and see whether that
is<00:03:53.290> actually<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.650> true<00:03:53.859> feature<00:03:54.129> or<00:03:54.310> whether

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
is actually a true feature or whether

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.190 
is actually a true feature or whether
it's<00:03:54.609> just<00:03:54.670> some<00:03:54.969> room<00:03:55.599> and<00:03:55.780> thing<00:03:55.959> at<00:03:56.079> this

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
it's just some room and thing at this

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.929 
it's just some room and thing at this
point<00:03:56.439> but<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.069> me<00:03:57.219> at<00:03:57.370> least

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
point but to me at least

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.660
