00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
gonna see if I can use that for pulleys

to<00:00:50.700> go<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.160> circular<00:00:53.160> motion<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.820> way<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
to go from a circular motion that way to

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.680 
to go from a circular motion that way to
turn<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.170> 90<00:00:55.649> degrees<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> circular

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
turn it 90 degrees to do a circular

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
turn it 90 degrees to do a circular
motion<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.710> way<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> rubber<00:01:00.000> band

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210

connecting<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> two<00:01:01.550> but<00:01:02.550> they're<00:01:02.699> quite

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
connecting the two but they're quite

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.690 
connecting the two but they're quite
large<00:01:03.120> holes<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> middle<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
large holes in the middle so I have to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.880 
large holes in the middle so I have to
add<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:08.390> barbecue<00:01:09.390> barbecue<00:01:10.020> skewer<00:01:10.740> up

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
add the barbecue barbecue skewer up

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.640 
add the barbecue barbecue skewer up
quite<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> lot<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.850> fit<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.650> I'll

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
quite a lot to make it fit so I'll

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.260 
quite a lot to make it fit so I'll
probably<00:01:13.799> wrap<00:01:14.159> some<00:01:14.430> tape<00:01:14.610> around<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.150> or

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
probably wrap some tape around it or

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.620 
probably wrap some tape around it or
something<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.420> I'll<00:01:18.509> have

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
something like that and then I'll have

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.130 
something like that and then I'll have
to<00:01:18.780> figure<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.080> some<00:01:19.409> way<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:20.630> mounting<00:01:21.630> that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
to figure out some way of mounting that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.890 
to figure out some way of mounting that
so<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.040> turn<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.720> make<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> little

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so that we can turn it make a little

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.490 
so that we can turn it make a little
tower<00:01:25.470> or<00:01:25.799> something<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.369> mount<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.790> on

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
tower or something to mount it on

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.539 
tower or something to mount it on
alright<00:01:28.500> I'm<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:28.979> wrap<00:01:29.189> tape

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
alright I'm just going to wrap tape

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
frame this until it's just big as that

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.429 
frame this until it's just big as that

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.759 
there a couple of beads now I got to
wrap<00:02:35.910> lots<00:02:36.239> of<00:02:36.390> tape<00:02:36.599> around<00:02:36.810> here<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.590> build

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
wrap lots of tape around here to build

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.160 
wrap lots of tape around here to build
it<00:02:37.920> up<00:02:38.010> again<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.629> can<00:02:39.810> put<00:02:40.019> that<00:02:42.170> over

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
it up again so that I can put that over

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.020 
it up again so that I can put that over
the<00:02:43.410> tape<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.950> hold<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.370> place<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.940> I'll

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
the tape and hold it in place and I'll

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.710 
the tape and hold it in place and I'll
probably<00:02:45.239> put<00:02:45.510> some<00:02:45.690> hot<00:02:45.900> glue<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.290> there<00:02:47.720> so

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
probably put some hot glue in there so

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.589 
probably put some hot glue in there so
hold<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.470> while<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.099> wind<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.459> up<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:54.390> now<00:02:54.540> to

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
hold it while we wind it up so now to

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:03.490 
hold it while we wind it up so now to
wrap<00:02:54.870> some<00:02:55.140> tape<00:02:55.319> around<00:02:55.620> here

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.780 

I'll<00:03:04.070> glue<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:04.610> axles<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.210> place<00:03:06.700> got<00:03:07.700> to

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
I'll glue the axles in place got to

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.530 
I'll glue the axles in place got to
remember<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.210> put<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.390> rubber<00:03:08.630> band<00:03:08.930> on<00:03:09.200> first

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
remember to put the rubber band on first

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.580 
remember to put the rubber band on first
there's<00:03:11.540> no<00:03:11.690> other<00:03:11.810> way<00:03:12.020> of<00:03:12.170> getting<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.500> in

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
there's no other way of getting it in

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.840 
there's no other way of getting it in
place<00:03:13.750> afterwards<00:03:15.160> unless<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.310> cut<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.730> and

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
place afterwards unless you cut it and

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.370 
place afterwards unless you cut it and
tie<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> knot<00:03:17.300> in<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.570> which<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.870> don't<00:03:17.930> want<00:03:18.140> to

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
tie a knot in it which I don't want to

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.620 
tie a knot in it which I don't want to
do<00:03:18.590> now<00:03:19.250> we<00:03:19.310> need<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:20.560> mount<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:22.520> bit<00:03:22.850> at<00:03:23.480> the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
do now we need to mount this bit at the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:32.590 
do now we need to mount this bit at the
right<00:03:23.810> sort<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.200> height<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:32.030> we<00:03:32.060> don't<00:03:32.390> put<00:03:32.570> too

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
right sort of height so we don't put too

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.920 
right sort of height so we don't put too
much<00:03:32.900> stress<00:03:33.440> on<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.740> rubber<00:03:33.920> band<00:03:34.930> but

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
much stress on the rubber band but

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:51.370 
much stress on the rubber band but
enough<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.380> keep<00:03:36.410> it<00:03:36.740> reasonably<00:03:37.700> tight<00:03:50.380> so

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
enough to keep it reasonably tight so

00:03:51.380 --> 00:04:02.580 
enough to keep it reasonably tight so
just<00:03:51.709> that

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.430 

suppose<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.370> can<00:04:03.489> always<00:04:04.110> unglue<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.260> and

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
suppose I can always unglue it and

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.960 
suppose I can always unglue it and
reglue<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:06.040> if<00:04:06.160> I<00:04:06.250> got<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.520> wrong<00:04:11.760> but<00:04:12.760> that

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
reglue it if I got it wrong but that

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.180 
reglue it if I got it wrong but that
should<00:04:13.150> be<00:04:13.180> about<00:04:13.510> right<00:04:13.780> there<00:04:14.380> we<00:04:14.590> are<00:04:14.620> all

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
should be about right there we are all

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.430 
should be about right there we are all
up<00:04:15.430> together<00:04:18.510> quite<00:04:19.510> thick<00:04:19.840> rubber<00:04:20.109> bands

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
up together quite thick rubber bands

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.540 
up together quite thick rubber bands
I've<00:04:20.859> actually<00:04:21.010> used<00:04:21.190> for<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.790> motor<00:04:23.550> so

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
I've actually used for the motor so

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:45.360 
I've actually used for the motor so
we'll<00:04:24.700> give<00:04:24.850> it<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:25.000> test<00:04:25.210> run<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:44.370> could

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
we'll give it a test run I could

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.550 
we'll give it a test run I could
probably<00:04:45.610> have<00:04:45.790> done<00:04:45.970> with<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.169> tighter<00:04:47.169> rubber

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
probably have done with a tighter rubber

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.260 
probably have done with a tighter rubber
band<00:04:47.830> on<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.100> back<00:04:48.370> because<00:04:48.669> it's<00:04:48.820> slipping<00:04:49.180> a

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
band on the back because it's slipping a

00:04:49.270 --> 00:05:00.050 
band on the back because it's slipping a
bit<00:04:49.620> but<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.680> think<00:04:50.889> it'll<00:04:51.040> be<00:04:51.190> okay

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.860
