00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.660
 to present the short film of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.720
 breast the short film from which the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.360
 feature film of the same name produced 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.910
 and led by we walk yeti and her sister 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.239
 barbarian machete this short film has 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.570
 a technically very clean style 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:33.300
 perfect and is loaded with excitement 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.340
 terror and is suggestive 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.380
 but deeply exciting this

 short film has a sequence shot 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.210
 very long built of several planes

 united through the digital edition 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.210
 that showed me instantly that 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.309
 andy was a director with style but with 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.190
 very big awareness of the narrative 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.980
 be about to see a short that is of 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.590
 the shortest but most terrifying 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.640
