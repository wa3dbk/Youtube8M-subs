some peaks and some lows it really does

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.370 
some peaks and some lows it really does
a<00:03:02.850> lot<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.150> great<00:03:03.480> things<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.110> audio

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
a lot of great things for the audio

acceleration<00:03:07.410> really<00:03:08.310> makes<00:03:08.490> this<00:03:08.670> possible

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
acceleration really makes this possible

there<00:03:11.280> on<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.520> dial<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.660> called

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
there on the dial and that is called

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.280 
there on the dial and that is called
scout<00:03:13.410> mode<00:03:13.740> that<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.850> very<00:03:15.120> much<00:03:15.360> like<00:03:15.630> bionic

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290
