00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.359 
Wolfenstein who did the let's play
campaign<00:00:27.270> so<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.380> learner<00:00:28.680> doesn't<00:00:28.949> if<00:00:29.100> we<00:00:29.189> did

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
campaign so a learner doesn't if we did

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.250 
campaign so a learner doesn't if we did
that<00:00:29.490> instead<00:00:29.970> where<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:30.180> going<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.630> is

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that instead where I'm going to do is

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.259 
that instead where I'm going to do is
take<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.099> through<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> rundown<00:00:32.789> of<00:00:32.850> each<00:00:33.090> of

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
take you through a rundown of each of

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:35.210 
take you through a rundown of each of
the<00:00:33.329> cars<00:00:33.600> they<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.470> get<00:00:34.590> without<00:00:34.770> cheat<00:00:35.010> code

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
the cars they can get without cheat code

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.400 
the cars they can get without cheat code
so<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.940> would<00:00:36.450> take<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> little<00:00:36.750> bit<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.230> look

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
so I would take a little bit of a look

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.200 
so I would take a little bit of a look
at<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.070> different<00:00:38.340> weaponry<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.030> mount

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
at the different weaponry you can mount

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.660 
at the different weaponry you can mount
on<00:00:39.450> them<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.140> what<00:00:40.620> they<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:41.070> today<00:00:41.309> I've

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
on them and what they can do today I've

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.600 
on them and what they can do today I've
got<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.469> BB<00:00:43.469> x<00:00:43.620> leprechaun<00:00:44.219> which<00:00:44.430> is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
analogous to the AMC Gremlin and I've

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.380 
analogous to the AMC Gremlin and I've
got<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> 7.62<00:00:50.070> millimeter<00:00:50.640> minigun<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.300> the

got the 7.62 millimeter minigun on the
top<00:00:51.680> mostly<00:00:52.680> as<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.890> tried<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> fire

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
top mostly as I tried this with the fire

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.569 
top mostly as I tried this with the fire
rocket<00:00:54.480> 60<00:00:55.170> rounds<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.649> rocket<00:00:56.010> ammunition<00:00:56.489> is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
rocket 60 rounds of rocket ammunition is

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.750 
rocket 60 rounds of rocket ammunition is
not<00:00:56.820> enough<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.780> fight<00:00:57.960> against<00:00:58.760> separate

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
not enough to fight against separate

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.810 
not enough to fight against separate
opponents<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:01.160> for<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> dropper

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
opponents so for a dropper

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.479 
opponents so for a dropper
we've<00:01:03.660> got<00:01:03.840> land<00:01:04.049> mines<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.159> all<00:01:05.339> we've

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
we've got land mines so really all we've

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.859 
we've got land mines so really all we've

this<00:01:06.990> new<00:01:07.139> tiny<00:01:07.350> car<00:01:07.700> we<00:01:08.700> got<00:01:08.819> a<00:01:08.850> couple<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
this new tiny car we got a couple of

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.149 
this new tiny car we got a couple of
specials<00:01:09.600> though<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.409> specials<00:01:10.859> include

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
specials though and the specials include

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.340 
specials though and the specials include
the<00:01:11.340> blower<00:01:11.819> to<00:01:12.270> increase<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.749> top<00:01:12.899> speed<00:01:13.200> by

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the blower to increase the top speed by

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.510 
the blower to increase the top speed by
25%

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
25%

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.449 
25%
I<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:15.149> acceleration<00:01:15.840> by<00:01:15.990> 10%<00:01:16.619> which<00:01:17.310> is

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:17.459 
I think acceleration by 10% which is

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:18.559 
I think acceleration by 10% which is
something<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.849> definitely<00:01:18.029> need<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.509> this

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:18.569 
something we definitely need in this

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.690 
something we definitely need in this
little<00:01:18.840> car<00:01:19.020> because<00:01:19.349> I've<00:01:19.469> only<00:01:19.619> got<00:01:19.859> the<00:01:19.979> v8

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
little car because I've only got the v8

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.510 
little car because I've only got the v8
I<00:01:20.999> think<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:22.560> keep<00:01:22.679> the<00:01:22.829> weight<00:01:23.009> down<00:01:23.219> to<00:01:23.279> keep

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
I think to keep the weight down to keep

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.629 
I think to keep the weight down to keep
the<00:01:23.609> car<00:01:23.759> actually<00:01:23.939> nimble<00:01:24.479> still<00:01:25.579> since<00:01:26.579> the

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:26.639 
the car actually nimble still since the

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:27.800 
the car actually nimble still since the
car<00:01:26.789> does<00:01:26.939> how<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.209> armor<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.569> got<00:01:27.719> this

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
car does how much armor we got this

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.690 
car does how much armor we got this
truck<00:01:28.109> tow<00:01:28.259> bumper<00:01:28.649> which<00:01:29.069> actually

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
truck tow bumper which actually

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.639 
truck tow bumper which actually
increases<00:01:29.969> the<00:01:30.539> chassis<00:01:30.899> reinforcements<00:01:31.560> in

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
increases the chassis reinforcements in

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.839 
increases the chassis reinforcements in
the<00:01:31.709> front<00:01:31.979> rear<00:01:32.539> doubles<00:01:33.539> it<00:01:33.659> actually<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849 
the front rear doubles it actually and

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:37.669 
the front rear doubles it actually and
got<00:01:35.849> the<00:01:35.939> heated<00:01:36.209> seats<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:37.349> the

about heated seats poke it actually

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.550 
about heated seats poke it actually
increase<00:01:42.549> your<00:01:42.579> ammunition<00:01:43.060> by<00:01:43.149> 10%<00:01:43.689> which<00:01:43.929> is
