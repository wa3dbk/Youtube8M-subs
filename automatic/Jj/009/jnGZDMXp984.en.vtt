so<00:00:36.340> we're<00:00:36.489> here<00:00:36.610> at<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.820> track<00:00:37.059> today<00:00:37.090> with

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
so we're here at the track today with

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.630 
so we're here at the track today with
the<00:00:37.719> 2013<00:00:38.199> portrait<00:00:38.949> boxer<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.430> third

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
the 2013 portrait boxer the third

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.270 
the 2013 portrait boxer the third
generation<00:00:39.879> of<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.300> car<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:41.079> see<00:00:41.350> how<00:00:41.649> well<00:00:42.010> it

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
generation of the car to see how well it

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.060 
generation of the car to see how well it
performs<00:00:42.820> 15<00:00:43.539> years<00:00:43.840> after<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.559> car<00:00:44.739> first

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
performs 15 years after the car first

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.299 
performs 15 years after the car first
debuted<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.870> handles<00:00:47.290> really<00:00:47.589> really<00:00:47.829> well

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
debuted it handles really really well

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.170 
debuted it handles really really well
very<00:00:48.579> easy<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:49.000> drive<00:00:49.210> on<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.449> throttle

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.180 

it's<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.570> much<00:00:54.719> more<00:00:54.780> well<00:00:55.289> balanced<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it's just so much more well balanced and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.270 
it's just so much more well balanced and
it's<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.760> easier<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> drive<00:00:57.570> very<00:00:57.960> quick

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.979 

so<00:01:03.280> this<00:01:03.400> third-generation<00:01:03.820> car<00:01:04.360> is<00:01:04.570> bigger

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
so this third-generation car is bigger

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.560 
so this third-generation car is bigger
in<00:01:05.290> almost<00:01:05.710> every<00:01:05.950> dimension<00:01:06.100> it's<00:01:06.850> over<00:01:07.510> an

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
in almost every dimension it's over an

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.150 
in almost every dimension it's over an
inch<00:01:07.720> longer<00:01:08.020> overall<00:01:08.410> with<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.860> two<00:01:09.010> and<00:01:09.130> a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
inch longer overall with the two and a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.190 
inch longer overall with the two and a
half<00:01:09.280> inch<00:01:09.490> longer<00:01:10.210> wheelbase<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.870> even<00:01:11.110> the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
half inch longer wheelbase and even the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.650 
half inch longer wheelbase and even the
top<00:01:11.530> is<00:01:11.830> bigger<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:12.790> that<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.060> opening

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
top is bigger so that the opening

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.850 
top is bigger so that the opening
stretches<00:01:14.170> further<00:01:14.530> back<00:01:14.830> on<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.220> car<00:01:16.860> it's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
stretches further back on the car it's

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.470 
stretches further back on the car it's
also<00:01:18.010> thankfully<00:01:18.550> slightly<00:01:19.030> lighter

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.850 

so<00:01:24.480> for<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.750> distance<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.260> Boxster<00:01:25.650> looks

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
so for the distance the Boxster looks

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 
so for the distance the Boxster looks
much<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.370> every<00:01:26.760> Boxster<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.330> preceded<00:01:27.840> it

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
much like every Boxster that preceded it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.200 
much like every Boxster that preceded it
but<00:01:28.410> Porsches<00:01:28.770> done<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.980> lot<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.640> kind<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.880> set

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
but Porsches done a lot to kind of set

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.720 
but Porsches done a lot to kind of set
this<00:01:30.450> car<00:01:30.840> apart<00:01:31.320> from<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.920> rear<00:01:32.070> especially

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
this car apart from the rear especially

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.490 
this car apart from the rear especially
you've<00:01:33.060> got<00:01:33.270> an<00:01:33.450> integrated<00:01:33.780> spoiler<00:01:34.320> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
you've got an integrated spoiler that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.410 
you've got an integrated spoiler that
runs<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.220> whole<00:01:35.250> distance<00:01:36.180> between

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
runs the whole distance between

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.450 
runs the whole distance between
taillights<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:38.070> sets<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
taillights and it really sets the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.060 
taillights and it really sets the
rear-end<00:01:38.850> off<00:01:39.030> nicely<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:40.410> the<00:01:40.560> 9/11

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
rear-end off nicely and like the 9/11

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.460 
rear-end off nicely and like the 9/11
that<00:01:41.160> was<00:01:41.280> redesigned<00:01:41.790> before<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.420> car<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that was redesigned before this car the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.670 
that was redesigned before this car the
folding<00:01:44.070> top<00:01:44.450> integrates<00:01:45.450> perfectly<00:01:45.990> into

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
folding top integrates perfectly into

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.740 
folding top integrates perfectly into
the<00:01:46.770> rear<00:01:46.980> deck<00:01:47.250> without<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:48.240> tonneau<00:01:48.600> cover

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the rear deck without a tonneau cover

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.580 
the rear deck without a tonneau cover
it's<00:01:49.440> just<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.770> beautiful<00:01:50.100> clean<00:01:50.340> look<00:01:54.590> as

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
it's just a beautiful clean look as

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.440 
it's just a beautiful clean look as
Porsche<00:01:56.010> files<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.880> boxer's<00:01:57.300> of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
Porsche files know the boxer's of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.540 
Porsche files know the boxer's of
mid-engine<00:01:57.900> car<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.590> means<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.250> has

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
mid-engine car and that means it has

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.850 
mid-engine car and that means it has
very<00:01:59.910> unique<00:02:00.000> driving<00:02:00.600> dynamics<00:02:01.290> there's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
very unique driving dynamics there's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.070 
very unique driving dynamics there's
just<00:02:02.190> something<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.940> visceral<00:02:03.570> about<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.960> way

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
just something so visceral about the way

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.710 
just something so visceral about the way
the<00:02:04.230> car<00:02:04.440> reacts<00:02:05.400> to<00:02:05.760> you<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.360> feel

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
the car reacts to you you can feel

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.520 
the car reacts to you you can feel
exactly<00:02:07.170> where<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.800> car<00:02:07.980> pivots<00:02:09.200> it's<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.290> very

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
exactly where the car pivots it's a very

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.740 
exactly where the car pivots it's a very
neutral<00:02:10.980> handling<00:02:11.460> car<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.240> balance<00:02:12.630> is

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
neutral handling car the balance is

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.870 
neutral handling car the balance is
almost<00:02:12.990> perfect<00:02:13.740> as<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.160> always<00:02:14.400> been<00:02:14.520> in

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
almost perfect as it's always been in

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.020 
almost perfect as it's always been in
