you<00:01:59.210> get<00:01:59.360> a<00:01:59.390> diploma<00:01:59.660> you<00:02:00.470> can<00:02:00.710> be<00:02:00.830> put<00:02:01.040> forward

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
you get a diploma you can be put forward

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.800 
you get a diploma you can be put forward
to<00:02:01.670> do<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.910> master<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:02.270> wine<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.630> there's

to do the master of wine that there's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.120 
to do the master of wine that there's
only<00:02:02.900> about<00:02:03.050> two<00:02:03.320> hundred<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:03.619> sixty<00:02:04.009> of<00:02:04.040> them

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
only about two hundred and sixty of them

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.850 
only about two hundred and sixty of them
in<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:04.940> world<00:02:05.119> so<00:02:05.500> probably<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.590> little<00:02:06.710> bit

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
in in the world so probably a little bit

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.889 
in in the world so probably a little bit
beyond<00:02:07.160> that<00:02:07.340> at<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.610> moment<00:02:07.729> it<00:02:08.119> but<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:08.840> a

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
beyond that at the moment it but is a

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.009 
beyond that at the moment it but is a
bit<00:02:09.230> beyond<00:02:09.500> me<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.489> in<00:02:11.060> terms<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.540> your<00:02:11.840> wine

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
bit beyond me and in terms of your wine

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.690 
bit beyond me and in terms of your wine
you<00:02:12.380> know<00:02:12.440> what<00:02:12.800> would<00:02:12.920> be<00:02:12.980> your<00:02:13.340> favorite

white<00:02:14.120> tipple<00:02:15.940> favorite<00:02:16.940> white<00:02:17.180> would

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
white tipple favorite white would

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.449 
white tipple favorite white would
probably<00:02:17.600> be<00:02:18.410> mercer<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:20.950> nice<00:02:21.950> japanese
