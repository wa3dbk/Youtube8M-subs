00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
and everybody thinks that all it was

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.629 
and everybody thinks that all it was
great<00:06:33.539> it's<00:06:33.830> something<00:06:34.830> like<00:06:34.860> been<00:06:35.310> another

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
great it's something like been another

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.110 
great it's something like been another
planet<00:06:36.240> so<00:06:36.449> they<00:06:37.289> start<00:06:37.860> to<00:06:38.070> buy<00:06:38.250> the<00:06:38.310> all<00:06:38.849> the

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
planet so they start to buy the all the

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.760 
planet so they start to buy the all the
people<00:06:39.389> that<00:06:39.419> they<00:06:39.660> know<00:06:39.690> and<00:06:40.110> that's<00:06:40.680> the

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
people that they know and that's the

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.200 
people that they know and that's the
reason<00:06:40.919> we<00:06:41.160> have<00:06:41.310> a<00:06:41.340> soul<00:06:41.610> cathedral<00:06:42.060> right

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
reason we have a soul cathedral right

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.300 
reason we have a soul cathedral right
here<00:06:42.449> because<00:06:43.169> the<00:06:43.289> fate<00:06:43.500> of<00:06:43.530> the<00:06:43.770> miners<00:06:44.099> own

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
here because the fate of the miners own

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.270
