with an angle that's almost straight my
next<00:00:04.560> shot<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:04.859> four<00:00:05.430> ball<00:00:05.640> at<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:05.970> end<00:00:06.210> of

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
next shot is four ball at this end of

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.780 
next shot is four ball at this end of
the<00:00:06.450> table<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:07.049> I'm<00:00:07.919> going<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.189> demonstrate

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
the table and I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.720 
the table and I'm going to demonstrate
how<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.000> can<00:00:09.320> draw<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.380> cue<00:00:10.679> ball<00:00:10.740> back<00:00:10.920> to

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
how we can draw the cue ball back to

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.279 
how we can draw the cue ball back to
either<00:00:12.030> side<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.900> four<00:00:13.139> depending<00:00:14.099> on

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
either side of the four depending on

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.450 
either side of the four depending on
obstructions<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.410> we'll<00:00:16.740> place<00:00:17.130> on<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
obstructions that we'll place on the

little outside English and I want to hit
it<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.170> softly<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.770> possible<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.579> minimize

can<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> draw<00:00:53.250> action<00:00:53.760> take<00:00:54.030> almost

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
can see the draw action take almost

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.060 
can see the draw action take almost
right<00:00:54.660> away<00:00:54.870> especially<00:00:55.260> after<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> ball

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
right away especially after the ball

leaves the rail again a touch of outside
English<00:00:58.859> helps<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.370> cheat<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> angle<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
English helps you cheat the angle of the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.229 
English helps you cheat the angle of the
shot<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.600> bit<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.489> also<00:01:02.489> helps<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.059> cue

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
shot a little bit and also helps the cue

ball run down the rail after contact
here<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> same<00:01:07.740> shot<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> Sun

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
here we have the same shot on the Sun

here we have the same shot on the Sun
with<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> opposite<00:01:10.799> problem<00:01:11.150> this<00:01:12.150> corner

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
with the opposite problem this corner

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.710 
with the opposite problem this corner
pocket<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.020> black<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.700> now<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.060> want<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.509> move

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
pocket is black and now I want to move

the<00:01:15.900> cue<00:01:16.080> ball<00:01:16.259> across<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.950> table<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.490> draw

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the cue ball across the table and draw

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.550 
the cue ball across the table and draw
it<00:01:18.360> back<00:01:18.540> from<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.869> floor<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:20.159> achieve<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.790> I

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
it back from the floor to achieve that I

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.070 
it back from the floor to achieve that I
like<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> elevate<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> cue<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> little

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
like to elevate the cue to get a little

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.950 
like to elevate the cue to get a little
jump<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.770> cue<00:01:26.009> ball<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:27.150> believe<00:01:27.840> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
jump and in cue ball and I believe that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
jump and in cue ball and I believe that
when<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.110> cue<00:01:28.350> ball<00:01:28.530> hits<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.979> seven<00:01:29.460> while

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
when the cue ball hits the seven while

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.580 
when the cue ball hits the seven while
it's<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> air<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.750> will<00:01:30.900> move<00:01:31.049> straight

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it's in the air it will move straight

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.100 
it's in the air it will move straight
sideways<00:01:31.950> into<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> cushion<00:01:33.060> leave<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
sideways into the cushion leave the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:48.260 
sideways into the cushion leave the
cushion<00:01:34.470> sideways<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.340> draw<00:01:47.149> there's<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
cushion sideways and then draw there's a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.670 
cushion sideways and then draw there's a
third<00:01:48.570> technique<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.380> haven't

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
third technique that we haven't

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.310 
third technique that we haven't
discussed<00:01:50.329> obviously<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:51.899> too<00:01:52.170> much

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
discussed obviously if we have too much

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.230 
discussed obviously if we have too much
cue<00:01:52.590> elevation<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.460> cue<00:01:53.640> ball<00:01:53.759> will<00:01:53.850> hop<00:01:54.030> too

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
cue elevation the cue ball will hop too

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.760 
cue elevation the cue ball will hop too
much<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.689> hit<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> object<00:01:55.049> ball<00:01:55.259> too<00:01:55.530> far

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
much and hit the object ball too far

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.590 
much and hit the object ball too far
above<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> equator<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:57.240> will<00:01:57.420> cause<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
above the equator this will cause the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.530 
above the equator this will cause the
cue<00:01:57.869> ball<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.020> launch<00:01:58.259> onto<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> rail<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
cue ball to launch onto the rail and

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.880 
cue ball to launch onto the rail and
usually<00:02:00.540> off<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> table<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.409> we're<00:02:01.619> lucky

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
usually off the table but if we're lucky

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.230 
usually off the table but if we're lucky
it<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.369> draw<00:02:02.549> back<00:02:02.759> onto<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.149> table<00:02:04.280> um<00:02:05.280> that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
it can draw back onto the table um that

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.150 
it can draw back onto the table um that
shot<00:02:06.479> worked<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:06.899> fine<00:02:07.229> cue<00:02:07.770> ball<00:02:07.920> came

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
shot worked out just fine cue ball came

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.740 
shot worked out just fine cue ball came
back<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.640> table<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.179> don't<00:02:09.450> want<00:02:09.660> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
back on the table but we don't want to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.800 
back on the table but we don't want to
jump<00:02:10.649> at<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.979> high<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.760> I'll<00:02:12.209> shoot

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
jump at that high so I'll shoot

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
jump at that high so I'll shoot
with<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.080> little<00:02:13.319> less<00:02:13.440> elevation<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.650> there

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
with a little less elevation and there

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.280 
with a little less elevation and there
it<00:02:25.920> is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
it is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.630 
it is
here<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.410> cue<00:02:28.590> ball<00:02:28.739> is<00:02:28.890> airborne<00:02:29.340> when<00:02:29.519> it

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
here the cue ball is airborne when it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.309 
here the cue ball is airborne when it
hits<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.910> cushion<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.540> stays<00:02:30.810> airborne

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
hits the cushion and it stays airborne

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.870 
hits the cushion and it stays airborne
for<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.590> while<00:02:31.739> after<00:02:32.190> leaving<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.519> cushion

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
for a while after leaving the cushion

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.420 
for a while after leaving the cushion
and<00:02:33.209> then<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.569> hops<00:02:33.840> um<00:02:34.110> all<00:02:34.349> this<00:02:34.769> delays<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
and then it hops um all this delays the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.920 
and then it hops um all this delays the
draw<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.970> allows<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.269> cue<00:02:36.450> ball<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:36.630> head

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
draw and allows the cue ball to head

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.059 
draw and allows the cue ball to head
across<00:02:37.140> table<00:02:38.810> look<00:02:39.810> at<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.989> same<00:02:40.170> shadow<00:02:40.470> 2/7

across table look at the same shadow 2/7

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.589 
across table look at the same shadow 2/7
again<00:02:41.310> with<00:02:41.519> us<00:02:41.700> with<00:02:41.970> an<00:02:42.090> angle<00:02:42.360> that's<00:02:42.450> a

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
again with us with an angle that's a

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.600 
again with us with an angle that's a
little<00:02:42.810> straighter<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.709> we're<00:02:44.370> going<00:02:44.550> to

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
little straighter and we're going to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.420 
little straighter and we're going to
show<00:02:44.850> we're<00:02:45.690> going<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.069> introduce<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.400> third

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
show we're going to introduce a third

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.850 
show we're going to introduce a third
technique<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.959> move<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.260> cue<00:02:49.440> ball<00:02:49.590> across

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
technique to move the cue ball across

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.699 
technique to move the cue ball across
the<00:02:49.980> table<00:02:50.400> when<00:02:50.730> we<00:02:50.850> need<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.239> for<00:02:52.049> position

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
the table when we need to for position

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.340 
the table when we need to for position
on<00:02:52.830> form<00:02:53.220> first<00:02:54.090> we'll<00:02:54.450> start<00:02:54.720> with<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.319> very

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
on form first we'll start with a very

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.199 
on form first we'll start with a very
straight<00:02:55.980> forward<00:02:56.010> straight<00:02:56.940> back<00:02:57.269> draw<00:02:57.950> when

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
straight forward straight back draw when

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.580 
straight forward straight back draw when
this<00:03:00.209> pack<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.690> black<00:03:00.930> then<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.230> want<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.470> keep

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
this pack is black then I want to keep

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.990 
this pack is black then I want to keep
the<00:03:01.709> cue<00:03:01.920> ball<00:03:02.069> on<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.310> same<00:03:02.519> side<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:02.849> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
the cue ball on the same side of the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.280 
the cue ball on the same side of the
table

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.900 

now<00:03:13.290> when<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.709> obstacle<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.400> over<00:03:14.640> on<00:03:14.760> this

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
now when the obstacle is over on this

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.900 
now when the obstacle is over on this
side<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.390> table<00:03:15.630> we<00:03:16.470> need<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:17.070> move<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
side of the table we need to move the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.789 
side of the table we need to move the
cue<00:03:18.090> ball<00:03:18.269> over<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.170> side<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.590> table

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
cue ball over to that side of the table

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.789 
cue ball over to that side of the table
to<00:03:20.010> shoot<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> four<00:03:20.549> into<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.880> clear<00:03:21.150> pipe

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
to shoot the four into the clear pipe

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.110 
to shoot the four into the clear pipe
because<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.920> angle<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.310> almost<00:03:23.730> straight

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
because the angle is almost straight

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.470 
because the angle is almost straight
here<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:25.100> can't<00:03:26.100> employ<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.730> same<00:03:27.000> technique

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
here I can't employ the same technique

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.960 
here I can't employ the same technique
where<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.720> hop<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.170> cue<00:03:28.380> ball<00:03:28.819> laterally<00:03:29.819> into

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
where I hop the cue ball laterally into

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.599 
where I hop the cue ball laterally into
the<00:03:30.180> cushion<00:03:30.569> so<00:03:31.200> I'll<00:03:31.410> play<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.859> shot<00:03:32.100> rail

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
the cushion so I'll play this shot rail

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:45.050 
the cushion so I'll play this shot rail
first<00:03:42.950> when<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.040> cue<00:03:44.220> ball<00:03:44.340> rebounds<00:03:44.880> off<00:03:45.030> the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
first when the cue ball rebounds off the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.330 
first when the cue ball rebounds off the
rail<00:03:45.389> at<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.780> shallow<00:03:46.139> angle<00:03:46.260> with<00:03:46.739> Bob<00:03:46.980> spin

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
rail at a shallow angle with Bob spin

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.309 
rail at a shallow angle with Bob spin
most<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.239> bottom<00:03:48.450> spin<00:03:48.569> is<00:03:48.720> retained<00:03:49.109> on

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
most of the bottom spin is retained on

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.199 
most of the bottom spin is retained on
the<00:03:49.410> rebound<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:50.340> still<00:03:50.579> get<00:03:50.700> good<00:03:50.970> draw

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
the rebound so we still get good draw

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.449 
the rebound so we still get good draw
action<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:52.530> looks<00:03:52.680> like<00:03:52.829> we<00:03:52.980> get<00:03:53.069> a<00:03:53.130> little<00:03:53.370> bit

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
action it looks like we get a little bit

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.830 
action it looks like we get a little bit
too<00:03:53.579> much<00:03:53.700> cut<00:03:53.970> angle<00:03:54.239> in<00:03:54.329> this<00:03:54.420> shot<00:03:54.630> but

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
too much cut angle in this shot but

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.390 
too much cut angle in this shot but
