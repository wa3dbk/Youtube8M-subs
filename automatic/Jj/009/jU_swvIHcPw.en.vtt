00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.170
 moisturizing fluid from mac 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.839

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.470
 this plot the tonal foundation we put 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.750

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.570
 from ghosts like a palette put on 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.410

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.239
 face everything as it should be visible places 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.309

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.379
 go to concealer clean concealer 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.100
 the illumination of the eyes of the very 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.110
 a little bit 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.530
 in those places where I have more 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.110
 dark circles like that and some dark ones 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.149
 places around the nose to the arm which is me 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.469
 I want to visually 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.170
 brighten and then small 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:08.159
 the brush is all well shaded to 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.990
 To make this type of dress Daria 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.060
 some more so serious already 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.130
 pimples or redness which are not 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.770
 overlapped strike based may 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.439
 overlap with such a dense concealer it 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.960

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.320
 The texture is perfect for 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.970
 overlapping pimples on the face as he 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.829
 gave one hundred percent coverage 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.799
 but it is by no means impossible 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.799
 use under your eyes that he will give you everything 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.100

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.930
 some kind of desert and only the same 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.000
 the brush is all gently shading 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.710
 not to erase the product but simply 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.610
 feather the edges to the observation 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.729

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.350
 natural anal orgy powders from meiko 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.750
 freerun I like it so much 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.969
 more honestly and she gives such 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.829
 the effect of the grout of pores in general after it as 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.790
 as if you have these beautiful ones 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.039
 places on the face 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.340
 super of course, where without a loved one 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.510

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.080
 bug under the cheekbones to even stronger 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.849
 highlight the form a little tax on the nose 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.519
 quite a bit and after that on 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.489
 invisible nonexistent second 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.129
 chin it seems to me not hurt 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.129
 no one because it always hunts to be 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.610
 more hem more slender so here's 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.440
 i put 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.019
 and our tonal basis 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.829
 blend better with mine 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.079
 skin tone and now we take highlighter 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.700

 Looks very natural I always 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.739

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.430
 highlighter and dry little bit here on 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.500
 nose and a little bit above the upper lip 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.290
 in order to make the lips in the hall stress more 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.900
 voluminous now go to the rouge 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.780

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.549

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.260
 the effect is just such freshness and color 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.750
 nice cream shadows now 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.910
 I will use instead of primer for 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.819
 chapters will not put really want 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.829
 keep picking up the first shade of the shadows 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.319
 this is the lightest shimmering shade of 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.090
 pallet chocolat battle of the east he 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.819
 is barely pinkish 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.200
 and put on under all moving eyelid 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.200
 even a little folder 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.950
 further medium brown shade 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.190
 we type on a fluffy brush 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.849
 and even if you create a tab, put it 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.510
 in the fold itself by sweat 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.470
 shade shade 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.660
 shade no clear edges yet 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.280
 can not see and we collect a little bit more god 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.709
 dark brown, too, those who 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.910
 neutral matt is the same on fluffy 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:22.560
 brush and slightly darken the outer 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.690
 corner for even more visible shape 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.020
 eye shape is what we have for this 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.120
 the moment happened here you can see 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.340
 I gave a little adjusting eyebrows when 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.740
 eyebrow pencil help this haze 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.139
 no reflection above mark 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.800
 picking up the brightest but already matte 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.200
 shade of cream shadows and emphasize under 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.750
 eyebrows now collect dark such 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:50.030
 burgundy brown burgundy hue 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:53.220
 a little more obscure the outer corners 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.370
 in order to be even more so dark 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.710
 little corner here is our final result not 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.080
 wall can now finish now 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.580
 we will draw arrows so you me 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.930
 there was no mirror began to draw 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.850
 otherwise I did not succeed 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.530
 I went to the mirror normally painted 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.650
 shooters and here already shows you 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.450
 what about me got here on 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.010
 one side with an arrow and here's the second 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.770
 country of disaster what do you like 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.350
 more water the same two lines are drawn 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.180
 then when we pass concealer 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.250
 by from the string itself and in order to 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.690
 clear the sum of some fallen shadows 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.030
 and so the arrow 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.720
 visually seemed more so clear and 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.210
 know more clearly this and now I take 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.280
 the lightest shade shimmer of 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.840
 palettes lorak about the first 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.030
 and put it on the inner corner of the eyes and 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.160
 shimmery so brown maroon 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.610
 shade walk along the bottom growth line 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.680
 eyelashes 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.940
 to shade a little bit and 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.270
 I like this zone very much when 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.070
 above there is a clear arrow below 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.990

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.810

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.960
 dark shadows and of course many many 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.849
 a lot of mascara and this me mascara from meybellin 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.370
 one of my favorites here is our tech 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:08.660
 which turned out I decided not to paste over 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.930
 cilia overhead just like that 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.070
 make up many layers of mascara for 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.500
 natural but volumetric effect and 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.840
 Now I put a lip liner on the whole 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.039
 surface year it chose its 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.060
 identical like natural my lips 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:24.740

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.840
 just put in order on it 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.190

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.590
 there are sponges of that and such an effect 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.740
