00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.109
 hello again yes here is the portrait of 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.940
 'the in the same clothes because I 'm going to 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:13.190
 make another video I made them the one 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.809
 beauty products and 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.000
 Well, if you have not seen it, I'm going 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.600
 to leave the link here and now we are going 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.180
 to see a few compresses of three towers that 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.119
 they are second-rate stores so are girls 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.340
 not only buy the sabers and buy 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.769
 second things and the truth is that I 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.870
 like to buy because I get it 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.630
 super cheap and I find super things 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.550
 good so well I like it a lot 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.340
 in these videos that's why I'm 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.050
 doing I know that many times good is 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.000
 what I think I see these videos of 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.460
 second purchases and I say there I never go 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.460
 to be able to find that but they are parents 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.860
 these videos because that's how you feel 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.600
 want to go find a second store 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.820
 say good it may be that you find me 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.160
 little treasures out there may be that I 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.800
 find super good things and super 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.440
 cheap so I do not take that much anymore 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.690
 and I'm going to show you what I found 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.549
 these stores and well first I go with 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.650
 little things I found for the gym 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:15.950
 I found station that is adidas if by 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.290
 there says adidas I loved it because 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.570
 I had been looking for many black this one 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.700
 and did not find or if it found cost 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 like 60 dollars or be clear that no 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.299
 thank you and this cost me three dollars like this 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.590
 I am very happy I like it very much 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.890
 is in perfect condition with 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.509
 conditions with visions well this way 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.670
 that good 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.920
 this is the one that I bought I also bought a 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.350
 chamarrita who had also had 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.470
 time I was looking for it and it's good 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.850
 this is 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.700
 pajinista is nike 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.880
 nike and I do not know how they say this but 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.799
 well it's also black with these lines 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.200
 white that makes me super basic 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.270
 because the black I feel that combines 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.280
 with everything aside my tennis or blacks 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.069
 it matters the clothes that I wear but I bring 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.899
 black tennis then I do not know how I like it 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.080
 apart from that about an orange all the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.720
 calories and well I do not follow true is 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.940
 that cost me is three dollars too 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.220
 in that store we went almost everything 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.670
 it cost three dollars so well 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.580
 everything went very cheap apart from that I think 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.870
 yes it had the label in tone 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.209
 yellow I think it 's halfway through 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.080
 price and well I also bought this 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.170
 blouse that is super basic is like that with 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.520
 this gesture from behind that I love that 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.280
 my friends call him a bricklayer 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.520
 this one is not lemon green very basic 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.590
 this did come out in about 50 I liked it 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.560
 a lot for the gym and now I'm going 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.490
 with the other things that are not like that anymore 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.490
 like for the gym 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.530
 is this pants that I used in the outfit 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.560
 of the day that if you have not seen it 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.360
 I'm going to leave this link here 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.060
 they told me to teach them the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.010

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.500

 I use it I do not know once in a lifetime 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.740
 do not spend so much other thing that I bought 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.870
 it was this sweater 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.390

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.160
 cost 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:58.730

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.380

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.020
 Real favorite is like celestial mint 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.020
 I loved that I also showed them to 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.990

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:38.060

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.689
 gifted to an unnameable this and I 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:36.469
 I liked it very much but I think that 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:40.219
 it cost 25 dollars and it's this blouse so 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:43.669
 simple but so pretty these flowers 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:45.000
 loved the design ends like this in tone 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:49.350
 White 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.050
 and it brings this as elastic as well 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.980
 I like to do Bombachita 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.960
 very much and it cost me up to three dollars 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.570
 so well those are all 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.480
 there will be no more videos of 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.130
 shopping from here to a good time or good 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.530
 who knows, maybe I'm going out there 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.690
 to see what I find this I hope that 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.050
 have liked these purchases that really 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.970
 be encouraged to go to second-hand stores 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.100
 There is nothing wrong with it, as I told you in 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:21.240
 a video there are people who buy clothes 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:24.870
 expensive and good you say good you do not know 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:28.050
 combine it does not fit well anything else 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.220
 they buy it for the brand and vice versa 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.600
 from other persons 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.300
 I have a friend who is good 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.150
 lover of the tianguis and finds things 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.220
 super nice that we say there 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.510
 where you buy and says you already know 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.480
 tianguis 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:45.030
 but the point is that you know how to combine 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.790
 what you know how to show it does not matter if it's 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.070
 new is used what is important is how 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:53.100

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.410

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.620
