00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello to you with this my first 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.319
 the report will come out and find out what 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.400
 solar panels and how to use them 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.990
 and how beautiful they are and everything about them so 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.059
 Our first panel is ours 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.369
 ordinary panel which gives one 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.289
 energy in the tag and connected to it six 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.939
 wires and for a short time she 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.850
 filled me up with everything and heat 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.490
 the keeper is the smallest vault 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.740
 industry admin 2 advises beginners 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.189
 where it just starts and when auth this 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.739
 the panels you see on your screen 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.469
 triangle or three glasses 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.760
 electrical circuit and coal dust generator 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.800
 you can safely crush the hand 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.079
 crusher and or just a crusher and 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.100
 The next panel we have is solarium and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.010
 call all 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.640
 avid players but it's called solar 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.800
 hall 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.520
 well shorter diesel fuel more simply it gives 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.820
 8 energy per tag by day and one energy per day 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.470
 night and also remembered this all in 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.470
 it will shrink like this 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.270
 quite complicated craft but still 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:20.530
 required by the people this is called a hybrid to 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:25.119
 and also called a hybrid to it up to 64 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.289
 energy in the tag and at night 8 and it is crafted 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.130
 here is how i am sorry mixed up 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.869
 here and so profits she is enough too 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 complex craft and and here it gives so much 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.340
 energy that is filled ears and 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.080
 The following is our multim otk 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.409
 Ultimat Soler Panel 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.750
 that is, ultimatum on and she's here to remember 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.179
 that all by him she produces 512 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.630
 energy it produces at night 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:58.179
 60 128 energy per tag and crafted 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.429
 in a very complicated way, I would also like to 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.830
 would add about the occasion to the wire if u 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.990
 you will not be over insulated wires 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.149
 there is not such they are for isolated 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.149
 I'll show you the wires 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.340
 if you have such a wire then to it 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.310
 will go away 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.840
 she energy stick on two wires so 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.670
 it's exactly the same note 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.230
 that's all with you was squeak out 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.360
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.360
 likes everyone good luck everyone yet
