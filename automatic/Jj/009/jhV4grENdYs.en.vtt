00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
havoc for anybody without commando pro

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.609 
havoc for anybody without commando pro
basically<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.329> circle<00:01:39.659> strafing<00:01:39.900> bonanza

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.260 
basically it's a circle strafing bonanza
for<00:01:40.650> anybody<00:01:41.189> who<00:01:41.310> wants<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.610> get<00:01:41.790> knife<00:01:42.000> kills

for anybody who wants to get knife kills
I'm<00:01:42.570> fairly<00:01:42.780> confident<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.770> bug<00:01:44.009> and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
I'm fairly confident that it's a bug and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.100 
I'm fairly confident that it's a bug and
not<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> hack<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.180> I'm<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.600> completely<00:01:45.960> sure

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
not a hack but I'm not completely sure

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.920 
not a hack but I'm not completely sure
about<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.880> only<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.570> found

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
about that and the only way that I found

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.960 
about that and the only way that I found
lobbies<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> was<00:01:49.979> stumbling<00:01:50.250> across<00:01:50.549> I'm

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
lobbies with it was stumbling across I'm

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.609 
lobbies with it was stumbling across I'm
trying<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.329> get<00:01:51.479> into<00:01:51.630> games<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.290> search<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
trying to get into games with search and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.679 
trying to get into games with search and
destroy<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:53.340> apparently<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.240> similar<00:01:54.479> to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
destroy going apparently it's similar to

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.810 
destroy going apparently it's similar to
a<00:01:54.930> glitch<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:55.710> fixed<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.130> January<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
a glitch that was fixed in January and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.969 
a glitch that was fixed in January and
it's<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.479> similar<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> care<00:01:58.649> package

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it's also similar to the care package

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.899 
it's also similar to the care package
glitch<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.579> said<00:01:59.759> earlier

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
glitch as I said earlier

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.169 
glitch as I said earlier
