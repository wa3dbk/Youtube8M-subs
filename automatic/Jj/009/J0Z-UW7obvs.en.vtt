00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:29.640
 go to the site microsoft games dot 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:36.149
 com and we see before us here such 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:42.840
 picture home server forums events 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:45.840
 I have it all automatically browser 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.469
 it does not interest us us cube kawaii desu 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.430
 whom to 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:57.760
 we are interested in the server 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:03.060
 so here we see everything before us 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.960
 usa europe canada australia asia 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.390
 what does it mean now I'll tell you 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.530
 it means that the server in one way or another 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.530
 the country is located 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:20.970
 otherwise you can see here 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.880
 go to Europe 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.500
 or Asia, it is the server is less likely 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.990
 lag me means that in front of you 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.090
 you see 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.830
 little green servers blue servers and 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.500
 red server 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.660
 what does this green server mean 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.040
 server which is in the lobby you 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.760
 there you can go as a player 7-ki 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.180
 server 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:57.020
 these are the ones that are in the game and you 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.670
 there may of these as a spectator and 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:06.060
 or they are dematmat 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.459
 or are they restarted holidays 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.190
 servers are servers offline which 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.190
 not working now which are disabled 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.130
 I recommend to play things in Europe or 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.510
 Asia these servers least fret 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.340
 but if you are so very good 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.049
 the Internet then 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.579
 you can play any well and Europe 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:38.280
 or Asia ping will be much less 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.579
 register here may not 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.579
 to register 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:52.950
 Well, in general, this is all forget to put 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.950
