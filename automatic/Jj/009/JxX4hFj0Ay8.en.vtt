like the file system and changing
permissions<00:02:38.040> for<00:02:38.660> folders<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.110> wouldn't

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
permissions for folders and I wouldn't

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:52.900 
permissions for folders and I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:42.080> um<00:02:44.269> system<00:02:45.269> library<00:02:48.739> oops

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
guess you can get rid of them if you

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.949 
guess you can get rid of them if you
want<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:17.840> send<00:03:19.400> up<00:03:21.859> send<00:03:22.859> oh<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:24.450> can<00:03:24.810> also
