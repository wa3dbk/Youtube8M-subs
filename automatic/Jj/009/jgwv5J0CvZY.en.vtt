00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
people just like you all right so the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.189 
people just like you all right so the
question<00:00:17.670> things<00:00:17.880> amino<00:00:18.480> acid<00:00:18.840> versus

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
question things amino acid versus

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.220 
question things amino acid versus
protein<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.800> I'm<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> assume<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
protein and I'm going to assume that the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.200 
protein and I'm going to assume that the
question<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.880> essentially<00:00:23.880> what's<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
question is essentially what's the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.450 
question is essentially what's the
difference<00:00:24.570> would<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.500> take<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.920> versus<00:00:26.340> VI

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
difference would you take one versus VI

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.200 
difference would you take one versus VI
in<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.420> nutshell<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:29.340> needle<00:00:29.640> acids<00:00:30.000> are<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
in a nutshell the needle acids are the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.970 
in a nutshell the needle acids are the
basis<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.689> protein<00:00:31.080> right<00:00:31.199> protein<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
basis of protein right protein is just a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.260 
basis of protein right protein is just a
food<00:00:32.189> group<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.579> macaroni<00:00:32.940> trade<00:00:33.120> group

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
food group is a macaroni trade group

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.510 
food group is a macaroni trade group
amino<00:00:33.899> acids<00:00:34.350> are<00:00:34.530> what<00:00:34.739> makes<00:00:34.950> up<00:00:35.160> protein

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
amino acids are what makes up protein

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.340 
amino acids are what makes up protein
every<00:00:35.940> single<00:00:36.300> protein<00:00:36.690> has<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.930> degree<00:00:37.200> of

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
every single protein has a degree of

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.799 
every single protein has a degree of
amino<00:00:37.649> acids<00:00:38.040> right<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.730> chicken<00:00:39.210> they're

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
amino acids right so chicken they're

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.319 
amino acids right so chicken they're
very<00:00:39.930> plentiful<00:00:40.590> amino<00:00:41.010> acid<00:00:41.309> profile<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.300> I

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
very plentiful amino acid profile so I

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.110 
very plentiful amino acid profile so I
not<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.290> much<00:00:43.469> um<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.520> guys<00:00:44.640> are<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> see

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
not so much um you guys are going to see

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
not so much um you guys are going to see
up<00:00:45.390> algae<00:00:46.020> proteins<00:00:46.469> marketed<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.039> year

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
up algae proteins marketed this year

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.880 
up algae proteins marketed this year
next<00:00:47.520> year<00:00:47.670> algae<00:00:48.600> proteins<00:00:48.960> are<00:00:49.079> good<00:00:49.230> but

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
next year algae proteins are good but

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.410 
next year algae proteins are good but
they're<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> complete<00:00:50.550> amino<00:00:50.730> acid<00:00:51.090> profile

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
they're in a complete amino acid profile

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.200 
they're in a complete amino acid profile
I<00:00:51.510> don't<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.899> every<00:00:52.230> amino<00:00:52.410> acid<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.370> amino

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
I don't have every amino acid so amino

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.819 
I don't have every amino acid so amino
acids<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.629> basis<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.079> protein<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
acids are the basis of protein but to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.080 
acids are the basis of protein but to
the<00:00:55.920> more<00:00:56.100> advanced<00:00:56.460> part<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> question

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the more advanced part of the question

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.510 
the more advanced part of the question
which<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.360> when<00:00:58.050> would<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.379> take<00:00:58.590> amino<00:00:59.129> acids

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
which is when would we take amino acids

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
which is when would we take amino acids
so<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> branch<00:01:00.329> chain<00:01:00.600> amino<00:01:00.629> acid<00:01:01.469> product<00:01:01.800> or

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
so a branch chain amino acid product or

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.369 
so a branch chain amino acid product or
an<00:01:02.010> essential<00:01:02.520> amino<00:01:02.699> acid<00:01:03.030> product<00:01:03.359> versus<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
an essential amino acid product versus a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.859 
an essential amino acid product versus a
whey<00:01:04.530> protein<00:01:04.920> shake<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.369> whole<00:01:06.060> chicken

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869

the deal I'm not the biggest believer in

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.730 
the deal I'm not the biggest believer in

let's not say don't take them or
recommend<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.170> think<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.830> fantastic

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

and<00:02:04.469> markers<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.399> they're<00:02:05.520> saying<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.850> okay

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.520

we<00:02:06.780> know<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.200> X<00:02:07.940> comes<00:02:08.940> before<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.300> lie<00:02:09.530> so

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
we know that X comes before a lie so

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.240 
we know that X comes before a lie so
then<00:02:10.679> by<00:02:11.310> having

then by having
we<00:02:12.400> get<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.790> see<00:02:12.970> that's<00:02:13.600> essentially<00:02:14.050> what

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
we get to see that's essentially what

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.770 
we get to see that's essentially what
they<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.320> is<00:02:14.590> they<00:02:14.980> measure<00:02:15.480> steps<00:02:16.480> they<00:02:16.630> say

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
they do is they measure steps they say

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.440 
they do is they measure steps they say

taking leucine and that means we'll get

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.720 
taking leucine and that means we'll get

because<00:03:41.560> during<00:03:41.890> training<00:03:42.400> your<00:03:42.519> body<00:03:42.700> is

branched chain amino acids so you have
