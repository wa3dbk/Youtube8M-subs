00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.830
 number of beats per minute we're going to 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.000
 football simple at this tempo there the 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.170

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.700
 second demonstration and one and two and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.700

 young people before going further 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.580
 practice training yourself 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.940
 chords it leaks and works 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.230
 slowly and especially with the metronome 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.270

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.130
