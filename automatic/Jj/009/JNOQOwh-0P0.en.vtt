 very good girls boys and creatures 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.350
 strangers of the night welcome to 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.840
 new pisco the vine if we're going to 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.920
 take from being royser and I hope that 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.380
 announcement so I can not get the colleja 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.390
 before I start good I 'm going to say 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.580
 this game is developed by epic 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.500
 games is a group of programmers 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 here in Spain and it is a title 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.830
 that will be available to play or 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.650
 from our browser or from 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.120
 portable devices either ios or 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.309
 Android or that thing that is appreciated a 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.170
 heap by ricky his mule that we can 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.730
 play from the browser and we are by 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.859
 the street and we want to take a look at the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.829
 game and mentally from our mobile 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.539
 Well, we can see how this game goes 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.030
 It will also have an exciting 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.159
 historical background that good what we 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.870
 what it is going to do to us is to occupy a planet 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.179
 which is going to be our first colony 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.339
 and from there we will be able to expand 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.659
 our empire there where our fund 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.780
 of power take us or leave a new 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:05.040
 limit we can go 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.479
 encompasses everything we want maybe that way 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.240
 entrance can remind us a little bit to 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.869
 someone for something that is a game in the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.210
 that we are going to manage a newspaper and 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.950
 sorry as multiplayer but these 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.170
 roots will offer us much more 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.090
 game depth to start the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.490
 galaxy will be divided into three 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.289
 zones in the first of which is the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.299
 central area we will be able to develop 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.270
 our activity in a peaceful way and 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.100
 we will be under the tutelage of the empire 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.259
 let's say imperious as well as a 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.740
 entity that is going to handle the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.060
 the central area does not give something 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.819
 well as I know, it seems to me that the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.520
 been the worcester planet if it fit 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.560
 something like that and yes in the if we have 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.330
 our planets in that area we're going to 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.380
 have to pay taxes to be able to 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.299
 have obstacles or is good the option is 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.569
 the second option the second zone that 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.130
 we are going to be able to populate is the apps are 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.470
 would be the outskirts of the central area 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.539
 that is there the empire has something of 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.060
 power but already for example with the 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.330
 taxes will not be able to, although that's what 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.400
 what 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.920
 there yes we go we risk that we 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.010
 attack so in reality so 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.420
 let us what taxes we will 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.420
 have to invest in defense 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.190
 if we do not have the resources but 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.620
 equally resources are going to have 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.060
 to invest to defend ourselves and 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.980
 finally more we have the ring 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.410
 exterior that is the furthest zone from 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.930
 the galaxy and we have that there is a 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.300
 lottery or we can bring us a 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:47.660
 impressive booties of resources or 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:51.090
 coins that I'm discovering that are 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.120
 in alpha phase because I have not yet been able 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.130
 palpated in quotes because that 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.630
 that area is a lottery 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.340
 the same we bring some boots 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.470
 awesome that is the same thing we go back 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.790
 dead all without ships destroyed it 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.349
 there they must fight the law of the strongest 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.930
 at risk and if that were not enough, that is to say yes 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.159
 yes we already have three options to talk about 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.769
 colonize three zones 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:19.060
 we also have to choose 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.549
 how are we going to face the universe 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.939
 who wants to be a trader who wants 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.370
 be a military empire or that is either 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.569
 to life pirates life better 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.879
 radio game that you can choose 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.069
 what you want to be and it's one thing that 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.099
 cool another of the strong points 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.989
 As you mentioned already the I spend on 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.609
 I have three fingers on the tongue 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.950
 strong points is the background 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.709
 historical or smells or whatever you want 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.329
 call that are being created around 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.849
 to the fire which gives a feeling of 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.799
 immersion and this is something very good for 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.970
 the ones that we read give it a point that 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.970
 rolero to his games 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.629
 I will not explain it calm down simply 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.909
 that science fiction stories 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.620
 well, he's going to have a universe with 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.800
 quite a background in fact already starts to 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.040
 see stories to go soaking 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.980
 in the blog that as always the box 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.480
 description the direction of the games and 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.580
 good about the gameplay of 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.500
 moment I know that we will be able to improve the 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.290
 firmness that we exploit the resources then 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.630
 improving a species the things that are 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.360
 a mine using very well how it works 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.770
 I imagine we must diversify and 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.240
 we can also remain ships but as 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.340
 I already tell you the game is to find a 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.250
 alpha phase very early my life more 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.570
 materiality say that alpha and 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.800
 are testing this that the 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.900
 game between the creation of the first 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.410
 thousands of settlers who practiced tucked 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.270
 2002 2,500 settlers like that to start for 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.740
 see what that process is to see if not 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.510
 saturated followers and there are no mistakes 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.890
 now at the time of massifying all the 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.710
 game and such and at the moment it seems that it is 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:59.480
 working well a good problem this 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.610
 how are you seeing is the galaxy that is 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.800
 has created for the alpha version and if it is 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.900
 the bullshit face that I loved 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.090
 of the greatest but good 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.650
 As you can see, we can expand to enter 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.080
 local groups and continue to expand 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.000
 then to visualize the planets of 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.830
 each star will now appear as a thing 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.240
 simple but when you implement two 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.699
 final hands the thing is complicated then the 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.039
 size of the huge profits 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.380
 immense giants I do not know the exact number 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.300
 how many stars will come the 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.759
 galaxy inc I do not know but I saw 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.280
 it turns to me it's like seriously and inside 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.020
 of each dot of those there is then a 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.840
 local group and within that local group 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.479
 of the star that is there has 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.199
 planets like to know a lot a lot 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.199
 a lot of colonizing 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.199
 it's a pride to participate in a project 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.870
 of this caliber and more considering 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.699
 which is a project that is being done 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.479
 in spain and in fact you are seeing the 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.479
 photos of the team 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.300
 and good that I hope to be the most useful 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.009
 possible in the alpha and be able to say here to 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.930
 a few years old when this game is 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.490
 known because it is going to be sure that 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.560
 that I was there from the beginning 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.180
 lending a hand and supporting him and I hope 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.280
 than finding many bugs so that 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.310
 then do not appear in the beta phase and 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.690
 much less in arguís please and nothing 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.760
 I advise you so it's very 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.490
 close and if you have creation 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.530
 If you want creation, then you have 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:31.510
 creation not if you have knowledge 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.510
 on creation of the video game 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.199
 you know that something about creation of 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.490
 video games and get in touch with 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.500
 them because although at the moment 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.360
 We are looking for anyone but good 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.270
 never comes out later later the 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.960
 people that take into account 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:52.430
 adjusts the labor situation of the country and 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:55.280
 Well, I hope I can do very good 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.500
 and I hope to do another gameplay very soon 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.030
 and any have them implemented 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.060
 functionalities and such that can show 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:04.070
 and good but for now this is what 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.540
 I hope that as well as by way of 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.750
 introduction and so that we started to hear 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.550
 talk about it has served you and what 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:14.530
 I always hope you liked it and we 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.530
 we see in the next fish and chao
