00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
and I've got 2 x pi/4 throw on there

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.160 
and I've got 2 x pi/4 throw on there
soon<00:00:48.320> but<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:50.000> real<00:00:51.000> difference<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.989> like

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
away this part right here used to be it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.270 
away this part right here used to be it
was<00:01:23.100> plastic<00:01:23.540> now<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:24.960> piece<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
was plastic now it's a one piece this is

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.100 
was plastic now it's a one piece this is
the<00:01:26.369> only<00:01:26.460> part<00:01:26.729> that's<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:27.150> color<00:01:27.780> matched

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110

difference<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.560> headlights<00:01:34.560> they<00:01:34.979> spaced

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
difference the headlights they spaced

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.670 
difference the headlights they spaced
them<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.640> leads<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.990> think<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:37.619> were

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
them out leads to be I think they were

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.130 
them out leads to be I think they were
fat<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.310> end<00:01:38.579> or<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.880> fat<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
fat on this end or the fat on one of the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.160 
fat on this end or the fat on one of the
other<00:01:40.259> ends<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.530> can't<00:01:40.740> remember<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:42.170> that's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
other ends I can't remember but that's

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.240 
other ends I can't remember but that's
what<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:43.439> did<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.710> make<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> headlights

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
what they did to make the headlights

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.170 
what they did to make the headlights
look<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.460> little<00:01:44.579> different<00:01:44.909> they<00:01:44.970> just

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
look a little different they just

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.670 
look a little different they just
changed<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> taillight<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.079> basically<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
changed the taillight it's basically the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.499 
changed the taillight it's basically the
same<00:01:46.890> same<00:01:47.659> style<00:01:48.659> rear<00:01:48.960> end<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:49.890> looks

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
same same style rear end it just looks

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.700 
same same style rear end it just looks
looks<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> little<00:01:51.659> sleeker<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> little

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
looks a little sleeker it is a little

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.200 
looks a little sleeker it is a little
sleeker<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:55.759> then<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.850> course<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.090> got

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
sleeker but so then of course you got

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.070 
sleeker but so then of course you got
the<00:01:57.360> Abdullah<00:01:57.750> chips

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
the Abdullah chips

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.110 
the Abdullah chips
I<00:01:59.400> this<00:02:00.400> one<00:02:00.640> supposedly<00:02:01.120> doesn't<00:02:01.900> have<00:02:02.260> the
