are 80 inches and the depth these are 24
inches<00:01:51.270> deep<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:52.430> we've<00:01:53.430> got<00:01:53.700> about<00:01:54.200> 23

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
inches deep and we've got about 23

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.600 
inches deep and we've got about 23
inches<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.649> work<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.310> we'll<00:01:56.430> probably

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
inches to work with so we'll probably

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.109 
inches to work with so we'll probably
have<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.049> shave<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.200> back<00:01:58.380> off<00:01:58.619> which<00:01:59.119> should

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
have to shave it back off which should

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.580 
have to shave it back off which should
be<00:02:00.240> fine<00:02:00.420> these<00:02:00.689> cabinets<00:02:00.990> are<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.409> wide

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
be fine these cabinets are not that wide

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.289 
be fine these cabinets are not that wide
only<00:02:01.890> about<00:02:01.979> 21<00:02:02.430> inches<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.909> drawers

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
only about 21 inches the drawers

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.800 
only about 21 inches the drawers
themselves<00:02:03.689> went<00:02:03.810> about<00:02:03.899> 21<00:02:04.290> inches<00:02:04.320> deep<00:02:04.770> so

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
themselves went about 21 inches deep so

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.960 
themselves went about 21 inches deep so
we're<00:02:06.810> going<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.310> cut<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.520> height<00:02:08.640> first

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
we're going to cut it to height first

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.790 
we're going to cut it to height first
and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:09.420> see<00:02:09.690> how<00:02:09.899> she<00:02:09.959> fits<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.410> there<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
and then see how she fits in there and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.530 
and then see how she fits in there and
probably<00:02:11.520> have<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.879> shave<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> little<00:02:12.180> off<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
probably have to shave a little off the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.180 
probably have to shave a little off the
back

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
back

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.750 
back
and<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:15.590> can<00:02:15.770> see<00:02:15.950> from<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.190> back<00:02:16.370> how<00:02:16.580> about

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
and you can see from the back how about

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.880 
and you can see from the back how about
how<00:02:16.940> wide<00:02:17.690> it's<00:02:17.900> going<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.170> be<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:18.620> going<00:02:18.680> to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890
