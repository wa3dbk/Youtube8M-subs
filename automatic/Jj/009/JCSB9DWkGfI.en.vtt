00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello guys how are you and yoandy I hope 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.189
 they are all well today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.809
 crown with all of you on the subject 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.880
 that I had already promised you two 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.219
 past videoblogs and is how to clarify the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.680
 skin easily and progressively and over 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.420
 all economical so let's go to it 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.980
 when I referred to an easy trick and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.779
 simple to lighten the skin of the face 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.599
 I was really referring to a pretty trick 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.929
 easy and simple to do only 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.789
 we need lemons and cotton I want 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.080
 show the brand of cottons because 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.150
 I do not want to advertise this brand 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.580
 punctually but I like it 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.280
 the cotton that comes in small flakes and 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.870
 small specks 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.239
 the people and ingenious and easy to 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.219
 use this mixture is very easy to 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.960
 do guys only is to extract the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.910
 lemon juice in a bowl and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.370
 combine it with a little water and then 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.890
 dip one of the flakes in this 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.720
 mix and pass it through the area 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.970
 affected towards your whole face be a 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.979
 punctual person include the neck and 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.420
 others because you want to clarify the 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.729
 face but you also want to clarify the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.379
 neck that also usually burns 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.420
 much tans a lot with the sun 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.159
 Once you apply lemon juice 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.170
 the face is important to let dry 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.390
 the mixture in a shady place in a 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.869
 dark place where there is no lightning 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.700
 of the sun because it is well known that the sun 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.409
 in combination with the lemon stain the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.880
 good skin and that is precisely what 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.880
 we want to avoid spots and other 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.890
 ah 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.730
 Usually when I read you this 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.770
 mix with lemon juice I prefer 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.740
 put a small towel with water 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.690
 hot on my face this opens the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.790
 pores and makes lemon juice 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.680
 penetrate a lot more on the skin and the 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.410
 effect is much much faster very much 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.970
 more cash is very important guys 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.710
 let them know that if they dare to do this 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.910
 treatment with lemon juice 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.980
 results are seen around the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.110
 third or fourth week then you have to 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.910
 be loaded with a lot of patience 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.940
 discipline and use the mask 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.440
 every day since we are talking 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.760
 of lemon from lemon juice that can 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.770
 become a pretty ingredient 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.480
 strong for the skin it is important that the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.730
 skin do not have any kind of wound 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.350
 no kind of open life about everything 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.180
 of acne because lemon what is going to do 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.250
 is to irritate even much more the 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.140
 skin to hurt the wounds you have 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.390
 open and good will burn you 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.010
 It is a little unpleasant experience 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.620
 so it is very important that you have the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.790
 skin in perfect condition and finally 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.860
 talking about this mask for 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.090
 rinse the skin with lemon is very very 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.370
 important I think it's one of the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.319
 most important steps guys 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.599
 and it is the use of anti solar all 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.980
 days so it's raining or whatever 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.629
 the day is cloudy, so the day 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.519
 it's sunny so it's not very 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.340
 sunny every day in any 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.200
 weather condition must be used the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.510
 same explained that uv rays see the 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.970
 sun are always present in the 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.159
 environment whether the day is rainy or 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.290
 the days on one side therefore always 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.970
 It is very important to use it 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.710
 I use the dawn probe mark 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.050
 I know that this brand especially 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.120
 specialized for when we go to the 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.400
 beach when we go to the pool but 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.170
 in truth it is the only formula that serves 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.490
 for my skin I really feel a 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.640
 protective cover and only beech 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.110
 I use the solar factor 50 although I think 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.570
 that there are solar factors up to 100 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.370
 since 50 because heaven is to say me 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.620
 it seems that the consistency is too much 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.220
 thickens and leaves the skin too greasy 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.380
 the 50 is ideal for me I do not know for you and 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.209
 for me it worked perfectly on 50 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.890
 I wanted to show you the song down because 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.930
 it's really a formula that works for me 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.240
 very much and maybe it also works for you 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.100
 you now talking about another alternative 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.750
 to lighten the skin I show you a 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.550
 product recommended to me by accelerator 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.470
 for two weeks the product is called 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.730
 very white listen very white and 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.350
 sorry the container is so 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.970
 but I had already told you that 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.680
 for lighting all products 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.269
 whites that show you good go to 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.040
 appear very very bright but it's going to 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.930
 be a club salt the product is called 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.419
 whitest is a cream that has a 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.690
 ingredient that is called if I'm not bad 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.120
 the hydroquinone the hydroquinone clarify 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.130
 the skin progressively like the 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.080
 lemon mask but a little more 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.360
 fast a little more accelerated the 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.040
 process the excess hydroquinone can 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.210
 become a bit harmful to 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.880
 health that's why 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.830
 I recommend as the first option in 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.660
 case such that the lemon are 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.880
 harmful to you I recommend this 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.410
 alternative is called white and I'm 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.490
 sure that he has put follow in 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.490
 any pharmacy 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.569
 finally guys to close the topic of 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.919
 the skin rinse I recommend 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.110
 again a product that you already 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.969
 I had talked about the past videoblog and it's 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.009
 of the marks is weapon is called sing 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.139
 Item 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.460
 and I consider this product more as a 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.499
 complement for the theme of the 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.080
 skin lightening 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:18.529
 in itself it is called civit radiance 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.949
 radiant and it's an emulsion that leaves the 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:24.379
 most luminous face literally more 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:27.559
 radiant brighter with a lot more 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:30.159
 light the skin reflects more light is made 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:34.969
 much more clearly to be a little bit more 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:37.149
 cleared and looks something like this is a 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.149
 cylinder 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.849
 in case parkinson I like it a lot and 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.430

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:49.449
 controlledly they can get it in

 any point of sale in companies 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.770
 I generally believe that it is present in 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.479
 spain usa and colombia but for being a 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.650
 international brand is very sure that what 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.650
 can get in any pharmacy
