00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.910
 these hydra divers work by two centimeters deep in 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.770
 more competitive him closed a gaseous mixture 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.770
 hydrogen-based 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.450
 thanks to the mixture idris another compound of hydrogen and helium and oxygen 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.070
 the respiratory and neurological constraints could be controlled 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.070
 up to 700 meters 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.810
 the data acquired at the test center cicae note was validated in 1988 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.070
 during the operation at sea he drives at 5,134 meters depth 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.750
 the support vessel had been specially adapted for diving 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.000
 with hydrogen 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.640
 these had required for reasons of safety inertage jumps of the zone 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.820
 surrounding the crates are empty and the implementation of complex procedures 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.310
 as well as the storage of very large quantities of hydrogen on the merits 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.960
 and thanks to the new helium technique he is no longer a very young woman 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.960
 these constraints have been removed 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.040
 June 23, 1985 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.639
 16 off cannes 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:23.229
 the four divers of the law of the ground in 30 questions for 12 days of saturation 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.229
 this standard helium mixture 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.360
 thank you 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.990
 even the rules 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.549
 noble 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:45.319
 in August 2010 after a good meal with friends the work of the divers down to 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.579
 consisted of connecting plagne straw elements underwater 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.629
 to the challenge 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.430
 for these intentions 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.760
 from 2 to 6 degrees 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.020
 on the work platform immersed two centimeters 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.739
 to we are in the heart of the closed-circuit breathing system 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.780
 the mixture of rossini explained by the diver who was fishing for lunch then surprised 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.239
 if before being sent to the front by the alpine umbilicus 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.749
 300 cubic meters only of a meeting of experts put to realize 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:44.749
 a deep, long-lasting worksite 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.239
 she 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.569
 so 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.219
 Yes 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.219
 we will do it 1 day 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.139
 in the future 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.449
 here 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.029
 my sense 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.029
 the world 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.780
 power of the divers 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.499
 their efficiency and their ability to work 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.499
 demonstrates the ergonomic qualities of the breathing mix 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.080
 France 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.080
 bilingualism 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.789
 after each return this is tomorrow the divers popular control the bus 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.789
 flowing 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.689
 lack of purpose 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.689
 find the right dosage of hydrogen in the balance sheet 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.589
 new diving techniques that have only one desire to return to height 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.689
 not prove it's reliability 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:53.849
 10-6 port-au-prince where it is a mission on all medium 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.139
 current underwater intervention 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.619
 this place of hydrogen communicating with the author of oxygen 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:02.619
 for South Korean shipyards on average great depth 

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:23.369
 June 28, 1996 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:26.369
 he will have 12 ends 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:31.409
 money has no salary 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.080
 leaving his reserve 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.279
 react to the article 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.669
 roland lavoie the balance sheet but it must be done with it is a power 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.659
 excellent divers this evening it's their second and third 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:51.199
 but especially it's the twelfth round of the last one today well the 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.300
 last considering these days 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.770
 well placed the last experience of this series that we started in 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.749
 83 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:00.779
 I think it just happened brilliantly
