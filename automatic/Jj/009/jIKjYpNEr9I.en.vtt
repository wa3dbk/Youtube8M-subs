00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.820
 Who needs it? 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.550
 so let's go to work right girl know if 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.899

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.239
 right here to add remove accounts 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.230
 from user ui 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.770
 so click it it is loading so 22 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.969
 little pinch 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.289
 then everything here is ready its old quota 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.850
 and the new 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.770
 I know that I have created it is necessary to create a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.979
 Also on the pc of you will have the one that is 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.320
 right administrator and the guest is and such 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.530
 so we knew to create an account 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.450
 if not here I wanted 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:24.659
 put the name of your account kits that is the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:27.240
 name type is serving jonas and several 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.240
 names there choose the name né 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.810
 the way the standard user chooses this 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.630
 because because it is difficult to catch viruses 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.670
 here with some guy next door will be the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.909
 third party will give as before will have 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.780
 Who pay that bill here? 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.189
 administrator is before him that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.970
 He's stirring, he's going to have to take it from here. 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.610
 the administrator that happens 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.040
 he can not this is going to be very difficult 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.710
 because I've endured a week putting 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.939
 a password that makes it difficult for you to invade 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.390
 to have this from here even more than 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.020
 happens may give up try harder 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.039

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.610

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.000
 here is the place to give dodo 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.770
 Your business there of your own means 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.200
 nor put her name to the new one 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.410
 name then everything puts the user to the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.740
 Standard user creates short cuts there. 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.220
 everything right and ends there with 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.250
 finalizations there was here ó do it gulf 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.290

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.200
 zone with the luck the account here is not old 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.050
 on this side, it's not the new one, right? 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.230
 but the new one on that side is there you 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.280
 explains new will take some by almost 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.310
 half an hour to start because 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.320
 Why are you preparing the desktop? 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.310

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:05.640
 they took it because it is the first use and 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:07.730
 keys freshness and tam in one understood already 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.160
 it will take time but it's worth it because 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.600
 the pc comes back as if it had a new website 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.640
 shop in giving 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:20.850
