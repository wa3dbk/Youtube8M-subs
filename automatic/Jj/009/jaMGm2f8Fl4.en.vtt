all together
in<00:02:43.920> fact<00:02:44.130> sometimes<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.670> know<00:02:44.880> what<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.030> do

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
in fact sometimes you know what I do

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.979 
in fact sometimes you know what I do
look<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.810> easier<00:02:46.140> take<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> spoon<00:02:47.570> it's<00:02:48.570> let<00:02:48.810> you

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
look it easier take a spoon it's let you

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.410 
look it easier take a spoon it's let you
eat<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.410> thinner<00:02:51.350> get<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.500> round<00:02:52.739> blend<00:02:53.100> it

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
eat this thinner get it round blend it

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.110 
eat this thinner get it round blend it
because<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.540> has<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:55.280> extend<00:02:56.690> its<00:02:57.690> importance

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
because it has to extend its importance

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.610 
because it has to extend its importance
now<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.540> all<00:03:00.690> mixed<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.110> absorbed<00:03:01.560> the
