if I can make a video about making
windows<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:27.000> HCI<00:00:27.390> compatible<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.740> those<00:00:28.890> of

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
windows a HCI compatible for those of

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.519 
windows a HCI compatible for those of
you<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.519> wonder<00:00:29.849> why<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.359> because<00:00:31.140> if<00:00:31.320> you

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
you that wonder why is because if you

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.740 
you that wonder why is because if you
have<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.430> hackintosh<00:00:32.880> installed<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.630> your

system you have to change your SATA mode
from<00:00:36.540> IDE<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.590> HCI<00:00:38.160> therefore<00:00:39.000> windows<00:00:39.450> mode

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
from IDE to a HCI therefore windows mode

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.090 
from IDE to a HCI therefore windows mode
is<00:00:39.930> not<00:00:40.140> compatible<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:41.840> IDE<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.980> is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
is not compatible with IDE and this is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
is not compatible with IDE and this is
going<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> quick<00:00:45.030> registry<00:00:45.809> editor<00:00:46.440> fix

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
