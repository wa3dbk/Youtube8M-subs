00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
got the different settings but what I do

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.229 
got the different settings but what I do
is<00:02:03.959> I've<00:02:04.319> already<00:02:04.590> programmed<00:02:05.039> it<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.819> then

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 
is I've already programmed it and then

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.559 
is I've already programmed it and then
you<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.539> use<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:08.069> custom<00:02:08.549> program<00:02:09.060> setting

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
you just use the custom program setting

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.400 
you just use the custom program setting
and<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.739> recalls<00:02:11.840> all<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.110> stuff<00:02:13.379> that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.949 
and then it recalls all the stuff that
you<00:02:13.799> program<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.790> then<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.269> just<00:02:15.480> go<00:02:15.660> in<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
you program and then you just go in and

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.220 
you program and then you just go in and
modify<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.190> like<00:02:17.430> say<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.730> want<00:02:18.060> let<00:02:19.019> you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
modify this so like say you want let you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.199 
modify this so like say you want let you
know<00:02:19.349> say<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.650> don't<00:02:19.890> want<00:02:20.220> an<00:02:20.430> out<00:02:20.579> or<00:02:20.610> in<00:02:20.910> 30

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
know say you don't want an out or in 30

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.319 
know say you don't want an out or in 30
minutes<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.609> adjust<00:02:23.880> the

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
minutes you just you can just adjust the

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.590 
minutes you just you can just adjust the
time<00:02:24.600> down<00:02:25.370> or<00:02:26.370> say<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.910> want<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
time down or say you want the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.620 
time down or say you want the
temperature<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.139> be<00:02:28.380> different<00:02:28.889> you<00:02:29.209> go<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.420> I

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
temperature to be different you go and I

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.420 
temperature to be different you go and I
don't<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:30.959> much<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.470> cameras<00:02:31.889> focusing<00:02:32.310> but

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
don't have much the cameras focusing but

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.809 
don't have much the cameras focusing but
you<00:02:32.549> can<00:02:32.970> change<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.450> temperature<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.819> then

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
you can change the temperature and then

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.120 
you can change the temperature and then
you<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.209> push<00:02:36.420> push<00:02:37.139> play<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.970> away<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.000> go

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
you just push push play and away you go

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.670 
you just push push play and away you go
so<00:02:41.130> it's<00:02:41.280> pretty<00:02:41.430> handy<00:02:41.849> and<00:02:42.090> it's<00:02:42.630> got<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> nice

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
big thing there's also a rack that fits

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.890 
big thing there's also a rack that fits
in<00:02:46.769> here<00:02:46.799> so<00:02:47.639> you<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:48.090> draw<00:02:48.299> your<00:02:48.540> tennis

shoes or whatever like on my timberlands

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.080 
shoes or whatever like on my timberlands
I<00:02:52.079> use<00:02:52.349> that<00:02:52.560> all<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.739> time<00:02:52.859> I<00:02:53.340> scrub<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
I use that all the time I scrub the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.930 
I use that all the time I scrub the
timberlands<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.230> sink<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.859> then<00:02:56.609> I<00:02:56.730> put

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
timberlands in the sink and then I put

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.240 
timberlands in the sink and then I put
the<00:02:57.060> rack<00:02:57.269> in<00:02:57.569> here<00:02:58.079> and<00:02:58.290> then<00:02:58.919> this<00:02:59.040> thing

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
the rack in here and then this thing

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.690 
the rack in here and then this thing
spins<00:02:59.639> but<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.030> shoe<00:03:00.239> sit<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.780> rack<00:03:01.019> and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
spins but the shoe sit on the rack and

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.550 
spins but the shoe sit on the rack and
get<00:03:02.700> clean<00:03:03.000> oh<00:03:03.209> my<00:03:03.450> God<00:03:03.599> look<00:03:03.810> at<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:03.989> dirty

get clean oh my God look at this dirty

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.949 
get clean oh my God look at this dirty
that's<00:03:04.950> Anita<00:03:05.250> doing<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.669> longer<00:03:05.880> because<00:03:06.780> I

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
that's Anita doing that longer because I

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.030 
that's Anita doing that longer because I
would<00:03:07.139> never<00:03:07.290> allow<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:07.590> thing<00:03:09.049> um<00:03:10.049> so

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
would never allow this thing um so

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.589 
would never allow this thing um so
that's<00:03:11.220> it

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.330 

and<00:03:16.719> then<00:03:17.260> as<00:03:17.409> you<00:03:17.560> can<00:03:17.709> see<00:03:17.950> there<00:03:18.189> in<00:03:18.310> the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
and then as you can see there in the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.239 
and then as you can see there in the
little<00:03:18.579> little<00:03:19.329> area<00:03:19.659> here<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.469> then<00:03:21.129> I

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:21.249 
little little area here and then I

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:25.709 
little little area here and then I
installed<00:03:22.060> some<00:03:22.499> these<00:03:23.499> things<00:03:23.799> here<00:03:24.719> which

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:25.719 
installed some these things here which

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:29.190 
installed some these things here which
are<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:25.989> water<00:03:27.299> valves<00:03:28.299> or<00:03:28.510> they're<00:03:28.989> like<00:03:29.170> a

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
are the water valves or they're like a

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.009 
are the water valves or they're like a
shock<00:03:29.709> absorber<00:03:29.909> so<00:03:30.909> when<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.510> water<00:03:31.689> turns

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
shock absorber so when the water turns

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.830 
shock absorber so when the water turns
on<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.439> off<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.859> it<00:03:33.189> combats<00:03:34.090> water<00:03:34.510> hammer

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
on and off and it combats water hammer

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.429 
on and off and it combats water hammer
because<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.129> jolt<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.959> these<00:03:37.959> washers

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
because of the jolt of the these washers

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.559 
because of the jolt of the these washers
actually<00:03:38.859> have<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.549> valve<00:03:39.879> that<00:03:39.969> goes<00:03:40.090> on<00:03:40.420> and

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
actually have a valve that goes on and

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.819 
actually have a valve that goes on and
off<00:03:40.689> real<00:03:40.930> fast<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:42.939> helps<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:44.500> helps<00:03:44.739> to

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
off real fast so it helps to it helps to

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.849 
off real fast so it helps to it helps to
offset<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.489> shock<00:03:45.909> to<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.329> plumbing<00:03:47.079> so<00:03:47.409> then

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
offset the shock to the plumbing so then

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.679 
offset the shock to the plumbing so then
I<00:03:47.950> have<00:03:48.129> these<00:03:48.310> little<00:03:48.459> valves<00:03:48.730> back<00:03:49.419> here

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
I have these little valves back here

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.599 
I have these little valves back here
adjusted<00:03:50.230> so<00:03:50.409> it<00:03:50.439> gives<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.919> the<00:03:51.430> right

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
adjusted so it gives the the right

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.390 
adjusted so it gives the the right
amount<00:03:51.879> of<00:03:51.939> pressure<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.480> everything<00:03:52.780> so

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
amount of pressure of everything so

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.659 
amount of pressure of everything so
anyways<00:03:54.400> that's<00:03:55.150> about<00:03:55.449> it<00:03:55.689> okay<00:03:56.349> well<00:03:56.829> hope

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
anyways that's about it okay well hope

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.300 
anyways that's about it okay well hope
