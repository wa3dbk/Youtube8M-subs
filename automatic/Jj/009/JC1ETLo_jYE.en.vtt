00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
 looking at pictures with this question we made here blog the following 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.539
 I would like to know what the relationship is 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.189
 of constantine 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.539
 with the bible now that it was constant boiling so this story that 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.129
 it gets more expensive stayed with the bible is quoted 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.500
 really had no relation to the bible of constantin 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.759
 type was the 'Roman emperor' 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:22.759
 toninho said 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.799
 he took some Christians from the apostolic church 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.220
 and formulated the church is not that emerged after the middle ages also 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.690
 Constantine Roman Emperor 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.480
 it potentiates the a320 after Christ's observance of Sunday 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.890
 every woman likes Sunday was already the last Sunday was already being 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.330
 observed by Christians in a betting and spiritual process of Joseph the 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.690
 saturday - together 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.900
 there will be no more than 100 thousand 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.170
 legalize the first Sunday rule in history 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.229
 on Tuesday 21 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.839
 it means that konstantin law that changed then the guard of the Sabbath to the 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.400
 Sunday he had an important role 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.670
 the change was gradual 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.580
 began with the Christians who went to them to celebrate the Sabbath and on Sunday 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.770
 celebrated a kind of omar 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.410
 melinda religious make a child snack work 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.100
 and then was still the was and comes from the betting period and in the church the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.350
 Sunday infiltrated into Christianity 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.000
 Saturday has been forgotten 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.470
 and then in the civil sphere 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.579
 321 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.099
 konstantinou played a very important role in establishing the 

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:29.460
 Sunday's keeper 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.229
 now konstantino tito has no relation to the bible 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.750
 by the following 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.040
 I will read a text here because there are people who believe that it was 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.590
 that the books of the New Testament 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.810
 was Konstantino 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.220
 whoever decided which books and a new testament belong to is absurd 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.620
 can not prove this historically 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.410
 I'm going to read a text 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.660
 that shows us 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.670
 that not long before Constantinople 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.720
 Christians already recognized the writings of the apostles as being inspired 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.630
 for God 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.240
 here is the question of time 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.909
 euller first pedro second pedro 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.699
 3 15 16 this text is very important 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.989
 I had always dreamed I still entered the city 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:21.279
 and has to bring salvation to the long life of our lord 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.759
 as also our beloved brother paulo rocha wrote 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.189
 according to the wisdom given to him 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.529
 when talking about these subjects as in fact they usually do in all their en 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:34.679
 stoles 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.899
 in which certain things difficult to understand 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.519
 that the ignorant unstable gate 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.150
 as well as a tour with the other scriptures for the expression itself 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.489
 their 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.189
 percy from here pedro is talking about paulo 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.039
 of the epistles of paulo and pedro calls the epistles of paulo as 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.049
 being part of the other scriptures 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.779
 so there was no constant being that the Christian church 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.159
 recognized 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.069
 the books of the new testament 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.469
 because in days the apostles as the apostles died tito 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:14.230
 only wrong happens today many apocryphal writings appear right after exchanges 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.900
 'hidden' and one with the author who wrote the author a calculation 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.919
 then to preserve apostolic inscripts 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.629
 Christians of the Christian 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.670
 these books that we have new wills 27 so constant and not 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.649
 had no part in the formation of b 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.279
 I played teacher 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.999
 So let's jump to something else, see, the question is like this.
