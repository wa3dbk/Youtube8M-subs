00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:08.230
 the moon and mars 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.889
 where the world 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.889
 but no 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.359
 is to take care of the decrease 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:32.099
 in which soccer player in the afternoons 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.350

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.280

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.969

 6 for you 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.100
 in the afternoon 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.050
 ah 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.600
 the dignity 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.600
 to see you with a little 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.520
 mom 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:27.350
 at a time when the Paraguayans 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.460
 we also have interesting things in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.950
 paraguay 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.560
 very clear that if Mariano I do not 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.810
 I want to start this song elegy to 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.350
 this song is truly a 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.350
 very personal question 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.829
 a very personal issue because of the fact 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.920
 that when you reach the river plate 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.909
 my first concentration in mendoza 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.130
 putting in the main team of 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.380
 river plate where there were figures where 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.969
 had figured the really wonderful 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.329
 this helped me a lot 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:59.020
 hernán díaz estrada sergio berti 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.020
 gallant 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.189
 where a Paraguayan made 17 years well 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.440
 entering the concentration of the river 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.290
 plate where ramón díaz presents me 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.540
 in front of the group and it says good 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.579
 boys from now on according to the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.170
 group to each time they are cave and it's going to be 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.640
 our our partner who should not 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.200
 be a hand 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.360
 then in the hotel lobby there was a 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.070
 pianist and a guitarist 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.230
 and I like my cover letter 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.750
 I wanted to stay behind and since I am a 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.020
 very little shy person in quotes 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.810
 he did not grab the guitar and execute a 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.820
 samba to all the establishment and the French is 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.950
 is really amazed by the fact 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.620
 that not everyone said that in their 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.730
 moment and more are 17 18 years old then 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.050
 those both of the road to all 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.200
 you and everything for Paraguay that is 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.200
 looking
