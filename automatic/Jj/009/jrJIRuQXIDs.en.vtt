but you know it's without having talked

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.970 
but you know it's without having talked
to<00:02:52.480> me<00:02:52.630> an<00:02:52.750> understanding<00:02:53.410> where<00:02:53.590> I've<00:02:53.769> been

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
to me an understanding where I've been

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.009 
to me an understanding where I've been
in<00:02:54.130> my<00:02:54.280> life<00:02:54.489> it's<00:02:54.730> hard<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.030> pass<00:02:55.420> judgment

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
in my life it's hard to pass judgment

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.990 
in my life it's hard to pass judgment
and<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:56.800> was<00:02:56.830> frustrating<00:02:57.489> because<00:02:57.610> people

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
and so it was frustrating because people

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.199 
and so it was frustrating because people
were<00:02:58.739> judging<00:02:59.739> me<00:03:00.069> for<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.340> personal<00:03:00.880> decision

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
were judging me for a personal decision

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.970 
were judging me for a personal decision
they<00:03:01.600> said<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:01.900> distracted<00:03:02.410> from<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.680> tea<00:03:02.799> and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
they said I distracted from the tea and

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.350 
they said I distracted from the tea and
it<00:03:03.069> didn't<00:03:03.370> distract<00:03:03.640> from<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.940> team<00:03:04.120> because

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
it didn't distract from the team because

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.059 
it didn't distract from the team because
most<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.630> those<00:03:04.720> guys<00:03:04.780> knew<00:03:05.170> already<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.799> I

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
most of those guys knew already and I

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.530 
most of those guys knew already and I
think<00:03:06.160> if<00:03:06.280> anything<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.760> encourages<00:03:07.330> them<00:03:07.510> to

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
think if anything it encourages them to

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.150 
think if anything it encourages them to
lets<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.110> know<00:03:08.200> fight<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.470> little<00:03:08.739> bit<00:03:08.830> harder
