00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello, I have called you today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.170
 I will show you how to make grenades in minecraft 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.530
 using block commands as we see y 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.250
 I have a pomegranate now we throw it in 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.089
 this resident 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.580
 for mind we have a blast all very 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.710
 cool explode quickly actively 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.380
 interesting but let's see how 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.410
 all this is done here i'm already a little 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.570
 had fun with grenades 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:33.000
 that's actually our little mechanism 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.000
 it is composed of such 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.340
 compact watches from comparator let's 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.350
 while we turn off 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.910
 so that it does not interfere with two teams of blocks 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.309
 so in pen to music we have a team 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:54.690
 the project itself sex and 10 blocks up with 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:57.000
 fusion 3 this criticism is literally a few 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.829
 milliseconds and through these few 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.180
 milliseconds it will explode with us 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.360
 this one, as it were wound-up unit 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.150
 dynamite they appear our very often 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.450
 as we see well because of the signal 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.710
 also very fast and next to moonduck 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.090
 we will use moving one 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.850
 entity in a different way here we move 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.409
 cocked dynamite radius in spots 15 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.869
 blocks that is just enough for us 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.439
 grab this dynamite which is above us 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.810
 and we import it to 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.820
 entity xp orb which we get from 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.640
 bottles with 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.670
 With a radius of 200 you can 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.100
 put u 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:51.700
 any radius and ximagin is necessary 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.759
 figure think not necessarily it 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.439
 explain but it must be different with us 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.439
 teleportation will not occur 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.530
 it works very weight to you as we see 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.630
 an hour does not work need to connect it and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.929
 you can blow everything up like this 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.110
 fun gram on it all with you was 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.560
 named subscribe put likes 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.560
 have a nice day
