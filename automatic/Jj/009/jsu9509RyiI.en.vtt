00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi friends today we are at the wedding here 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.520
 newlyweds but half an hour decided to come 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.130
 self order and so I tell you today 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.530
 I want to tell you why because a picture is not 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.650
 maybe you go one hundred why it costs more 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.120
 than taking a photo twice three times 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.260
 in fact, itâ€™s not easy for 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.210
 I want to show you how much 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.029
 equipment and take it with you so you 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.420
 you understand we are shooting from two cameras 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.880
 at least sometimes from three cameras therefore all 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.779
 long shot on two cameras 8 a 8 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.690
 tripod manfrotto with 501 head we carry 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.390
 I am not really a monopod 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.399
 I love monopod because you can 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.100
 only reportage artwork I pay us 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.809
 remove fundamentally here though many 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.789
 take off and many like this one 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.600
 picture and multiplied by the rolling shutter 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.449
 it makes me so unpleasant 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.420
 feeling then another tripod 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.460

 several hundred dollars and fruit even 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.879

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.100
 Krasnogorsk Austria on which stands 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.050

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.090
 handy thing we used to take off the rig 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.860

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.540

 label them charged discharged and this 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.750
 it is very important that the time of live shooting 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.930

 various batteries for remotes 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.870

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:43.820
 medication if someone suddenly becomes 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:47.810
 bad because shooting for us here 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.370
 and the top of most need that is 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.420
 need is a variable neutral filter 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:56.840
 density polarik for general plans on 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.610
 nature and memory cards but really 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.600
 this is not all memory card there already 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.370
 us yet 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:07.290
 memory cards are already our technology 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.600
 that's all 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.340
 the weight is all of this thing here 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.800

 here is a backpack ideally 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.470
 if you have two operators is well that 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.750
 just two people who shoot you 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.540
 still need a third big score which 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.950
 should wear this backpack like that 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.530

 mounting with many cameras 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.210
