00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
ago we did our market research and 9 out

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.770 
ago we did our market research and 9 out
of<00:02:09.250> 10<00:02:09.580> three-year-olds<00:02:10.300> really<00:02:10.629> like

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
of 10 three-year-olds really like

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.360 
of 10 three-year-olds really like
dollars<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.410> so<00:02:11.560> we<00:02:11.709> figured<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.040> was<00:02:12.249> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
best market price and they were willing

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.569 
best market price and they were willing
to<00:02:13.900> sell<00:02:14.109> at<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.439> not<00:02:14.829> to<00:02:15.010> mention<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
to sell at that not to mention the

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:16.910 
to sell at that not to mention the
