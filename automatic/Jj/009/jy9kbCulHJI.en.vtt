without<00:01:08.430> enzymes<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.299> then<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.080> to

on<00:02:12.180> an<00:02:12.420> organic<00:02:12.930> farm<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.410> are<00:02:13.650> minimally

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
on an organic farm that are minimally

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.280 
on an organic farm that are minimally
processed<00:02:14.340> then<00:02:15.300> we're<00:02:15.450> right<00:02:15.750> back<00:02:15.810> where<00:02:16.050> we

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
processed then we're right back where we

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.470 
processed then we're right back where we
came<00:02:16.590> from<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.190> certainly<00:02:17.970> we<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.300> take

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
came from and certainly we can take

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.120 
came from and certainly we can take
advantage<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.230> know<00:02:19.350> things<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:19.800> ovens

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
advantage of you know things like ovens

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.040 
advantage of you know things like ovens
and<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.990> know<00:02:22.110> low-level<00:02:23.010> food<00:02:23.250> processing

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
and you know low-level food processing

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.650 
and you know low-level food processing
knives<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.590> things<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.950> we've<00:02:26.070> developed

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
knives and things that we've developed

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.150 
knives and things that we've developed
technologically<00:02:27.660> refrigerators<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:29.040> when

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
technologically refrigerators but when

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.710 
technologically refrigerators but when
you<00:02:29.220> start<00:02:29.459> using<00:02:29.670> Clues<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.180> microwaves

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
you start using Clues like microwaves

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.320 
you start using Clues like microwaves
and<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.530> start<00:02:31.800> breaking<00:02:32.010> things<00:02:32.400> up<00:02:32.700> into

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
and you start breaking things up into

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.590 
and you start breaking things up into
such<00:02:34.260> small<00:02:34.880> chemical<00:02:35.880> elements<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.450> they

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
such small chemical elements that they

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.960 
such small chemical elements that they
lose<00:02:36.930> their<00:02:37.170> holistic<00:02:37.500> integrated<00:02:38.430> function

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
lose their holistic integrated function

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.150 
lose their holistic integrated function
it's<00:02:39.090> no<00:02:39.209> longer<00:02:39.450> food<00:02:39.870> now<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.290> becomes<00:02:40.620> shall

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
it's no longer food now it becomes shall

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.530 
it's no longer food now it becomes shall
we<00:02:41.280> say<00:02:42.020> chemicals<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.890> isolates<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
we say chemicals and isolates that the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.930 
we say chemicals and isolates that the
body<00:02:45.810> can't<00:02:46.230> use<00:02:46.320> effectively<00:02:47.100> happy<00:02:47.430> legs

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
body can't use effectively happy legs

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.560 
body can't use effectively happy legs
too<00:02:49.250> yeah<00:02:50.250> yeah<00:02:50.700> well<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.360> means

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
too yeah yeah well it just means

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.400 
too yeah yeah well it just means
breaking<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.560> know<00:02:53.180> everything<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.450> gives

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
breaking you know everything that gives

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.340 
breaking you know everything that gives
us<00:02:55.680> life<00:02:55.950> has<00:02:56.940> an<00:02:57.150> integrated<00:02:57.450> function<00:02:58.140> a

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
us life has an integrated function a

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.650 
us life has an integrated function a
cell<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.220> an<00:02:59.340> integrated<00:02:59.880> system<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.480> if<00:03:00.570> you

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
cell is an integrated system so if you

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.479 
cell is an integrated system so if you
eat<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> piece<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.260> chicken<00:03:01.530> or<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.280> eat<00:03:02.459> a

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
eat a piece of chicken or you eat a

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.979 
eat a piece of chicken or you eat a
carrot<00:03:02.790> you're<00:03:03.120> eating<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.450> collection<00:03:03.900> of

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
carrot you're eating a collection of

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.380 
carrot you're eating a collection of
cells<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:05.070> if<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.220> break<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.610> down<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.269> that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
cells but if you break that down so that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.360 
cells but if you break that down so that
you're<00:03:06.540> all<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.019> enzymes<00:03:07.530> are<00:03:07.709> broken<00:03:08.040> up<00:03:08.190> all

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you're all the enzymes are broken up all

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.490 
you're all the enzymes are broken up all
the<00:03:08.519> trace<00:03:08.760> minerals<00:03:09.239> are<00:03:09.330> broken<00:03:09.690> up<00:03:09.780> all<00:03:10.320> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the trace minerals are broken up all the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.920 
the trace minerals are broken up all the
fats<00:03:10.739> are<00:03:10.980> separated<00:03:11.820> out<00:03:11.970> all<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.450> proteins

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
fats are separated out all the proteins

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.750 
fats are separated out all the proteins
are<00:03:13.050> separated<00:03:13.500> out<00:03:13.590> now<00:03:13.860> you've<00:03:14.100> lost<00:03:14.370> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
are separated out now you've lost the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.820 
are separated out now you've lost the
shall<00:03:15.510> we<00:03:15.540> say<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.930> holistic<00:03:16.410> integrated

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
shall we say the holistic integrated

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.860 
shall we say the holistic integrated
function<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.970> you're<00:03:18.120> not<00:03:18.300> eating<00:03:18.540> something

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
function and you're not eating something

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.390 
function and you're not eating something
this<00:03:19.140> life-giving<00:03:19.380> anymore

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
this life-giving anymore

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.699 
this life-giving anymore
yeah<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.940> know<00:03:21.060> think<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.660> way<00:03:21.720> what

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
yeah you know think of it this way what

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.430 
yeah you know think of it this way what
part<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.160> watch<00:03:23.370> tells<00:03:23.760> time<00:03:25.310> question

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
part of a watch tells time question

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.740 
part of a watch tells time question
no<00:03:28.040> it's<00:03:28.280> not<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.490> dream<00:03:28.970> what<00:03:29.120> kind<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.570> what

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
no it's not a dream what kind of what

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.790 
no it's not a dream what kind of what
stuff<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:31.820> whole<00:03:32.030> thing<00:03:34.930> if<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.110> if<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:36.560> give

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
stuff the whole thing if you if I give

stuff the whole thing if you if I give
you<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.370> whole<00:03:37.880> bucket<00:03:38.300> of<00:03:38.360> sweet<00:03:38.720> pans<00:03:38.990> yeah

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
you a whole bucket of sweet pans yeah

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.990 
you a whole bucket of sweet pans yeah
does<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.010> help<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.310> tell<00:03:40.520> time

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
does it help you tell time

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.670 
does it help you tell time
sweet<00:03:41.410> sweet<00:03:42.410> pans<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:43.750> minute<00:03:44.750> sweep<00:03:45.200> and

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
sweet sweet pans the minute sweep and

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.320 
sweet sweet pans the minute sweep and
deny<00:03:46.070> right<00:03:46.250> now<00:03:46.490> that<00:03:46.640> doesn't<00:03:46.850> like<00:03:47.090> if<00:03:47.240> I

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
deny right now that doesn't like if I

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.970 
deny right now that doesn't like if I
give<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:47.600> our<00:03:47.780> hands<00:03:48.200> does<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.560> help<00:03:48.710> you<00:03:48.800> tell

give you our hands does it help you tell

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.330 
give you our hands does it help you tell
to<00:03:49.130> them<00:03:49.280> not<00:03:49.610> so<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.210> need<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.570> whole<00:03:50.750> watch

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
to them not so you need the whole watch

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.340 
to them not so you need the whole watch
but<00:03:52.340> when<00:03:52.490> you're<00:03:52.640> eating<00:03:52.940> food<00:03:53.210> if<00:03:53.960> you<00:03:54.110> break

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
but when you're eating food if you break

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.780 
but when you're eating food if you break
it<00:03:54.380> up<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:54.950> point<00:03:55.100> it<00:03:55.340> doesn't<00:03:55.520> work

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
it up to the point it doesn't work

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.980 
it up to the point it doesn't work
functionally<00:03:56.330> anymore

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
functionally anymore

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.450 
functionally anymore
it's<00:03:57.140> like<00:03:57.350> eating<00:03:57.560> pieces<00:03:58.070> of<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.280> watch

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
it's like eating pieces of a watch

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.220 
it's like eating pieces of a watch
you'll<00:03:58.760> never<00:03:58.940> tell<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.270> something<00:03:59.510> better<00:03:59.750> so

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
you'll never tell it something better so

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.970 
you'll never tell it something better so
that's<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.560> can<00:04:00.770> set<00:04:00.980> up<00:04:01.070> drinking<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.700> juice

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
that's I can set up drinking the juice

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.830 
that's I can set up drinking the juice
well<00:04:03.980> if<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.280> get<00:04:04.430> all<00:04:04.550> that<00:04:04.730> is<00:04:05.420> one<00:04:05.660> thing

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
well if you get all that is one thing

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.930 
well if you get all that is one thing
now<00:04:06.320> drinking<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.040> juice<00:04:07.310> it's<00:04:07.610> fresh

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
now drinking the juice it's fresh

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.120 
now drinking the juice it's fresh
squeezed<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:08.870> it's<00:04:09.110> used<00:04:09.290> with<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.530> slow<00:04:09.800> speed
