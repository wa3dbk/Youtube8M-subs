00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.850
 hi girls a few weeks ago 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.740
 I will show you my favorites for 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.510
 the operation neither who nor when you knew 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.309
 your poems and today I you 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.110
 showed some other favorites for 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.719
 summer too but it's roissy makeup 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.609
 they were born the skin so the first 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.660
 things for makeup this is the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.520
 terracotta of guerlain 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.070
 I love to read I thought tulle 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.960
 and every summer because I do not like 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.810
 take the sun because it's so hard on the skin 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.730
 and down like that I can achieve an effect 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.219
 tanned meaning before flight be of course 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.160
 I always put on cheekbones 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.500
 done here on the nose in its parts 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.059
 muller nose and rendering is really 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.800
 very natural and beautiful I like a lot 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.550
 and actually have like I'm not 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.469
 tan I can use the same fallen 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.559
 in all the summer so these novels 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.090
 of my flagship products for the summer then 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.860
 another product that I'm trying 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.270
 to use a lot right now that I 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.960
 think I will use all summer 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.609
 it's sure jo's foal lipstick 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 I love it is once colors 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.680
 transparent practically but not 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.310
 really so bright with a slight 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.290
 pink touch really very beautiful is 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.810
 it's the color of the future to wake up 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.250
 the times of the lips but not enough for 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.530
 advise to be aware 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.930
 suddenly it's really hard at the cottage 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.509
 so it's great and what I like 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.130
 well also product products 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.170
 paul and joe in general but crowded 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.750
 it makes sense because cdc music I 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.850
 speaking now is that in fact we 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.920
 ax and one side of the recharge of 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.490
 the other the case which is great for 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.619
 choose the lettuce you prefer and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.259
 we can have one and the two the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.390
 collection that has all the time that is 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.149
 white but also an edition that he 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.860
 was going out for the season and not like that 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.640
 at the same time we embellish and the kit 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.680
 make-up 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.860
 so to finish with the thousand cases I 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.659
 also showed polish that I am 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.220
 really a victor nor I have it all 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.700
 time there it's true that I only have 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.189
 a bit of a prince prince color but 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.220
 I am practically every day in 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.409
 changing my color then the 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.390
 first I already wanted to shown on 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.800
 instagram it's this red of the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.190
 Hex 1d collection 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.830
 meymac and six lots a very intense red 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.540
 very beautiful I really like them very much 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.220
 because in addition to red it goes with 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.440
 everything so if for example I know that a 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.000
 day I do not know if the next day I 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.450
 could change the color down I put 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.760
 a red 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.800
 and like that I'm sure it's okay 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.330
 go with everything is then for both 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.540
 others to varnish both belongs to 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.910
 the collection brazil opium and insi 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.560
 in pink and the other also a coral is 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.560
 still the colors that are not going to be 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.840
 all who are really very beautiful and 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.700
 what do you do it wakes up the hands and 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.440
 feet and without top for 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.090
 classic and then for the sonnet the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.630
 skin I showed you products the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.110
 first is this mist of gingham that 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.880
 has a solar factor 50 and I love it 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.410
 because I put all the time too 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.330
 well on the face than on the bodies 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.540
 factor 50 because I fight the 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.580
 sun but despite that when I'm at the 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.310
 beach or pool a golden day 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.130
 I know I'm going to have the floor and on 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.100
 I always put 50 because 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.070
 here I am I I protect myself from the sun 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.989
 is more than I can ski I love this 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.790
 product actually also apart from the fact 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.380
 that they sit without counting is that 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.290
 it's a haze it's really very 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.430
 light is not like other products 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.470
 for example in cream which is a lot 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.260
 thicker and it bothers a little when 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.880
 even that's very very light we 're not going 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.700
 would just have a little bit on the pump at the 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.300
 hand and sailly Serbian would be so it's 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.610
 impossible 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.790
 and to finish my last favors this 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.250
 profit oil from the martin line 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.970
 and again it's a product with 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.160
 a very light section a year because 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.600
 it's true it's over but that's what 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.120
 is very surprising is that it is a 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.460
 dry oil and saves it on the 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.450
 skin and the virtually absorbed to 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.600
 at the moment and I love it because 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.700
 I was idrac the mud but without having 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.860
 there again the thick feeling 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.020
 on the skin that I do not like and in addition 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.100
 they are very very good I think 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.440
 it can not feel come 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.380
 so I think before I'm done 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.180
 the summer I will have finished the bottle and 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.710
 here are my favorites for the summer I hope 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.280
 that you will know and we see each other 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:27.200
 next week I'm waiting for you on 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.330
