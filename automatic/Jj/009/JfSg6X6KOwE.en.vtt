00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.780
 hello in the round and heartily 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.580
 welcome to the baskets tv thek news 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.230
 action camps are now available 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.090
 Whole lot on the market if you have one 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.470
 to take reasonably reasonable model 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.270
 can you make it nice shots 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.630
 over water and of course under 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.939
 water 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.039
 now there is this variant of here 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.720
 it's probably from this one 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.859
 camera is mainly for this 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.859
 field of application 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.649
 so that can be against the bait 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.359
 make really spectacular shots 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.019
 and how the whole works is to 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.019
 look at us now 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.260
 Visually, the camera reminds one 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.980
 pistol ball pcs 12 cm long and weighs 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.680
 66 here on the bottom you see one 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.420
 small rail with this rail with 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.860
 This leadership has the following in mind 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.210
 you get to the camera still such a sch 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.340
 only tubes delivered here that it 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.720
 nothing but a small bar there 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.130
 do you have there on the one side an eyelet 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.970
 Can you ever turn your capital on 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.370
 fix 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.350
 then you take the camera puts this 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.780
 Chopsticks here in the sledges and have 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.570
 then the possibility to the whole 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.700
 fix is ​​very fast and holds 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.890
 bombproof that's it 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.390
 At the other end you also have one 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.920
 eyelet because you can offer your times before 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.320
 By the way, it should be like that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.000
 between 40 and 70 centimeters long 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.500
 Here you can see a small weight 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 that it is also inserted which is 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.290
 Supplied in three different 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.390
 weight classes so you can the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.220
 Balance camera and that's it 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390
 principle so easy and fast 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.400
 the whole thing is done 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.540
 and if you wonder why dangles 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.340
 actually the whole time such a piece 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.630
 cord on the camera around that too 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.850
 I quickly explained that 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.380
 killed so I cover the camera well 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.119
 on busy it did not work namely times 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.619
 so simple it should also not 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.149
 after all, the camera should be tight 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.280
 sealed it is here thus two 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.899
 Rubber ring and if you look in 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.280
 Throw the camera because we see the whole thing 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.260
 is not witchcraft so there you can 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.940
 Definitely not wrong there 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
 There are no possibilities anyway 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.600
 to adjust something 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.860
 you have only one here and 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.260
 switch then there is one 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.200
 SD card slot suitable for micro SD cards 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.090
 two to 32gb and you have the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.250
 possibility of course here the camera 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.900
 charging the battery in the otto wulff 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.610
 is firmly installed he could not 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.900
 Change keeps according to manufacturer four 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.550
 hours that is already quite 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.420
 orderly 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.580
 Nevertheless, I have one more 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.660
 External battery may be similar 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.970
 hurt if you are out and about a lot 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.500
 It could not just be the water 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.030
 charge wulff but of course 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.650
 your smartphone a very practical 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.720
 history but four hours 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.160
 battery life if it is then then 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.160
 we should not have fully maxed out 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.450
 Of course, it's also very neat 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.190
 if you put the camera lid on the back 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.720
 then it also records audio too 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.720
 not very good as you can hear 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.130
 That's the big problem with almost everyone 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.480
 Action camps are usually 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.640
 yes not made it is ok 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.910
 mostly around the pictures and like you 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.860
 see with hungry 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.230
 she does not have her problems that too 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.140
 is a problem of many cameras of course 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.950
 even under water the clearer the water 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.690
 of course the better if he 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.030
 you have a lot of suspended matter if you 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.550
 it will be relatively far down then 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.950
 image accordingly, but more often 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.020
 in clear water works completely 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.200
 excellent and thus back very close 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.200
 his 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.270
 with its 66 grams, the camera can be 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.730
 Although posing and thus at play 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.700
 between bets is really optimal 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.740
 However, this variant is not better 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.900
 it's running while the camera is hauling 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.940
 up to 100 meters waterproof and films in the 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.350
 small hd format 1280 x 720 and 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.330
 Of course, there are also single-seaters 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.880
 or pose anglers on their 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.370
 cost everything you need for it 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.230
 and he gets so supplied 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.000
 a neoprene sleeve here with velcro straps 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.770
 so you can fix the camera 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.940
 either a route for example or 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.860
 somewhere on the boat 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.630
 There are also various tools 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.430
 which are compatible with the gopro's 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.350
 means you can diligently and vary 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.750
 So combining is really one 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.580
 practical history of the robot wulff 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.620
 takes spectacular shots 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.910
 In any case, it takes a bit of luck 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.740
 also have borders in the net 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.740
 found for around 150 euros
