00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
ball at the ball is is is very different

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.629

from<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.379> regular<00:02:58.439> ball<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.099> we<00:02:59.189> found<00:02:59.370> us<00:02:59.519> when

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
from a regular ball but we found us when

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.159 
from a regular ball but we found us when
you<00:02:59.730> play<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.540> street<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:00.989> other

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
you play in the street and other

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.960 
you play in the street and other
countries<00:03:01.439> that<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.040> regular<00:03:02.519> soccer<00:03:02.760> ball

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
countries that a regular soccer ball

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.399 
countries that a regular soccer ball
just<00:03:03.180> gets<00:03:03.359> beat<00:03:03.599> up<00:03:03.629> way<00:03:04.109> too<00:03:04.169> much<00:03:04.290> and

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
just gets beat up way too much and

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.750 
just gets beat up way too much and
they're<00:03:04.620> too<00:03:04.739> bouncy<00:03:05.099> they're<00:03:05.280> all<00:03:05.400> over<00:03:05.579> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
they're too bouncy they're all over the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.490 
they're too bouncy they're all over the
place<00:03:05.790> mats<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.419> the<00:03:06.450> street<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:06.930> we<00:03:06.959> took<00:03:07.260> this

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
place mats in the street so we took this

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.170 
place mats in the street so we took this
ball<00:03:07.769> went<00:03:08.280> through<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.459> bunch<00:03:08.609> of<00:03:08.700> prototypes

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
ball went through a bunch of prototypes

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.929 
ball went through a bunch of prototypes
and<00:03:09.419> basically<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.530> outer<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.069> soft<00:03:11.519> rubber

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
and basically the outer is a soft rubber

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.839 
and basically the outer is a soft rubber
so<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:12.689> can<00:03:12.840> take<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.019> beating<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.439> any<00:03:14.159> surface

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
so it can take a beating on any surface

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.429 
so it can take a beating on any surface
you<00:03:15.060> know<00:03:15.209> pavement<00:03:15.689> asphalt<00:03:16.200> concrete

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
you know pavement asphalt concrete

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.920 
you know pavement asphalt concrete
whatever<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.340> also<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:18.180> bladder<00:03:18.479> that<00:03:18.720> holds

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
whatever and also the bladder that holds

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.750 
whatever and also the bladder that holds
the<00:03:18.989> air<00:03:19.139> in<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.349> ball<00:03:19.620> we've<00:03:20.220> put<00:03:20.729> a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
the air in the ball we've put a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.189 
the air in the ball we've put a
substance<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.269> there<00:03:21.419> to<00:03:21.510> kind<00:03:21.629> of<00:03:21.720> help<00:03:21.780> take

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
substance in there to kind of help take

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.689 
substance in there to kind of help take
the<00:03:22.229> bounce<00:03:22.650> out<00:03:22.919> of<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.099> ball<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.489> ball

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
the bounce out of the ball so the ball

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:25.670 
the bounce out of the ball so the ball
will<00:03:23.909> stay<00:03:24.090> on<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.299> ground<00:03:24.479> better<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.560> when

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
will stay on the ground better so when

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.309 
will stay on the ground better so when
you're<00:03:25.799> out<00:03:25.859> on<00:03:25.889> a<00:03:26.220> bouncy<00:03:26.609> surface<00:03:26.970> such<00:03:27.120> as<00:03:27.150> a

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
you're out on a bouncy surface such as a

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.719 
you're out on a bouncy surface such as a
parking<00:03:28.319> lot<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.620> ball<00:03:28.859> won't<00:03:29.129> be<00:03:29.310> bouncing

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
parking lot the ball won't be bouncing

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.930 
parking lot the ball won't be bouncing
yeah<00:03:30.359> a<00:03:31.199> nine-time<00:03:31.560> chasing<00:03:32.190> exactly<00:03:32.849> exactly

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
yeah a nine-time chasing exactly exactly

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.990 
yeah a nine-time chasing exactly exactly
so<00:03:33.449> really<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:33.959> allows<00:03:34.530> players<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.979> to<00:03:35.549> use

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
so really it allows players to to use

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.539 
so really it allows players to to use
the<00:03:36.150> ball<00:03:36.299> on<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.629> surface<00:03:37.049> but<00:03:37.199> to<00:03:38.129> use<00:03:38.430> this

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
the ball on the surface but to use this

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.860 
the ball on the surface but to use this
ball<00:03:38.790> over<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.239> over<00:03:39.359> without<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.810> getting

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
ball over and over without it getting

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.839 
ball over and over without it getting
beat<00:03:40.199> up<00:03:40.229> all<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.530> time<00:03:40.739> now<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.579> guys<00:03:41.790> have
