00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.400
 again with 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.200
 I have had many comments with monitos 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.540
 of all 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.789
 there are also friends who already presented me 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.129
 his clothes made and that motivates me 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.230
 make more videos for you want 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.330
 say that they are understanding you because 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.060
 they are getting very nice 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.500
 I'm very pleased with the clothes and I'll continue 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.820
 working with 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.460
 Welcome to all who see for 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.160
 first time these 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.329
 and I want to tell you something, not nothing 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.870
 more you have to know how to knit 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.550
 teach nothing more 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.770
 but we also have to teach 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.960
 our secrets there are many accessories 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.660
 what can we do to decorate our 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.170
 clothes well in this case I want them 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.420
 teach how to make this button see just 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.969
 finish this vest 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.300
 but I wanted to put this button woven 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.880
 To decorate my garment this other has not 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.430
 very successful because you can 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.730
 in many sides to decorate then 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.540
 I will teach you how to do 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.300
 they like 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.460
 so look at friends this is the button that 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.280
 I want to teach them how to do they will see 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.590
 what a father and how nice is this is a 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.750
 but I'm going to teach you with the 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.530
 same button do it in various ways 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.020
 I look for this sack to occupy this thread and 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.510
 this thread will then choose 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.670
 any of the two that you like for 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.070
 make your vote me in this case 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.080
 I chose gray because it is leading to 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.290
 the shore this seems to me to be more 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.280
 nice that stands out more we are going to put 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.130
 a strand of middle yarn and we're going to 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.940
 work with a hook of number 5 and 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.930
 medium or 6 if we're going to start 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:53.020
 remember let's welcome one we're going to 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.440
 turn around and we started doing our 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.160
 chains we are going to make 4 chains 2 3 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.950
 and 4 chains closed when we close 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.560
 our wheel is very important to weave 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.979
 the tail in this way because there are people 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.500
 that leaves it loose and then its its 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.530
 This ring is left open then 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.660
 always remember that they serve your ring 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.670
 they should always weave the tail 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.450
 then now let's start knitting 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.510
 half points inside this ring 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.750
 we're not going to tell you anything we're going to 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.750
 go weaving 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:36.750
 111 to those who fit us 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.819
 it does not matter the number like that without squeezing or 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.340
 nothing but not without leaving much 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.140
 space 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.730
 let's weave one more 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.860
 when we finish our round there 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.490
 we are going to close if we are not going to continue 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:56.950
 weaving but above this 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.950
 above this in this way 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.360
 so and so we 're going to keep coming back and 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.670
 back and forth to the size that 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.890
 let's want it like this is thick yarn 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.840
 then we will have a big button 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.690
 but if you want to run around 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.170
 example a very delicate garment like a 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.840
 Chambita or shoes 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.150
 do it with thinner yarn and with 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.220
 your thinnest hook then you will 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.440
 be the small button 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.020
 we're going to keep going like this 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.620
 a lot of people think that I put some 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.710
 filling in the middle but not just that 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.530
 pure tissue and so we go back 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.650
 turn back turn up the size that 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.450
 we want and when we have 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.450
 the size I'm going to go for a spin 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.880
 and I to this to this button I gave a 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.950
 a little more 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.800
 then you can do the 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.210
 size I want let's go we're going to close 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.670
 here 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.070
 so that I can teach you about the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.680
 different ways you can use your 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.140
 vote more or less calculating that it ends 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:17.000
 in the return they will join with a slipped 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.790
 and then your button can occupy it like this 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.830
 to decorate your garment or you can 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.420
 occupy like this or can occupy it so 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.120
 They can take either a needle 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.360
 can not take all the small bank and 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.390
 close it and they also fit so that in 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.520
 this case I did this this is how it is born 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.650
 bigger because I got bigger and 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.780
 just stick it with this same liter 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.750
 that they sew with their cinnamon needle here 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.120
 well cooked well they stick with this same 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.790
 liter they cut it long and they stick it to its 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.340
 Garment can put several buttons on 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.430
 the garments inclusive also when 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.980
 we weave a flower we can make a button 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.290
 of these to put it in the center of 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.020
 our flower and it will be beautiful 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.630
 If your flower, for example, is pink or red, 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.740
 center they can do it in another tone and 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.880
 they will see how beautiful they are 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.880
 They liked it 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.110
 our 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.409
 what do you think? 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.889
 they are there by address 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:25.639
 different now can not elaborate a 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:28.610
 Earrings or decorate your girl's dancer 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.590
 or your outfit today can be used for 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.710
 amount of things to decorate my 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.960
 shoes your bags for many things 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.100
 they can make several different for 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.640
 simulate 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.640
 this 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:46.119
 madrid- of grapes or yes I hope 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.280
 I liked an idea and I want you to follow 

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:49.920
 watching my videos 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.740
 I want to tell you that I have many 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.050
 students that I taught them to knit for 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.270
 sell look now the situation is very 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.400
 difficult there are people who can not leave 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.340
 your house to work or you do not have the 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.130
 preparation or do not have the means to 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.139
 do it then I teach these people 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.330
 to knit to sell all my garments 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.210
 They are very simple and very easy to 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.300
 elaborate if you weave a capital 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.090
 like those that 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.340
 I teach them in the past video the can 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.979
 sell and you can earn good money 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.509
 do it, my friends, many people tell me that 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.629
 sometimes he can not because he takes care of his 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:27.310
 children take care of their sick mom or her 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:29.560
 they will also be unable to leave 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.490
 then do your clothes leave the 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:36.710
 windows now it is very difficult to sell a 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.990
 very elaborate garment because they do not pay us 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.660
 but these clothes that are very simple 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.930
 and they can easily sell them fast and they 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.480
 they can earn in the afternoon about 150 200 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.970
 because nobody pesos wrong then we fall 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.210
 is a piece of advice that I give you and I want you 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.150
 take it into account this week we're going 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.570
 to see with pretty people what 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.490

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.580
