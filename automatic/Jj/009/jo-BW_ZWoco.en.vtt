00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.010 

alright<00:00:06.010> here<00:00:06.310> we<00:00:06.340> have<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:07.600> lattice

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.020 
alright here we have the lattice

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.740 
alright here we have the lattice
soundboard<00:00:09.059> after<00:00:10.059> the<00:00:10.510> lattice<00:00:11.230> has<00:00:11.590> been

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
soundboard after the lattice has been

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.580 
soundboard after the lattice has been
initially<00:00:13.750> glued<00:00:14.230> on<00:00:14.980> to<00:00:15.580> the<00:00:15.610> soundboard

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
initially glued on to the soundboard

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.429 
initially glued on to the soundboard
with<00:00:17.590> the<00:00:17.740> vacuum<00:00:18.190> clamp<00:00:18.660> as<00:00:19.660> you<00:00:19.929> can<00:00:20.170> see

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
with the vacuum clamp as you can see

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.779 
with the vacuum clamp as you can see
quite<00:00:20.920> a<00:00:20.980> bit<00:00:21.310> of<00:00:21.429> it<00:00:21.580> has<00:00:21.789> been<00:00:22.320> removed

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
quite a bit of it has been removed

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.109 
quite a bit of it has been removed
sanded<00:00:24.789> down<00:00:24.820> to<00:00:25.150> nothing<00:00:25.599> here<00:00:25.839> at<00:00:25.929> the<00:00:26.080> edges

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
sanded down to nothing here at the edges

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.390 
sanded down to nothing here at the edges
it's<00:00:28.119> high<00:00:28.419> here<00:00:28.839> in<00:00:28.929> the<00:00:28.960> middle<00:00:29.380> but<00:00:30.070> then<00:00:30.249> it

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
it's high here in the middle but then it

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.810 
it's high here in the middle but then it
tapers<00:00:30.609> down<00:00:30.880> to<00:00:31.749> nothing<00:00:32.259> here<00:00:32.680> and<00:00:33.550> for

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
tapers down to nothing here and for

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.660 
tapers down to nothing here and for
comparison<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:36.550> is<00:00:36.699> the<00:00:38.460> lattice<00:00:39.629> before

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
comparison here is the lattice before

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.369 
comparison here is the lattice before
game<00:00:42.670> carbon<00:00:43.239> fibers<00:00:43.660> put<00:00:43.899> on<00:00:44.050> underneath

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
game carbon fibers put on underneath

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.170 
game carbon fibers put on underneath
here<00:00:45.270> epoxy<00:00:46.270> it<00:00:46.329> onto<00:00:46.690> there<00:00:46.870> and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.850> like<00:00:49.000> I

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
here epoxy it onto there and then like I

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.099 
here epoxy it onto there and then like I
said<00:00:49.420> in<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.600> last<00:00:49.780> video<00:00:50.079> about<00:00:50.579> 50%<00:00:51.579> of<00:00:51.640> the

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
said in the last video about 50% of the

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.950 
said in the last video about 50% of the
lattice<00:00:53.109> is<00:00:53.289> removed<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:55.570> I'm<00:00:55.660> about

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
lattice is removed and now I'm about

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.069 
lattice is removed and now I'm about
ready<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.289> put<00:00:56.590> some<00:00:56.620> carbon<00:00:57.250> fiber<00:00:57.280> on<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
ready to put some carbon fiber on the

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.720 
ready to put some carbon fiber on the
top<00:00:59.350> here<00:00:59.739> we're<00:00:59.980> gonna<00:01:00.070> cap<00:01:00.429> that<00:01:00.820> and<00:01:02.730> show

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
top here we're gonna cap that and show

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.020 
top here we're gonna cap that and show
that<00:01:03.760> in<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.180> next<00:01:04.210> video<00:01:04.650> okay<00:01:05.650> so<00:01:06.030> that's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
that in the next video okay so that's

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.150 
that in the next video okay so that's
the<00:01:08.010> lattice<00:01:10.440> they've<00:01:11.440> gone<00:01:11.650> to<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:11.980> next

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
the lattice they've gone to the next

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.350 
the lattice they've gone to the next
stage<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:13.570> if<00:01:13.630> we<00:01:13.720> can<00:01:13.840> get<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.940> side<00:01:15.940> view<00:01:16.330> here

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
stage see if we can get a side view here

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.060 
stage see if we can get a side view here
so<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:16.870> can<00:01:17.020> kind<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.260> see<00:01:17.530> how<00:01:17.740> that<00:01:20.070> what

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
so you can kind of see how that what

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:32.800 
so you can kind of see how that what
that<00:01:21.100> looks<00:01:21.580> like<00:01:21.700> here

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.230 

you<00:01:33.649> see<00:01:33.890> how<00:01:33.950> flexible<00:01:34.220> these<00:01:34.670> edges<00:01:35.090> are

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
you see how flexible these edges are

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.260 
you see how flexible these edges are
here<00:01:35.770> can<00:01:36.770> move<00:01:36.979> quite<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.340> bit<00:01:39.850> very<00:01:40.850> thin

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
here can move quite a bit very thin

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.710 
here can move quite a bit very thin
soundboard<00:01:42.159> okay<00:01:43.159> about<00:01:43.520> 40<00:01:44.000> thousands<00:01:44.539> right

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
soundboard okay about 40 thousands right

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.590 
soundboard okay about 40 thousands right
now<00:01:44.930> that's<00:01:45.170> right<00:01:45.350> around<00:01:45.649> one<00:01:45.920> millimeter

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
now that's right around one millimeter

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.859 
now that's right around one millimeter
okay

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
okay

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.260 
okay
very<00:01:48.439> loose<00:01:48.799> edges<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.490> middle<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.240> very

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
very loose edges the middle is very

00:01:50.270 --> 00:02:08.790 
very loose edges the middle is very
stiff<00:01:59.020> side<00:02:00.020> view<00:02:00.439> here

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.890 

all<00:02:09.310> right<00:02:09.490> that's<00:02:09.790> it<00:02:09.970> we'll<00:02:10.150> see<00:02:10.360> in<00:02:10.450> next

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
all right that's it we'll see in next

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.230 
all right that's it we'll see in next
video
