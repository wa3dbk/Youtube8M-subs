to really challenge I guess they always
are<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:56.230> know<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.470> main<00:01:56.620> thing<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:56.890> audio

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
are you know the main thing that audio

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.610 
are you know the main thing that audio
is<00:01:57.580> really<00:01:57.850> all<00:01:58.060> goes<00:01:58.240> back<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.510> things<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:59.560> if

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
is really all goes back to things so if

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.040 
is really all goes back to things so if
you<00:01:59.770> have<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.070> have<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.850> ability<00:02:01.300> to<00:02:01.510> put<00:02:02.020> a

using<00:03:11.610> wireless<00:03:12.610> microphones<00:03:13.090> versus<00:03:13.510> the

using wireless microphones versus the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.330 
using wireless microphones versus the
wired<00:03:13.840> mics<00:03:14.320> in<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.620> room<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.160> everything

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
wired mics in the room and everything

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.430 
wired mics in the room and everything
and<00:03:15.610> security<00:03:16.180> always<00:03:16.810> seems<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.049> be<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.290> is

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
and security always seems to be that is

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.240 
and security always seems to be that is
everybody<00:03:18.340> has<00:03:18.820> had<00:03:19.350> even<00:03:20.350> on<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.500> standard

down next to it right also did you get

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.710 
down next to it right also did you get
all<00:03:27.280> kinds<00:03:27.459> of<00:03:27.610> interference<00:03:28.180> particularly

that you're going to play back later

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.600 
that you're going to play back later
it's<00:03:31.780> always<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.019> big<00:03:32.230> issue<00:03:32.380> all<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.519> our

it's always a big issue all of our

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.780 
it's always a big issue all of our
microphones<00:03:34.090> actually<00:03:34.510> feature<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:35.760> have<00:03:36.760> a

feature called are a farmer that means i

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.650 
feature called are a farmer that means i
can<00:03:39.280> take<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.459> microphone<00:03:39.940> away<00:03:40.120> some<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:40.510> place

tiktik going back to the microphone okay

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.809 
tiktik going back to the microphone okay
now<00:03:47.470> whenever<00:03:47.860> you're<00:03:48.010> talking<00:03:48.280> security<00:03:48.730> as

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
now whenever you're talking security as

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.910 
now whenever you're talking security as
well<00:03:48.870> every<00:03:49.870> microphone<00:03:50.349> that<00:03:50.530> we<00:03:50.680> have

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
well every microphone that we have

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.720 
well every microphone that we have
actually<00:03:51.790> has<00:03:52.030> 128<00:03:52.810> bit<00:03:53.019> aes<00:03:53.290> encryption<00:03:53.730> okay

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
actually has 128 bit aes encryption okay

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.430 
actually has 128 bit aes encryption okay
what<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.360> means<00:03:55.599> to<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:56.110> that's

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
what that means to you is that that's

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.830 
what that means to you is that that's
the<00:03:56.560> same<00:03:56.739> encryption<00:03:56.950> key<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.690> while<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.720> was

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
the same encryption key that while I was

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.559 
the same encryption key that while I was
ok<00:03:59.500> but<00:04:00.129> every<00:04:00.549> mike<00:04:00.760> has<00:04:01.030> that<00:04:01.269> has<00:04:01.540> that

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
ok but every mike has that has that

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.930 
ok but every mike has that has that
encryption<00:04:02.170> method<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:02.920> whenever<00:04:03.790> you're

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
encryption method so whenever you're

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.250 
encryption method so whenever you're
dealing<00:04:04.090> with<00:04:04.209> that<00:04:04.420> you<00:04:04.690> have<00:04:04.810> eight<00:04:05.019> Mike's

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
dealing with that you have eight Mike's

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.149 
dealing with that you have eight Mike's
16<00:04:06.040> mics<00:04:06.250> in<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.489> building<00:04:06.849> every<00:04:07.659> mike<00:04:07.840> has

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
16 mics in the building every mike has

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.289 
16 mics in the building every mike has
so<00:04:09.159> they<00:04:09.340> won't<00:04:09.519> interfere<00:04:09.760> with<00:04:09.909> each<00:04:10.060> other

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
so they won't interfere with each other

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.080 
so they won't interfere with each other
nope<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.560> obviously<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:12.069> guess<00:04:12.280> can<00:04:12.760> apply<00:04:13.030> in

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
nope and obviously I guess can apply in

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.550 
nope and obviously I guess can apply in
there<00:04:13.329> what's<00:04:13.599> happening<00:04:13.959> in<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.110> boardroom
