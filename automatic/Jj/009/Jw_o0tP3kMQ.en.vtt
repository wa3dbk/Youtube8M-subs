crystals oh there's the wave pool down a

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.800 
crystals oh there's the wave pool down a
Monte<00:02:46.520> Carlo<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:47.530> mean<00:02:48.530> see<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:49.630> centered<00:02:50.630> there

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
Monte Carlo I mean see it centered there

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.290 
Monte Carlo I mean see it centered there
are<00:02:51.770> people<00:02:52.070> down<00:02:52.190> there<00:02:52.400> that's<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.730> wave<00:02:52.910> pool
