this spot on the warp nacelle is the one

strike and I do the series fortuitously
that's<00:01:02.430> where<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.730> struck<00:01:03.290> because<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.590> had

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that's where it struck because it had

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.290 
that's where it struck because it had
been<00:01:04.830> long<00:01:05.040> time<00:01:05.250> since<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.580> seen<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.910> episode

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
been long time since I seen the episode

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:14.300 
been long time since I seen the episode
and<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.960> built<00:01:07.140> before<00:01:07.350> video<00:01:07.770> tape

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.070 

this<00:01:14.880> was<00:01:15.030> done<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.240> those<00:01:15.479> days<00:01:15.690> when<00:01:15.930> nobody

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
this was done in those days when nobody

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.780 
this was done in those days when nobody
was<00:01:16.350> quite<00:01:16.560> sure<00:01:16.680> whether<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.430> there<00:01:17.670> was

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
was quite sure whether or not there was

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.100 
was quite sure whether or not there was
a<00:01:17.850> deflector<00:01:18.360> grid<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.720> this

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
a deflector grid on this

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.800 
a deflector grid on this
so<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> decided<00:01:20.190> yes<00:01:21.000> there's<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> deflector

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so I decided yes there's a deflector

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.630 
so I decided yes there's a deflector
grid<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.350> buried<00:01:22.799> underneath<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.369> small

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640

that's<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.790> answer<00:03:48.920> when<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.130> warp<00:03:50.670> nacelle

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
that's the answer when the warp nacelle

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.300 
that's the answer when the warp nacelle
blew<00:03:51.209> up<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.510> figure<00:03:51.840> why<00:03:52.440> not<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.830> fed<00:03:53.100> back

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
blew up I figure why not it fed back

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.009
