as<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.150> take<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.080> look<00:02:21.349> there<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.650> got<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.920> a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
as you take a look there I got a a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.600 
as you take a look there I got a a
groove<00:02:23.269> here<00:02:23.690> still<00:02:24.080> on<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.099> inner<00:02:25.250> most

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
groove here still on the inner most

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.420 
groove here still on the inner most
tread<00:02:26.000> on<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.989> outer<00:02:27.140> most<00:02:27.470> it's<00:02:27.769> kind<00:02:28.340> of

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
tread on the outer most it's kind of

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.420 
tread on the outer most it's kind of
feathered<00:02:28.790> away<00:02:29.090> however<00:02:30.019> it's<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.349> really<00:02:31.250> not

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
feathered away however it's a really not

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.930 
feathered away however it's a really not
too<00:02:31.700> far<00:02:32.000> off<00:02:32.560> what<00:02:33.560> happened<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.099> I<00:02:34.129> replaced

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
too far off what happened is I replaced

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.770 
too far off what happened is I replaced
the<00:02:35.180> front<00:02:35.690> shocks<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.470> when<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.250> did<00:02:37.489> so

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
the front shocks and when I did so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.900 
the front shocks and when I did so
replace<00:02:38.780> them<00:02:38.959> with<00:02:39.110> one<00:02:39.379> with<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.819> little<00:02:40.819> bit

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
replace them with one with a little bit

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.750 
replace them with one with a little bit
of<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.180> lift<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.780> with<00:02:42.319> that<00:02:42.500> lift<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.250> camber

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
of a lift and with that lift the camber

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.850 
of a lift and with that lift the camber
wound<00:02:43.970> up<00:02:44.209> getting<00:02:44.390> readjusted<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:45.500> even

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
wound up getting readjusted so even

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.050 
wound up getting readjusted so even
though<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:45.980> took<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.430> for<00:02:46.459> an<00:02:46.640> alignment

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
though I took it in for an alignment

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.880 
though I took it in for an alignment
it's<00:02:47.390> still<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:48.340> not<00:02:49.340> exactly<00:02:49.819> right<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:50.890> but

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
it's still and not exactly right but but

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.250 
it's still and not exactly right but but
as<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.190> see<00:02:52.430> what<00:02:52.610> I'm<00:02:52.700> talking<00:02:53.180> about

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
all right that's just pretty much a

along this tread is pretty much done for
hugely<00:03:15.440> disgusted<00:03:16.280> by<00:03:16.430> this<00:03:16.870> went<00:03:17.870> up<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.079> the

store and thought to myself that I just

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.069 
store and thought to myself that I just
got<00:03:19.790> defective<00:03:20.299> tires<00:03:20.540> or<00:03:20.810> what's<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.019> deal

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
got defective tires or what's the deal

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.650 
got defective tires or what's the deal
this<00:03:21.769> is<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.100> way<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.400> that's<00:03:22.910> designed<00:03:23.389> as

this is the way that that's designed as

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.800 
this is the way that that's designed as

with snow and these tires are probably

with snow and these tires are probably
the<00:03:41.630> most<00:03:42.609> are<00:03:43.609> the<00:03:43.849> worst<00:03:44.060> tires<00:03:44.329> I've<00:03:44.569> I've

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
the most are the worst tires I've I've

the most are the worst tires I've I've
had<00:03:45.109> in<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.260> while<00:03:45.440> in<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.739> snow<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:48.230> I'm<00:03:48.319> hoping

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
had in a while in the snow so I'm hoping

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.559 
had in a while in the snow so I'm hoping
by<00:03:48.709> cutting<00:03:49.010> out<00:03:49.099> these<00:03:49.280> new<00:03:49.459> grooves<00:03:49.760> with

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
up it's going to wind up making a big

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.949 
up it's going to wind up making a big
difference<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:55.069> I<00:03:55.220> mean<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:56.510> know<00:03:56.630> I<00:03:56.660> mean

difference and I mean you know I mean
the<00:03:58.180> trying<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.269> save<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.510> couple<00:03:59.750> bucks<00:03:59.930> is
