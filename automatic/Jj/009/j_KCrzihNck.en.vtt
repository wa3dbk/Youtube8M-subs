period<00:01:35.420> which<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> brand<00:01:36.900> new<00:01:37.049> component<00:01:37.650> as

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
period which is a brand new component as

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.890 
period which is a brand new component as
part<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.220> their<00:01:38.369> calendar<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.720> now<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
part of their calendar and so now the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.710 
part of their calendar and so now the
club's<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:40.860> into<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.430> short<00:01:42.240> break<00:01:42.450> at

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
club's will go into a short break at

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.060 
club's will go into a short break at
that<00:01:42.840> age<00:01:42.990> group<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:43.530> it'll<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.799> what

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that age group and then it'll be what

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.530 
that age group and then it'll be what
we're<00:01:44.220> calling<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> futsal<00:01:44.820> period<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.329> think

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
we're calling the futsal period we think

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.060 
we're calling the futsal period we think
there's<00:01:45.689> great<00:01:45.810> value<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.350> benefits<00:01:46.799> from

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
there's great value and benefits from

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.310 
there's great value and benefits from
from<00:01:47.490> futsal<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.750> total<00:01:49.079> skill

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
from futsal you know it's a total skill

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
from futsal you know it's a total skill
game<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> foundation<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.970> we

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
game and that is the foundation and we

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.370 
game and that is the foundation and we
think<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.390> going<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:51.630> enjoyable<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
think it's going to be enjoyable for the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.810 
think it's going to be enjoyable for the
players<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.070> we're<00:01:53.250> excited<00:01:53.460> about<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
players and so we're excited about that

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.969 
players and so we're excited about that
and<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:54.540> culminate<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.500> futsal

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
and that will culminate with a futsal

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.310 
and that will culminate with a futsal
event<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.240> major<00:01:57.450> markets<00:01:57.960> where<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
event in the major markets where all the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.630 
event in the major markets where all the
clubs<00:01:58.560> will<00:01:58.710> come<00:01:58.860> together<00:01:59.189> we've<00:01:59.430> made<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
clubs will come together we've made a

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.399 
clubs will come together we've made a
few<00:01:59.729> other<00:02:00.060> changes<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.600> year<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.930> big<00:02:01.229> one

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
few other changes this year the big one

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.810 
few other changes this year the big one
being<00:02:01.560> how<00:02:01.649> we're<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> approach<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
being how we're going to approach the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.249 
being how we're going to approach the
finals<00:02:03.180> week<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.540> think<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.780> clubs<00:02:04.110> are

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
finals week and we think that clubs are

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.780 
finals week and we think that clubs are
ready<00:02:04.409> for<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.860> little<00:02:05.369> bit<00:02:05.520> different

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
ready for a little bit different

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.950 
ready for a little bit different
approach<00:02:06.030> we're<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> shorten<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.810> time

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
approach we're going to shorten the time

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.449 
approach we're going to shorten the time
where<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.320> bring<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.649> club's<00:02:07.860> together<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
where we bring the club's together and

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.699 
where we bring the club's together and
so<00:02:08.610> basically<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:10.229> will<00:02:10.410> be<00:02:10.530> an<00:02:10.619> elimination

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
so basically it will be an elimination

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.720 
so basically it will be an elimination
format<00:02:11.489> where<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> higher<00:02:12.270> seed<00:02:12.599> will<00:02:12.780> host

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
format where the higher seed will host

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.340 
format where the higher seed will host
and<00:02:14.730> we'll<00:02:15.030> cover<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.510> travel<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> lower

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and we'll cover the travel for the lower

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.340 
and we'll cover the travel for the lower
seed<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.770> go<00:02:16.920> play<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.370> match<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.810> will<00:02:19.110> you

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
seed to go play that match and will you

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.250 
seed to go play that match and will you
know<00:02:19.530> support<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.100> match<00:02:20.280> as<00:02:20.550> we<00:02:20.730> would<00:02:21.260> you

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
know support that match as we would you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.810 
know support that match as we would you
know<00:02:22.350> all<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.620> showcase<00:02:23.040> matches<00:02:23.520> or<00:02:23.670> when

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
know all of the showcase matches or when

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.280 
know all of the showcase matches or when
they<00:02:23.910> were<00:02:23.970> at<00:02:24.180> finals<00:02:24.600> week<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.110> higher

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
they were at finals week but the higher

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.290 
they were at finals week but the higher
seed<00:02:25.530> will<00:02:25.680> host<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.130> then<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.340> final<00:02:26.520> four

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
seed will host and then the final four

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.730 
seed will host and then the final four
teams<00:02:27.630> for<00:02:27.870> each<00:02:27.960> of<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.170> age<00:02:28.290> groups<00:02:28.560> will

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
teams for each of the age groups will

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.380 
teams for each of the age groups will
bring<00:02:28.920> together<00:02:29.100> at<00:02:29.460> our<00:02:29.550> national<00:02:30.030> training

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
bring together at our national training

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.770 
bring together at our national training
center<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:31.290> carson<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.940> i<00:02:33.270> guess<00:02:33.600> we've

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
center in carson and so i guess we've

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.440 
center in carson and so i guess we've
we've<00:02:34.050> shortened<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.270> is

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
we've shortened it but we think this is

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.380 
we've shortened it but we think this is
the<00:02:36.570> right<00:02:36.720> next<00:02:36.960> step<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:38.190> terms<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.670> where

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the right next step in terms of where

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.140 
the right next step in terms of where
we're<00:02:39.510> headed<00:02:39.720> with<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.930> clubs
