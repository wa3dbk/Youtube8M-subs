00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.170 
your filler attacks surge is strong
against<00:01:33.570> them<00:01:33.689> now<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.900> think<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.650> may<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.250> made

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
against them now I think I may have made

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
against them now I think I may have made
a<00:01:36.240> mistake<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> other<00:01:37.320> ability<00:01:37.950> that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
a mistake I think the other ability that

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.260 
a mistake I think the other ability that
I<00:01:38.130> could<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.400> chosen<00:01:38.549> instead<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.939> surgeons

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
I could have chosen instead of surgeons

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.490 
I could have chosen instead of surgeons
may<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.570> been<00:01:39.720> watered<00:01:40.079> yet<00:01:40.229> which<00:01:40.350> would

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
may have been watered yet which would

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
may have been watered yet which would
have<00:01:40.590> been<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.770> better<00:01:40.860> call<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.759> are<00:01:41.880> faster

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
have been a better call we are faster

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.030 
have been a better call we are faster
than<00:01:42.479> Carrodus<00:01:42.840> maximus<00:01:43.229> with<00:01:43.380> these<00:01:43.530> pets<00:01:43.770> so

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
than Carrodus maximus with these pets so

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.530 
than Carrodus maximus with these pets so
we<00:01:44.159> didn't<00:01:44.369> necessarily<00:01:44.520> need<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> use<00:01:45.299> surge

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
we didn't necessarily need to use surge

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.899 
we didn't necessarily need to use surge
to<00:01:45.720> go<00:01:45.810> first<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.649> hey<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.189> works<00:01:47.369> out<00:01:47.579> anyways

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
to go first but hey it works out anyways

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.039 
to go first but hey it works out anyways
so<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.689> are

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
so there we are

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.810 
so there we are
and<00:01:49.170> because<00:01:49.799> we're<00:01:49.979> faster<00:01:50.369> we<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.700> an

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and because we're faster we can get an

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.760 
and because we're faster we can get an
immediate<00:01:51.180> blood<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.229> water<00:01:52.439> without

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
immediate blood in the water without

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.830 
immediate blood in the water without
even<00:01:53.130> having<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> put<00:01:53.610> any<00:01:53.820> more<00:01:54.090> bleed<00:01:54.689> up

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
even having to put any more bleed up

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.179 
even having to put any more bleed up
it's<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.290> handy<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.799> have<00:01:55.920> bleed

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it's really handy to have bleed

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.920 
it's really handy to have bleed
available<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:56.790> three<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.090> these<00:01:57.210> pets<00:01:57.479> and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
available in all three of these pets and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.749 
available in all three of these pets and
we<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.680> continue<00:01:59.040> wearing<00:01:59.280> him<00:01:59.430> down<00:01:59.460> this

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
we just continue wearing him down this

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.630 
we just continue wearing him down this
carrot<00:02:00.149> does<00:02:00.450> heal<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.079> lot<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.280> quite

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
carrot does heal a lot it's quite

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.580 
carrot does heal a lot it's quite
frustrating<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.600> he<00:02:04.020> does<00:02:04.140> quite<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.380> bit<00:02:04.500> of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
frustrating and he does quite a bit of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.990 
frustrating and he does quite a bit of
damage<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.009> while<00:02:05.159> he's<00:02:05.369> doing<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.700> but

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
damage to you while he's doing that but

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.429 
damage to you while he's doing that but
you<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.390> wear<00:02:06.689> him<00:02:06.810> down<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.259> wear

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
you just have to wear him down but wear

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.960 
you just have to wear him down but wear
him<00:02:07.619> down<00:02:07.649> faster<00:02:08.369> than<00:02:08.520> he's<00:02:08.700> wearing

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
him down faster than he's wearing

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.820 
him down faster than he's wearing
himself<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.720> originally<00:02:10.649> thought<00:02:10.770> that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
himself up I originally thought that

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.110 
himself up I originally thought that
snails<00:02:11.220> would<00:02:11.400> be<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> good<00:02:11.640> call<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:12.030> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
snails would be a good call for this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.460 
snails would be a good call for this
because<00:02:12.390> they<00:02:12.540> take<00:02:12.720> reduced<00:02:13.020> ER<00:02:13.140> damage<00:02:13.379> from

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
because they take reduced ER damage from

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.910 
because they take reduced ER damage from
his<00:02:13.650> Hey

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
his Hey

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.710 
his Hey
and<00:02:13.980> they<00:02:14.069> also<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.459> access<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.849> dive<00:02:15.060> but

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and they also have access to dive but

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.210 
and they also have access to dive but
with<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.319> cool<00:02:16.500> down<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.800> guide<00:02:16.920> they<00:02:17.130> are

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
with the cool down and guide they are

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.300 
with the cool down and guide they are
just<00:02:17.550> too<00:02:17.760> slow<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.450> he<00:02:19.319> can't<00:02:19.590> outlast<00:02:19.950> three

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
just too slow and he can't outlast three

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.520 
just too slow and he can't outlast three
snails<00:02:20.580> pretty<00:02:20.940> darn<00:02:21.150> easily<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.319> there's

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
snails pretty darn easily so there's

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.870 
snails pretty darn easily so there's
another<00:02:22.739> blood<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.130> water<00:02:23.280> sounds<00:02:23.730> good

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
another blood on the water sounds good

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.670 
another blood on the water sounds good
he<00:02:24.090> cleanses<00:02:24.540> with<00:02:24.720> age<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:25.260> we<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.560> go

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
he cleanses with age do can we just go

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.559 
he cleanses with age do can we just go
ahead<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.040> reapply<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.489> bleed<00:02:26.760> that's<00:02:27.420> all

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569

your bleed up fill with surge and then

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.680 
your bleed up fill with surge and then
spam<00:02:31.970> flood<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.120> waters<00:02:33.360> off<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.600> it's
