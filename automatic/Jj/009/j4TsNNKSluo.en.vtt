00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 very good to mind all welcome 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.839
 to a new job of gta 5 we were in 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.269
 patch 1.6 and you can duplicate the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.150
 cars we can do it the next 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.790
 way inside our place these 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.770
 options and place of appearance property 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.100
 Once this is done we leave the session 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.189
 in online mode I have to warn you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.289
 I say one thing, you pay, you know, 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.199
 can duplicate the cars as you go 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.410
 see in the video but you can not 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.989
 give away I've been trying all day 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.969
 do it but we can not do it or it is not 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.590
 you can give away at least we have done 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.809
 an important step that is to duplicate 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.870
 cars then once got into 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.110
 our individual session we give to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.570
 start 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.670
 and we give it back online but here 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.710
 we no longer play normal but 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.260
 play gta online and session by inviting and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.230
 by invitation, it is valid not because 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.680
 you have to do it in the following way 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.739
 then once inside the session 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.300
 Private we have created it as 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.210
 you can see I'm not, I'm not cutting 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.979
 nothing is going to be a little long so 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.560
 see all things one hundred percent 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.440
 this works safe as I said no what 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.790
 we can give away the cars because when 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.110
 you take a hotel 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.509
 the owner tells you that to him the companion 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.280
 tells you that on their websites or in their saints 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.460
 custom just fuck no you can not put it 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.190
 and you get it the other one does not have insurance 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.540
 but it does not leave you then once either 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.700
 inside our garage we take the 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.500
 vehicle that we want to duplicate memory 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.240
 that to do this you need space 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.220
 in the car in the garage sorry 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.259
 you need space in the garage because 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.910
 if you are not going to be able to document and 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.050
 you can duplicate it but it says that we have 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.630
 to change this car for another 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.700
 then once since we were wanted 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.230
 that were we wanted that we were this car 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.560
 which in this case is the car stickers 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.560
 we have what 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.170
 then quickly enter playstation 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.170
 store when we go to enter the 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.460
 garage is worth the same dinner what 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.500
 changes 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.600
 what we are going to do we enter inside the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.750
 garage and when we are inside the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.620
 garage as you will see below 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.140
 we enter to start on line there is start and 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.470
 playstation store according makes it a 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.030
 once inside 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.670
 we enter and leave 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.959
 if it went well for you if it went well 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.170
 you have done well 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.390
 when you enter it 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.160
 when you enter what is he 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.110
 again in the online you have to have 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.780
 the car behind logically you have to 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.510
 have the car behind 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.760
 otherwise it will not work once we have the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.069
 vehicle behind us we have to 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.380
 call the police because we put one 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.300
 we kill another and have at least 300 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.390
 of the car you see that it will change position 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.280
 more or less and you will have it here 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.400
 so now it is very easy what there is 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.730
 what to do , we are ending up choosing and 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.420
 when the star is already blinking 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.100
 when the star blinks 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.810
 to get into the garage 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.410
 and we put it in 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.540
 our garage and it will turn out that in my 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.690
 case I have the garage full and we have to 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.150
 change the location of the car you want 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.470
 replace this vehicle with another one we see 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.890
 that if we believe that we want to change it and 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.860
 in this case when we have already 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.480
 changed good have it empty auto 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.830
 automatically as you are going to see now the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.170
 video we are going to change for the cutter 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.910
 you have the car duplicated 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.550
 good guys this is the video at least 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.170
 we have made a big step we have been able to 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.030
 duplicate the cars but we can 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.490
 give so nothing guys I hope that you 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:54.190
 have liked like favorites a greeting and 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.190
