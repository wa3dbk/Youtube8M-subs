00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.009
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.300
 another small video from today 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.029
 I want to show you how for the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.430
 latest version namely 1 point 4.4 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.779
 if the fine can get we go 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.430
 this download link the next 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:44.679
 tender screen a little bit down 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:47.800
 So far, whether the ride 1.4.2011 on 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:52.239
 best now on the desktop can do that 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.160
 close under hikers of course and 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.899
 open the whole and now we go 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:02.800
 in our point minecraft folder too 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:07.210
 100% in the point minecraft 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.210
 folder bin and minecraft points so 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.220
 this is now the brand new version the 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.050
 I know is the yesterday or today 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.300
 only come out in any case , well 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.210
 We continue the running meter into the 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.000
 and delete the metal in the upgrade 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.740
 already said yes that prevents the 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.740
 So everything has to be installed 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.660
 if you have a mac pc would have 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.600
 that is not necessarily but that this 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.620
 video also not meant in any case 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:39.400
 so control now and so ctrl a paste 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.780
 that in the minecraft 1 on ok that can 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.790
 close whole and I change now 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.010
 let's just say the program is the same 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.660
 Now we are back so we are 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.510
 Go on in here now 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.440
 Graphics settings and how you see 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:57.130
 we have several options there we can 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.280
 now with details we can here yes 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.260
 many things turn much on and off 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.860
 in the quality you can of course 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.110
 everything is turning much higher here 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.110
 but I make the sound 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 stairways 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:20.820
 and yes, well, here you can now up to 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:24.310
 extremely high yes here is below 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:29.020
 still 1 point 4.2 but this video is 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:35.230
 thought for 1 point 4.4 because yes this one 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.850
 video is a bit older but yes good 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.370
 I have just started again 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.730
 and now we definitely catch 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.300
 Here you can set much more and 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.410
 If we are here then I just know 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:56.020
 my kong world if we are here now 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.590
 we can go or go alone 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.380
 here 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.810
 I prefer to do it fast 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.190
 here a lot of things 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.760
 and yes, then everything looks much better 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.150
 off and yes well, in any case, that was it 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.380
 for this tutorial and yes I hope we 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.380
 then see another free
