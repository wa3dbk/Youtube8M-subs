my methodology and why it is I think

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.189 
my methodology and why it is I think
it's<00:00:14.880> important<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.330> crack<00:00:15.540> these<00:00:15.719> allegories

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
it's important to crack these allegories

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.990 
it's important to crack these allegories
and<00:00:16.800> I'd<00:00:17.070> like<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.279> start<00:00:17.550> off<00:00:17.730> with<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
and I'd like to start off with a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.939 
and I'd like to start off with a
presumption<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.779> make<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.590> prophetic

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
presumption that I make the prophetic

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.500 
presumption that I make the prophetic
writings<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.640> biblical<00:00:21.090> authors<00:00:21.359> are

and everyone else the presumption that I

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.470 
and everyone else the presumption that I
make<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> authors<00:00:26.699> were<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:27.150> trying

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
make is that the authors were not trying

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.779 
make is that the authors were not trying
to<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.810> diabolical<00:00:28.650> nor<00:00:29.160> were<00:00:29.310> they<00:00:29.429> trying<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
to be diabolical nor were they trying to

to be diabolical nor were they trying to
be<00:00:29.910> fiction<00:00:30.150> writers<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.810> for<00:00:31.439> example<00:00:31.740> I'd

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
be fiction writers and for example I'd

to the authors and in some ways

to the authors and in some ways
