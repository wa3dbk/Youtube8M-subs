00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
an impressive stance and don't I just

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
an impressive stance and don't I just
love<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> height<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> impulse<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.930> is

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
love the height of the impulse this is

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.539 
love the height of the impulse this is
one<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.229> those<00:01:13.350> few<00:01:13.650> bikes<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.010> Indian<00:01:14.310> market

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
one of those few bikes of Indian market

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.190 
one of those few bikes of Indian market
that<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.790> perfectly<00:01:15.150> suited<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.659> someone<00:01:16.080> as

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that is perfectly suited to someone as

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
that is perfectly suited to someone as
tall<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.560> me<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.150> mic<00:01:18.299> has

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
tall as me because of that the mic has

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.700 
tall as me because of that the mic has
some<00:01:18.630> awesome<00:01:18.810> ground<00:01:19.290> clearance

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
some awesome ground clearance

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.800 
some awesome ground clearance
so<00:01:20.130> take<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> impulse<00:01:20.759> practically<00:01:21.299> anywhere

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so take the impulse practically anywhere

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.390 
so take the impulse practically anywhere
you<00:01:22.320> want<00:01:22.500> to

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.570 

that<00:01:29.000> ground<00:01:29.270> clearance<00:01:29.510> is<00:01:29.920> 245<00:01:30.920> millimeters

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
that ground clearance is 245 millimeters

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.540 
that ground clearance is 245 millimeters
however<00:01:32.420> unlike<00:01:33.140> other<00:01:33.320> endurance<00:01:33.830> bikes<00:01:34.070> the

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
however unlike other endurance bikes the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.060 
however unlike other endurance bikes the
bike<00:01:34.760> is<00:01:35.000> not<00:01:35.180> very<00:01:35.450> tall<00:01:35.720> therefore<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.860> can

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
bike is not very tall therefore it can

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.469 
bike is not very tall therefore it can
be<00:01:37.220> ridden<00:01:37.490> well<00:01:37.700> by<00:01:38.120> most<00:01:38.330> people

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
be ridden well by most people

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.289 
be ridden well by most people

too heavy a slim profile helps in

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.350 
too heavy a slim profile helps in
control<00:01:50.140> aspect<00:01:50.579> there's<00:01:51.579> a<00:01:51.670> monoshock<00:01:52.000> in
