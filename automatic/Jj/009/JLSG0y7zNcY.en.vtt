00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.040 
I also use another very effective
technique<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.400> counter-attack<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.599> one

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
technique in this counter-attack the one

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.790 
technique in this counter-attack the one
to<00:02:13.230> pass

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to pass

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.760 
to pass
which<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.340> also<00:02:14.850> data<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.870> quick<00:02:16.200> way<00:02:16.230> to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
which is also data and a quick way to

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.460 
which is also data and a quick way to
beat<00:02:17.190> his<00:02:17.490> defense<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.540> combo<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.110> strongly

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
beat his defense the combo is strongly

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.070 
beat his defense the combo is strongly
recommend<00:02:20.160> about<00:02:20.430> four<00:02:20.970> counter-attacks<00:02:21.840> at

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080
