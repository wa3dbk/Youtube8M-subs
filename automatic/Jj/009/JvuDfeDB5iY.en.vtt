assume this is Azeroth and this is
Kalimdor<00:01:13.790> this<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.970> probably<00:01:15.590> out<00:01:16.590> lands<00:01:17.159> or

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
Kalimdor this is probably out lands or

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.010 
Kalimdor this is probably out lands or
set<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> calls<00:01:17.850> over<00:01:18.210> here

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
get one and this connector doesn't do

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.569 
get one and this connector doesn't do
much<00:01:50.880> when<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.270> plug<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:52.310> mouse<00:01:53.310> or

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
much when you plug in a mouse or

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.590 
much when you plug in a mouse or
keyboard<00:01:53.689> so<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.079> must<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.670> must

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
keyboard so but that must be for must

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.990 
keyboard so but that must be for must
plug<00:01:57.899> into<00:01:58.110> some<00:01:58.590> kind<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.250> super<00:01:59.490> network

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
plug into some kind of super network

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.870 
plug into some kind of super network
there<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.960> there's<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.409> boxing<00:02:02.009> with<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
there so there's that boxing with a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.450 
there so there's that boxing with a
blade<00:02:03.149> server
