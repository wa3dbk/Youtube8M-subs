00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.560
 like you see it a bit today 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.180
 differently I have a new camera 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.949
 namely now she has become 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.539
 right on my head and you can 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.310
 everybody sees what i do today i have 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.660
 Many jenny with it and become one 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.460
 a little bit out of luck because we have 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.199
 namely monday both a color credo in 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.199
 Hamburg or music is good for a stir 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.400
 i believe that we are using baking paper only 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.940
 can bake the lies in any case 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.620
 not correct 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.300
 what do we need today for the next one? 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.100
 technology how do i have my preparation 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.960
 made I need time anyway normal 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.180
 Baking paper because I have such a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.920
 rectangle cut out and the square 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.710
 divided again and now I have it 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.479
 a nice triangle and I need it 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.660
 right for my hair color its little ones 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.790
 maybe some kids from the 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.920
 cake baking to decorate i want yes 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.810
 decorate something today, however 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.670
 not a cake but me him 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.729
 less today how do you do that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.780
 whole and this is how it turns around you 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.100
 that the point points forward and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.619
 then you just start 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:38.100
 Slowly finger this bag with your fingers 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.869
 completely 1 to turn and up to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.520
 rotate 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.080
 pretty tight too that you me that you 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.080
 also a nice tip out of here 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.310
 there's a bit tighten that is 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.330
 also as I said are fixed that is 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.520
 whole and very important to complete 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.850
 final if you screwed that perfectly 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.850
 have the upper part just like that 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.590
 Fold it a bit makes them and then 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.300
 you have your complete typical once 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.610
 finished where we just later the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.930
 hair color fill on we go for 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.760
 you have already seen us 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.900
 now completely bleached we have 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.880
 the whole pages again a bit 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.580
 shorter that means we have one now 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.690
 nice free area to paint and that 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.000
 how are we going to do it? 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.800
 shot and did our reuchlin 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.890
 I here once a dark blue tone 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:37.760
 and I just fill it here 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:43.410
 up in my little twisted 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:46.260
 baking paper tubes three pieces then have 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.610
 I have another violet tone here 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.910
 It's so easy in too 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.910
 this direction 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.560
 and then I have one last time 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.780
 just a lighter pastel blue tone 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.739
 so a bit further refining 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.050
 to bring in and fill him as well 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.730
 again so if we did that 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.330
 you see, there already comes downstairs 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.340
 really something out definitely here 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.160
 above beautiful first compress the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.720
 all that we have a nice tension 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.820
 and, as I said, the small one 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.800
 tip gives us a bit of that 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.610
 paint off and now we just put it 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.150
 go and I'll do it too freely 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.000
 snout 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.860
 I start with the darker color and 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.250
 end then finally with the lighter one 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.250
 driver
