teaching students is giving them
something<00:00:58.309> fun<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.090> they<00:00:59.180> can<00:00:59.329> play<00:00:59.510> to

something fun that they can play to
learn<00:00:59.870> a<00:00:59.899> concept<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.280> we're<00:01:01.399> gonna<00:01:01.489> do<00:01:01.730> both

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
learn a concept so we're gonna do both

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.719 
learn a concept so we're gonna do both
of<00:01:02.090> these<00:01:02.570> in<00:01:02.870> this<00:01:03.410> particular<00:01:04.039> lesson<00:01:04.250> now

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
of these in this particular lesson now

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.969 
of these in this particular lesson now
the<00:01:05.210> first<00:01:05.479> thing<00:01:05.690> we're<00:01:05.869> gonna<00:01:05.960> do<00:01:06.289> is<00:01:06.500> we're

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
the first thing we're gonna do is we're

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.620 
the first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:01:07.039> come<00:01:07.430> up<00:01:07.580> with<00:01:07.940> a<00:01:07.970> simple<00:01:08.420> pattern

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
gonna come up with a simple pattern

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.389 
gonna come up with a simple pattern
alright<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.500> simple<00:01:09.860> pattern<00:01:10.190> is<00:01:10.310> going

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
alright so the simple pattern is going

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.160 
alright so the simple pattern is going
to<00:01:10.520> consist<00:01:10.850> of<00:01:11.030> two<00:01:11.180> different<00:01:11.479> patterns<00:01:11.690> the

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
to consist of two different patterns the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:21.150 
to consist of two different patterns the
first<00:01:12.500> one<00:01:12.800> is<00:01:12.950> going<00:01:13.160> to<00:01:13.280> be<00:01:13.460> kick<00:01:14.030> kick<00:01:14.509> left

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.790 

the<00:01:22.160> second<00:01:22.670> pattern<00:01:22.880> we<00:01:23.149> have<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:23.690> kick<00:01:24.349> kick

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
the second pattern we have is kick kick

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.680 
the second pattern we have is kick kick
left<00:01:25.280> left

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.499 

now<00:01:32.690> if<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:32.959> take<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.410> first<00:01:33.740> pattern<00:01:34.280> and

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
now if you take that first pattern and

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.410 
now if you take that first pattern and
you<00:01:35.509> loop<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:36.020> four<00:01:36.319> times<00:01:36.940> you<00:01:37.940> come<00:01:38.240> up<00:01:38.390> with

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
you loop it four times you come up with

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.480 
you loop it four times you come up with
three<00:01:39.170> beats<00:01:39.560> if<00:01:39.830> you<00:01:39.860> do<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.280> with

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
three beats if you do that with

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.570 
three beats if you do that with
sixteenth<00:01:41.030> notes<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:41.810> one<00:01:42.140> E<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.979> two<00:01:43.009> E<00:01:43.490> and

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
sixteenth notes so one E and a two E and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:52.560 
sixteenth notes so one E and a two E and
A<00:01:44.209> three<00:01:44.240> E<00:01:44.660> and<00:01:44.869> pi

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.270 

so<00:01:53.570> if<00:01:53.690> we're<00:01:53.900> gonna<00:01:53.990> measure<00:01:54.230> for<00:01:54.710> for<00:01:55.070> I'm

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
so if we're gonna measure for for I'm

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.620 
so if we're gonna measure for for I'm
gonna<00:01:55.460> say<00:01:55.640> alright<00:01:55.940> well<00:01:56.120> I<00:01:56.150> want<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.510> do<00:01:56.600> a

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
gonna say alright well I want to do a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.390 
gonna say alright well I want to do a
measure<00:01:56.870> for<00:01:56.960> four<00:01:57.440> so<00:01:57.560> I've<00:01:57.680> got<00:01:57.860> three<00:01:58.190> beats

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
measure for four so I've got three beats

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.950 
measure for four so I've got three beats
of<00:01:58.550> sixteenth<00:01:58.970> notes<00:01:59.210> taken<00:01:59.540> care<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.780> but<00:01:59.930> I

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
of sixteenth notes taken care of but I

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.480 
of sixteenth notes taken care of but I
mean<00:01:59.990> ease<00:02:00.170> with<00:02:00.290> me<00:02:00.410> with<00:02:00.560> four<00:02:00.860> sixteenth

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
mean ease with me with four sixteenth

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.790 
mean ease with me with four sixteenth
notes<00:02:01.580> left<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:02.510> I'm<00:02:02.630> gonna<00:02:02.750> do<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.020> kick<00:02:03.410> kick

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
notes left so I'm gonna do a kick kick

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.490 
notes left so I'm gonna do a kick kick
left<00:02:04.250> left<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:05.270> make<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.630> pattern<00:02:05.870> complete

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
left left to make that pattern complete

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:24.880 
left left to make that pattern complete
so<00:02:06.950> altogether<00:02:07.400> that<00:02:07.820> sounds<00:02:08.150> like<00:02:08.240> this<00:02:23.890> now

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
so altogether that sounds like this now

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.800 
so altogether that sounds like this now
that<00:02:25.040> pattern<00:02:25.490> in<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.790> itself<00:02:26.150> as<00:02:26.480> neither

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
that pattern in and of itself as neither

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.100 
that pattern in and of itself as neither
hard<00:02:27.410> nor<00:02:27.980> complex<00:02:28.550> nor<00:02:28.820> very<00:02:28.970> fun<00:02:29.390> alright<00:02:29.930> so

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
hard nor complex nor very fun alright so

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.050 
hard nor complex nor very fun alright so
