playing read remover a game that came

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.030 
playing read remover a game that came
out<00:00:05.549> two<00:00:05.819> years<00:00:05.850> ago<00:00:06.270> but<00:00:06.569> recently<00:00:07.049> went<00:00:07.680> free

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
out two years ago but recently went free

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.259 
out two years ago but recently went free
what<00:00:08.490> do<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.639> think<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:08.910> man

what do you think my man

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.330 
what do you think my man
I<00:00:09.410> feel<00:00:10.410> like<00:00:10.530> I've<00:00:10.650> seen<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:10.980> before<00:00:11.099> but

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
I feel like I've seen this before but

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.379 
I feel like I've seen this before but
okay<00:00:11.550> let's<00:00:11.880> do<00:00:12.030> this

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
okay let's do this

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.570 
okay let's do this
well<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.650> pretty<00:00:13.860> old<00:00:14.009> I'm<00:00:14.250> just<00:00:14.429> gonna

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
well it is pretty old I'm just gonna

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.730 
well it is pretty old I'm just gonna
walk<00:00:14.730> through<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.089> first<00:00:15.330> 16<00:00:15.960> or<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.320> levels

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
walk through the first 16 or so levels

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.099 
walk through the first 16 or so levels
basically<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> game<00:00:17.789> about<00:00:18.109> removing

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
basically it's a game about removing

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.010 
basically it's a game about removing
blocks<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.580> save<00:00:21.150> other<00:00:21.359> blocks<00:00:21.720> it's

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
blocks to save other blocks it's

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.599 
blocks to save other blocks it's
tutorial<00:00:22.470> level<00:00:22.740> basically<00:00:23.010> demonstrates

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
tutorial level basically demonstrates

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
tutorial level basically demonstrates
that<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:23.970> remove<00:00:24.269> every<00:00:24.660> light<00:00:24.960> red

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that you can remove every light red

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.009 
that you can remove every light red
block<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.910> subsequent<00:00:27.390> level<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.810> I'll<00:00:27.900> be

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
block the subsequent level that I'll be

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.929 
block the subsequent level that I'll be
getting<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.320> shows<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.250> can't<00:00:29.519> remove

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
getting to shows you you can't remove

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.759 
getting to shows you you can't remove
dark<00:00:30.449> red<00:00:30.689> blocks<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.349> move<00:00:31.560> around

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
dark red blocks you have to move around

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.819 
dark red blocks you have to move around
them<00:00:32.340> hence<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.480> whole<00:00:33.570> puzzle<00:00:33.989> part<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
them hence the whole puzzle part of the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.910 
them hence the whole puzzle part of the
experience<00:00:35.510> mmm<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:37.350> interesting<00:00:37.559> like

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
experience mmm it's interesting like

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.619 
experience mmm it's interesting like
production<00:00:38.280> side<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.969> stuff<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.450> too

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
production side and stuff like that too

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
production side and stuff like that too
is<00:00:39.840> really<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.950> strong<00:00:41.250> kind<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.670> look

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
is really a really strong kind of look

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.119 
is really a really strong kind of look
and<00:00:42.180> sound<00:00:43.140> which<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.590> something<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.920> most

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
and sound which is something you most

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.779 
and sound which is something you most
expect<00:00:44.399> from<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.629> flash<00:00:46.260> game<00:00:46.789> so

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
expect from a a flash game so

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.630 
expect from a a flash game so
LeWitt<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.660> did<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> veiled<00:00:49.350> seeing<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.460> that's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
LeWitt I did a veiled seeing like that's

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.740 
LeWitt I did a veiled seeing like that's
a<00:00:50.730> cool<00:00:50.850> thing<00:00:50.879> about<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.329> always<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.660> to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
a cool thing about you always have to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.080 
a cool thing about you always have to
think<00:00:51.870> around<00:00:52.050> stuff<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.070> also<00:00:53.610> contend<00:00:53.969> with

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
think around stuff and also contend with

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.490 
think around stuff and also contend with
a<00:00:54.120> physics<00:00:54.539> engine<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.079> something<00:00:55.350> you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
a physics engine which is something you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.110 
a physics engine which is something you
don't<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> lot<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.250> physics<00:00:56.550> games<00:00:56.760> just

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
don't do a lot in physics games just

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.610 
don't do a lot in physics games just
because<00:00:57.390> they're<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.780> mean<00:00:57.840> not<00:00:58.079> physics<00:00:58.440> games

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
because they're I mean not physics games

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.110 
because they're I mean not physics games
rather<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.100> puzzle<00:00:59.430> games<00:00:59.640> because<00:01:00.000> they're

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
rather but puzzle games because they're

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
rather but puzzle games because they're
you<00:01:00.449> know<00:01:00.510> physics<00:01:00.930> engines<00:01:01.260> are<00:01:01.460> typically

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
you know physics engines are typically

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
you know physics engines are typically
pretty<00:01:02.640> wonky<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.750> don't<00:01:03.870> wanna<00:01:04.019> get<00:01:04.110> you

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
pretty wonky you don't wanna get you

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.810 
pretty wonky you don't wanna get you
know<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.680> don't<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> designer<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.640> don't

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
know you don't as a designer you don't

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.940 
know you don't as a designer you don't
want<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.000> punish<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> player<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> need<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
want to punish a player see I need to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.130 
want to punish a player see I need to
move<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.610> other<00:01:08.640> block<00:01:09.090> right<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.659> son<00:01:10.020> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
move the other block right there son you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.469 
move the other block right there son you
should<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.439> focusing<00:01:11.010> more<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.820> game<00:01:12.060> Brad

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
should be focusing more on the game Brad

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.690 
should be focusing more on the game Brad
I<00:01:12.810> know<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.409> talking<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.250> play<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
I know I know talking and play at the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.670 
I know I know talking and play at the
same<00:01:14.760> time<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.450> one<00:01:15.840> thing<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.560> go

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
same time and one thing that as we go

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.740 
same time and one thing that as we go
through<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.970> you'll<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> tilt

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
through this you you'll have to tilt

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.270 
through this you you'll have to tilt
your<00:01:18.810> head<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.290> certain<00:01:19.619> levels<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.130> this

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
your head and certain levels like this

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.980 
your head and certain levels like this
one<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.570> kind<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.840> tilt

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
one right here just just kind of tilt

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
one right here just just kind of tilt
your<00:01:22.049> head<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> little<00:01:22.470> bit<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:23.070> imagine<00:01:23.670> just

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
your head a little bit just imagine just

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.440 
your head a little bit just imagine just
imagine<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.100> normal<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.820> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
imagine that that it's normal that you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.010 
imagine that that it's normal that you
switched<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:27.960> youtube<00:01:28.350> dial<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.950> landscape

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
switched your youtube dial to landscape

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.350 
switched your youtube dial to landscape
you<00:01:31.020> know<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> duty<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> turn

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
you know just do the duty do you turn

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.770 
you know just do the duty do you turn
your<00:01:33.540> device<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.409> landscape<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.880> aren't<00:01:36.720> you

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
your device to landscape I do aren't you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.109 
your device to landscape I do aren't you
supposed<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.650> don't<00:01:38.070> know<00:01:38.250> probably<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
supposed to I don't know probably so

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.640 
supposed to I don't know probably so
another<00:01:39.659> cool<00:01:39.840> thing<00:01:39.900> actually<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:40.500> should

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
another cool thing actually we should

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.530 
another cool thing actually we should
mention<00:01:40.829> there<00:01:41.070> are<00:01:41.100> four<00:01:41.400> planes<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:42.000> gravity

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
mention there are four planes of gravity

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.789 
mention there are four planes of gravity
in<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> game<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.140> can't<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.500> see<00:01:43.710> them

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
in the game you can't really see them

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.950 
in the game you can't really see them
yet<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.549> mean<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.240> never<00:01:45.360> really<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.840> them<00:01:45.899> but

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
yet I mean you never really see them but

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.810 
yet I mean you never really see them but
later<00:01:46.649> levels<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.220> demonstrate<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
later levels will demonstrate this a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510 
later levels will demonstrate this a
little<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.270> better<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:49.170> depending<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:49.950> where

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
little bit better but depending on where

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.859 
little bit better but depending on where
the<00:01:50.610> blocks<00:01:50.850> are<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.299> might<00:01:51.509> swing

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the blocks are they might swing

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.020 
the blocks are they might swing
different<00:01:52.259> ways<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.579> upper<00:01:53.700> left

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
different ways so like in the upper left

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.590 
different ways so like in the upper left
quadrant<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:55.470> blocks<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.490> your<00:01:57.270> fall

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
quadrant that blocks that your fall

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.709 
quadrant that blocks that your fall
actually<00:01:58.020> fall<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.310> kinda<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.719> was

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
actually fall up it's kinda like a was

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.120 
actually fall up it's kinda like a was

oh<00:03:22.500> man<00:03:23.489> wow<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:23.970> one<00:03:24.150> looks<00:03:24.299> hard<00:03:24.510> yeah<00:03:24.900> and

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
oh man wow this one looks hard yeah and

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.420 
oh man wow this one looks hard yeah and
this<00:03:25.139> is<00:03:25.200> where<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.590> physics<00:03:25.950> engine<00:03:26.099> really

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
this is where the physics engine really

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.650 
this is where the physics engine really
comes<00:03:26.609> in<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:26.910> what<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.090> have<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.329> do<00:03:27.450> is

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
comes in so what I have to do is

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.210 
comes in so what I have to do is
basically<00:03:28.019> get<00:03:28.349> rid<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.709> block<00:03:28.919> at<00:03:29.130> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
basically get rid of that block at the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.870 
basically get rid of that block at the
right<00:03:29.489> time<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:30.150> then<00:03:30.329> yeah<00:03:30.720> whoa<00:03:31.440> yeah<00:03:32.280> so

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
right time and then yeah whoa yeah so

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.780 
right time and then yeah whoa yeah so
yeah<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.540> gets<00:03:33.660> much<00:03:33.959> more<00:03:34.169> like<00:03:34.790> kinetic

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
yeah it gets much more like kinetic

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.009 
yeah it gets much more like kinetic
almost<00:03:36.150> like<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.480> way<00:03:36.569> you're<00:03:36.720> kind<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.900> doing

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
almost like the way you're kind of doing

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.509 
almost like the way you're kind of doing
things<00:03:37.319> this<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.739> another<00:03:37.950> one<00:03:38.099> those<00:03:38.220> levels

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
things this is another one those levels
