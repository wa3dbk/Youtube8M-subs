00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
far gone well here we have one if we

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.960

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
bad as well but now here's the dilemma

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.160 
bad as well but now here's the dilemma
this<00:02:10.649> one<00:02:10.950> looks<00:02:11.520> perfect<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.930> might<00:02:13.140> be

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this one looks perfect and it might be

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.070 
this one looks perfect and it might be
but<00:02:14.069> if<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.340> been<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.910> car<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.450> years<00:02:15.780> or

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
but if it's been on the car for years or

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.680 
but if it's been on the car for years or
60,000<00:02:16.920> miles<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.489> needs<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:18.090> be<00:02:18.209> replaced

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
60,000 miles it needs to be replaced

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.979 
60,000 miles it needs to be replaced
because<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:19.800> can't<00:02:20.159> see<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.209> reinforcing

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
because we can't see the reinforcing

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.420 
because we can't see the reinforcing
fabric<00:02:22.709> inside<00:02:23.189> and<00:02:23.549> it<00:02:23.939> could<00:02:24.180> be<00:02:24.329> shot

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
fabric inside and it could be shot

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.179 
fabric inside and it could be shot
