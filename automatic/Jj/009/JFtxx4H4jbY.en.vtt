will<00:02:39.790> be<00:02:39.940> awesome<00:02:40.319> I'm<00:02:41.319> not<00:02:41.440> sure<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.620> us

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
will be awesome I'm not sure of us

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.650 
will be awesome I'm not sure of us
represent<00:02:42.190> 34<00:02:42.489> gia<00:02:42.640> would<00:02:42.790> be<00:02:42.879> enough<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.180> BML

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
represent 34 gia would be enough to BML

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.839 
represent 34 gia would be enough to BML
cuz<00:02:43.810> i<00:02:43.840> think<00:02:44.019> goku<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:45.099> know<00:02:45.250> it's<00:02:45.579> his<00:02:45.700> first

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
cuz i think goku you know it's his first

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.430 
cuz i think goku you know it's his first
time<00:02:46.000> turning<00:02:46.329> into<00:02:46.540> super<00:02:46.780> saiyan<00:02:46.959> 3<00:02:47.019> i<00:02:47.200> guess

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
time turning into super saiyan 3 i guess

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.319 
time turning into super saiyan 3 i guess
so<00:02:47.709> he<00:02:48.130> probably<00:02:48.310> wouldn't<00:02:48.609> be<00:02:48.700> as<00:02:48.880> used<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.209> it

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
so he probably wouldn't be as used to it

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.250 
so he probably wouldn't be as used to it
he<00:02:49.389> probably<00:02:49.450> wouldn't<00:02:49.780> be<00:02:49.870> able<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.019> unlock

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
he probably wouldn't be able to unlock

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.039 
he probably wouldn't be able to unlock
the<00:02:50.410> full<00:02:50.530> potential<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.900> know

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
the full potential of it but you know

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.599 
the full potential of it but you know
whatever<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.980> go<00:02:54.069> could<00:02:54.250> be<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> little<00:02:54.489> more

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
whatever it go could be a little more

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.129 
whatever it go could be a little more
used<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.090> super<00:02:55.389> saiyan<00:02:55.600> 3<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.959> you'd<00:02:56.049> be<00:02:56.109> like

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
used to super saiyan 3 and you'd be like

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.140 
used to super saiyan 3 and you'd be like
well<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.500> know<00:02:56.560> what<00:02:56.739> I<00:02:56.769> can<00:02:56.980> do<00:02:57.160> with<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.489> and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
well I know what I can do with this and

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.879 
well I know what I can do with this and
all<00:02:58.569> that<00:02:58.750> stuff<00:02:58.900> but<00:02:59.049> Vegeta<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.620> might<00:02:59.769> be<00:02:59.859> a

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
all that stuff but Vegeta I might be a

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.729 
all that stuff but Vegeta I might be a
little<00:02:59.980> bit<00:03:00.190> weaker<00:03:00.579> I<00:03:00.790> don't<00:03:01.389> know<00:03:01.739> whatever

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
little bit weaker I don't know whatever

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.129 
little bit weaker I don't know whatever
that's<00:03:03.160> not<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.519> point<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.790> this<00:03:04.139> we're

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
that's not the point of this we're

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.080 
that's not the point of this we're
trying<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.560> firkin<00:03:06.040> beat<00:03:06.400> him<00:03:06.609> up<00:03:06.730> right<00:03:06.910> now

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
trying to firkin beat him up right now

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.830 
trying to firkin beat him up right now
so<00:03:07.750> let's<00:03:08.139> do<00:03:08.350> that<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:09.489> was<00:03:09.700> like<00:03:09.880> oh<00:03:10.120> kicker

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
so let's do that it was like oh kicker
