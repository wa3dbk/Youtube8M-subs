 brought to southern california a course

 theoretical-practical dressage in the 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.890
 which the participants were offered 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.850
 an easy introduction to this discipline 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 consolidating basic knowledge 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.130
 This course has also served to 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.960
 who already have experience but have 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.960
 wanted to take a feedback 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.710
 the course talks about dressage and is 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.130
 a course with very basic notions of 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.100
 dressage in which he explains how to start 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.290
 a young foal up to what is the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.190
 procedure and well obviously 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.500
 I talk a little about also exercises 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.230
 dressage of high level already with this 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.580
 course you have the notions bases for 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.830
 then do other many 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.580
 disciplines so come to promote the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.740
 rh stud farm that is in spain we 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.200
 we dedicate to the pure Spanish race in 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.180
 dressage competition but also 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.390
 I came to 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.660
 advise a savior to try 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.080
 also or teach new dressage methods 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.890
 not only for especially in 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.630
 doma boxes but also methods with 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.060
 what you can later 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.130
 develop many other disciplines that 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.530
 at the end is the basis of dressage 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.260
 is the basis of many other disciplines and 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.580
 they are very basic concepts concepts 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.740
 logical and especially with a reason for 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.210
 be what is going to take the 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.590
 person who came to participate in these 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.630
 courses what is going to take from 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.630
 here on top to carry 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.900
 course of violence is never good 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:44.489
 for horses 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.400
 that there is a language a communication with 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.810
 the rider and the horse that has so much 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.599
 have to learn the client as then 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.640
 show it to the horse but without using 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.900
 violence but using a rational method 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.990
 a balanced method 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.960
 a logical method and using a few pauses 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.200
 a guide that makes your Argentine foal 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.450
 from minute 1 to there where 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.760
 you want to wear it well juancarlistas 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.739
 how do you comment 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.200
 the fact of wine to this course makes 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.920
 you can learn new concepts 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.010
 methods and a kind of guide to follow 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.340
 with your horse that later you can 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.890
 Take it to the discipline you want 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.360
 either 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.760
 it would either jump with the horse and 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.150
 so to walk or be it in a classical way 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.239
 doma cowgirl dancing 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.239
 ah 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.319
 good juan carlos prefer talking about 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.989
 the natural taming seems to me to be the 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.769
 most rational method of communication with 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.379
 the horses where you can understand what 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.420
 that the horse needs and you can 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.670
 convey what you want the horse 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.450
 therefore communication is direct 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.159
 it is concrete and specific to learn the 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.050
 natural aroma is like learning another 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:12.560
 language is practice study 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.210
 and good skill together with practice 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.760
 that gives you the basis of communication with 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.739
 the job to choose a horse from 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.680
 sport or have to practice at 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.040
 any of the sports is necessary 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.350
 have a healthy horse a horse without 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.430
 pain and with a clean mind to be able 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.240
 transmit to you through the language that 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.210
 before we talk 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.819
 the sports teachings of each 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.509
 discipline then it's important 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:44.460
 select a horse in its morphology 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.229
 its conformation but also its character 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.860
 that is correct for the discipline 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:53.099
 that is looking good I in particular have 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.009
 had and I have great admiration and 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:58.740
 respect for him for the purebred horse 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.900
 Spanish race 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.979
 and this we have some horses that 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.060
 they started taking the most classic and 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.600
 creamy 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.360
 seize to attract a very person 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.960
 professional that brings us more than anything 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.080

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.270
 way because we are bringing am 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.870
 contributing a bit to the world 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.500
 of the horse 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.520
 Spanish avaÃ­ and a particular style 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.280
 when a client comes here to the 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.580
 arrival I usually like to explain 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.470
 the good and bad points I can 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.190

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.380
 knowledge this there will be who 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.270
