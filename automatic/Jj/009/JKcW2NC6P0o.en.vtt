00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520 

okay<00:00:00.510> let's<00:00:00.690> move<00:00:00.840> on<00:00:01.020> now<00:00:01.079> to<00:00:01.199> talk<00:00:01.410> about

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
okay let's move on now to talk about

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.080 
okay let's move on now to talk about
something<00:00:01.770> called<00:00:01.890> the<00:00:02.129> greatest<00:00:02.580> common

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
something called the greatest common

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.299 
something called the greatest common
factor<00:00:04.049> or<00:00:04.520> abbreviated<00:00:05.520> as<00:00:05.779> GCF<00:00:06.799> so<00:00:07.799> the

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
factor or abbreviated as GCF so the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.129 
factor or abbreviated as GCF so the
greatest<00:00:08.670> common<00:00:08.940> factor<00:00:09.269> GCF<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
greatest common factor GCF is the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.480 
greatest common factor GCF is the
largest<00:00:10.679> factor<00:00:11.179> k<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.360> largest<00:00:13.049> factor<00:00:13.490> then

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
largest factor k the largest factor then

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.939 
largest factor k the largest factor then
is<00:00:14.700> divisible<00:00:15.000> by<00:00:15.330> each<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.440> group<00:00:16.770> of

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
is divisible by each in a group of

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.349 
is divisible by each in a group of
numbers<00:00:18.859> so<00:00:19.859> find<00:00:20.130> where<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.340> GCF<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.970> pretty

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
numbers so find where the GCF is pretty

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.929 
numbers so find where the GCF is pretty
simple<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:22.470> just<00:00:22.710> find<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> product<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.699> all

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
simple we just find the product of all

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.810 
simple we just find the product of all
common<00:00:24.779> factors<00:00:25.320> between<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:26.010> numbers

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
common factors between the numbers

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.849 
common factors between the numbers
there's<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.930> be<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.050> lot<00:00:28.320> easier<00:00:28.619> than

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
there's going to be a lot easier than

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.420 
there's going to be a lot easier than
the<00:00:29.189> LCM<00:00:30.410> so<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.500> only<00:00:31.740> about<00:00:31.830> procedure

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the LCM so it's only about procedure

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.240 
the LCM so it's only about procedure
that<00:00:32.669> I've<00:00:32.759> written<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> GCF<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.860> for

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
that I've written for the GCF so for

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.830 
that I've written for the GCF so for
step<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.760> factor<00:00:36.270> each<00:00:36.450> number

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
step one you factor each number

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.590 
step one you factor each number
completely<00:00:37.489> for<00:00:38.489> step<00:00:38.700> two<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.910> list<00:00:39.270> every

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
completely for step two you list every

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.900 
completely for step two you list every
factor<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.260> common<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.920> every<00:00:41.670> number

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
factor that is common to every number

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.130 
factor that is common to every number
and<00:00:42.329> that's<00:00:42.780> important<00:00:43.230> has<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.559> common<00:00:44.160> to

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
and that's important has to be common to

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.430 
and that's important has to be common to
every<00:00:46.140> number<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.940> then<00:00:48.090> step<00:00:48.360> 3<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> GCF<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
every number and then step 3 the GCF is

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.750 
every number and then step 3 the GCF is
just<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> product<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> numbers<00:00:50.670> from

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
just the product of the numbers from

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.299 
just the product of the numbers from
step<00:00:51.030> 2<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.989> you're<00:00:52.469> basically<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:53.100> going<00:00:53.250> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
step 2 so you're basically just going to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.459 
step 2 so you're basically just going to
multiply<00:00:53.670> all<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.390> common<00:00:55.190> factors<00:00:56.190> together

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
multiply all the common factors together

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.049 
multiply all the common factors together
okay<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.649> example<00:00:59.039> 1<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.460> objective<00:00:59.910> is<00:00:59.940> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
okay for example 1 the objective is to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.750 
okay for example 1 the objective is to
find<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.480> greatest<00:01:00.989> common<00:01:01.320> factor<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.190> GCF

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
find the greatest common factor or GCF

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
find the greatest common factor or GCF
of<00:01:03.140> 35<00:01:04.140> +<00:01:05.210> 150<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:07.170> we'll<00:01:07.409> start<00:01:07.650> by<00:01:07.799> factoring

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
of 35 + 150 so we'll start by factoring

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.060 
of 35 + 150 so we'll start by factoring
each<00:01:08.520> number<00:01:08.909> 35<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:10.250> 5<00:01:11.250> times<00:01:11.820> 7<00:01:12.530> course<00:01:13.530> 5<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
each number 35 is 5 times 7 course 5 and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.499 
each number 35 is 5 times 7 course 5 and
7<00:01:14.310> or<00:01:14.400> both<00:01:14.520> prime<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.090> we're<00:01:15.210> gonna<00:01:15.330> start

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
7 or both prime so we're gonna start

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.130 
7 or both prime so we're gonna start
below<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:17.060> 150<00:01:18.060> let's<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.110> 15<00:01:19.560> times<00:01:19.830> 10<00:01:20.960> 15<00:01:21.960> is

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
below and 150 let's do 15 times 10 15 is

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.190 
below and 150 let's do 15 times 10 15 is
5<00:01:22.409> times<00:01:22.680> 3<00:01:22.890> both<00:01:23.850> 5<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.420> 3<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.689> prawn<00:01:24.900> will

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
5 times 3 both 5 and 3 or prawn will

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.190 
5 times 3 both 5 and 3 or prawn will
circle<00:01:25.530> those<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.970> 10<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.420> 5<00:01:27.600> times<00:01:27.840> 2

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
circle those and then 10 is 5 times 2

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.319 
circle those and then 10 is 5 times 2
and<00:01:28.590> again<00:01:28.920> 5<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.369> 2<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.610> both<00:01:29.640> prime<00:01:30.030> so

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
and again 5 and 2 are both prime so

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.770 
and again 5 and 2 are both prime so
we're<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.920> circle<00:01:31.920> both<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.220> those<00:01:32.780> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
we're going to circle both of those so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.270 
we're going to circle both of those so
now<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.680> I'm<00:01:34.799> looking<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:35.479> would<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:37.280> common

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
now what I'm looking for would be common

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.770 
now what I'm looking for would be common
factors<00:01:38.729> factors<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.689> both<00:01:40.350> 35<00:01:41.009> +<00:01:41.310> 150<00:01:42.090> share

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
factors factors that both 35 + 150 share

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.170 
factors factors that both 35 + 150 share
ok<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.250> we're<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.430> ahead<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.670> write<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.970> out

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
ok so we're go ahead and write this out

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.460 
ok so we're go ahead and write this out
like<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.899> did<00:01:46.079> when<00:01:46.200> we're<00:01:46.380> doing

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
like this like we did when we're doing

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.120 
like this like we did when we're doing
the<00:01:46.680> LCM<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:48.990> 35<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.390> 150<00:01:52.130> 35

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the LCM so we have 35 and we have 150 35

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.249 
the LCM so we have 35 and we have 150 35
is<00:01:53.340> 5<00:01:53.579> times<00:01:53.850> 7<00:01:54.590> 150<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.680> 5<00:01:56.040> times<00:01:56.689> 5<00:01:57.689> times<00:01:57.750> 3

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
is 5 times 7 150 is 5 times 5 times 3

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.730 
is 5 times 7 150 is 5 times 5 times 3
times<00:01:58.560> 2<00:01:59.329> now<00:02:00.329> when<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:00.840> did<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> LCM

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
times 2 now when we did the LCM

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.800 
times 2 now when we did the LCM
procedure<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.850> looked<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.420> largest

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
procedure we looked for the largest

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.959 
procedure we looked for the largest
number<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> repeats<00:02:04.560> that's<00:02:05.189> not<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.790> case

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
number of repeats that's not the case

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.869 
number of repeats that's not the case
here<00:02:06.079> what<00:02:07.079> you're<00:02:07.229> looking<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.099> for<00:02:08.849> a

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
here what you're looking for is for a

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.050 
here what you're looking for is for a
factor<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.899> they<00:02:10.110> share<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.849> case

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
factor that they share so in this case

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.980 
factor that they share so in this case
the<00:02:12.270> only<00:02:12.599> fact

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
the only fact

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.620 
the only fact
that<00:02:13.200> they<00:02:13.320> share<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.800> five<00:02:14.130> right<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.300> share

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
that they share is five right they share

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.010 
that they share is five right they share
a<00:02:15.660> factor<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.290> five<00:02:16.620> now<00:02:17.310> 150<00:02:18.210> has<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.510> second

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
a factor of five now 150 has a second

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.350 
a factor of five now 150 has a second
factor<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.470> five<00:02:19.710> but<00:02:20.460> there's<00:02:20.640> not<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.790> second

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
factor of five but there's not a second

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.590 
factor of five but there's not a second
factor<00:02:21.690> five<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.080> 12<00:02:22.230> 35<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.670> GCF<00:02:24.300> here

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
factor five and 12 35 so the GCF here

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.820 
factor five and 12 35 so the GCF here
will<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:25.050> be<00:02:25.170> five<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.320> main<00:02:31.530> thing<00:02:31.560> to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
will just be five so the main thing to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.320 
will just be five so the main thing to
get<00:02:31.950> out<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.460> that<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:32.820> have<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
get out of this is that they have to

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.900 
get out of this is that they have to
share<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.230> factor<00:02:34.860> right<00:02:35.460> i<00:02:35.520> mean<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.760> can

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
share the factor right i mean you can

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.610 
share the factor right i mean you can
basically<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.510> erase<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.990> 5<00:02:37.230> here<00:02:37.410> i<00:02:37.440> put

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
basically just erase this 5 here i put

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.190 
basically just erase this 5 here i put
in<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:37.800> different<00:02:38.070> color<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:39.150> put<00:02:39.390> five<00:02:39.690> and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
in a different color and put five and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.780 
in a different color and put five and
five<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.890> can<00:02:41.010> see<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.130> they<00:02:41.310> don't<00:02:41.460> share

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
five you can see that they don't share

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.060 
five you can see that they don't share
any<00:02:42.090> other<00:02:42.360> factors<00:02:42.990> they<00:02:43.530> don't<00:02:43.710> share<00:02:43.890> any

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
any other factors they don't share any

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.040 
any other factors they don't share any
other<00:02:44.190> factors<00:02:44.670> again<00:02:45.270> there's<00:02:45.450> another<00:02:45.690> five

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
other factors again there's another five

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.830 
other factors again there's another five
here<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:47.310> not<00:02:47.370> shared<00:02:47.790> there's<00:02:48.060> only<00:02:48.270> 15

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
here but it's not shared there's only 15

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.380 
here but it's not shared there's only 15
that<00:02:49.110> they<00:02:49.230> share<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.250> GCF<00:02:50.820> here<00:02:51.150> is

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
that they share and so the GCF here is

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.720 
that they share and so the GCF here is
just<00:02:51.570> going<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.780> be<00:02:51.840> 5<00:02:52.310> let's<00:02:53.310> take<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.460> look<00:02:53.640> at

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
just going to be 5 let's take a look at

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.340 
just going to be 5 let's take a look at
another<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.180> don't<00:02:54.600> get<00:02:54.750> frustrated<00:02:54.900> if<00:02:55.260> you

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
another and don't get frustrated if you

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.310 
another and don't get frustrated if you
don't<00:02:55.500> get<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.680> right<00:02:55.800> away<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:57.320> not

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
don't get it right away it's not

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.420 
don't get it right away it's not
something<00:02:58.590> that's<00:02:58.740> easy<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.010> wrap<00:02:59.190> your<00:02:59.280> head

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
something that's easy to wrap your head

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.510 
something that's easy to wrap your head
around<00:02:59.460> it<00:02:59.730> first<00:03:00.410> okay<00:03:01.410> for<00:03:01.530> example<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
around it first okay for example to the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.400 
around it first okay for example to the
objective<00:03:02.940> again<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.270> find<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> GCF<00:03:04.020> and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
objective again is to find the GCF and

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.330 
objective again is to find the GCF and
of<00:03:05.340> 14<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.260> 42<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.730> 14<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.940> 42<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:10.140> 14<00:03:10.740> is<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.160> 7

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
of 14 and 42 a 14 and 42 so 14 is just 7

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.140 
of 14 and 42 a 14 and 42 so 14 is just 7
times<00:03:11.670> 2<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:13.250> 7<00:03:14.250> into<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.550> problem<00:03:14.970> we'll<00:03:15.060> go

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
times 2 and 7 into a problem we'll go

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.270 
times 2 and 7 into a problem we'll go
ahead<00:03:15.210> circle<00:03:15.600> those<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:17.720> 42<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:19.850> 3<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.030> 14<00:03:21.300> x

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
ahead circle those and 42 is 3 to 14 x

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.340 
ahead circle those and 42 is 3 to 14 x
33<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.370> prime<00:03:24.290> 14<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.470> 7<00:03:25.800> times<00:03:25.830> 27<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:28.110> 2<00:03:28.230> are

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
33 is prime 14 is 7 times 27 and 2 are

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.530 
33 is prime 14 is 7 times 27 and 2 are
both<00:03:28.380> prime<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:32.610> let's<00:03:33.030> go<00:03:33.150> ahead<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.300> write

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
both prime so let's go ahead and write

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.460 
both prime so let's go ahead and write
this<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:34.050> chart<00:03:34.830> form<00:03:36.260> 214<00:03:38.900> seven<00:03:39.900> times<00:03:40.110> two

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
this in chart form 214 seven times two

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:49.220 
this in chart form 214 seven times two
and<00:03:41.870> forty<00:03:42.870> 27<00:03:43.530> x<00:03:43.680> 2<00:03:43.800> x<00:03:43.920> 3<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:48.810> can<00:03:48.960> see<00:03:49.080> that

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
and forty 27 x 2 x 3 so you can see that

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.040 
and forty 27 x 2 x 3 so you can see that
they<00:03:49.380> share<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.680> factor<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.340> seven<00:03:50.790> they<00:03:51.750> share

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
they share a factor of seven they share

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.500 
they share a factor of seven they share
a<00:03:52.080> factor<00:03:52.410> too<00:03:52.980> but<00:03:53.850> they<00:03:53.970> don't<00:03:54.210> share<00:03:54.450> a

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
a factor too but they don't share a

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.060 
a factor too but they don't share a
factor<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.960> three<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:56.250> basically<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.030> GCF

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
factor of three so basically the GCF

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.020 
factor of three so basically the GCF
will<00:03:59.070> be<00:03:59.220> 7<00:03:59.760> times<00:04:00.270> 2<00:04:00.840> or<00:04:01.200> 14<00:04:01.860> okay<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:02.820> the

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
will be 7 times 2 or 14 okay that is the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.350 
will be 7 times 2 or 14 okay that is the
greatest<00:04:03.420> common<00:04:04.230> factor<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:06.090> if<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.240> go

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
greatest common factor and if you go

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.640 
greatest common factor and if you go
back<00:04:06.540> through<00:04:06.810> here<00:04:07.020> you<00:04:07.140> can<00:04:07.290> just<00:04:07.320> kind<00:04:07.620> of

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
back through here you can just kind of

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.260 
back through here you can just kind of
look<00:04:07.800> at<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:07.980> prime<00:04:08.220> factorization<00:04:08.640> see<00:04:09.180> it

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
look at the prime factorization see it

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.710 
look at the prime factorization see it
that's<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.630> case<00:04:10.160> 14<00:04:11.160> /<00:04:11.459> 14<00:04:11.940> would<00:04:12.120> be<00:04:12.240> 1<00:04:12.480> and

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
that's the case 14 / 14 would be 1 and

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.130 
that's the case 14 / 14 would be 1 and
42<00:04:13.650> /<00:04:14.040> 14<00:04:14.550> would<00:04:14.760> be<00:04:14.880> three<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:15.990> can<00:04:16.080> see

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
42 / 14 would be three so you can see

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.050 
42 / 14 would be three so you can see
that<00:04:16.170> anything<00:04:16.739> larger<00:04:17.280> than<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.609> anything

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
that anything larger than that anything

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.340 
that anything larger than that anything
larger<00:04:18.330> than<00:04:18.390> fourteenth<00:04:18.780> not<00:04:18.959> going<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.170> work

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
larger than fourteenth not going to work

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.130 
larger than fourteenth not going to work
so<00:04:19.950> obviously<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:20.640> factor<00:04:21.479> of<00:04:21.570> three<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:21.960> not

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
so obviously this factor of three is not

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.120 
so obviously this factor of three is not
going<00:04:22.290> to<00:04:22.410> include<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.770> because<00:04:22.800> it's<00:04:23.040> not

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
going to include it because it's not

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.570 
going to include it because it's not
shared<00:04:23.520> by<00:04:23.610> both<00:04:23.729> of<00:04:23.940> them<00:04:25.220> let's<00:04:26.220> take<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.400> look

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
shared by both of them let's take a look

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.200 
shared by both of them let's take a look
another<00:04:26.789> one<00:04:28.039> okay<00:04:29.039> for<00:04:29.220> example<00:04:29.580> three<00:04:29.909> we

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
another one okay for example three we

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.570 
another one okay for example three we
want<00:04:30.389> to<00:04:30.449> find<00:04:30.599> the<00:04:30.720> GCF<00:04:31.139> of<00:04:31.729> 1575<00:04:32.729> in<00:04:33.650> 120<00:04:34.650> ok

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
want to find the GCF of 1575 in 120 ok

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.860 
want to find the GCF of 1575 in 120 ok
so<00:04:35.639> again<00:04:35.789> which<00:04:36.060> is<00:04:36.090> going<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.360> factor<00:04:36.689> each

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
so again which is going to factor each

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.300 
so again which is going to factor each
number<00:04:37.319> 15<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:37.979> five<00:04:38.189> times<00:04:39.349> 375<00:04:40.349> we<00:04:40.590> can<00:04:40.710> do<00:04:40.770> 15

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
number 15 is five times 375 we can do 15

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.159 
number 15 is five times 375 we can do 15
times<00:04:41.750> 5<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:44.750> 120<00:04:45.750> we<00:04:46.740> could<00:04:46.919> do<00:04:47.039> 12<00:04:47.370> times<00:04:47.699> 10

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
times 5 and 120 we could do 12 times 10

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.020 
times 5 and 120 we could do 12 times 10
ok<00:04:49.169> 5<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:49.740> 3<00:04:49.770> of<00:04:50.039> both<00:04:50.159> prime<00:04:50.460> so<00:04:50.849> we're<00:04:50.939> gonna

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
ok 5 and 3 of both prime so we're gonna

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.929 
ok 5 and 3 of both prime so we're gonna
circle<00:04:51.360> those<00:04:54.020> under<00:04:55.020> 75<00:04:55.530> five<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:56.039> prime<00:04:56.250> 15

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
circle those under 75 five is prime 15

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.719 
circle those under 75 five is prime 15
is<00:04:57.150> five<00:04:57.389> times<00:04:57.599> three<00:04:58.219> five<00:04:59.219> and<00:04:59.250> three<00:04:59.639> of

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
is five times three five and three of

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.059 
is five times three five and three of
those<00:04:59.849> Prime's<00:05:00.150> so<00:05:00.360> we<00:05:00.419> can<00:05:00.509> circle<00:05:00.690> those<00:05:01.069> and

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
those Prime's so we can circle those and

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.360 
those Prime's so we can circle those and
then<00:05:02.520> for<00:05:02.759> 12<00:05:03.060> that's<00:05:03.449> four<00:05:03.750> times<00:05:04.039> 34<00:05:05.039> is<00:05:05.190> 2

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
then for 12 that's four times 34 is 2

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:12.290 
then for 12 that's four times 34 is 2
times<00:05:05.550> 2<00:05:08.539> 10<00:05:09.539> is<00:05:09.690> going<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:09.870> be<00:05:09.960> 5<00:05:10.199> times<00:05:10.469> 2<00:05:11.300> so

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
times 2 10 is going to be 5 times 2 so

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.369 
times 2 10 is going to be 5 times 2 so
choose<00:05:12.930> prime<00:05:13.280> three<00:05:14.280> prime<00:05:14.310> five<00:05:14.909> prime<00:05:15.479> and

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
choose prime three prime five prime and

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:19.100 
choose prime three prime five prime and
again<00:05:16.590> tues<00:05:16.830> brawn<00:05:17.539> so<00:05:18.539> let's<00:05:18.810> go<00:05:18.930> ahead<00:05:18.960> and

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
again tues brawn so let's go ahead and

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.469 
again tues brawn so let's go ahead and
just<00:05:19.259> list<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.740> as<00:05:19.949> a<00:05:19.979> charge<00:05:20.370> 15<00:05:21.270> will<00:05:21.389> be

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
just list this as a charge 15 will be

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:30.939 
just list this as a charge 15 will be
five<00:05:21.719> times<00:05:28.279> 375<00:05:29.279> will<00:05:29.490> be<00:05:29.580> 5<00:05:29.849> times<00:05:30.029> 3<00:05:30.150> times<00:05:30.300> 5

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
five times 375 will be 5 times 3 times 5

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:41.540 
five times 375 will be 5 times 3 times 5
or<00:05:31.949> 5<00:05:32.370> times<00:05:32.580> 5<00:05:32.879> times<00:05:32.940> 3<00:05:38.659> 120<00:05:39.659> b<00:05:39.900> 2<00:05:40.500> x<00:05:40.710> 2<00:05:40.800> x<00:05:41.009> 3<00:05:41.129> x<00:05:41.250> 5

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
or 5 times 5 times 3 120 b 2 x 2 x 3 x 5

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:51.110 
or 5 times 5 times 3 120 b 2 x 2 x 3 x 5
x<00:05:41.729> 2<00:05:42.000> so<00:05:42.180> 3<00:05:42.779> factors<00:05:43.229> of<00:05:43.289> 2<00:05:49.310> 1<00:05:50.310> factor<00:05:50.729> 3<00:05:50.940> 1

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
x 2 so 3 factors of 2 1 factor 3 1

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.300 
x 2 so 3 factors of 2 1 factor 3 1
factor<00:05:51.479> of<00:05:51.539> 5<00:05:53.449> everything<00:05:54.449> has<00:05:54.629> 15<00:05:55.229> I'm<00:05:56.129> go

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
factor of 5 everything has 15 I'm go

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.249 
factor of 5 everything has 15 I'm go
ahead<00:05:56.490> a<00:05:56.520> race<00:05:56.729> 5<00:05:57.000> and<00:05:57.509> put<00:05:57.779> in<00:05:57.870> a<00:05:57.960> different

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
ahead a race 5 and put in a different

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:06.529 
ahead a race 5 and put in a different
color<00:06:04.400> everything<00:06:05.400> is<00:06:05.639> one<00:06:05.819> factor<00:06:06.029> of<00:06:06.240> three

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
color everything is one factor of three

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.930 
color everything is one factor of three
so<00:06:06.810> I'll<00:06:06.900> do<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.110> same<00:06:07.289> thing<00:06:07.469> with<00:06:07.589> that<00:06:10.940> now

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
so I'll do the same thing with that now

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.019 
so I'll do the same thing with that now
we<00:06:12.599> have<00:06:12.690> an<00:06:12.810> extra<00:06:13.110> factor<00:06:13.409> of<00:06:13.620> 5<00:06:13.889> here<00:06:14.370> but

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
we have an extra factor of 5 here but

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:16.579 
we have an extra factor of 5 here but
it's<00:06:15.180> not<00:06:15.330> common<00:06:15.690> to<00:06:15.870> everything's<00:06:16.409> just

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:16.589 
it's not common to everything's just

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:19.519 
it's not common to everything's just
common<00:06:16.979> to<00:06:17.819> 75<00:06:18.389> right<00:06:19.050> we<00:06:19.169> don't<00:06:19.259> have<00:06:19.440> an

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:19.529 
common to 75 right we don't have an

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:21.200 
common to 75 right we don't have an
extra<00:06:19.770> factor<00:06:19.949> of<00:06:20.159> 5<00:06:20.339> and<00:06:20.520> 15<00:06:20.639> and<00:06:21.029> we<00:06:21.089> don't

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
extra factor of 5 and 15 and we don't

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.209 
extra factor of 5 and 15 and we don't
have<00:06:21.300> an<00:06:21.389> extra<00:06:21.629> factor<00:06:21.810> plot<00:06:22.169> in<00:06:22.319> 120<00:06:23.009> and

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
have an extra factor plot in 120 and

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.309 
have an extra factor plot in 120 and
then<00:06:23.909> we<00:06:24.029> had<00:06:24.210> three<00:06:24.509> factors<00:06:24.870> or<00:06:25.020> two<00:06:25.169> or

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 
then we had three factors or two or

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.820 
then we had three factors or two or
eight<00:06:25.560> that's<00:06:26.520> just<00:06:27.000> in<00:06:27.349> 120<00:06:28.349> that's<00:06:28.620> not

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
eight that's just in 120 that's not

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.430 
eight that's just in 120 that's not
common<00:06:29.250> anything<00:06:29.610> else<00:06:29.819> so<00:06:30.690> basically<00:06:31.110> 5

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
common anything else so basically 5

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.129 
common anything else so basically 5
times<00:06:31.740> 3<00:06:31.889> or<00:06:32.219> 15<00:06:32.849> is<00:06:33.270> going<00:06:33.870> to<00:06:33.930> be<00:06:34.020> your

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
times 3 or 15 is going to be your

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:35.870 
times 3 or 15 is going to be your
greatest<00:06:34.319> common<00:06:34.770> factor<00:06:35.159> right<00:06:35.610> those<00:06:35.849> are

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
greatest common factor right those are

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.389 
greatest common factor right those are
the<00:06:36.029> factors<00:06:36.509> five<00:06:36.870> and<00:06:37.289> three<00:06:37.680> that<00:06:38.370> are

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:38.399 
the factors five and three that are

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:40.730 
the factors five and three that are
common<00:06:38.880> to<00:06:38.909> each<00:06:39.300> number<00:06:39.690> and

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
common to each number and

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.890 
common to each number and
as<00:06:40.800> we<00:06:41.009> come<00:06:41.130> in<00:06:41.310> every<00:06:41.639> number<00:06:41.910> here<00:06:42.150> so<00:06:42.630> 5

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
as we come in every number here so 5

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.330 
as we come in every number here so 5
times<00:06:42.930> 3<00:06:43.259> which<00:06:43.500> is<00:06:43.740> 15<00:06:44.220> again<00:06:44.580> as<00:06:44.699> your<00:06:44.819> GCF
