00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
my gears turned in my head and I two

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.950 
my gears turned in my head and I two
weeks<00:00:26.550> later<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.849> came<00:00:26.939> up<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.300> well<00:00:27.660> maybe

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
weeks later I came up with well maybe

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.759 
weeks later I came up with well maybe
maybe<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.090> I<00:00:30.090> thought<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:30.840> maybe<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.380> had

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
maybe and I thought about maybe if I had

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.020 
maybe and I thought about maybe if I had
one<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.040> these<00:00:32.099> helicopters<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.850> if<00:00:32.940> I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
one of these helicopters and if I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.290 
one of these helicopters and if I
modified<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:34.309> this<00:00:35.309> helicopter<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.940> actually

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
modified it this helicopter can actually

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.560 
modified it this helicopter can actually
do<00:00:36.480> aerobatics<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:37.410> its<00:00:37.590> own<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:39.270> wanted

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
do aerobatics on its own but we wanted

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.690 
do aerobatics on its own but we wanted
to<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> regular<00:00:40.260> basis<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.520> air

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
to do it on a regular basis but air

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.220 
to do it on a regular basis but air
shows<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.300> wanted<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> make<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.809> safer<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
shows so we wanted to make it safer and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.790 
shows so we wanted to make it safer and
easier<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> aerobatics<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.710> I

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
easier to do the aerobatics so and I

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.930 
easier to do the aerobatics so and I
didn't<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.250> sign<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.670> doing

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
didn't want to sign on to doing

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.450 
didn't want to sign on to doing
something<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.690> unless<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.230> could<00:00:49.460> make

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
something like this unless I could make

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.549 
something like this unless I could make
it<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:51.030> where<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.180> personally<00:00:51.840> felt<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.440> we

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
it to where I personally felt like we

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350 
it to where I personally felt like we
could<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> aerobatic<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:54.300> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
could do the aerobatic and on a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.250 
could do the aerobatic and on a
long-term<00:00:54.570> basis<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.120> told<00:00:57.539> our<00:00:57.719> boss<00:00:57.930> about

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
long-term basis so I told our boss about

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.160 
long-term basis so I told our boss about
it<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:59.160> Red<00:00:59.309> Bull<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.730> he<00:01:00.660> said<00:01:00.870> go<00:01:01.020> ahead

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.200 
it and at Red Bull and he said go ahead
and<00:01:01.260> make<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.379> happen<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.579> took<00:01:02.730> me<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> year<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the process took like I said year and a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.820 
the process took like I said year and a
half<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.090> buy<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> helicopter<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.650> then

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
half to buy the helicopter and and then

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.100 
half to buy the helicopter and and then
think<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.700> modify<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.330> teach<00:01:21.930> myself

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
think it out and modify and teach myself

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.410 
think it out and modify and teach myself
I<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.470> aerobatics<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
I do aerobatics and and then do the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.999 
I do aerobatics and and then do the
aerobatics<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.560> certified<00:01:25.950> for

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
aerobatics and then get certified for

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.780 
aerobatics and then get certified for
the<00:01:26.490> exact<00:01:27.210> process<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.290> did<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:29.159> modify

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the exact process that we did to modify

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.520 
the exact process that we did to modify
it<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> secret<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.930> I'll<00:01:31.140> tell<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.439> the

basics<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.689> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
basics of it and that is we have this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.100 
basics of it and that is we have this
helicopter<00:01:34.530> has<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> rigid<00:01:35.630> titanium<00:01:36.630> single

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
helicopter has a rigid titanium single

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.649 
helicopter has a rigid titanium single
piece<00:01:37.320> rotor<00:01:37.650> head<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
piece rotor head on it and that's that

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.289 
piece rotor head on it and that's that
right<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.020> you're<00:01:40.380> looking<00:01:40.650> at<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:42.210> the

right that you're looking at and in the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.139 
right that you're looking at and in the
middle<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:43.200> has<00:01:43.350> composite<00:01:44.130> rotor<00:01:44.820> blades

coming off of it this emitter composite
so<00:01:48.000> between<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> rigid<00:01:48.689> head<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> can

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
so between the rigid head and I can

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.630 
so between the rigid head and I can
that's<00:01:50.500> cement<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.920> transmission<00:01:52.550> is

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
that's cement and the transmission is

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.090 
that's cement and the transmission is
bolted<00:01:53.030> down<00:01:53.270> hard<00:01:53.690> hard<00:01:54.530> mounted<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:55.010> the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
bolted down hard hard mounted to the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.230 
bolted down hard hard mounted to the
airframe<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:56.170> then<00:01:57.520> I've<00:01:58.520> got<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.729> titanium

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
airframe and then I've got a titanium

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.859 
airframe and then I've got a titanium
tail<00:01:59.630> rotor<00:01:59.810> driveshaft<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:01.390> terror<00:02:02.390> hub<00:02:02.659> and

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
tail rotor driveshaft and terror hub and

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.870 
tail rotor driveshaft and terror hub and
blades<00:02:03.680> back<00:02:03.860> there<00:02:04.040> terror<00:02:04.460> hub<00:02:04.670> and

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
blades back there terror hub and

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.969 
blades back there terror hub and
assembly<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.420> titanium<00:02:05.840> also<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.740> the

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
assembly is titanium also and the

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.480 
assembly is titanium also and the
terrible<00:02:07.250> blades<00:02:07.520> are<00:02:07.759> also<00:02:07.880> composite<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:09.490> we

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
terrible blades are also composite so we

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.280 
terrible blades are also composite so we
have<00:02:10.610> beefed<00:02:11.030> up<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.330> tail<00:02:11.540> section<00:02:11.780> and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
have beefed up the tail section and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.570 
have beefed up the tail section and
we've<00:02:12.530> changed<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.950> center<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.250> gravity<00:02:13.550> a

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
we've changed the center of gravity a

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.880 
we've changed the center of gravity a
lot<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:20.420> that's<00:02:20.630> technically<00:02:21.140> how<00:02:21.410> I<00:02:21.440> can<00:02:21.739> do

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
lot so that's technically how I can do

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.830 
lot so that's technically how I can do
it<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.670> just<00:02:22.880> from<00:02:23.000> those<00:02:23.090> modifications

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
it it's just from those modifications

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.620 
it it's just from those modifications
the<00:02:24.830> g's<00:02:25.070> are<00:02:25.250> fine<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.489> keep<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.940> down<00:02:26.239> pretty

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
the g's are fine I keep it down pretty

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.300 
the g's are fine I keep it down pretty
little<00:02:26.930> almost<00:02:27.320> everybody<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:27.980> goes<00:02:28.160> up

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
little almost everybody that goes up

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.310 
little almost everybody that goes up
with<00:02:28.489> me<00:02:28.640> thinks<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.540> going<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.780> be<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.230> know
