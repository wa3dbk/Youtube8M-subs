00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.970
 good morning, everyone, I'm sick, it's 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.670
 that I arrived last night is super tired 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.189
 insurance expires today and tomorrow I expire 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.860
 of the visa I have 250 kilos is tanzania 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.250
 the road so it's fine or 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.960
 is that I have no major problem when 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.840
 I got there I have to hook a ferry 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.250
 and tanzania crosses me and nothing is going to be 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.809
 a day zero because I do not have time to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.900
 make clues so I'm going to mess with 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:51.600
 the asphalt a boring day and right now 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.600
 I'm just going to pick up kids 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.049
 we are doing well 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.950
 we left the subject at eleven thirty 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.950
 I have four hours 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.850
 all good 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.390
 d 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.150
 that 80 km and I already deviated to the right 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.600
 your wonderful little road and I just 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.910
 to look at the map and yesterday look at google 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.500
 maps and said 200 meters along the coast is 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.500
 track around here are 400 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.739
 I have 65 kilometers left to a city that 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.260
 neither selectivity and all this today not 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.230
 I have eaten and I do not take food 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.269
 there is the very nice thing that people 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.830
 ask you do not you fear sometimes and 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.230
 right now I'm alone in the middle of the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.860
 nothing 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.860
 outside 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.030
 it is very difficult for a wall to appear 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.130
 bad but good could 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.690
 but on the other hand you think and the rock that 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.730
 go through here see me with this 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.510
 interesting engine with a light in the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.510
 license plate 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.470
 because this bike physicist beds at 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.400
 I greet you animals housed 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.400
 we scare 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.829
 in short you also have to be cautious 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.400
 then I'm going to make this short stop 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.620
 well maybe this trip in general I'm 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.989

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.989

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.160
 good comes to palm in 3d I had the happy 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.819
 idea as many times to ask in 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.579
 the police station that you tell me 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.690

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.990
 Sport wiggles politely I do not have them 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.540

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.310

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.930

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.250
