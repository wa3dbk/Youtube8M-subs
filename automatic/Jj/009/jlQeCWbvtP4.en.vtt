wipe it dry with a clean cloth after

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.640 
wipe it dry with a clean cloth after
that<00:01:29.890> we<00:01:30.890> will<00:01:31.070> cut<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.509> so<00:01:32.509> to<00:01:32.570> cut<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.290> windy

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
that we will cut it so to cut the windy

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.410 
that we will cut it so to cut the windy
what<00:01:34.070> I<00:01:34.100> would<00:01:34.340> suggest<00:01:34.549> is<00:01:34.939> that<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.119> hold

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
what I would suggest is that you hold

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.480 
what I would suggest is that you hold
all<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.689> bindi<00:01:36.140> is<00:01:36.170> in<00:01:36.320> one<00:01:36.500> line<00:01:36.530> like<00:01:37.280> this

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
all the bindi is in one line like this

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.499 
all the bindi is in one line like this
and<00:01:37.759> just<00:01:39.310> chop<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.579> head<00:01:40.820> off<00:01:41.000> like<00:01:41.180> this

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
and just chop the head off like this

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.280 
and just chop the head off like this
after<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:42.500> hold<00:01:42.799> it<00:01:42.979> like<00:01:43.159> this<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:44.259> cut<00:01:45.259> it

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
after that hold it like this and cut it

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.160 
after that hold it like this and cut it
into<00:01:46.540> smaller<00:01:47.540> pieces<00:01:47.979> isn't<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.100> simple

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
into smaller pieces isn't it simple

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.319 
into smaller pieces isn't it simple
after<00:01:51.170> that<00:01:51.380> take<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.430> smaller<00:01:52.850> Bunch

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
after that take a smaller Bunch

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.590 
after that take a smaller Bunch
and<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:57.619> ends<00:01:58.130> will<00:01:58.430> have<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.729> be<00:01:58.850> thrown<00:01:59.390> off

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
and the ends will have to be thrown off

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.969 
and the ends will have to be thrown off
so<00:02:00.110> we'll<00:02:00.560> take<00:02:00.770> another<00:02:00.950> bunch<00:02:01.430> here<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:02.979> lot

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
so we'll take another bunch here a lot

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.520 
so we'll take another bunch here a lot
of<00:02:04.009> people<00:02:04.549> I<00:02:04.729> have<00:02:04.789> seen<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:05.869> bindi<00:02:06.320> like

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
of people I have seen that bindi like

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.180 
of people I have seen that bindi like
this<00:02:06.740> they<00:02:07.610> cut<00:02:08.209> one<00:02:08.239> at<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.630> time<00:02:08.979> throw<00:02:09.979> this

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
this they cut one at a time throw this

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.259 
this they cut one at a time throw this
and<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.610> cut<00:02:10.970> like<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:12.850> this<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:14.090> also

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
and it cut like this this is also

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.240 
and it cut like this this is also
another<00:02:14.570> way<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.930> doing<00:02:15.049> it<00:02:15.320> but<00:02:15.860> if<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.100> are<00:02:16.160> a

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
another way of doing it but if you are a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.099 
another way of doing it but if you are a
beginner<00:02:16.639> and<00:02:16.820> just<00:02:17.090> learning<00:02:17.570> about<00:02:17.810> how<00:02:18.049> to

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.109 
beginner and just learning about how to

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.220 
beginner and just learning about how to
cook<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.709> cut<00:02:18.980> vegetables<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
cook and cut vegetables the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.990 
cook and cut vegetables the
earlier<00:02:20.379> method<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.920> had<00:02:21.069> shown<00:02:21.340> was<00:02:21.700> much

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
earlier method that I had shown was much

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.330 
earlier method that I had shown was much
easier<00:02:22.080> where<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.230> hold<00:02:23.500> all<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.860> windi's

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
easier where you hold all the windi's

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.960 
easier where you hold all the windi's
together<00:02:24.790> like<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.239> chop<00:02:25.900> off<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.230> head<00:02:26.409> and

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
together like this chop off the head and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.460 
together like this chop off the head and
cut<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.239> smaller<00:02:28.750> pieces<00:02:29.080> like<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:31.470> we've

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
cut it in smaller pieces like this we've

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.860 
cut it in smaller pieces like this we've
cut<00:02:32.830> sufficient<00:02:33.459> bindi<00:02:33.819> now<00:02:34.030> let's<00:02:34.540> take<00:02:34.840> a

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
cut sufficient bindi now let's take a

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.520 
cut sufficient bindi now let's take a
walk

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
walk

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.240 
walk
and<00:02:35.739> we'll<00:02:36.040> add<00:02:36.220> some<00:02:36.250> oil<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.769> if<00:02:38.769> you

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
and we'll add some oil to this if you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.449 
and we'll add some oil to this if you
like<00:02:39.519> bindis<00:02:40.060> slightly<00:02:40.810> crisp<00:02:41.230> make<00:02:42.099> sure<00:02:42.340> you

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
like bindis slightly crisp make sure you

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.059 
like bindis slightly crisp make sure you
take<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.879> little<00:02:43.060> more<00:02:43.330> oil<00:02:43.569> oil<00:02:44.110> also<00:02:44.620> has<00:02:44.860> got

gone<00:03:00.730> darker<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.269> color<00:03:01.510> now<00:03:01.989> what<00:03:02.410> we<00:03:02.560> will<00:03:02.650> do

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
gone darker in color now what we will do

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.750 
gone darker in color now what we will do
is<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:04.450> will<00:03:04.480> take<00:03:04.780> green<00:03:05.620> chili<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.160> cut<00:03:06.640> it

is we will take green chili and cut it
into<00:03:07.260> bigger<00:03:08.260> pieces<00:03:09.239> why<00:03:10.239> bigger<00:03:10.569> pieces

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
into bigger pieces why bigger pieces

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.110 
into bigger pieces why bigger pieces
because<00:03:11.349> we<00:03:11.530> cannot<00:03:11.799> cut<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.129> as<00:03:12.340> small<00:03:12.790> as<00:03:12.970> the
