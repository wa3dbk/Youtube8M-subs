00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.649 
just sort of big and up is is attacking
side<00:01:52.799> maybe<00:01:53.280> that's<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> case<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> don't

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
side maybe that's the case like I don't

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.080

watch<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.320> Sevilla<00:01:56.070> games<00:01:56.280> yeah<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.850> can

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
watch to be Sevilla games yeah we can

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.690 
watch to be Sevilla games yeah we can
pick<00:01:57.299> out<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.799> it<00:01:58.799> does<00:01:59.009> seem<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.280> me<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.520> he

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
pick out but it does seem to me that he

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.459 
pick out but it does seem to me that he
is<00:01:59.850> far<00:02:00.090> more<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.390> an<00:02:00.479> attack<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> fall<00:02:01.200> back

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
is far more of an attack and fall back

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.050 
is far more of an attack and fall back
better<00:02:01.740> than<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.040> defensive<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:02.700> per<00:02:02.850> se<00:02:03.030> so

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
better than a defensive one per se so

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.139 
better than a defensive one per se so
anyway<00:02:03.689> look<00:02:04.649> around<00:02:04.740> there's<00:02:05.130> an<00:02:05.219> initial<00:02:05.640> 60

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
anyway look around there's an initial 60

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.270 
anyway look around there's an initial 60
