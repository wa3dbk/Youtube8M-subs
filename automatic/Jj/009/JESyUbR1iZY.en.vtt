location<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.029> guys<00:00:18.210> probably<00:00:18.750> didn't<00:00:18.990> know

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
location you guys probably didn't know

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.450 
location you guys probably didn't know
about<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.590> know<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.770> didn't<00:00:20.160> know<00:00:20.250> about<00:00:20.340> it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
about I know I didn't know about it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.609 
about I know I didn't know about it
until<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.820> few<00:00:20.880> days<00:00:21.090> ago<00:00:21.150> Sofie<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.320> spawn

until a few days ago Sofie this spawn

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.380 
until a few days ago Sofie this spawn
location<00:00:23.160> makes<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.490> easier<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.060> guys<00:00:24.180> to

location makes it easier for you guys to

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.089 
location makes it easier for you guys to
get<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.689> vehicle<00:00:24.869> I'm<00:00:25.529> not<00:00:25.740> sure<00:00:25.890> if<00:00:25.980> this

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
get this vehicle I'm not sure if this

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.710

spawn<00:00:26.369> location<00:00:26.880> applies<00:00:27.180> for<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> old

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
spawn location applies for the old

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.380 
spawn location applies for the old
generation<00:00:28.199> consoles<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:28.859> 100%<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:30.060> it

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
generation consoles but 100% I know it

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.269 
generation consoles but 100% I know it
works<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> Xbox<00:00:31.380> one<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.679> PlayStation<00:00:31.859> 4

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
works for the Xbox one and PlayStation 4

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.280 
works for the Xbox one and PlayStation 4
the<00:00:32.730> reason<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.239> say<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.750> don't<00:00:33.809> know<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.200> it

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the reason I say I don't know if it

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.290 
the reason I say I don't know if it
works<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.890> old<00:00:35.130> gen<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.489> because<00:00:35.850> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
works for the old gen is because you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.910 
works for the old gen is because you
know<00:00:36.420> by<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:36.899> would<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.260> found<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.680> but

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
know by now we would have found this but

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.200 
know by now we would have found this but
since<00:00:38.040> we're<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.280> finding<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.850> now<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
since we're just finding it now I

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.209 
since we're just finding it now I
believe<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.690> only<00:00:39.930> for<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> next-gen<00:00:40.739> but

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
believe it's only for the next-gen but

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.740 
believe it's only for the next-gen but
correct<00:00:41.460> me<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:41.700> I'm<00:00:41.790> wrong<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.600> actually

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
correct me if I'm wrong and I actually

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.569

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
mountain yourself so that's a pretty

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
but you can get insurance on it in a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340 
but you can get insurance on it in a
tracker<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.210> could<00:01:57.299> always<00:01:57.420> keep<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.899> so

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
