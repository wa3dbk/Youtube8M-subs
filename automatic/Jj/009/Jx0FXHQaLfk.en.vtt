completely replaces the rubber piping

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.750 
completely replaces the rubber piping
that<00:00:40.320> comes<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.770> attaches<00:00:41.280> into<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> side

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that comes up and attaches into the side

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.360 
that comes up and attaches into the side
of<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:42.140> intake<00:00:43.140> right<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.070> little

of your intake right here in this little
bit<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:45.030> kind<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.930> holds<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> as

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
bit here that kind of like holds it as

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.830 
bit here that kind of like holds it as
it<00:00:46.680> goes<00:00:46.710> down<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.640> attaches<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.390> your

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it goes down and it attaches into your

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.680 
it goes down and it attaches into your
lower<00:00:49.050> intercooler<00:00:49.410> pipe<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.950> there<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.690> your

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
lower intercooler pipe in there so your

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.240 
lower intercooler pipe in there so your
blow<00:00:55.079> off<00:00:55.199> valve<00:00:55.379> piping<00:00:55.710> comes<00:00:55.890> off<00:00:56.039> your

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
blow off valve piping comes off your

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.529 
blow off valve piping comes off your
lower<00:00:56.399> intercooler<00:00:56.670> piping<00:00:57.030> which<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.360> down

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
lower intercooler piping which is down

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.830 
lower intercooler piping which is down
below<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:58.890> i<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.160> maybe<00:00:59.750> show<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
straight down in there and it comes off

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570 
straight down in there and it comes off
of<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:06.510> comes<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:07.100> attaches<00:01:08.100> at<00:01:08.220> an<00:01:08.310> elbow

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
of there comes up attaches at an elbow

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.609 
of there comes up attaches at an elbow
here<00:01:08.850> comes<00:01:09.570> up<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.110> into<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> blow-off

valve here and then off the back hammer

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.550 
valve here and then off the back hammer
and<00:01:13.920> vacuum<00:01:14.640> line<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:16.409> bent

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and vacuum line here and then for bent

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.749 
and vacuum line here and then for bent
atmosphere<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.070> plug<00:01:17.310> off<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:18.740> intake<00:01:19.759> this

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
atmosphere you plug off your intake this

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
atmosphere you plug off your intake this
year<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.240> your<00:01:21.360> factory<00:01:21.990> reset<00:01:22.229> valve

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
year for your factory reset valve

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.410 
year for your factory reset valve
normally<00:01:23.009> sits<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> flange

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
normally sits right there on that flange

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.230 
normally sits right there on that flange
and<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.580> aluminum<00:01:26.970> plug

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and we just have a little aluminum plug

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
and we just have a little aluminum plug
that<00:01:27.450> goes<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.710> takes<00:01:29.070> its<00:01:29.220> place

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
that goes in there and takes its place

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.510 
that goes in there and takes its place
so<00:01:29.850> instead<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.799> recirculating<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.220> air

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
so instead of recirculating all the air

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.690 
so instead of recirculating all the air
back<00:01:32.790> into<00:01:33.000> your<00:01:33.540> inlet<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:35.070> sent<00:01:35.579> out

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
back into your inlet it is just sent out

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.440 
back into your inlet it is just sent out
the<00:01:35.820> front<00:01:36.030> right<00:01:36.479> here<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:37.880> want<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> set<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the front right here I want to set it to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.109 
the front right here I want to set it to
recirc<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.350> last<00:01:40.950> night<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:41.939> pretty

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
recirc but last night we it was pretty

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.050 
recirc but last night we it was pretty
late<00:01:42.299> when<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.750> started<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:44.759> didn't<00:01:44.970> really

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
late when we started so we didn't really

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.080 
late when we started so we didn't really
have<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.509> mental<00:01:46.200> acuity<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.680> guess<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.189> keep

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
have the mental acuity I guess to keep

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.910 
have the mental acuity I guess to keep
on<00:01:48.270> fighting<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.200> night<00:01:49.380> long<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.829> we

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
on fighting with it all night long so we

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.550 
on fighting with it all night long so we
just<00:01:50.070> said<00:01:50.220> screw<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.790> I'll<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> little

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
just said screw it and I'll do a little

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.960 
just said screw it and I'll do a little
driving<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.430> show<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.700> what<00:01:53.850> it

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
driving for you and show you what it

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.370 
driving for you and show you what it
sounds<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.840> sounds<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.259> good

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
sounds like it sounds really good

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.740 
sounds like it sounds really good
it<00:01:56.439> is<00:01:56.590> now<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.969> I<00:01:58.030> still<00:01:58.299> want<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.509> get<00:01:58.630> the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
it is now but I still want to get the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.120 
it is now but I still want to get the
benefits<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.229> having<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.590> recirculation
