00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.690 

ball<00:00:42.780> finals<00:00:43.230> run<00:00:43.470> with<00:00:43.740> absolutely<00:00:44.490> great

with<00:00:46.710> 124<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.570> think<00:00:49.080> Eric<00:00:49.320> Miller<00:00:49.650> behind<00:00:49.920> us

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
with 124 I think Eric Miller behind us

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.420 
with 124 I think Eric Miller behind us
with<00:00:50.310> 128<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> tomorrow<00:00:52.560> is<00:00:52.739> going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.950> be<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
with 128 so tomorrow is going to be a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.210 
with 128 so tomorrow is going to be a
real<00:00:53.730> long<00:00:53.910> race<00:00:54.150> I'm<00:00:54.870> saying<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.350> about<00:00:55.530> 14

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
real long race I'm saying it's about 14

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.530 
real long race I'm saying it's about 14
miles<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.580> lap<00:00:56.760> six<00:00:57.090> laps

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
miles of lap six laps

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.970 
miles of lap six laps
supposed<00:00:58.200> to<00:00:58.260> get<00:00:58.350> two<00:00:58.500> inches<00:00:58.650> of<00:00:58.860> rain

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
supposed to get two inches of rain

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.680 
supposed to get two inches of rain
tonight<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.340> think<00:00:59.700> this<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.360> be<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.450> third

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
tonight I think this would be the third

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.270 
tonight I think this would be the third
time<00:01:00.900> outbreaks<00:01:01.290> down<00:01:01.470> here<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.100> know<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
time outbreaks down here you know the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.500 
time outbreaks down here you know the
main<00:01:02.430> strategy<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.330> to<00:01:03.390> be

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
main strategy I think is going to be

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.540 
main strategy I think is going to be
keeping<00:01:03.960> things<00:01:04.260> together<00:01:04.410> try<00:01:05.190> not<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.489> get

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
keeping things together try not to get

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.760 
keeping things together try not to get
any<00:01:05.700> bottlenecks<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.080> I'm<00:01:07.200> setting<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
any bottlenecks you know I'm setting the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:02:11.110 
any bottlenecks you know I'm setting the
pace<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.190> I'm<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.520> chasing<00:01:08.880> guys

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.430

overall it was a great day I mean I ran
harder<00:02:13.920> out<00:02:14.069> here<00:02:14.250> than<00:02:14.430> some<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.849> stuff

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
