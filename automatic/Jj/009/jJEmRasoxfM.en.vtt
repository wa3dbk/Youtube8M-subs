backwards for more legroom plus if you
watch<00:00:50.780> this<00:00:51.020> you'll<00:00:51.800> see<00:00:52.120> that<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:53.239> can<00:00:53.270> fold

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
watch this you'll see that you can fold

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.630 
watch this you'll see that you can fold
them<00:00:53.750> down<00:00:53.780> dead<00:00:54.260> easy<00:00:54.470> and<00:00:54.980> when<00:00:55.070> you<00:00:55.190> do<00:00:55.370> they

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
them down dead easy and when you do they

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.460 
them down dead easy and when you do they
lie<00:00:55.850> completely<00:00:56.090> flat<00:00:56.480> which<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:57.050> handy<00:00:57.350> when

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
lie completely flat which is handy when

practicality here in the front of the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.480 
practicality here in the front of the
rav4<00:01:05.630> as<00:01:06.110> well<00:01:06.320> it's<00:01:06.530> very<00:01:06.649> spacious<00:01:07.040> and

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
rav4 as well it's very spacious and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.280 
rav4 as well it's very spacious and
there's<00:01:07.939> lots<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.210> useful<00:01:08.450> cubbies<00:01:08.930> dotted

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
there's lots of useful cubbies dotted

around the cabin as is quick checklist
I'll<00:01:11.510> show<00:01:11.720> you<00:01:11.780> now

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.360 

you

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
you

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.010 
you
well<00:01:28.370> that's<00:01:28.790> practicality<00:01:29.420> dealt<00:01:29.630> with<00:01:29.780> so

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
well that's practicality dealt with so

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.350 
well that's practicality dealt with so
let's<00:01:30.260> move<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.620> reliability<00:01:31.360> actually

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
let's move on to reliability actually

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.490 
let's move on to reliability actually
there's<00:01:32.510> not<00:01:32.600> really<00:01:32.810> much<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.140> say<00:01:33.170> here

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
there's not really much to say here

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.110 
there's not really much to say here
because<00:01:33.620> being<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.160> Toyota<00:01:34.490> it's<00:01:34.940> very

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
because being a Toyota it's very

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.610 
because being a Toyota it's very
unlikely<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.630> rav4<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:36.050> ever<00:01:36.170> going<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.380> break

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
unlikely the rav4 is ever going to break

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.890 
unlikely the rav4 is ever going to break
down<00:01:36.650> however<00:01:37.310> if<00:01:37.580> it<00:01:37.700> does<00:01:37.730> there<00:01:38.540> is<00:01:38.660> a<00:01:38.690> peace

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
down however if it does there is a peace

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.380 
down however if it does there is a peace
of<00:01:39.020> mind<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.590> five-year<00:01:40.160> warranty<00:01:40.400> however

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
of mind of a five-year warranty however

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.790

that in a little bit of shaky camerawork
there<00:03:07.430> because<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.060> ride<00:03:08.270> it's<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.780> bit<00:03:08.930> jiggly

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
there because the ride it's a bit jiggly

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.190 
there because the ride it's a bit jiggly
and<00:03:09.440> bouncy<00:03:10.270> can<00:03:11.270> be<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.420> bit<00:03:11.570> of<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.660> noisy<00:03:11.990> car

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
and bouncy can be a bit of a noisy car

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.500 
and bouncy can be a bit of a noisy car
as<00:03:12.410> well<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.710> get<00:03:12.860> quite<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.280> bit<00:03:13.430> of<00:03:13.550> Tyre<00:03:14.120> roar

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
as well you get quite a bit of Tyre roar

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.560 
as well you get quite a bit of Tyre roar
and<00:03:14.810> if<00:03:14.960> you<00:03:15.050> rev<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.410> engine<00:03:16.300> well<00:03:17.300> listen<00:03:17.540> to

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
and if you rev the engine well listen to

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.140 
and if you rev the engine well listen to
that<00:03:17.830> it's<00:03:18.830> got<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.040> gruff<00:03:19.280> Diesel<00:03:19.730> isn't<00:03:20.000> it

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
that it's got a gruff Diesel isn't it

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.090 
that it's got a gruff Diesel isn't it
and<00:03:20.420> then<00:03:20.870> there's<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.110> interior<00:03:21.560> plastics

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
and then there's the interior plastics

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.640 
and then there's the interior plastics
because<00:03:22.250> then<00:03:22.780> they're<00:03:23.780> all<00:03:23.960> hard<00:03:24.320> and

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
because then they're all hard and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.170 
because then they're all hard and
brittle<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.190> mean<00:03:25.340> granted<00:03:25.610> it'll<00:03:26.000> probably

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
brittle I mean granted it'll probably

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.240 
brittle I mean granted it'll probably
never<00:03:26.420> fall<00:03:26.660> apart<00:03:26.990> but<00:03:27.230> probably<00:03:28.070> wouldn't

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
never fall apart but probably wouldn't

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.100 
never fall apart but probably wouldn't
care<00:03:28.460> if<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.880> did<00:03:29.240> I<00:03:29.270> mean<00:03:29.540> come<00:03:29.870> on

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
care if it did I mean come on

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.140 
care if it did I mean come on
Toyota<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.800> really<00:03:31.280> need<00:03:31.520> to<00:03:31.700> sort<00:03:31.910> out<00:03:32.120> your

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
Toyota you really need to sort out your

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:42.650 
Toyota you really need to sort out your
interiors

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.780 

finally<00:03:43.500> there's<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:43.980> tailgate<00:03:44.490> because

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
finally there's the tailgate because

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.040 
finally there's the tailgate because
instead<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:45.210> a<00:03:45.270> hatch<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:46.110> get<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:47.090> big<00:03:48.090> stupid

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
instead of a hatch you get a big stupid

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.820 
instead of a hatch you get a big stupid
door<00:03:49.950> look<00:03:50.580> it's<00:03:50.910> almost<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.330> long<00:03:51.510> as<00:03:51.830> this

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
door look it's almost as long as this

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.710 
door look it's almost as long as this
fuckup<00:03:53.640> that's<00:03:54.330> gonna<00:03:54.420> be<00:03:54.510> really

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
fuckup that's gonna be really

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.480 
fuckup that's gonna be really
problematic<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.410> opening<00:03:55.740> tight<00:03:55.920> spaces

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
problematic to opening tight spaces

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.540 
problematic to opening tight spaces
however<00:03:56.940> other<00:03:57.510> than<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.830> raffle<00:03:59.160> is<00:03:59.370> a

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
however other than this the raffle is a

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.040 
however other than this the raffle is a
very<00:03:59.880> practical<00:04:00.060> car<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.720> like<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:00.990> said

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
very practical car and like I said

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.050 
very practical car and like I said
earlier<00:04:01.530> it's<00:04:01.920> also<00:04:02.070> very<00:04:02.280> reliable<00:04:02.880> and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
earlier it's also very reliable and

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.770 
earlier it's also very reliable and
capable<00:04:03.840> as<00:04:04.530> well
