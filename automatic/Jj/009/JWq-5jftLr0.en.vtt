00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.790
 Hello everyone from youtube I come to bring 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.880
 in a video of how to repair a plate 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.720
 a motherboard or motherboard that is 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.309
 damaged or burnt that does not emit a video and 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.860
 well the most normal thing is that you can get 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.680
 to make memory the modules of 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.820
 boot are dirty as much as the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.080
 ram memory like the modules me when 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.000
 I see them that they are about to pass a 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.640
 gomita and clean them 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.610
 and can also make it reach 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.930
 of the processor that is not burned or 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.760
 the pins of the socket that is cheating 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.610
 when a plate does not emit the child 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.360
 it can be really some condenser 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.340
 that is swollen or burst 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.490
 or also that you have some rne module 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.280
 with a burned one you can also 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.080
 get to be from some burn that 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.930
 there was behind the paid some ago 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.460
 broken track but what happened to me 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.129
 It was recently that this plate 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.680
 I found it lying and so good 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.330
 we provide modern and well understood 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.420
 perfectly but it did not emit or videos 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.860
 neither by the integrated graphics nor by sides 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.410
 implement now 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.370
 then I say good took the ran and 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.340
 I looked 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.560
 Pythagoras removed the ran and whistled 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.390
 but when I'm going to put it national to 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.490
 ascend ventilated sold everything well 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.000
 but I did not broadcast video and I realized 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.000
 That was from 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.150
 of this 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.760
 dissipator of this power is what from 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.729
 here I took it out that takes away very easy 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.570
 remove with pliers remove the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.830
 two skewers this if you want to do it 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.770
 then do not take this away 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.710
 until I finished I had burned I took it with 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.520
 a dryer because we do not have to leave him 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.440
 for five minutes wagging do not leave 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.700
 that I send in the same place for a while 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.030
 have we are seeing it in the drying 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.310
 google when it's hot we touch it 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.200
 a little hot we leave it three 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.729
 minutes I know that another one gets good 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.060
 and another five minutes giving him the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.700
 dryer 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.200
 then we throw thermal paste not beige 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.760
 without thermal paste because it burns 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.040
 faster than a processor so what 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.080
 we take a little bit of technical 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.130
 we put it after talking to the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.569
 dryer and try and see as if 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.550
 it works I tried in many ways 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.160
 resetting the bio with the battery with the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.709
 jumper changing in the ramen module 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.450
 changing the source and everything but not 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.310
 I knew he was not burning because if 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.210
 a plate whistles when removed 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.400
 means that 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.440
 that was fine that should what fails 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.250
 on the other hand I changed the losers and 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.530
 nothing remains the same then I saw in a forum 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.050
 what could I do about this I said good 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.960
 for trying nothing happens then what 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.170
 I did and it worked for me right now I do not have 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.240
 I have it disassembled I can not prove the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.710
 but what can be said that the fence the 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.720
 go to revive the dead because that 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.700
 I found myself throw in a dumpster and 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.750
 this plate some to port all all 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.770
 the series of interest or that 775 endured 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.220
 all the processors from the 21 4 to the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.950
 which intercooler col ecuador and then 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.280
 good endured four days of ram 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.099
 of the module and then it is already 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.209
 you know that if the computer fails 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.269
 it can be ram modules 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.610
 capacitor plate or capacitor 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.209
 from here that many people say I strip 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.340
 because it has no arrangement but by telling 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.000
 that can also be from here 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.629
 and it was good I took the quick one off 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.970
 so the memory was puffing then we say 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.519
 it's sad it's all here and it was repaired as 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.890
 a laptop also say or that although 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.069
 you put additional graphics and 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.319
 have broken this we do not band have to 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.260
 have this also fixed although not 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:09.489
 I'm using one of here good guys 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.680
 I hope that I have served you and that I have 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.040
 liked life and subscribe to the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.040
 next
