kind of pretty much infinitely

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.690 
kind of pretty much infinitely
adjustable<00:02:33.050> I've<00:02:33.890> not<00:02:34.160> really<00:02:34.370> done<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.610> up

adjustable I've not really done it up

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.160 
adjustable I've not really done it up
too<00:02:34.910> much<00:02:35.060> yet<00:02:35.300> because<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.600> wanted<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.990> show

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
you in the video and then this arm is

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.000 
you in the video and then this arm is
all<00:02:40.760> adjustable<00:02:41.300> as<00:02:41.420> well<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.900> with<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.860> arm

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
all adjustable as well so with the arm

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.680 
all adjustable as well so with the arm
you<00:02:43.220> can<00:02:43.340> obviously<00:02:43.670> move<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.030> about<00:02:44.330> get<00:02:44.600> it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
you can obviously move it about get it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.540 
you can obviously move it about get it
in<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.900> right<00:02:45.080> position<00:02:45.290> then<00:02:46.100> once<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:46.460> get

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
in the right position then once you get

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.830 
in the right position then once you get
it<00:02:46.670> into<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.000> right<00:02:47.120> position<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.750> you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
it into the right position that you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.050 
it into the right position that you
think<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.260> need<00:02:48.440> this<00:02:49.250> end<00:02:49.520> can

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
think that you need this end can

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.220 
think that you need this end can
actually<00:02:50.390> be<00:02:50.570> tilted<00:02:51.110> as<00:02:51.710> well<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:53.990> can<00:02:54.110> be

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
actually be tilted as well and it can be

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.200 
actually be tilted as well and it can be
tilted<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.830> mean<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.400> can<00:02:55.520> bend<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.850> all<00:02:56.000> round

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
tilted I mean you can bend it all round

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.140 
tilted I mean you can bend it all round
up<00:02:56.690> down<00:02:57.140> left<00:02:57.410> right<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.980> then<00:02:58.820> once<00:02:59.000> you

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
up down left right and then once you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.360 
up down left right and then once you
find<00:02:59.390> your<00:02:59.750> kind<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.290> like<00:03:00.470> optimal<00:03:00.950> position

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
find your kind of like optimal position

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.280 
find your kind of like optimal position
you<00:03:01.490> can<00:03:01.610> go<00:03:01.730> around<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.150> start<00:03:02.480> doing<00:03:02.750> all

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
you can go around and start doing all

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.440 
you can go around and start doing all
the<00:03:03.440> little<00:03:03.530> bits<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.040> bobs<00:03:04.190> up<00:03:04.450> because

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
the little bits and bobs up because

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.820 
the little bits and bobs up because
allen<00:03:05.780> keys<00:03:05.960> and<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.170> can<00:03:06.200> make<00:03:06.410> sure<00:03:06.440> it's

time but it does come with two sets of

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.520 
time but it does come with two sets of
screws<00:03:52.700> you<00:03:53.450> get<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:53.630> short<00:03:53.840> set<00:03:54.140> of<00:03:54.260> screws

which fits our monitor fine and then you

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.830 
which fits our monitor fine and then you
get<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.280> long<00:03:58.550> set<00:03:58.820> of<00:03:58.940> screws<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.450> idea<00:03:59.750> is

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
get a long set of screws and the idea is

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.710 
get a long set of screws and the idea is
with<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.110> long<00:04:00.290> set<00:04:00.590> of<00:04:00.620> screws<00:04:01.459> it<00:04:02.390> does<00:04:02.540> come

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
with the long set of screws it does come

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.690 
with the long set of screws it does come
with<00:04:02.840> these<00:04:02.930> offsets<00:04:03.380> as<00:04:03.620> well<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:04.160> what

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
with these offsets as well and what

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.000 
with these offsets as well and what
happens<00:04:05.030> if<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:05.330> you<00:04:05.480> can't<00:04:05.780> get<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.800> base

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
happens if it you can't get the the base

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.699 
happens if it you can't get the the base
flat<00:04:07.400> like<00:04:07.640> mine<00:04:07.820> it's<00:04:08.300> catching<00:04:08.630> on<00:04:08.989> the

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
flat like mine it's catching on the

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.940 
flat like mine it's catching on the
corners<00:04:10.190> what<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.090> have<00:04:11.270> to<00:04:11.420> do<00:04:11.600> is<00:04:12.440> put<00:04:12.770> the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
corners what you have to do is put the

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.720 
corners what you have to do is put the
offsets<00:04:13.910> in<00:04:14.570> place<00:04:15.110> and<00:04:15.470> then<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:16.340> use<00:04:16.549> the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
offsets in place and then you use the

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.180 
offsets in place and then you use the
long<00:04:16.940> screws<00:04:17.359> instead<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:18.590> bolt<00:04:18.859> it<00:04:18.980> on

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
long screws instead and you bolt it on

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.050 
long screws instead and you bolt it on
or<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.720> bolt<00:04:20.960> it<00:04:21.109> on<00:04:21.289> so<00:04:21.620> that<00:04:21.890> it<00:04:22.100> stands<00:04:22.640> away

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
or you bolt it on so that it stands away

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.820 
or you bolt it on so that it stands away
from<00:04:23.720> your<00:04:23.900> monitor

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
from your monitor

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.110 
from your monitor
so<00:04:25.009> it's<00:04:25.159> pretty<00:04:25.280> good<00:04:25.490> that<00:04:25.639> they<00:04:25.729> thought<00:04:25.940> of

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
so it's pretty good that they thought of

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.149 
so it's pretty good that they thought of
that<00:04:26.270> so<00:04:26.900> what<00:04:27.110> I'm<00:04:27.169> gonna<00:04:27.259> have<00:04:27.409> to<00:04:27.440> do<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:27.830> I'm

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:28.159 
that so what I'm gonna have to do is I'm

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.010 
that so what I'm gonna have to do is I'm
going<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.370> have<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.520> use<00:04:28.639> these<00:04:28.819> ones<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.240> I'm

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
going to have to use these ones and I'm

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.779 
going to have to use these ones and I'm
going<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.650> get<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:30.830> all<00:04:30.949> fitted<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.580> then<00:04:31.699> I

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
going to get it all fitted and then I

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.020 
going to get it all fitted and then I
will<00:04:31.970> be<00:04:32.090> back<00:04:32.330> when<00:04:32.810> I've<00:04:32.960> done<00:04:33.139> it<00:04:33.199> right

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
will be back when I've done it right

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.879 
will be back when I've done it right
okay<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.090> I've<00:04:35.300> got<00:04:35.449> it<00:04:35.479> semi<00:04:35.900> kind<00:04:36.229> of<00:04:36.379> mounted

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
okay so I've got it semi kind of mounted

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.240 
okay so I've got it semi kind of mounted
we've<00:04:37.879> still<00:04:38.180> got<00:04:38.419> the<00:04:38.599> UM<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.590> wetsuit<00:04:40.009> stuff

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
we've still got the UM the wetsuit stuff

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.379 
we've still got the UM the wetsuit stuff
on<00:04:40.400> here<00:04:40.520> now<00:04:40.669> I've<00:04:40.759> done<00:04:40.909> this<00:04:41.030> so<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.210> doesn't

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
on here now I've done this so it doesn't

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.790 
on here now I've done this so it doesn't
mark<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.870> top<00:04:42.050> of<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.229> desk<00:04:42.440> because<00:04:42.650> this

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
mark the top of the desk because this

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.200 
mark the top of the desk because this
isn't<00:04:42.979> going<00:04:43.159> to<00:04:43.280> be<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.520> final<00:04:43.879> place<00:04:44.060> that

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
isn't going to be the final place that

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.520 
isn't going to be the final place that
it<00:04:44.300> wants<00:04:44.539> to<00:04:44.569> live<00:04:44.840> so<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.050> don't<00:04:45.289> want<00:04:45.470> to

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
it wants to live so I don't want to

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.010 
it wants to live so I don't want to
clamp<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.520> all<00:04:46.669> up<00:04:46.849> settings<00:04:47.270> any<00:04:47.449> marks<00:04:47.810> in<00:04:47.990> it

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
clamp it all up settings any marks in it

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.869 
clamp it all up settings any marks in it
which<00:04:48.259> it<00:04:48.409> might<00:04:48.650> do<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.190> probably<00:04:49.310> will<00:04:49.669> do

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879 
which it might do and probably will do

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.629 
which it might do and probably will do
because<00:04:50.210> underneath<00:04:50.629> this<00:04:50.900> it<00:04:51.830> is<00:04:51.979> still<00:04:52.159> a

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
because underneath this it is still a

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.279 
because underneath this it is still a
lump<00:04:53.180> of<00:04:53.389> metal<00:04:53.539> and<00:04:53.960> there's<00:04:54.080> going<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.229> be

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
lump of metal and there's going to be

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.600 
lump of metal and there's going to be
quite<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.590> bit<00:04:54.800> of<00:04:54.889> force<00:04:55.099> especially<00:04:55.370> if

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
quite a bit of force especially if

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.980 
quite a bit of force especially if
you've<00:04:55.699> got<00:04:55.729> a<00:04:55.849> big<00:04:56.030> heavy<00:04:56.240> monitor<00:04:56.720> like<00:04:56.840> this

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
you've got a big heavy monitor like this

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.209 
you've got a big heavy monitor like this
so<00:04:57.110> just<00:04:57.319> consider<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:57.830> we're<00:04:58.069> going<00:04:58.159> to

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:58.219 
so just consider that we're going to

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:01.320 
so just consider that we're going to
move<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.490> about<00:04:58.729> a<00:04:58.759> bit<00:04:59.110> it<00:05:00.110> does<00:05:00.379> come<00:05:00.680> with

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
move it about a bit it does come with

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.659 
move it about a bit it does come with
rubber<00:05:02.330> pads<00:05:03.550> which<00:05:04.550> I<00:05:04.819> have<00:05:05.240> used<00:05:05.659> but<00:05:06.669> again

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
rubber pads which I have used but again

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.399 
rubber pads which I have used but again
I<00:05:07.879> just<00:05:07.909> didn't<00:05:08.300> want<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.449> risk<00:05:08.599> it<00:05:08.780> now<00:05:08.990> we

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
I just didn't want to risk it now we

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.029 
I just didn't want to risk it now we
move<00:05:09.620> up<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:10.039> the<00:05:10.159> monitor<00:05:10.690> itself<00:05:11.690> so<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.979> can

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
move up to the monitor itself so you can

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.219 
move up to the monitor itself so you can
see<00:05:13.310> we've<00:05:13.520> got<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.669> little<00:05:13.969> thumb<00:05:14.780> screw<00:05:15.080> and

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
see we've got a little thumb screw and

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.469 
see we've got a little thumb screw and
the<00:05:15.289> idea<00:05:15.560> with<00:05:15.680> that<00:05:15.770> thumb<00:05:15.979> screw<00:05:16.219> is<00:05:16.479> that

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
the idea with that thumb screw is that

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.689 
the idea with that thumb screw is that
we<00:05:17.599> can<00:05:17.780> stop<00:05:18.590> it<00:05:18.740> from<00:05:18.770> being<00:05:19.099> able<00:05:19.219> to<00:05:19.400> rotate

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
we can stop it from being able to rotate

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.930 
we can stop it from being able to rotate
which<00:05:20.449> is<00:05:20.659> one<00:05:21.409> and<00:05:21.620> there's<00:05:21.800> another<00:05:21.889> one<00:05:22.250> if

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
which is one and there's another one if

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.899 
which is one and there's another one if
I<00:05:23.030> move<00:05:23.210> this<00:05:23.360> around<00:05:23.539> because<00:05:24.169> it's<00:05:24.319> all<00:05:24.440> very

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
I move this around because it's all very

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.659 
I move this around because it's all very
movable<00:05:26.680> there's<00:05:27.680> another<00:05:27.860> one<00:05:28.099> round<00:05:28.280> here

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
movable there's another one round here

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.490 
movable there's another one round here
and<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.449> reason<00:05:29.750> why<00:05:29.840> you've<00:05:29.990> got<00:05:30.139> one<00:05:30.289> round

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
and the reason why you've got one round

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.980 
and the reason why you've got one round
here<00:05:30.770> is<00:05:30.919> because<00:05:31.069> you<00:05:31.279> can<00:05:31.400> actually<00:05:31.669> adjust

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
here is because you can actually adjust

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.740 
here is because you can actually adjust
how<00:05:32.990> much<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.529> monitor<00:05:34.419> pitches<00:05:35.419> and<00:05:35.569> moves

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
how much the monitor pitches and moves

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.120 
how much the monitor pitches and moves
as<00:05:36.020> well<00:05:36.050> so<00:05:36.349> if<00:05:36.409> we<00:05:36.500> do<00:05:36.620> it<00:05:36.740> so<00:05:36.860> that<00:05:36.979> you<00:05:37.009> can

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
as well so if we do it so that you can

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.680 
as well so if we do it so that you can
see<00:05:37.340> it<00:05:38.830> that<00:05:39.830> means<00:05:40.009> we<00:05:40.190> can<00:05:40.599> tilt<00:05:41.599> the

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
see it that means we can tilt the

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.269 
see it that means we can tilt the
monitor<00:05:42.199> backwards<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:42.770> forwards<00:05:43.130> you<00:05:43.159> can

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
monitor backwards and forwards you can

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.459 
monitor backwards and forwards you can
actually<00:05:43.639> rotate<00:05:43.819> it<00:05:44.240> as<00:05:44.419> well<00:05:44.630> so<00:05:45.289> there's<00:05:45.409> a

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:45.469 
actually rotate it as well so there's a

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:47.050 
actually rotate it as well so there's a
lot<00:05:45.590> of<00:05:45.620> movement<00:05:45.860> there<00:05:46.250> but<00:05:46.550> you<00:05:46.669> have<00:05:46.789> to<00:05:46.940> go

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
lot of movement there but you have to go

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.149 
lot of movement there but you have to go
around<00:05:47.120> and<00:05:47.419> do<00:05:47.779> the<00:05:48.020> old<00:05:48.229> screws<00:05:48.590> up<00:05:48.770> really

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
around and do the old screws up really

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.670 
around and do the old screws up really
tight<00:05:49.370> that<00:05:50.090> will<00:05:50.240> do<00:05:50.360> you<00:05:50.479> well<00:05:50.659> but<00:05:51.440> there<00:05:51.560> is

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
tight that will do you well but there is

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.959 
tight that will do you well but there is
like<00:05:52.009> I<00:05:52.130> said<00:05:52.340> there's<00:05:52.520> a<00:05:52.580> fair<00:05:52.759> bit<00:05:52.940> of

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
like I said there's a fair bit of

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.659 
like I said there's a fair bit of
movement<00:05:53.509> there<00:05:54.159> I'm<00:05:55.159> trying<00:05:55.370> to<00:05:55.430> do<00:05:55.520> this

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
movement there I'm trying to do this

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.469 
movement there I'm trying to do this
with<00:05:55.909> a<00:05:57.490> it's<00:05:58.490> a<00:05:58.580> bit<00:05:58.729> difficult<00:05:58.940> with<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.360> way

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
with a it's a bit difficult with the way

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.409 
with a it's a bit difficult with the way
I've<00:05:59.599> got<00:05:59.750> it<00:05:59.889> mounted<00:06:01.029> but<00:06:02.029> there's<00:06:02.210> a<00:06:02.270> very

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
I've got it mounted but there's a very

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.360 
I've got it mounted but there's a very
old<00:06:02.599> bit<00:06:02.779> of<00:06:02.900> movement<00:06:03.080> so<00:06:03.860> you've<00:06:04.009> got<00:06:04.159> plenty

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
old bit of movement so you've got plenty

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.019 
old bit of movement so you've got plenty
of<00:06:04.580> options<00:06:04.759> it<00:06:05.389> comes<00:06:05.629> with<00:06:05.810> two<00:06:06.110> sets<00:06:06.409> of<00:06:06.710> oh

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:07.029 
of options it comes with two sets of oh

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:09.430 
of options it comes with two sets of oh
there<00:06:08.029> we<00:06:08.120> go<00:06:08.150> it<00:06:08.750> comes<00:06:08.900> with<00:06:09.169> two<00:06:09.409> different

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
there we go it comes with two different

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.740 
there we go it comes with two different
thickness<00:06:10.430> sets<00:06:10.669> of<00:06:10.849> screws<00:06:11.120> as<00:06:11.300> well<00:06:11.449> it<00:06:11.690> does

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
thickness sets of screws as well it does

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.080 
thickness sets of screws as well it does
look<00:06:12.139> a<00:06:12.229> bit<00:06:12.259> wonky<00:06:12.560> but<00:06:12.889> it's<00:06:13.009> not<00:06:13.250> just

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
look a bit wonky but it's not just

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.200 
look a bit wonky but it's not just
because<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:14.509> monitors<00:06:14.870> not<00:06:15.080> quite<00:06:15.319> straight

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
because the monitors not quite straight

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.950 
because the monitors not quite straight
but<00:06:17.210> what<00:06:17.360> you<00:06:17.419> need<00:06:17.569> to<00:06:17.659> do<00:06:17.779> one<00:06:17.930> thing

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
but what you need to do one thing

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.209 
but what you need to do one thing
otherwise<00:06:18.229> when<00:06:18.560> you<00:06:18.590> fit<00:06:18.800> in<00:06:18.919> it<00:06:19.039> you're

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:19.219 
otherwise when you fit in it you're

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:20.469 
otherwise when you fit in it you're
probably<00:06:19.370> going<00:06:19.669> to<00:06:19.729> need<00:06:19.849> to<00:06:19.909> get<00:06:20.210> someone<00:06:20.449> to

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
probably going to need to get someone to

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.570 
probably going to need to get someone to
give<00:06:20.659> you<00:06:20.750> a<00:06:20.810> hand<00:06:21.110> and<00:06:21.289> then<00:06:21.979> once<00:06:22.190> you<00:06:22.340> get<00:06:22.490> it

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
give you a hand and then once you get it

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.200 
give you a hand and then once you get it
all<00:06:22.610> set<00:06:23.120> up<00:06:23.150> and<00:06:23.479> ready<00:06:25.000> you're<00:06:26.000> probably

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
all set up and ready you're probably

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.689 
all set up and ready you're probably
going<00:06:26.599> to<00:06:26.690> where<00:06:27.069> maybe<00:06:28.069> you<00:06:28.250> want<00:06:28.370> to<00:06:28.400> take<00:06:28.580> it

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
going to where maybe you want to take it

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.309 
going to where maybe you want to take it
apart<00:06:28.789> and<00:06:29.090> do<00:06:29.210> things<00:06:29.479> up<00:06:29.659> and<00:06:29.840> get<00:06:30.050> it<00:06:30.169> kind

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 
apart and do things up and get it kind

apart and do things up and get it kind
of<00:06:30.440> like<00:06:30.620> semi<00:06:30.919> in<00:06:31.069> the<00:06:31.159> right<00:06:31.340> sort<00:06:31.610> of<00:06:31.639> place

then go around the nipple the screws and
everything<00:06:33.320> up<00:06:33.680> but<00:06:34.399> I<00:06:34.460> definitely<00:06:34.820> would
