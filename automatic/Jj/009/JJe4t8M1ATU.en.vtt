cool<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.549> was<00:01:37.700> really<00:01:38.000> weak<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.510> only<00:01:38.659> took

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
cool it was really weak and it only took

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.950 
cool it was really weak and it only took
like<00:01:39.020> one<00:01:39.500> or<00:01:39.619> two<00:01:39.650> seconds<00:01:40.220> um<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.750> just

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
like one or two seconds um so it just

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.780 
like one or two seconds um so it just
what's<00:01:42.260> that<00:01:42.320> instantly<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.189> what's<00:01:43.610> quite

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
what's that instantly so what's quite

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.149 
what's that instantly so what's quite
good<00:01:44.030> but<00:01:44.420> yeah<00:01:45.049> using<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.560> target<00:01:45.860> phone<00:01:46.040> is

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
good but yeah using the target phone is

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.370 
good but yeah using the target phone is
pretty<00:01:46.400> good<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.760> I<00:01:47.030> think<00:01:47.170> playing<00:01:48.170> team

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
pretty good and I think playing team

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.520 
pretty good and I think playing team
deathmatch<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.040> very<00:01:49.520> bad<00:01:50.000> decision

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
deathmatch is a very bad decision

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.929 
deathmatch is a very bad decision
because<00:01:51.530> in<00:01:51.680> team<00:01:51.860> deathmatch<00:01:51.979> it's<00:01:52.549> just<00:01:52.759> so

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
because in team deathmatch it's just so

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.719 
because in team deathmatch it's just so
slow<00:01:53.299> paced<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:54.380> don't<00:01:54.590> get<00:01:54.770> many<00:01:54.830> kills<00:01:55.369> so

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
slow paced you don't get many kills so

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.960 
slow paced you don't get many kills so
I'd<00:01:56.000> suggest<00:01:56.479> you<00:01:56.840> playing<00:01:57.229> free-for-all<00:01:57.970> if

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
I'd suggest you playing free-for-all if

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.280 
I'd suggest you playing free-for-all if
you're<00:01:59.119> not<00:01:59.210> good<00:01:59.420> at<00:01:59.450> free<00:01:59.810> for<00:02:00.049> all<00:02:00.110> you

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
you're not good at free for all you

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.320 
you're not good at free for all you
should<00:02:00.470> play<00:02:00.710> something<00:02:01.100> else<00:02:01.369> then<00:02:02.119> team

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
should play something else then team

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.870 
should play something else then team
deathmatch<00:02:02.810> maybe<00:02:03.079> kill<00:02:03.619> confront<00:02:04.130> because<00:02:04.640> a

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
deathmatch maybe kill confront because a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.810

lot of people get UAVs very often

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.150 
lot of people get UAVs very often

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
because you're able to get scorestreaks

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.860 
because you're able to get scorestreaks
a<00:02:10.340> lot<00:02:10.489> easier<00:02:10.729> because<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.329> text<00:02:11.750> and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
a lot easier because of the text and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.830 
a lot easier because of the text and
kill<00:02:12.200> confirmed<00:02:12.380> so<00:02:13.060> when<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.150> UAVs<00:02:14.540> on<00:02:14.750> you

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
kill confirmed so when the UAVs on you

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.830 
kill confirmed so when the UAVs on you
get<00:02:15.019> more<00:02:15.230> kills<00:02:15.530> but<00:02:16.370> yeah<00:02:17.150> for<00:02:17.390> me<00:02:17.510> it's<00:02:17.660> just

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
get more kills but yeah for me it's just

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.050 
get more kills but yeah for me it's just
free<00:02:18.440> fall<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.829> play<00:02:19.220> free<00:02:19.489> for<00:02:19.670> all<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.880> most

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
free fall I play free for all the most

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.229 
free fall I play free for all the most
because<00:02:20.900> for<00:02:21.170> me<00:02:21.350> in<00:02:21.530> my<00:02:21.560> opinion<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.280> really

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
because for me in my opinion it's really

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.140 
because for me in my opinion it's really
the<00:02:23.810> most<00:02:24.350> fast-paced<00:02:25.220> game<00:02:25.549> out<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.910> game

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
the most fast-paced game out in the game

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.750 
the most fast-paced game out in the game
of<00:02:26.360> course<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:26.780> ground<00:02:27.110> war<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:27.760> yeah

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
of course that's ground war but yeah

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.879 
of course that's ground war but yeah
it's<00:02:29.630> kind<00:02:29.840> of<00:02:29.900> laggy<00:02:30.079> and<00:02:30.320> ground<00:02:30.620> what<00:02:30.829> I

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:30.889 
it's kind of laggy and ground what I

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:31.809 
it's kind of laggy and ground what I
don't<00:02:31.100> want<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.340> mess

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
don't want to mess

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.470 
don't want to mess
but<00:02:31.909> grandma<00:02:32.299> ground<00:02:32.870> war<00:02:33.170> too<00:02:33.680> much<00:02:34.099> but<00:02:34.519> yeah

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
but grandma ground war too much but yeah

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.629 
but grandma ground war too much but yeah
when<00:02:35.659> we're<00:02:35.780> talking<00:02:35.959> about<00:02:36.549> when<00:02:37.549> we're

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
when we're talking about when we're

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.309 
when we're talking about when we're
talking<00:02:37.760> about<00:02:37.969> team<00:02:38.299> deathmatch<00:02:38.719> being<00:02:39.049> slow

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
talking about team deathmatch being slow

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.589 
talking about team deathmatch being slow
paced<00:02:40.540> I've<00:02:41.540> recently<00:02:42.019> read<00:02:42.469> on<00:02:42.709> twitter<00:02:42.889> that

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
paced I've recently read on twitter that

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.910 
paced I've recently read on twitter that
David<00:02:44.599> Vonda<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.019> think<00:02:45.260> he<00:02:45.349> tweeted<00:02:45.709> something

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
David Vonda I think he tweeted something

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.750 
David Vonda I think he tweeted something
like<00:02:46.280> when<00:02:47.030> he's<00:02:47.209> going<00:02:47.659> to<00:02:47.930> get<00:02:48.760> 300,000

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
like when he's going to get 300,000

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.679 
like when he's going to get 300,000
followers<00:02:49.909> on<00:02:50.359> Twitter<00:02:51.189> he<00:02:52.189> will<00:02:52.400> maybe<00:02:53.359> he's

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
followers on Twitter he will maybe he's

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.849 
followers on Twitter he will maybe he's
thinking<00:02:53.870> about<00:02:54.200> doing<00:02:54.650> team<00:02:55.519> deathmatch<00:02:56.859> 125

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
thinking about doing team deathmatch 125

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.369 
thinking about doing team deathmatch 125
so<00:02:58.069> if<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.340> don't<00:02:58.519> know<00:02:58.609> what<00:02:58.760> TDM<00:02:59.180> 125<00:02:59.930> is<00:03:00.139> it

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
so if you don't know what TDM 125 is it

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.089 
so if you don't know what TDM 125 is it
means<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.099> get<00:03:01.540> 125<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:03.049> scores<00:03:03.799> the

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
means that you get 125 and scores the

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.300 
means that you get 125 and scores the
score<00:03:04.700> streak<00:03:05.150> points<00:03:05.750> per<00:03:06.169> kill<00:03:06.439> so<00:03:06.950> instead

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
score streak points per kill so instead

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.089 
score streak points per kill so instead
of<00:03:07.370> getting<00:03:07.579> 100<00:03:08.299> points<00:03:08.599> you<00:03:08.689> get<00:03:08.780> 125<00:03:09.590> points

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
of getting 100 points you get 125 points

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.360 
of getting 100 points you get 125 points
and<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.969> would<00:03:11.209> make<00:03:11.389> you<00:03:11.739> get<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:13.010> score

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
and that would make you get the score

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.619 
and that would make you get the score
streaks<00:03:13.699> a<00:03:13.849> lot<00:03:14.209> quicker<00:03:14.599> so<00:03:15.409> if<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:16.299> if<00:03:17.299> you

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
streaks a lot quicker so if you if you

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.080 
streaks a lot quicker so if you if you
for<00:03:18.139> example<00:03:18.169> kill<00:03:18.709> someone<00:03:19.069> M<00:03:19.280> near<00:03:20.060> a

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
for example kill someone M near a

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.229 
for example kill someone M near a
domination<00:03:20.810> flag<00:03:21.169> you<00:03:21.409> get<00:03:21.669> 125<00:03:22.669> points<00:03:23.000> I

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
domination flag you get 125 points I

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.059 
domination flag you get 125 points I
think<00:03:23.510> because<00:03:23.989> he<00:03:24.019> was<00:03:24.230> neither<00:03:24.409> flag<00:03:24.739> so<00:03:24.980> you

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
think because he was neither flag so you

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.379 
think because he was neither flag so you
get<00:03:25.219> some<00:03:25.250> bonus<00:03:25.579> but<00:03:25.909> in<00:03:26.030> team<00:03:26.239> deathmatch

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
get some bonus but in team deathmatch

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.479 
get some bonus but in team deathmatch
you<00:03:26.719> don't<00:03:26.930> have<00:03:27.079> any<00:03:27.290> bonuses<00:03:27.859> and<00:03:28.310> it's

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
you don't have any bonuses and it's

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.369 
you don't have any bonuses and it's
basically<00:03:28.939> just<00:03:29.090> like<00:03:29.329> bare<00:03:29.659> bones<00:03:29.959> because

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
basically just like bare bones because

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.319 
basically just like bare bones because
you<00:03:30.739> have<00:03:30.949> to<00:03:31.129> you<00:03:31.370> have<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.549> get<00:03:31.760> five<00:03:32.030> kills

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
you have to you have to get five kills

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.449 
you have to you have to get five kills
to<00:03:32.480> get<00:03:32.599> you<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:33.409> get<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.560> UAV<00:03:33.829> without<00:03:34.219> hard

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
to get you to get a UAV without hard

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.490 
to get you to get a UAV without hard
line<00:03:34.669> of<00:03:34.819> course<00:03:35.030> but<00:03:35.180> still<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:36.199> have<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.349> get

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
line of course but still you have to get

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.409 
line of course but still you have to get
five<00:03:36.680> kills<00:03:37.040> so<00:03:37.250> that's<00:03:37.489> basically<00:03:37.669> a

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
five kills so that's basically a

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.710 
five kills so that's basically a
predator<00:03:39.109> and<00:03:39.199> mw2<00:03:39.680> that's<00:03:40.069> just<00:03:40.250> ridiculous

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
predator and mw2 that's just ridiculous

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.210 
predator and mw2 that's just ridiculous
so<00:03:41.720> it's<00:03:42.019> just<00:03:42.199> like<00:03:42.319> bare<00:03:42.590> bones<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:43.040> bare

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
so it's just like bare bones and bare

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.890 
so it's just like bare bones and bare
bones<00:03:43.430> wasn't<00:03:43.849> that<00:03:44.000> popular<00:03:44.209> in<00:03:44.569> black<00:03:44.750> ops

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
bones wasn't that popular in black ops

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.839 
bones wasn't that popular in black ops
want<00:03:45.199> to<00:03:45.290> be<00:03:45.409> perfectly<00:03:45.829> honest<00:03:46.129> not<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.609> lot<00:03:46.819> of

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
want to be perfectly honest not a lot of

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.219 
want to be perfectly honest not a lot of
people<00:03:46.970> played<00:03:47.509> it<00:03:48.129> so<00:03:49.389> yeah<00:03:50.389> I'd<00:03:50.629> say<00:03:50.659> that

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
people played it so yeah I'd say that

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.399 
people played it so yeah I'd say that
it's<00:03:52.099> a<00:03:52.250> pretty<00:03:52.400> good<00:03:52.579> idea<00:03:52.639> to<00:03:52.939> do<00:03:53.090> TDM<00:03:53.629> 125

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
it's a pretty good idea to do TDM 125

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.610 
it's a pretty good idea to do TDM 125
and<00:03:54.970> maybe<00:03:55.970> it<00:03:56.090> was<00:03:56.209> just<00:03:56.239> a<00:03:56.540> joke<00:03:56.569> but<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.439> was

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
and maybe it was just a joke but it was

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.369 
and maybe it was just a joke but it was
April<00:03:58.129> second<00:03:58.639> so<00:03:58.909> I<00:03:59.239> don't<00:03:59.419> really<00:03:59.599> get<00:04:00.319> it

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
April second so I don't really get it

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.469 
April second so I don't really get it
because<00:04:00.859> if<00:04:00.979> you<00:04:01.040> do<00:04:01.159> an<00:04:01.220> April<00:04:01.310> Fool's<00:04:02.150> joke

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
because if you do an April Fool's joke

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.099 
because if you do an April Fool's joke
you<00:04:03.169> probably<00:04:03.650> would<00:04:04.430> do<00:04:04.639> it<00:04:04.669> on<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.120> April

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
you probably would do it on the April

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.059 
you probably would do it on the April

haven't mentioned that it's a pretty

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.260 
haven't mentioned that it's a pretty
decent<00:04:27.710> gameplay<00:04:28.039> in<00:04:28.159> my<00:04:28.250> opinion<00:04:28.580> the

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
decent gameplay in my opinion the

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.969 
decent gameplay in my opinion the
killstreak<00:04:29.659> at<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.870> beginning<00:04:30.199> was<00:04:30.349> just<00:04:30.620> so

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
killstreak at the beginning was just so

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.760 
killstreak at the beginning was just so
so<00:04:31.610> awesome<00:04:31.969> but<00:04:32.150> at<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.719> end<00:04:32.750> i<00:04:32.900> just<00:04:33.139> failed

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
so awesome but at the end i just failed

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.010 
so awesome but at the end i just failed
it<00:04:35.080> but<00:04:36.080> yet<00:04:36.590> TDM<00:04:37.219> 125<00:04:37.849> it's<00:04:38.300> quite<00:04:38.509> good<00:04:38.750> and

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
it but yet TDM 125 it's quite good and

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.600 
it but yet TDM 125 it's quite good and
another<00:04:39.500> thing<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.860> wanted<00:04:39.889> to<00:04:40.159> mention<00:04:40.250> this

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
another thing I wanted to mention this

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.399 
another thing I wanted to mention this
the<00:04:40.789> new<00:04:40.909> DLC<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:41.779> think<00:04:42.199> it<00:04:42.260> has<00:04:42.349> been

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.409 
the new DLC I think it has been

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.580 
the new DLC I think it has been
announced<00:04:42.770> like<00:04:43.219> one<00:04:43.699> week<00:04:43.940> ago<00:04:44.150> but

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
announced like one week ago but

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.190 
announced like one week ago but
I<00:04:45.650> just<00:04:46.190> find<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.730> a<00:04:46.970> lot<00:04:47.600> of<00:04:47.750> people<00:04:47.930> are

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
I just find it a lot of people are

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.260 
I just find it a lot of people are
already<00:04:48.410> skeptic<00:04:49.190> about<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.640> even<00:04:49.850> though<00:04:50.090> it

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
already skeptic about it even though it

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.930 
already skeptic about it even though it
hasn't<00:04:50.510> been<00:04:50.840> released<00:04:51.170> yet<00:04:51.590> it's<00:04:52.280> ridiculous

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
hasn't been released yet it's ridiculous

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.780 
hasn't been released yet it's ridiculous
like<00:04:53.240> many<00:04:53.510> people<00:04:53.720> say<00:04:54.400> magma<00:04:55.400> in<00:04:55.490> the<00:04:55.550> middle

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
like many people say magma in the middle

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.950 
like many people say magma in the middle
of<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:55.970> map<00:04:56.150> is<00:04:56.360> there<00:04:56.630> going<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.900> be

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
of the map is there going to be

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.670 
of the map is there going to be
interesting<00:04:57.650> and<00:04:59.080> vertigo<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.230> think<00:05:00.500> what's

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
interesting and vertigo I think what's

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.890 
interesting and vertigo I think what's
the<00:05:00.800> math<00:05:00.920> on<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.130> skyscraper<00:05:01.700> like<00:05:02.510> a<00:05:02.690> lot<00:05:02.810> of

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
the math on the skyscraper like a lot of

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.140 
the math on the skyscraper like a lot of
people<00:05:03.080> sent<00:05:03.380> me<00:05:03.680> another<00:05:04.340> map<00:05:04.700> where<00:05:04.910> you<00:05:04.970> can

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
people sent me another map where you can

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.720 
people sent me another map where you can
fall<00:05:05.390> off<00:05:05.420> just<00:05:05.990> ridiculous<00:05:06.710> I<00:05:06.860> like<00:05:07.040> like
