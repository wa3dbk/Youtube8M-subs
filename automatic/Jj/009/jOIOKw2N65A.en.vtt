 But I would like to take the 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.790
 doubt to believe face many people 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.330

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.600

 fuck I'm going to buy the ps4 bought the 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.989
 ps4 at the end of the year and I'm scared 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.650
 Dude, I want to see what happens if 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.690

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.610
 It happens that she will break will do

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.950
 turn it goes from there it will catch fire sim cara 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.960
 many people asked me that then 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.390
 I was not going to make a video does not exist 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.600
 more to ask questions of these people and 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.220
 also a possible doubt is a 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.979
 curiosity of others 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.450
 I'm going to make this video here precisely 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:28.370
 testing with you 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.700
 So it's okay, we're here with the 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.460
 playstation 4 on this side and here we 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.330
 we have the tv Neitiznot focus on TV for you 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:43.340
 see the smallest of the ps4 window then 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:46.409
 how to do the following let's get 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.369
 we see that there is a game any O 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.270
 Manchester and three in case a game 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.530
 it's obviously not ps3 and we'll see what 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.810
 happens when we put him in the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:07.259
 console is already without any games then 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.179
 Let's see, let's see what happens. 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.849
 It will load if there is going to be an error. 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.510
 Something appears, let's see, let's go. 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:20.329
 check now notice that you draw 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.310
 is running there and disk incompatible with 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:26.870
 interesting then at least it shows there 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.450
 An error has shown that I'm going to try 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.690
 click on it to see what happens to know 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.739
 coming down giving will not 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.099
 We're going to stay black, it's not there, it's not 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.220
 possible to play discs in the 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:46.709
 ps3 is a focus on icann 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.440
 so you see that they do not have the title 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.859
 the league there is not a problem you try 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.209
 to put a playstation 3 new disk 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:03:00.000
 ps 4 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:02.760
 but he gives this error there ' he did not 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.010
 I have none and many people ifaw 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.310
 Our lady, I 'm afraid to try. 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:12.030
 will put that escapes my console there is every 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.609
 a monster curiosity that you then 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.349
 they see that it does not have any type it does not have 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.239
 no problem 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.760
 no, I think it's really possible 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.799
 Now let's do the following many 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.470
 People also asked about 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.530
 game that has remastered province with 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.280
 four kind the director fans 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:36.239
 So let's do a test with a game. 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.010
 which has been remastered be it the version 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.450
 of playstation 3 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.930
 many people have asked me too 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.930
 so it's hard to say 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.340
 with the advance we have it all 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.729
 in these 14 we will also see if it goes 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.389
 read will not recognize the same error 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:04:04.199
 and then what happens is walls running 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:06.930
 it is already the same then game that has 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:12.720
 also used it is not possible to change 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:17.820
 neither is it possible 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.820
 ps3 is that there is no danger 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.949
 so linked and put it is obvious that the 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.169
 sony would put a system of 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.930
 security was not going to catch fire on the 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:31.229
 game you're curious to put 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.509
 a playstation 3 disc on ps 4 now 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.320
 I will not risk putting a disk 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:40.919
 305 can not put there and goes 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.720
 appear on disk does not work says 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.100
 that xbox 360 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.800
 type works does not say that the 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.400
 Competition I do not know what happens 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.590
