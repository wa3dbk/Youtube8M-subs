00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.889 

all<00:00:02.610> right<00:00:02.760> so<00:00:03.240> let's<00:00:03.419> say<00:00:03.570> you've<00:00:03.720> got

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
all right so let's say you've got

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.110 
all right so let's say you've got
somebody<00:00:04.259> with<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.560> really<00:00:05.220> nasty<00:00:05.430> metabolic

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
somebody with a really nasty metabolic

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.059 
somebody with a really nasty metabolic
acidosis<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.410> decide<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:07.770> you're

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
acidosis and you decide that you're

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.560 
acidosis and you decide that you're
going<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.280> treat<00:00:08.580> them<00:00:08.820> with<00:00:09.059> some<00:00:09.300> sodium

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
going to treat them with some sodium

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.230 
going to treat them with some sodium
bicarbonate<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.980> somebody<00:00:11.460> gets<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.820> genius

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
bicarbonate and somebody gets the genius

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.209 
bicarbonate and somebody gets the genius
idea<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.780> let's<00:00:12.990> just<00:00:13.230> push<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.769> bicarb

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
idea that let's just push the bicarb

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.670 
idea that let's just push the bicarb
point<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:15.150> question<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.750> if<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.080> push<00:00:16.320> sodium

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
point the question is if you push sodium

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.800 
point the question is if you push sodium
bicarbonate<00:00:17.369> does<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.150> work<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.510> how<00:00:18.570> long

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
bicarbonate does it work and how long

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.529 
bicarbonate does it work and how long
does<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.140> work<00:00:19.320> let's<00:00:20.160> take<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.340> step<00:00:20.520> back<00:00:20.580> so

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
does it work let's take a step back so

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.960 
does it work let's take a step back so

and<00:01:12.350> for<00:01:13.350> example<00:01:13.530> someone<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:14.070> DKA<00:01:14.430> you've

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and for example someone with DKA you've

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.830 
and for example someone with DKA you've
intubated<00:01:15.240> them<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.450> got<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> Fayette

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
intubated them they got a Fayette

intubated them they got a Fayette
metabolic<00:01:16.200> acidosis<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:17.130> somebody<00:01:17.430> gets<00:01:17.550> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
metabolic acidosis if somebody gets a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
metabolic acidosis if somebody gets a
bright<00:01:17.850> idea<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.180> pushing<00:01:18.360> bicarbonate<00:01:19.050> on

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
bright idea of pushing bicarbonate on

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.499 
bright idea of pushing bicarbonate on
them<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.190> will<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.550> is<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.300> they

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
them what you will see is because they

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.240 
them what you will see is because they
all<00:01:21.690> have<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.930> fixed<00:01:22.350> type<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> volume<00:01:23.070> you're

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
all have a fixed type of volume you're

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
you what will happen is when you push

and<00:02:00.149> expired<00:02:00.599> carbon<00:02:01.080> dioxide<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.459> patient

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
and expired carbon dioxide the patient

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.690 
and expired carbon dioxide the patient
had<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.910> pH<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.300> 6.9<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.500> some<00:02:04.649> change<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
had a pH of 6.9 and some change so the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.850 
had a pH of 6.9 and some change so the
ER<00:02:06.060> team<00:02:06.270> decided<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.840> start<00:02:07.080> them<00:02:07.440> on<00:02:07.649> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
ER team decided to start them on a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.669 
ER team decided to start them on a
bicarb<00:02:08.369> drip<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.690> usually<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.140> case<00:02:10.289> there

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
bicarb drip as is usually the case there

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.860 
bicarb drip as is usually the case there
was<00:02:10.770> no<00:02:10.920> space<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> ICU<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.390> ICU<00:02:12.720> team

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
was no space in the ICU so the ICU team

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.020 
was no space in the ICU so the ICU team
came<00:02:13.170> down<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.590> began<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.430> take<00:02:14.580> over<00:02:14.790> his

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
came down and began to take over his

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.390 
came down and began to take over his
care<00:02:15.360> they<00:02:16.290> felt<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.680> because<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.220> pH

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
care they felt that because of the pH

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.430 
care they felt that because of the pH
that<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:18.060> would<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.540> better<00:02:18.720> if<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> patient

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
that it would be better if the patient

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.430 
that it would be better if the patient
received<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.489> sodium<00:02:21.060> bicarb<00:02:21.450> as<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.720> bolus<00:02:22.290> so

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
received the sodium bicarb as a bolus so

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.920 
received the sodium bicarb as a bolus so
recommended<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.250> bicarb<00:02:24.209> bolus<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.630> for<00:02:24.810> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
recommended to bicarb bolus is for the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.550 
recommended to bicarb bolus is for the
patient<00:02:26.569> what<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.690> can<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:28.020> here<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.410> what

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
patient what you can see here is what

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.400 
patient what you can see here is what
happens<00:02:28.980> when<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.280> bicarb<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.880> pushed<00:02:30.410> you

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
happens when the bicarb is pushed you

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.530 
happens when the bicarb is pushed you
can<00:02:31.560> see<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.830> end<00:02:31.950> tidal<00:02:32.160> co2<00:02:32.430> rise<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.390> can

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
can see the end tidal co2 rise you can

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.910 
can see the end tidal co2 rise you can
see<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.750> quantitative<00:02:34.349> level<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.890> right

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
see the quantitative level on the right

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.680 
see the quantitative level on the right
as<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.520> numbers<00:02:35.849> go<00:02:35.970> up<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.480> see<00:02:36.569> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
as the numbers go up you can see the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.510 
as the numbers go up you can see the
waveform<00:02:36.870> increased<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.280> looks<00:02:38.459> like

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
waveform increased and it looks like

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.100 
waveform increased and it looks like
you've<00:02:38.730> solved<00:02:39.060> your<00:02:39.150> problem<00:02:39.629> you've<00:02:39.780> given

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
you've solved your problem you've given

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.559 
you've solved your problem you've given
the<00:02:40.260> bicarb<00:02:41.040> neutralized<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.940> hydrogen<00:02:42.420> your

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
the bicarb neutralized the hydrogen your

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.240 
the bicarb neutralized the hydrogen your
exhale<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.050> carbon<00:02:43.349> dioxide<00:02:43.410> everything

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
exhale on the carbon dioxide everything

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.729 
exhale on the carbon dioxide everything
looks<00:02:44.430> perfect<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.690> for<00:02:46.140> about<00:02:46.410> a

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
looks perfect and it is for about a

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.699 
looks perfect and it is for about a
couple<00:02:47.610> seconds<00:02:47.970> because<00:02:48.300> if<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:49.110> watch<00:02:49.319> you

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
couple seconds because if you watch you

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.170 
couple seconds because if you watch you
can<00:02:49.770> see<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.069> goes<00:02:50.220> right<00:02:50.370> back<00:02:50.730> down<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
can see it goes right back down to the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.619 
can see it goes right back down to the
baseline<00:02:51.860> usually<00:02:52.860> lasts<00:02:53.069> about<00:02:53.220> 25<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.390> 30

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
baseline usually lasts about 25 to 30

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.869 
baseline usually lasts about 25 to 30
seconds<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.349> you<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.099> see<00:02:56.280> you're<00:02:56.489> pretty

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
seconds and you can see you're pretty

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.460 
seconds and you can see you're pretty
much<00:02:57.060> right<00:02:57.420> back<00:02:57.599> where<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.870> started<00:02:57.989> from

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
much right back where you started from

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.220 
much right back where you started from
so<00:02:59.220> although<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.580> neutralize<00:03:00.360> some<00:03:00.780> hydrogen

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
so although you neutralize some hydrogen

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.930 
so although you neutralize some hydrogen
ion<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.800> really<00:03:02.040> didn't<00:03:02.220> get<00:03:02.280> any<00:03:02.340> sustained

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
ion you really didn't get any sustained

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.220 
ion you really didn't get any sustained
effect<00:03:03.299> at<00:03:03.719> all<00:03:04.819> not<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:05.969> be<00:03:06.060> dissuaded<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.870> was

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
effect at all not to be dissuaded it was

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.870 
effect at all not to be dissuaded it was
decided<00:03:07.859> that<00:03:07.890> it

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
decided that it

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.360 
decided that it
wasn't<00:03:09.270> that<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:10.530> problem<00:03:10.890> was<00:03:11.010> with<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
wasn't that the problem was with the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.920 
wasn't that the problem was with the
bike<00:03:11.580> are<00:03:11.790> being<00:03:11.970> pushed<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.510> was<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:12.810> there

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
bike are being pushed it was that there

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.540 
bike are being pushed it was that there
wasn't<00:03:13.110> enough<00:03:13.500> bike<00:03:13.710> are<00:03:13.920> pushed<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.520> a

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
wasn't enough bike are pushed so a

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.450 
wasn't enough bike are pushed so a
second<00:03:15.030> amp<00:03:15.180> was<00:03:15.330> given<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.100> again<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.310> can

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
second amp was given and again you can

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.270 
second amp was given and again you can
see<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.660> waveform<00:03:19.080> demonstrates<00:03:20.010> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
see that the waveform demonstrates the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.120 
see that the waveform demonstrates the
carbon<00:03:20.700> dioxide<00:03:21.150> being<00:03:21.930> exhaled<00:03:22.410> meaning

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
carbon dioxide being exhaled meaning

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.950 
carbon dioxide being exhaled meaning
that<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.430> hydrogen<00:03:23.940> ions<00:03:24.210> being<00:03:24.450> neutralized

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
that the hydrogen ions being neutralized

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.520 
that the hydrogen ions being neutralized
their<00:03:25.620> pH<00:03:26.010> must<00:03:26.400> be<00:03:26.580> changing<00:03:27.140> except<00:03:28.140> for<00:03:28.320> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
their pH must be changing except for the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.840 
their pH must be changing except for the
fact<00:03:28.740> that<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:29.040> does<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.340> same<00:03:29.490> thing<00:03:29.550> again

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
fact that it does the same thing again

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.000 
fact that it does the same thing again
it<00:03:30.360> drops<00:03:30.630> right<00:03:30.750> back<00:03:31.140> down<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.650> baseline

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
it drops right back down to the baseline

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.190 
it drops right back down to the baseline
so<00:03:32.880> if<00:03:32.970> you're<00:03:33.090> going<00:03:33.270> to<00:03:33.480> push<00:03:33.750> sodium

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
so if you're going to push sodium

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.480 
so if you're going to push sodium
bicarbonate<00:03:34.860> you'll<00:03:35.040> get<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.250> wonderful

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
bicarbonate you'll get a wonderful

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.700 
bicarbonate you'll get a wonderful
response<00:03:36.030> but<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.050> only<00:03:37.170> going<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.500> last

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
response but it's only going to last

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.100 
response but it's only going to last
about<00:03:37.950> 25<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.790> 30<00:03:39.000> seconds<00:03:39.540> which<00:03:39.810> really

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
about 25 to 30 seconds which really

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.790 
about 25 to 30 seconds which really
doesn't<00:03:40.440> do<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> patient<00:03:41.010> much<00:03:41.160> good<00:03:42.800> that's

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
doesn't do the patient much good that's

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.340 
doesn't do the patient much good that's
why<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.010> better<00:03:44.310> way<00:03:44.460> to<00:03:44.490> treat<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.240> to

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
why the better way to treat it is to

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.590 
why the better way to treat it is to
show<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.410> bicarbonate<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.280> you'll<00:03:48.030> get<00:03:48.390> a

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
show you bicarbonate and you'll get a

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.390 
show you bicarbonate and you'll get a
nice<00:03:48.930> sustained<00:03:49.380> release<00:03:49.710> as<00:03:50.010> opposed<00:03:50.340> to

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
nice sustained release as opposed to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.460 
nice sustained release as opposed to
that<00:03:50.550> big<00:03:50.820> peak<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.630> goes<00:03:51.840> away<00:03:52.080> just<00:03:52.110> as

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
that big peak and goes away just as

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.680 
that big peak and goes away just as
quickly<00:03:52.740> when<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:53.130> push<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.520> as<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.640> bolus<00:03:54.060> and

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
quickly when you push it as a bolus and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.230 
quickly when you push it as a bolus and
that's<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.020> guys
