you have to strain it to get all the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.040 
you have to strain it to get all the
impurities<00:00:20.760> out<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.420> from<00:00:21.600> where<00:00:21.840> you've

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
parts of the cheese you can order on the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.840 
parts of the cheese you can order on the
internet<00:00:33.210> generally<00:00:33.739> you'll<00:00:34.739> need<00:00:35.010> rennet

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
internet generally you'll need rennet

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.330 
internet generally you'll need rennet
which<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> coagulator<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.920> you'll<00:00:38.160> need

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
which is the coagulator and you'll need

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.459 
which is the coagulator and you'll need
the<00:00:38.550> bacteria<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.450> their<00:00:39.600> specific<00:00:40.140> sort<00:00:40.379> of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the bacteria for their specific sort of

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.250 
the bacteria for their specific sort of
cheese<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> since<00:00:41.910> I'm<00:00:42.059> making<00:00:42.239> chef<00:00:42.690> here

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
cheese and since I'm making chef here

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.020 
cheese and since I'm making chef here
which<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> fresh<00:00:44.210> cheese<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.770> just<00:00:46.770> use<00:00:47.039> one

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
which is a fresh cheese I just use one

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.650 
which is a fresh cheese I just use one
certain<00:00:49.010> bacteria<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.579> makes<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.090> fabulous

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
certain bacteria it makes this fabulous

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.630 
certain bacteria it makes this fabulous
cheese<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.320> adds<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:52.949> bit<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.160> taste<00:00:53.430> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
cheese and adds a little bit of taste to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.979 
cheese and adds a little bit of taste to
it<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:55.430> do<00:00:56.430> always<00:00:56.760> pasteurize<00:00:57.510> my<00:00:57.719> milk

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it I do always pasteurize my milk

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.229 
it I do always pasteurize my milk
because<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.469> Arkansas<00:00:58.920> there's<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> law<00:00:59.460> that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
because in Arkansas there's a law that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.900 
because in Arkansas there's a law that
says<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.690> cheese<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.199> not<00:01:01.350> aged<00:01:01.920> 90<00:01:02.670> days

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
says if your cheese is not aged 90 days

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.030 
says if your cheese is not aged 90 days
then<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> pasteurize<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:04.830> milk

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
then you have to pasteurize your milk

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.609 
then you have to pasteurize your milk
and<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.150> I'm<00:01:06.299> always<00:01:06.479> pasteurizing<00:01:07.140> my<00:01:07.350> milk

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and so I'm always pasteurizing my milk

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.200 
and so I'm always pasteurizing my milk
before<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.920> make<00:01:08.130> my<00:01:08.159> cheese<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> very<00:01:09.000> easy

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
before I make my cheese it's a very easy

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.450 
before I make my cheese it's a very easy
process<00:01:09.540> too<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:11.270> all<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.450> really<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.990> is

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
process too and all you really do is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.090 
process too and all you really do is
pasteurized<00:01:14.460> your<00:01:14.939> cheese<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.860> chef

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
pasteurized your cheese then the chef

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.030 
pasteurized your cheese then the chef
takes<00:01:17.460> three<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.850> four<00:01:18.060> days<00:01:18.270> generally<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.350> day

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
takes three to four days generally a day

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.550 
takes three to four days generally a day
of<00:01:20.369> draining<00:01:20.880> after<00:01:21.360> you've<00:01:21.540> mixed<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.439> your

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
of draining after you've mixed in your

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
of draining after you've mixed in your
bacteria<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.430> rennet<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.060> leave<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
bacteria in your rennet you leave it to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.950 
bacteria in your rennet you leave it to
sit<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.810> 24<00:01:25.380> hours<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:27.720> next

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
sit for 24 hours and then the next

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.710 
sit for 24 hours and then the next
process<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.650> molding<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> cheese<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.939> scoop

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
process is molding the cheese you scoop

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.330 
process is molding the cheese you scoop
it<00:01:30.840> out<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.170> slotted<00:01:31.470> spoon<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.040> fill<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
it out with a slotted spoon and fill it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.210 
it out with a slotted spoon and fill it
fill<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> little<00:01:32.909> molds<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.500> next<00:01:34.740> day<00:01:34.920> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
fill the little molds up the next day it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.359 
fill the little molds up the next day it
drains<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.630> next<00:01:36.900> day<00:01:37.049> after<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.890> take

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
drains the next day after that you take

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.069 
drains the next day after that you take
the<00:01:38.670> cheese<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.270> flip<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
the cheese out and you flip it in the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.410 
the cheese out and you flip it in the
mold<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> very<00:01:41.250> uniform<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.240> both

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
mold so it is a very uniform on both

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.590 
mold so it is a very uniform on both
sides<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.070> next<00:01:44.369> day<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:45.090> comes<00:01:45.360> out<00:01:45.509> of

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
sides and the next day it comes out of

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.319 
sides and the next day it comes out of
the<00:01:45.659> molds<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.079> gets<00:01:46.290> salted<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.939> salt

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the molds and gets salted and the salt

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.480 
the molds and gets salted and the salt
the<00:01:48.869> salting<00:01:49.259> process<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.960> actually

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
the salting process and it actually

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.460 
the salting process and it actually
inhibits<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.820> growth<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.090> bacteria<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
inhibits the growth of bacteria on the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.770 
inhibits the growth of bacteria on the
outside<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.070> cheese<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:57.090> also<00:01:57.240> adds<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
outside of the cheese it also adds to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.709 
outside of the cheese it also adds to
the<00:01:57.869> taste<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.700> third<00:01:59.909> thing<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.210> does<00:02:00.390> is

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the taste and the third thing it does is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.410 
the taste and the third thing it does is
it<00:02:01.170> helps<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.159> dry<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.090> rest<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
it helps to dry out the rest of the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.810 
it helps to dry out the rest of the
moisture<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> cheese<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.670> so<00:02:05.670> it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
moisture out of the cheese and so it
