 since I show you a dollar on the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.050

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.239
 then hardware side the list a little 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.770
 not long because I show you four 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.420
 patterns so I used a base a top 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.940
 coat a pastel blue nail polish 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.129
 hungry green varnish a white and a 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.140
 black of the brown acrylic paint a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.480
 fine brush a shooting tools a cure 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.770
 tooth and a palette 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.270
 I start as always by applying 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.610
 my base to protect my fingernail from 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.290
 vernet pigment I then apply a 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.730
 pastel blue polish in two layers here 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.230
 the ice varnish that I got all 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.550
 recently on my iphone i will put you 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.780
 all product references that 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.030
 I used in this video we bar 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.350
 info I take a brush 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.640
 dish with solvent for good 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.110
 clean but outlines and I leave 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.110
 to dry my polish 5 to 10 minutes 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.570
 we go now we are there I 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.950
 shows you the first reason they are 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.630
 little blackness so these are 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.369
 kinds of little balls of am alive 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.049
 still that I'm going to take a black polish 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.100
 that I'm going to put on a pallet and to 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.450
 using the back of a brush while 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.060
 just I'll come tap for 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.409
 to make small black masses 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.820
 I then take my brush end I 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.409
 will make very small lines 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.330
 patting with the tip of the brush 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:39.140
 all around the little masses I have 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:40.460
 created earlier I then take a 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.959
 white polish and using a toothpick 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.610
 I'm going to make two weights 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.020
 average on every point road and a 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.729
 once they're dry I'm going to add a 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.159
 little black dot in the center for 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.750
 do the eyes I show you now 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.850
 the little white bull so I'm going 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.649
 start with white oval 1/2 outline on 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.209
 the end of my fingernail that using 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.950
 a fine brush I will come to draw 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.929
 both ears a little bit pointed 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.459
 while it's dry I'm going to realize the 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.080
 leaf that serves as wolf umbrellas 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.520
 I start by tracing the stem 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.259
 drawing a fine line 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.090
 I will then paint the sheet in 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.270
 heart shape that will end up a 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.250
 tip well elongated 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.810
 I add a pastel green line 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.910
 in the center of my sheet to add a 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.230
 touch of light 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.030
 I now go to the eyes I start 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.990
 by making two black dots once 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.670
 what they are is I'm going to add 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.620
 two white dots slightly smaller 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.990
 and I end up with two tiny dots 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.340
 blacks in the center 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.900
 we now go to bulls and as 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.520
 for the previous character I start 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.980
 by making a half oval with a 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.510
 gray varnish I then take a brush 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.010
 end I start by tracing two 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.660
 small notches at the base of the ears 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.040
 and I will then realized both 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.070
 almond shaped ears leaving 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.720
 the little notch of departure for the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.520
 eyes I start to place white pea 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.960
 quite apart as he knows I'm going 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.460
 take the opportunity to make the muzzle that is 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.290
 quite flat with a little point towards 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.940
 the bottom I then place two small 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.560
 black dots in the center of the eyes with a 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.760
 toothpick 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.770
 I paint then the belly well rounded 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.150
 with the brush of a white varnish and if 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.560
 you trace is not perfect or 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.690
 could take it back with a brush 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.430
 end I then added a little bit of 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.580
 matter on the sides of my downside for 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.080
 do the arms with the fine brush 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.730
 I always have traces and mustaches 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.290
 of montoro so I will work with 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.330
 the tip of the brush to trace the 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.010
 the finest lines possible for 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.570
 finish I added small dots 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.740
 of gray on the belly of the bull in 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.510
 doing kinds of accents 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.120
 circumflexes always with the tip of the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.770
 brush without crushing we already go to 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.910
 last reason which is the simplest that 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.590
 a little leaf and I'm going to start 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.970
 by tracing the rod with my painting 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.980
 brown acrylic of you can use 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.390
 a varnish if you do not have one and 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.100
 then I will take the green varnish 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.810
 and I will trace the two leaves in 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.959
 almond shape that leaves from the end 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.250
 of the stem 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.690
 I finish as usual by applying 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.130
 a good layer of top coat to make 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.750
 shine and keep my elhardt more 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.709
 a long time and for this kind of reasons I 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.270
 really advise you to put 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.890
 a lot of top coat is really there 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.360
 tapping went off the 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.050
 matter otherwise you will drool 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.050
 your motive 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.459
