00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 i 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.230
 m 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.090
 hello girls how good to tell you 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.880
 also in this video it's good because I'm going 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.830
 dressed just like in another that I will upload 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.810
 previously I imagine that if you see me 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.430
 with worse quality than us videos or 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.349
 it is because I am using the camera 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.180
 my sister that is of a quality a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.070
 little bit inferior to mine because mine 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.320
 is broken then while not the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.899
 arrange or do not have another one because that's what 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.670
 touch I'm sorry so nothing to tell you that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.570
 lips today I wear the fashion boom lic 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.570
 in the green &amp; tone 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.010
 and I'm going to show you my top five my top 5 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.480
 of orange labials I only have five the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.940
 truth is that they are the ones that I have I do not have 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.770
 more because it is a color that good not me 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.720
 feel bad but no more favor and csi 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.239
 more then I do not have too many 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.820
 The gloss was included, it's worth 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.070
 top five so it's just lipsticks 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.030
 they are all of different brands very 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.190
 different 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.170
 step to teach you for example the first one is 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.170
 the serious tone 200 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.220
 this one here 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.750
 which is of the shepherd brand 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.490
 I bought it in mercadona 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.490
 and it's an orange tone 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.670
 covers very well has a smell like fruits 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.440
 the truth and it is neither very creamy nor very 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.360
 dry has a pretty good texture the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.560
 lifetime 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.560
 it's this orange here 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.840
 it is very good to me this one of the oranges 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.340
 that what is my favorite 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.750
 and then I also have the tone of fashion 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.750
 see number 14 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.020
 that is also an orange 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.890
 orange is worth this is a tad more 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.890
 clarito maybe 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.930
 and you can see it 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.079
 afterwards I have also chosen the coraline 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.079
 1909 of wet and white 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.540
 that is good, people say it's a 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.200
 red but I on my lips that the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.600
 orange to be seen between orange and red 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.400
 it is clear but I do not know to me it throws me more to 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.140
 orange that to red but good this already 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.210
 you know it depends 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.950
 is this one here next to the other two 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.790
 maybe and it looks more red but to me in 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.790
 my lips are left 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.549
 I have chosen the ix of the romo lipsic 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.070
 the 550 indian pink which is a tone that 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.680
 I like it a lot because it seems like a 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.680
 sexy is an orange like with sparkles 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.709
 lovely this feels great 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.599
 and finally I have chosen this I will devour you 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:27.140
 he dazzled that on one hand dye and on the other 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:30.880
 balsam side this is the tone rose 02 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.880
 is without a marker as I say 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.909
 it's a tone to see is not orange orange 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:41.140
 but yes that shoots orange mine it seems 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.420
 so good this up 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.950
 written between brown and pink do not 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.220
 he intoned a little weird like that 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.730
 but well maybe the most orange ones are 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.129
 and the one of astor the one of fashion and the one of mix 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.640
 Okay, well, well, you have a little bit 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.640
 more variety 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.410
 and nothing about the price tell you that 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.030
 Deborah's I have no idea because I 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.520
 come a little box I do not know where 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.350
 you can buy those from wet and wild I think 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.150
 that cost three euros or a little thing like that 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.130
 you can find them on machinery and not 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.130
 I know if in some other website I guess 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.250
 that remains the same in exquisite 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.500
 those of nix in any web page stang 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.170
 They sell it at all, make yourself knicks on 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.990
 the own page of mix in machinery 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.730
 they also sell on other pages I suppose 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.969
 the others can also find them 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.800
 in makeup and there on the fashion page 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.409
 and they cost 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.580
 one euro 50 I think two euros very free 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:38.259
 those of the ix also 250 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.939
 and the expense I suppose you can 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.229
 to find in perfumeries, as I say 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:43.629
 I found the market in the settlement 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.789
 to three euros but I do not know how much it costs 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:48.070
 originally and well I guess what 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.020
 will sell for the perfumeries 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.730
 and nothing else I hope you liked the 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.620
 video that you will have the pics in my 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.620
