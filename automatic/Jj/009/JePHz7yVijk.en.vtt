00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
oak bark mixture the hides are then

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.870 
oak bark mixture the hides are then
placed<00:03:27.730> into<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.180> stronger<00:03:28.630> solution<00:03:29.730> how<00:03:30.730> many

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
placed into a stronger solution how many

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.210 
placed into a stronger solution how many
highs<00:03:31.060> go<00:03:31.390> into<00:03:31.570> one<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.870> these<00:03:31.930> pits<00:03:32.260> we<00:03:33.040> can

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
highs go into one of these pits we can

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.130 
highs go into one of these pits we can
put<00:03:33.370> 80<00:03:33.580> into<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.030> pit<00:03:34.240> so<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:34.840> must<00:03:34.960> be<00:03:35.050> quite

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
put 80 into the pit so it must be quite

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.840 
put 80 into the pit so it must be quite
deep<00:03:35.380> there<00:03:35.740> of<00:03:35.860> good<00:03:36.130> six<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.460> six<00:03:36.610> these

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
deep there of good six of six these

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.410 
deep there of good six of six these
right<00:03:37.540> but<00:03:38.280> you'll<00:03:39.280> be<00:03:39.520> alright<00:03:39.850> falling<00:03:40.240> into

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
right but you'll be alright falling into

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
right but you'll be alright falling into
this<00:03:40.510> one<00:03:40.660> because<00:03:40.810> there's<00:03:40.960> quite<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.320> lot<00:03:41.410> of

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
this one because there's quite a lot of

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.570 
this one because there's quite a lot of
leather<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:41.770> there<00:03:41.860> already<00:03:42.100> so<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.430> won't

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
leather in there already so you won't

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.030 
leather in there already so you won't
get<00:03:42.670> to<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.850> bottom<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:44.590> then<00:03:44.740> we're<00:03:44.860> going

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
get to the bottom and then we're going

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.800 
get to the bottom and then we're going
to<00:03:45.070> dust<00:03:45.700> it<00:03:45.910> in<00:03:46.030> as<00:03:46.150> we<00:03:46.270> call<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:46.660> we're

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
to dust it in as we call it so we're

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.090 
to dust it in as we call it so we're
going<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:46.960> take<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:47.170> couple<00:03:47.440> handfuls<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.860> buck

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
going to take a couple handfuls a buck

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.320 
going to take a couple handfuls a buck
each<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:49.450> just<00:03:50.080> spread<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:50.920> around<00:03:51.210> what<00:03:52.210> does

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
each and just spread it around what does

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.840 
each and just spread it around what does
what<00:03:52.750> does<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.960> Bob<00:03:53.140> do<00:03:53.410> right<00:03:53.920> well<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.370> tan

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
what does the Bob do right well the tan

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.370 
what does the Bob do right well the tan
in<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.150> bark<00:03:55.390> is<00:03:55.570> getting<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:55.870> soak<00:03:56.080> out<00:03:56.260> of

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
in the bark is getting a soak out of

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.500 
in the bark is getting a soak out of
that<00:03:56.500> bark<00:03:56.740> and<00:03:56.980> gradually<00:03:57.760> feed<00:03:58.090> into<00:03:58.450> the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
that bark and gradually feed into the

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.180 
that bark and gradually feed into the
tan<00:03:58.750> liquor<00:03:58.990> so<00:03:59.110> it<00:03:59.200> keeps<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.590> strength<00:04:00.100> of

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
tan liquor so it keeps the strength of

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.250 
tan liquor so it keeps the strength of
the<00:04:00.250> tan<00:04:00.460> liquor<00:04:00.730> up<00:04:00.880> rose<00:04:01.480> actually<00:04:01.840> the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
the tan liquor up rose actually the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.720 
the tan liquor up rose actually the
tannic<00:04:02.560> is<00:04:02.650> getting<00:04:02.920> weaker<00:04:03.220> because<00:04:03.520> the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
tannic is getting weaker because the

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.910 
tannic is getting weaker because the
hides<00:04:03.940> are<00:04:04.240> absorbing<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.870> right<00:04:05.470> so<00:04:05.620> this<00:04:05.800> is

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
hides are absorbing it right so this is

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.110 
hides are absorbing it right so this is
a<00:04:05.950> little<00:04:06.190> reserved<00:04:06.700> in<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.510> pit<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.970> they'll

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
a little reserved in the pit and they'll

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.850 
a little reserved in the pit and they'll
be<00:04:10.270> there<00:04:10.450> in<00:04:10.600> this<00:04:11.050> pit<00:04:11.290> for<00:04:11.500> nine<00:04:11.650> months

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
be there in this pit for nine months

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.200 
be there in this pit for nine months
they've<00:04:12.160> already<00:04:12.280> done<00:04:12.520> three<00:04:12.730> months<00:04:13.060> up

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
they've already done three months up

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.180 
they've already done three months up
till<00:04:13.390> now<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.230> whole<00:04:14.380> process<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:14.920> 12

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
till now so the whole process is 12

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.289 
till now so the whole process is 12
months<00:04:17.459> once<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.670> hides<00:04:18.910> have<00:04:19.150> been

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
months once the hides have been

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.140 
months once the hides have been
converted<00:04:19.660> into<00:04:20.049> leather<00:04:20.790> they're<00:04:21.790> ready<00:04:22.060> for

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
converted into leather they're ready for

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.600 
converted into leather they're ready for
the<00:04:22.360> final<00:04:22.870> stages<00:04:23.290> in<00:04:23.740> their<00:04:23.950> journey<00:04:24.310> from

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
the final stages in their journey from

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.680 
the final stages in their journey from
animal<00:04:25.090> skin<00:04:25.420> to<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.810> saleable<00:04:26.350> product<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:28.570> we

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
animal skin to a saleable product and we

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.400 
animal skin to a saleable product and we
went<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.230> put<00:04:29.410> some<00:04:29.650> fish<00:04:30.220> on<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:30.990> as<00:04:31.990> the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
went and put some fish on it as the

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.860 
went and put some fish on it as the
leather<00:04:32.860> starts<00:04:33.100> to<00:04:33.400> dry<00:04:33.610> out<00:04:33.640> yeah<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.720> oil

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
leather starts to dry out yeah the oil

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.350 
leather starts to dry out yeah the oil
will<00:04:34.990> go<00:04:35.200> into<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.590> grain<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.760> just<00:04:37.000> feed<00:04:37.210> it

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
will go into the grain and just feed it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.510 
will go into the grain and just feed it
so<00:04:37.540> it'll<00:04:37.690> be<00:04:37.780> nice<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:37.960> flexible<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:39.370> it

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
so it'll be nice and flexible and it
