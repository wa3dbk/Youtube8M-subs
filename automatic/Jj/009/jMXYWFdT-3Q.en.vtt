00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello friends welcome to the truth 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.140
 about fitness you want another 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.179
 Scam supplement is not in this video 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.219
 the role of fish in the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.440
 bodybuilding world of gyms 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.929
 we weigh alias chain amino acids 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.600
 branched represent a great interest 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.340
 for the supplement industry the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.830
 fish are part of the nine amino acids 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.320
 essentials and have side chains 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.789
 I am aware that the psa or garlic are 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.949
 used for many conditions 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.500
 medical but in this particular case 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.750
 I'm going to focus exclusively on the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.579
 aspect of which are amino acids 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.790
 muscle mass builders there are three 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.520
 Sometimes they are leucine isoleucine and valine 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.079
 the branched-chain amino acids 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.870
 also branched chain amino acids 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.149
 in English they are called bca de brancher 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.980
 chain amino assist refers to a type 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.379
 of amino acids that has a compound 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 aliphatic that are non-linear your name 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.640
 comes from this feature 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.399
 branched between them are the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.680
 leucine isoleucine and the vagina is treated 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.199
 of the most hydrophobic amino acids that 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.299
 they ingest through an adequate diet the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.720
 combination of these three amino acids is 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.910
 per se 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.740
 decomposes almost a third of the 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.750
 skeletal muscles in the body 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.630
 human and play a very role 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.520
 important in protein synthesis 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.990
 the branched-chain amino acids are 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.820
 frequently used in 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.010
 treatment of patients who have 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.960
 suffered burns as well as in the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.720
 athletes dietary supplements 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.640
 who practice bodybuilding the industry 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.190
 of everything that is physical exercise and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.260
 gyms itself really loves the psa and 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.810
 the main reason for this is that it 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.830
 says that you want are amino acids 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.200
 highly responsible for growth 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.150
 muscle that the body can not 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.250
 produce by itself and that has to 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.590
 receive from external sources such as 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.780
 food or in this case in particular to 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.369
 Through this pill or powder 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.110
 statement is very good and makes 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.110
 wonders in convincing people 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.119
 that they need to be bought after 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.100
 of everything the industry wants is 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.570
 make sure that you get your 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.880
 essential amino acids 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.250
 there is no doubt that the psa are useful 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.960
 but they are not magical beans that 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.190
 because the person consumes them 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.800
 will become men and women 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.470
 Muscled as companies announce 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.810
 but there is a very important fact that the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.850
 supplement industry omits if not what 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.280
 omit goodbye business in the sale should 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.290
 being is that you want are in what one 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.810
 would consider as regular foods 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.990
 like the meat the cheese the eggs 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.540
 Etc. 80 100 grams of beef 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.450
 of fish half a cup of cottage cheese 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.640
 contain about 1.7 grams of 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.100
 leucine a gram of isoleucine and a 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.080
 gram of balin to the truth is that if 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.060
 you are eating foods rich in 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.910
 proteins do not need to buy 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.010
 supplements should be these amino acids 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.989
 not only have a horrible taste but 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.370
 they are also expensive and require that 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.739
 consume large doses 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.019
 in fact the jars if they are in pills 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.209
 or if they are in powder they usually reach for 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.430
 about 15 days and the body would be 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.019
 absorbing the really a week or 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.150
 week and a half since not being 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.519
 natural the body takes it as a 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.460
 strange agent and then removes it 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.080
 we have the first doses 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.180
 wasted then why do 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.370
 that is already being provided to the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.320
 body a lot of bs to come from 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.750
 all the protein contained in a typical 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.220
 diet not to mention the fact that 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.530
 most addicts to the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.570
 supplements are already taking proteins 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.430
 of whey that also contain 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.470
 despite the industry of 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.260
 fitness is pretty 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.180
 smart they try to isolate everything 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.190
 what supposedly increases the mass 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.290
 muscle and sell it if you could 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.900
 they would be isolating and selling each 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.150
 amino acid separately that way 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.040
 you would be buying 10 supplements 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.810
 different achieving so the 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.150
 supplement distributors are 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.400
 made richer I want to make one 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.620
 quick question is supposed to be 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.510
 human has to consume every substance 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.390
 which contributes to the growth of the mass 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.400
 muscle separately then how 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.350
 people were doing to increase 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.080
 muscle mass before they existed 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.060
 You want them believe it or not bodybuilding 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.290
 it would be absolutely the same if the 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.170
 supplements should be not only those 99 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.950
 99 percent of all supplements 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.470
 disappear right now 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.540
 at this very moment the impact that 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.669
 they had to have and they will have these 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.530
 amino acids in bodybuilding or in the 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.139
 physical improvement of a person who 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.720
 feeds well equals 0 bodybuilders 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.000
 professionals did not use do not use 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.820
 nor will you use the ones you want to build 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.070
 his muscular physiques in fact I think that 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.050
 professional bodybuilders laugh at 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.720
 all those who buy or use 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.419
 you want them when you want them out 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.550
 first time in the 1980s the 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.560
 people were excited because they believed that 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.320
 by taking them they would have much more mass 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.030
 muscle however they were performed 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.530
 several investigations and there was no 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.729
 evidence that the fish 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.389
 will help improve performance 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.100
 sporting what a surprise not over 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.690
 everything there is no research that 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.790
 show that you need 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.770
 supplements you want if you 're already 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.990
 covering your protein needs 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.360
 with the surprising regular food 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.610
 true this would be a very study 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.040
 interesting about the no consumption bar 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.870
 bca consumption would be organized three 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.230
 groups of 30 people with ages 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.450
 Similar 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.870
 I would not exercise without any supplement 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.430
 only food group 2 would exercise with 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.160
 whey protein as 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.380
 Group 3 supplement would exercise 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.970
 with you want as a supplement all 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.460
 groups should do the same 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.530
 exercises follow the same ranges of 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.770
 repetitions and train the same number 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.270
 of days per week if the investigation 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.610
 prove that the people in group 3 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.140
 they took wished they were better 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.180
 I would be among the first to go to the 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.060
 store to buy such supplements 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.070
 but unfortunately and as expected 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.200
 there would not be a better answer than 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.940
 those who normally ate 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.950
 supplement companies do not 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.290
 would benefit from all the studies and 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.760
 they only show in their pages studies 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.950
 payments by themselves 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.320
 of having some study to prove 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.240
 that it is not necessary to consume amino acids 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.090
 like the one that they described the 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.350
 discredit and have immediately 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.780
 there many studies but it should be 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.730
 research enough to find them and 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.510
 that's because of so much money giving 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.760
 turns 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.160
 the studies abound as I said before 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.500
 but it's the payments by the companies of 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.960
 Conclusion supplements 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.140
 of supplements always present 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.130
 carefully prepare the information 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.430
 omitting the most important details 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.530
 of the studies as a result the people 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.180
 just look at the pictures of the ads in 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.280
 which are images of 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.620
 models that consume steroids and that 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.330
 are retouched with photoshop is true 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.490
 what are required for the 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.620
 muscle growth but most 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.840
 people do not need to take them in shape 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.700
 of supplements unless there is a 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.560
 physical condition would be where the 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.080
 person could not eat food 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.880
 solid and if that condition is already 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.860
 a medical condition that must be 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.050
 evaluated by professionals in the field 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.060
 of medicine to tell the truth most 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.190
 of bca buyers are 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.530
 adolescents depressed because of their condition 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.240
 physical or they believe in fairy tales and 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.460
 adults looking for a factor of 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.830
 extraordinary growth which not 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.080
 will happen to take despite the money that 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.060
 companies or sellers manage to do 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.010
 with the sale of their products always 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.040
 comes from the ignorant or naive 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.560
 because because the ignorant or 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.750
 naive people look for money from anywhere 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.580
 spend it on supplements besides that 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.259
 they are very motivated 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.629
 if we do which ones they use as 

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:37.669
 fuel and that takes them directly 

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:40.250
 towards the consumption of useless products 

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:42.590
 thanks for watching the video if you liked the 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.780
