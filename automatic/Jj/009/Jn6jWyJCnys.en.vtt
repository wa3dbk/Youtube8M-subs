new so the first thing I thought were

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.750

some they're basically you know how the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.200

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
gas shoots fire charges in the nether

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.020 
gas shoots fire charges in the nether
well<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> dragon<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.440> xbox<00:00:56.010> shoots<00:00:56.699> what

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
well the dragon on xbox shoots what

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.840 
well the dragon on xbox shoots what
looks<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.620> purple<00:00:58.620> colored<00:00:59.010> fire<00:00:59.309> charges

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700 
ender charges I don't know that's that
sounds<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.450> better<00:01:09.630> name<00:01:09.900> anyway<00:01:10.200> but

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
sounds like a better name anyway but

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.740 
sounds like a better name anyway but
yeah<00:01:11.310> they<00:01:11.640> shoot<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.090> he<00:01:12.180> shoots<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.540> out

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
yeah they shoot that he shoots that out

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
yeah they shoot that he shoots that out
and<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.409> hits<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:13.979> from<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.280> distance

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and when it hits you up from a distance

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.249 
and when it hits you up from a distance
it<00:01:14.790> seems<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> does<00:01:15.450> two<00:01:15.689> damage<00:01:16.080> two

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
it seems like it does two damage two

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.980 
it seems like it does two damage two
hearts<00:01:16.530> worth<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.770> damage<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.900> really<00:01:18.900> up

hearts worth of damage and really up

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.899 
hearts worth of damage and really up

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
close I can do as much as four hearts

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.690 
close I can do as much as four hearts
damage<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.590> kind<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.979> cool<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.400> didn't

damage and it was kind of cool I didn't
really<00:01:23.909> expect<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.750> pink<00:01:25.229> fire<00:01:25.530> charge

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
coming out of the dragon so I was really

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.090 
coming out of the dragon so I was really
cool<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.540> see<00:01:27.570> an<00:01:27.780> attack<00:01:28.049> like<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.619> then

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
cool to see an attack like that and then

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
cool to see an attack like that and then
the<00:01:29.220> other<00:01:29.250> tag<00:01:29.759> which<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.090> knew<00:01:30.540> about<00:01:30.659> we

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the other tag which we knew about we

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.390 
the other tag which we knew about we
didn't<00:01:31.200> know<00:01:31.290> any<00:01:31.439> characteristics<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
didn't know any characteristics of it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.550 
didn't know any characteristics of it
was<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> ender<00:01:33.360> acid<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> dragon's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
was the ender acid or the dragon's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.080 
was the ender acid or the dragon's
breath<00:01:34.740> heads<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.250> guess<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> game<00:01:35.729> calls<00:01:36.000> it

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
breath heads I guess the game calls it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.520 
breath heads I guess the game calls it
when<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.270> die<00:01:36.420> they<00:01:36.659> say<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.960> get<00:01:37.140> slain<00:01:37.409> by

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
when you die they say you get slain by

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.469 
when you die they say you get slain by
the<00:01:37.560> dragon's<00:01:38.009> breath<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.180> ender

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the dragon's breath but it's the ender

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.749 
the dragon's breath but it's the ender
acid<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.799> anytime<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.579> hit<00:01:41.729> with

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
acid and that anytime you get hit with

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.999 
acid and that anytime you get hit with
it<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.180> get<00:01:42.780> anytime<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.590> take<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> hit

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
it I get anytime you can take a hit

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.760 
it I get anytime you can take a hit
damage<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.939> takes<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.479> hit<00:01:45.750> heart<00:01:46.110> away<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.530> if

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
damage it takes one hit heart away so if

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.590 
damage it takes one hit heart away so if
you're<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> stream<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.270> you

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
you're like in a stream of it and you

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.450 
you're like in a stream of it and you
get<00:01:48.720> hit<00:01:48.869> once<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.560> that's<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:50.220> heart

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
get hit once with it that's one heart

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.429 
get hit once with it that's one heart
away<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:50.909> you're<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.810> kind<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.170> hits<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439

like it
standing<00:01:53.789> in<00:01:53.939> his<00:01:54.119> breath<00:01:54.450> while<00:01:54.659> he's

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
standing in his breath while he's

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.899 
standing in his breath while he's
breathing<00:01:55.289> that<00:01:55.439> out<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.039> kind<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.549> hits<00:01:56.759> you

breathing that out it kind of hits you

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.029 
breathing that out it kind of hits you

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and every time it detects a hit on you

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.109 
and every time it detects a hit on you
that's<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.189> heart<00:02:02.460> away<00:02:02.640> from<00:02:02.819> you<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.090> you
