is basically any time in the game like

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.769 
is basically any time in the game like
if<00:00:17.740> there's<00:00:18.520> an<00:00:18.699> explosion<00:00:19.000> or<00:00:19.359> something<00:00:19.510> on

if there's an explosion or something on
the<00:00:19.840> screen<00:00:19.930> will<00:00:20.770> shake<00:00:21.420> well<00:00:22.420> I'm<00:00:22.510> just

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
the screen will shake well I'm just

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.600 
the screen will shake well I'm just
create<00:00:22.960> an<00:00:23.050> effect<00:00:23.380> and<00:00:24.100> then<00:00:24.310> teach<00:00:24.460> you<00:00:24.550> how

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
create an effect and then teach you how

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.700 
create an effect and then teach you how
to<00:00:24.670> do<00:00:24.820> that<00:00:24.850> so<00:00:25.420> first<00:00:26.260> thing<00:00:26.380> we're<00:00:26.470> going<00:00:26.620> to

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
to do that so first thing we're going to

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.310 
to do that so first thing we're going to
do<00:00:26.860> is<00:00:27.010> get<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.190> background<00:00:28.080> I'm<00:00:29.080> going<00:00:29.230> to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
do is get a background I'm going to

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.590 
do is get a background I'm going to
navigate<00:00:29.680> to<00:00:29.800> that<00:00:29.830> background<00:00:30.400> like<00:00:31.360> this

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
navigate to that background like this

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:40.760 
navigate to that background like this
real<00:00:31.810> quick

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.610 

care

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.619 

all<00:00:46.129> right<00:00:46.460> as<00:00:47.059> I<00:00:47.270> background<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:48.579> then<00:00:49.600> get<00:00:50.600> a

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
all right as I background and then get a

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.360 
all right as I background and then get a
room<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:51.199> room<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.649> most<00:00:51.860> important<00:00:52.340> part

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
in screen shake because it has to be in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.910 
in screen shake because it has to be in
a<00:00:54.320> room<00:00:54.440> obviously<00:00:55.870> so<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:57.260> just<00:00:57.440> put<00:00:57.800> the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
a room obviously so you just put the

this<00:01:10.399> tutorial<00:01:10.580> purposes<00:01:11.500> I'm<00:01:12.500> going<00:01:12.560> to

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
this tutorial purposes I'm going to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.580 
this tutorial purposes I'm going to
create<00:01:12.979> an<00:01:13.130> object<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:13.729> isn't<00:01:14.590> probably

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
create an object this isn't probably

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.070 
create an object this isn't probably
isn't<00:01:15.920> how<00:01:16.040> you<00:01:16.070> usually<00:01:16.580> use<00:01:17.540> it<00:01:17.720> in<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.899> game

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
isn't how you usually use it in the game

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.630 
isn't how you usually use it in the game
but<00:01:18.440> for<00:01:18.679> the<00:01:18.770> tutorial<00:01:18.950> purposes<00:01:19.250> I'm<00:01:19.580> going

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
but for the tutorial purposes I'm going

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.660 
but for the tutorial purposes I'm going
to<00:01:19.789> do<00:01:20.660> it<00:01:20.780> this<00:01:20.810> way<00:01:24.190> what<00:01:25.190> I'm<00:01:25.310> going<00:01:25.460> to<00:01:25.490> do

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
to do it this way what I'm going to do

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.330 
to do it this way what I'm going to do
is<00:01:26.000> I'm<00:01:26.570> just<00:01:26.630> going<00:01:26.899> to<00:01:27.020> do<00:01:27.380> when<00:01:27.679> i<00:01:27.800> press

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
is I'm just going to do when i press

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.950 
is I'm just going to do when i press
spacebar<00:01:28.820> it's<00:01:29.240> going<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.630> screen<00:01:29.899> is

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
spacebar it's going to the screen is

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.620 
spacebar it's going to the screen is
going<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.140> shape<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:36.970> you<00:01:37.970> would<00:01:38.090> write<00:01:38.300> this

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
going to shape so you would write this

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:51.010 
going to shape so you would write this
code<00:01:38.929> for<00:01:39.319> it

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
that's what it is ok and then i'm going

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.420 
that's what it is ok and then i'm going
to<00:02:58.170> say<00:02:58.440> key<00:02:59.190> release<00:02:59.720> space<00:03:01.250> i'm<00:03:02.250> going<00:03:02.370> to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
to say key release space i'm going to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.650 
to say key release space i'm going to
make<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.580> go<00:03:02.790> back<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.120> normal<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:06.360> you

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
make it go back to normal so that you

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.810 
make it go back to normal so that you
write<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.080> code<00:03:07.320> whenever<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:08.220> want<00:03:08.519> the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
write this code whenever you want the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:26.309 
write this code whenever you want the
screen<00:03:09.150> shake<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.480> stop

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.890 

that's<00:03:26.980> good<00:03:27.189> so<00:03:27.519> we'll<00:03:27.700> put<00:03:27.939> this<00:03:28.120> in<00:03:28.480> the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
that's good so we'll put this in the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.959 
that's good so we'll put this in the
room<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.620> doesn't<00:03:29.950> matter<00:03:30.010> where<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.340> put<00:03:30.909> it

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:30.969 
room it doesn't matter where you put it

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:37.610 
room it doesn't matter where you put it
pretty<00:03:31.629> much<00:03:34.170> it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.339 

test<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.459> out<00:03:38.549> here<00:03:38.819> I<00:03:40.640> want<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.700> press<00:03:41.909> space

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
test it out here I want to press space

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.000 
test it out here I want to press space
screams<00:03:43.349> shaking<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:44.069> let<00:03:44.549> go<00:03:44.580> space<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.239> stops

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
screams shaking I let go space and stops

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.259 
screams shaking I let go space and stops
now<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.220> isn't<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.549> only<00:03:47.580> way<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.239> a

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
now this isn't the only way to do a

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.619 
now this isn't the only way to do a
screen<00:03:48.599> shakes<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.500> pretty<00:03:50.629> pretty

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
screen shakes this is a pretty pretty

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:52.940 
screen shakes this is a pretty pretty
lazy<00:03:51.870> way<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.170> doing<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.500> screen<00:03:52.769> shake

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
lazy way of doing a screen shake

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.580 
lazy way of doing a screen shake
actually<00:03:53.489> but<00:03:54.299> it's<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.870> easiest<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.470> that's

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
actually but it's the easiest and that's

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.119 
actually but it's the easiest and that's
why<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:55.799> use<00:03:56.159> it<00:03:58.579> so<00:04:00.470> I'm<00:04:01.470> going<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.799> explain

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
why I use it so I'm going to explain

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.180 
why I use it so I'm going to explain
this<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.400> little<00:04:02.459> further<00:04:03.440> what<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.590> does<00:04:04.860> is

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
this a little further what this does is

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.420 
this a little further what this does is
during<00:04:06.060> whenever<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.560> want<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.220> have<00:04:08.340> the

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
during whenever you want to have the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.240 
during whenever you want to have the
screen<00:04:08.700> shake<00:04:09.170> since<00:04:10.170> its<00:04:10.379> space<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:11.160> not

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
screen shake since its space and not

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.830 
screen shake since its space and not
keep<00:04:11.519> press<00:04:11.790> space<00:04:12.030> or<00:04:12.180> anything<00:04:12.510> that<00:04:12.540> means

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
keep press space or anything that means

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.750 
keep press space or anything that means
every<00:04:13.170> step<00:04:13.500> spacebar<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:14.430> being<00:04:15.260> pushed<00:04:16.260> down

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
every step spacebar is being pushed down

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.659 
every step spacebar is being pushed down
it's<00:04:17.760> going<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.000> be<00:04:18.150> doing<00:04:18.329> this<00:04:18.539> code<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.229> you

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
it's going to be doing this code so you

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.240 
it's going to be doing this code so you
might<00:04:20.669> like<00:04:20.880> for<00:04:21.150> an<00:04:21.269> explosion<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.740> for

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
might like for an explosion just for

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.070 
might like for an explosion just for
every<00:04:23.490> step<00:04:23.789> it'll<00:04:24.120> do<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:24.449> code<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:24.960> then

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
every step it'll do this code and then

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.010 
every step it'll do this code and then
one<00:04:25.199> is<00:04:25.320> destroyed<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:26.820> will<00:04:26.850> lose<00:04:27.150> this<00:04:27.690> one

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
one is destroyed it will lose this one

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.350 
one is destroyed it will lose this one
and<00:04:28.880> what<00:04:29.880> this<00:04:30.000> is<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:31.620> view<00:04:31.919> wport<00:04:32.639> that

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
and what this is is the view wport that

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.360 
and what this is is the view wport that
means<00:04:33.570> view<00:04:33.870> width<00:04:34.139> port<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:34.710> view<00:04:35.070> height

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
means view width port and view height

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.939 
means view width port and view height
port<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:37.310> by<00:04:38.310> default<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.930> rooms<00:04:40.289> width<00:04:40.800> and

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
port and by default the rooms width and

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.150 
port and by default the rooms width and
height<00:04:41.130> is<00:04:41.430> 640<00:04:41.970> by<00:04:42.090> 480<00:04:43.010> obviously<00:04:44.010> if<00:04:44.070> you

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
height is 640 by 480 obviously if you

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.740 
height is 640 by 480 obviously if you
want<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.430> change<00:04:44.729> that<00:04:45.030> or<00:04:45.240> if<00:04:45.389> you<00:04:45.539> want<00:04:45.690> to

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
want to change that or if you want to

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.930 
want to change that or if you want to
change<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.200> view<00:04:46.380> on<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.620> screen<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.760> can

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
change the view on the screen you can

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.300 
change the view on the screen you can
look<00:04:48.330> into<00:04:48.690> it<00:04:48.840> bit<00:04:49.139> more<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.770> understand<00:04:50.220> it

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
look into it bit more to understand it

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.300 
look into it bit more to understand it
the<00:04:50.430> more<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.729> game<00:04:50.910> maker<00:04:51.180> help<00:04:51.500> but<00:04:52.500> it's

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
the more and game maker help but it's

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.750 
the more and game maker help but it's
basically<00:04:53.970> like<00:04:54.419> it's<00:04:55.349> going<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.830> equal<00:04:55.979> 6<00:04:56.370> 40

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
basically like it's going to equal 6 40

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.440 
basically like it's going to equal 6 40
and<00:04:56.970> then<00:04:57.930> plus<00:04:58.440> choose<00:04:58.889> random<00:04:59.430> 25<00:05:00.000> random

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
and then plus choose random 25 random

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.900 
and then plus choose random 25 random
negative<00:05:00.780> 25<00:05:01.229> it<00:05:02.010> basically<00:05:02.370> means<00:05:02.580> it's

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
negative 25 it basically means it's

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.680 
negative 25 it basically means it's
going<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.240> go<00:05:03.450> either<00:05:04.440> up<00:05:04.889> 20<00:05:05.610> to<00:05:05.700> 25<00:05:06.300> pixels<00:05:08.690> to

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
going to go either up 20 to 25 pixels to

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.900 
going to go either up 20 to 25 pixels to
the<00:05:09.870> right<00:05:10.110> or<00:05:10.440> left<00:05:10.470> or<00:05:11.070> up<00:05:11.430> or<00:05:11.610> down

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
the right or left or up or down

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.990 
the right or left or up or down
depending<00:05:12.210> on<00:05:12.780> whether<00:05:12.990> its<00:05:13.139> width<00:05:13.289> or<00:05:13.470> height

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
depending on whether its width or height

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.870 
depending on whether its width or height
and<00:05:15.169> then<00:05:16.169> it's<00:05:16.590> just<00:05:16.830> setting<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.550> back<00:05:17.729> to

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
and then it's just setting it back to

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.080 
and then it's just setting it back to
normal<00:05:18.180> when<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.389> release<00:05:19.880> and<00:05:20.880> that's

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
normal when you release and that's

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.810 
normal when you release and that's
basically<00:05:21.330> what's<00:05:22.169> happening<00:05:22.289> and<00:05:24.830> it<00:05:25.830> makes

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
basically what's happening and it makes

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.600 
basically what's happening and it makes
a<00:05:27.060> screen<00:05:27.419> shake<00:05:27.810> effect<00:05:28.169> which<00:05:28.500> is<00:05:28.710> really

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
a screen shake effect which is really

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.170 
a screen shake effect which is really
nice<00:05:29.820> for<00:05:30.120> things<00:05:30.449> such<00:05:30.599> as<00:05:30.660> explosions

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
nice for things such as explosions

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.580 
nice for things such as explosions
whatever<00:05:33.180> you'd<00:05:33.389> want<00:05:33.419> to<00:05:33.660> use<00:05:33.780> that<00:05:33.810> for<00:05:34.320> just

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
whatever you'd want to use that for just

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.950 
whatever you'd want to use that for just
if<00:05:35.130> an<00:05:35.250> explosion<00:05:35.490> happens<00:05:36.030> maybe<00:05:36.419> that<00:05:36.660> about

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
if an explosion happens maybe that about

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.629 
if an explosion happens maybe that about
that<00:05:37.199> much<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:38.900> don't<00:05:39.900> know

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
that much I don't know
