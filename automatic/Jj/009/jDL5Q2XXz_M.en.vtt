00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
alright so in this first scenario we are

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.429 
alright so in this first scenario we are
going<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.360> d2d<00:02:00.360> pass<00:02:00.659> with<00:02:00.899> enough<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.350> what

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
going to do d2d pass with enough so what

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.480 
going to do d2d pass with enough so what
we're<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.950> break<00:02:02.189> out<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
we're going to do is break out of the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.920 
we're going to do is break out of the
zone<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.670> bit<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> right<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:03.390> Hank<00:02:03.810> it

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
zone a bit to the right and then Hank it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.749 
zone a bit to the right and then Hank it
off<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.229> boards<00:02:04.530> back<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.950> your<00:02:05.100> demon<00:02:05.399> so

you'll see that first guy rushes then

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.809 
you'll see that first guy rushes then
you<00:02:07.649> get<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:08.009> bit<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.190> space<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:08.640> and

jvr pick it up and you see how smooth

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.059 
jvr pick it up and you see how smooth
that<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.629> one

out and why are we gonna go off the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.599 
out and why are we gonna go off the
boards<00:02:54.079> because<00:02:54.290> look<00:02:54.560> at<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.799> as<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.340> see

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
boards because look at this as you see

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.949 
boards because look at this as you see
this<00:02:55.760> defender<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.299> kind<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.540> covering<00:02:56.840> him

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
this defender is kind of covering him

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.050 
this defender is kind of covering him
but<00:02:57.379> if<00:02:57.469> you<00:02:57.590> sauce<00:02:57.829> it<00:02:58.010> off<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.250> boards<00:02:58.549> the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
but if you sauce it off the boards the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.569 
but if you sauce it off the boards the
puck<00:02:59.269> will<00:02:59.419> just<00:02:59.599> go<00:02:59.689> nicely<00:02:59.959> like<00:03:00.260> this<00:03:00.579> so

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
puck will just go nicely like this so

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.099 
puck will just go nicely like this so
this<00:03:01.669> is<00:03:01.819> our<00:03:02.000> B<00:03:02.239> you're<00:03:02.540> aiming<00:03:02.900> at<00:03:02.989> the

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
this is our B you're aiming at the

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.539 
this is our B you're aiming at the
boards<00:03:03.409> off<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.859> boards<00:03:04.099> and<00:03:04.219> look<00:03:04.310> at<00:03:04.430> this

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
boards off the boards and look at this

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.479 
boards off the boards and look at this
jvr<00:03:05.540> picks<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:05.870> off<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.230> when<00:03:06.379> the<00:03:06.500> guys<00:03:06.530> pick

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
jvr picks it off and when the guys pick

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.800 
jvr picks it off and when the guys pick
up<00:03:07.579> a<00:03:07.639> puck<00:03:07.819> off<00:03:07.969> the<00:03:08.120> boards<00:03:08.359> they<00:03:08.510> get<00:03:08.629> a<00:03:08.659> bit

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
up a puck off the boards they get a bit

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.750 
up a puck off the boards they get a bit
of<00:03:08.900> an<00:03:08.989> acceleration<00:03:09.500> boost<00:03:09.919> so<00:03:10.459> you'll<00:03:10.579> see<00:03:10.730> a

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
of an acceleration boost so you'll see a

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.699 
of an acceleration boost so you'll see a
JV<00:03:11.150> are<00:03:11.239> now<00:03:11.389> can<00:03:11.629> you<00:03:11.930> know<00:03:12.019> bus<00:03:12.409> down<00:03:12.590> the

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
JV are now can you know bus down the

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.110 
JV are now can you know bus down the
link<00:03:12.859> i<00:03:12.889> could<00:03:13.069> take<00:03:13.219> a<00:03:13.250> wrist<00:03:13.549> shot<00:03:13.609> there<00:03:13.939> I

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
link i could take a wrist shot there I

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.939 
link i could take a wrist shot there I
could<00:03:14.510> stop<00:03:14.780> up<00:03:15.019> I<00:03:15.139> could<00:03:15.290> do<00:03:15.379> whatever<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.680> want

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:15.949 
could stop up I could do whatever I want

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.469 
could stop up I could do whatever I want
there<00:03:16.489> I<00:03:16.519> choose<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.819> spin<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.180> go<00:03:17.329> to<00:03:17.419> the

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:17.479 
there I choose a spin and go to the

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.939 
there I choose a spin and go to the
demon<00:03:17.750> that's<00:03:18.259> not<00:03:18.439> important<00:03:18.829> what<00:03:18.919> is

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:18.949 
demon that's not important what is

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.219 
demon that's not important what is
important<00:03:19.459> is<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:20.060> breakout<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:20.900> there<00:03:21.049> we

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:21.229 
important is the breakout so there we

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.289 
important is the breakout so there we
just<00:03:21.349> showed<00:03:21.620> how<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.340> break<00:03:22.699> out<00:03:22.879> by<00:03:23.060> going

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
just showed how to break out by going

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.849 
just showed how to break out by going
from<00:03:23.540> D<00:03:23.689> to<00:03:23.720> D<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.079> that's<00:03:24.229> really<00:03:24.409> useful<00:03:24.620> if

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
from D to D so that's really useful if

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:25.719 
from D to D so that's really useful if
you've<00:03:24.979> got<00:03:25.129> a<00:03:25.159> guy<00:03:25.340> that's<00:03:25.519> really

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:25.729 
you've got a guy that's really

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.789 
you've got a guy that's really
aggressive<00:03:26.209> just<00:03:26.810> go<00:03:26.930> D<00:03:27.109> to<00:03:27.199> D<00:03:27.349> because<00:03:27.560> you

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
aggressive just go D to D because you

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.259 
aggressive just go D to D because you
don't<00:03:28.159> have<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.519> know<00:03:28.609> feel<00:03:28.790> rushed<00:03:29.060> and

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
don't have to you know feel rushed and

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.849 
don't have to you know feel rushed and
make<00:03:29.419> a<00:03:29.449> panic<00:03:29.870> pass<00:03:30.079> you<00:03:30.319> just<00:03:30.500> go<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:30.769> too

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
make a panic pass you just go to you too

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.589 
make a panic pass you just go to you too
d<00:03:30.979> it's<00:03:31.099> that<00:03:31.250> simple<00:03:31.459> alright<00:03:32.269> so<00:03:32.449> next

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
d it's that simple alright so next

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.030 
d it's that simple alright so next
example<00:03:33.049> we're<00:03:33.349> just<00:03:33.470> going<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:33.650> go<00:03:33.709> off<00:03:33.919> the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
example we're just going to go off the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.259 
example we're just going to go off the
board<00:03:34.159> so<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.430> skate<00:03:34.639> out<00:03:34.759> towards<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.120> right

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
board so you skate out towards the right

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.210 
board so you skate out towards the right
and<00:03:35.419> just<00:03:35.930> straight<00:03:36.109> up<00:03:36.169> past<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.739> like<00:03:36.979> to<00:03:37.099> go

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
and just straight up past I like to go

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.559 
and just straight up past I like to go
on<00:03:37.250> my<00:03:37.459> backhand<00:03:37.849> there<00:03:38.030> as<00:03:38.120> you'll<00:03:38.269> see<00:03:38.449> with

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
on my backhand there as you'll see with

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.869 
on my backhand there as you'll see with
enough<00:03:38.870> i<00:03:39.109> go<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.590> my<00:03:39.650> backhand<00:03:40.099> for<00:03:40.400> increased

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
enough i go to my backhand for increased

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.550 
enough i go to my backhand for increased
accuracy<00:03:41.269> if<00:03:41.599> you<00:03:41.720> just<00:03:41.900> try<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.079> kind<00:03:42.470> of

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
accuracy if you just try to kind of

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.899 
accuracy if you just try to kind of
flick<00:03:42.769> it<00:03:42.889> up<00:03:42.979> there<00:03:43.159> you're<00:03:43.639> not<00:03:43.759> really

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
flick it up there you're not really

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.129 
flick it up there you're not really
protecting<00:03:44.419> the<00:03:44.509> puck<00:03:44.659> if<00:03:44.810> you<00:03:44.900> put<00:03:45.049> it<00:03:45.109> on

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
protecting the puck if you put it on

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.539 
protecting the puck if you put it on
your<00:03:45.290> backhand<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.799> protects<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.189> puck<00:03:46.340> well

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
your backhand it protects the puck well

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.610 
your backhand it protects the puck well
oh<00:03:46.699> my<00:03:47.449> god<00:03:47.569> just<00:03:47.750> let<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:48.139> it<00:03:48.229> I<00:03:48.470> don't

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
oh my god just let the it I don't

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.860 
oh my god just let the it I don't
want<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.799> do<00:03:48.859> it<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.239> quick<00:03:50.449> replay<00:03:50.780> of

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
want to do it so this quick replay of

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.920 
want to do it so this quick replay of
that<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.319> is<00:03:51.500> pretty<00:03:51.889> basic<00:03:52.250> stuff<00:03:52.810> this<00:03:53.810> is

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
that this is pretty basic stuff this is

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.780 
that this is pretty basic stuff this is
probably<00:03:54.139> the<00:03:54.290> breakout<00:03:55.129> that<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.400> guys<00:03:55.549> will

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
probably the breakout that you guys will

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.149 
probably the breakout that you guys will
use<00:03:56.060> most<00:03:56.449> often<00:03:56.719> i<00:03:57.019> would<00:03:57.169> assume<00:03:57.259> so<00:03:57.620> like

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
use most often i would assume so like

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.009 
use most often i would assume so like
here<00:03:58.400> is<00:03:58.549> for<00:03:58.790> example<00:03:58.879> if<00:03:59.419> i<00:03:59.629> try<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.870> make

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
here is for example if i try to make

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.780 
here is for example if i try to make
this<00:04:00.079> pass<00:04:00.290> by<00:04:00.560> just<00:04:00.769> going<00:04:01.099> on<00:04:01.250> my<00:04:01.340> forehand

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
this pass by just going on my forehand

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.520 
this pass by just going on my forehand
this<00:04:02.269> guy<00:04:02.449> could<00:04:02.509> easily<00:04:03.019> this<00:04:03.319> guy<00:04:03.469> could

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
this guy could easily this guy could

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.929 
this guy could easily this guy could
easily<00:04:03.829> poke<00:04:04.009> it<00:04:04.129> away<00:04:04.189> so<00:04:04.310> i<00:04:04.459> just<00:04:04.699> go<00:04:04.819> on<00:04:04.909> my

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:04.939 
easily poke it away so i just go on my

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.759 
easily poke it away so i just go on my
backhand<00:04:05.449> as<00:04:05.659> you'll<00:04:06.259> see<00:04:06.439> I<00:04:06.469> go<00:04:06.650> on<00:04:06.739> my

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
backhand as you'll see I go on my

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.129 
backhand as you'll see I go on my
backhand<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.549> protect<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:08.030> puck<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.449> you<00:04:09.019> can

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
backhand to protect the puck and you can

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.689 
backhand to protect the puck and you can
also<00:04:09.259> make<00:04:09.530> more<00:04:09.680> accurate<00:04:10.039> passes<00:04:10.459> so<00:04:10.579> you

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
also make more accurate passes so you

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.550 
also make more accurate passes so you
just<00:04:10.849> flick<00:04:11.359> up<00:04:11.509> the<00:04:11.629> past<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.109> Castle<00:04:12.439> there

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
just flick up the past to Castle there

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.920 
just flick up the past to Castle there
simple<00:04:13.459> stuff<00:04:13.549> simple<00:04:14.030> stuff<00:04:14.209> okay<00:04:14.629> so<00:04:14.689> now

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
simple stuff simple stuff okay so now

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.699 
simple stuff simple stuff okay so now
we're<00:04:15.349> going<00:04:15.439> to<00:04:15.500> go<00:04:15.680> up<00:04:15.949> the<00:04:16.639> other<00:04:16.669> wing<00:04:17.180> and

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
we're going to go up the other wing and

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.110 
we're going to go up the other wing and
this<00:04:18.709> is<00:04:18.859> simple<00:04:19.159> I'll<00:04:19.370> make<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.729> bank<00:04:19.909> pass

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
this is simple I'll make the bank pass

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.729 
this is simple I'll make the bank pass
off<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.419> boards<00:04:20.630> now<00:04:20.780> do<00:04:20.840> you<00:04:20.930> see<00:04:21.109> how<00:04:21.139> jvr

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
off the boards now do you see how jvr

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.500 
off the boards now do you see how jvr
kind<00:04:21.979> of<00:04:22.070> made<00:04:22.190> a<00:04:22.219> bit<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.520> an<00:04:22.639> acceleration

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
kind of made a bit of an acceleration

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.060 
kind of made a bit of an acceleration
there<00:04:23.779> like<00:04:23.930> I<00:04:23.960> was<00:04:24.139> talking<00:04:24.440> about

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
there like I was talking about

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.400 
there like I was talking about
let's<00:04:25.790> let<00:04:25.940> them<00:04:26.030> get<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.270> puck<00:04:26.420> out<00:04:26.540> GV<00:04:27.230> are

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
let's let them get the puck out GV are

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.660 
let's let them get the puck out GV are
made<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.590> bit<00:04:27.770> of<00:04:27.860> it<00:04:27.950> acceleration<00:04:28.520> so<00:04:28.610> I

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
made a bit of it acceleration so I

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.620 
made a bit of it acceleration so I
banked<00:04:28.940> it<00:04:29.030> off<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.240> boards<00:04:29.480> with<00:04:29.570> the

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
banked it off the boards with the

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.930 
banked it off the boards with the
regular<00:04:29.960> pass<00:04:30.140> I<00:04:30.470> don't<00:04:31.430> really<00:04:31.610> want<00:04:31.760> to<00:04:31.790> do

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
this I'll show you an example kill it so

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.370 
this I'll show you an example kill it so
you<00:04:34.370> get<00:04:34.460> in<00:04:34.580> trouble<00:04:34.910> look<00:04:35.120> at<00:04:35.240> this<00:04:35.390> this<00:04:36.290> is

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
you get in trouble look at this this is

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.480 
you get in trouble look at this this is
all<00:04:36.530> you<00:04:36.620> got<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.800> do<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.890> get<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:37.160> pucker<00:04:37.340> to

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
all you got to do to get the pucker to

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.610 
all you got to do to get the pucker to
the<00:04:37.580> zone<00:04:37.730> just<00:04:38.180> Bank<00:04:38.420> it<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:38.810> look<00:04:39.380> at<00:04:39.440> that

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
the zone just Bank it and look at that

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.140 
the zone just Bank it and look at that
we<00:04:39.770> still<00:04:39.950> got<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.340> we<00:04:40.400> gotta<00:04:40.550> rush<00:04:40.820> even

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
we still got it and we gotta rush even

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.020 
we still got it and we gotta rush even
out<00:04:41.270> of<00:04:41.300> it<00:04:41.510> so<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.470> do<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.620> when<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.040> hold<00:04:43.250> RB

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
out of it so to do that when you hold RB

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.240 
out of it so to do that when you hold RB
and<00:04:44.330> flick<00:04:44.870> up<00:04:45.050> like<00:04:45.260> you're<00:04:45.410> shooting<00:04:45.740> the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
and flick up like you're shooting the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.200 
and flick up like you're shooting the
only<00:04:46.400> thing<00:04:46.490> you<00:04:46.550> want<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:46.730> be<00:04:46.790> careful<00:04:47.000> about

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
only thing you want to be careful about

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.670 
only thing you want to be careful about
with<00:04:47.390> that<00:04:47.630> is<00:04:47.870> if<00:04:48.140> you<00:04:48.260> shoot<00:04:48.380> over<00:04:48.530> the

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
with that is if you shoot over the

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.980 
with that is if you shoot over the
boards<00:04:48.950> it<00:04:49.100> is<00:04:49.220> a<00:04:49.250> penalty<00:04:49.810> alright<00:04:50.810> so<00:04:50.900> now

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
boards it is a penalty alright so now

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.840 
boards it is a penalty alright so now
we're<00:04:51.110> gonna<00:04:51.170> go<00:04:51.320> up<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.440> middle<00:04:51.560> so

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
we're gonna go up the middle so

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.640 
we're gonna go up the middle so
sometimes<00:04:52.850> you'll<00:04:53.540> see<00:04:53.720> like<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.050> if<00:04:54.530> you

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
sometimes you'll see like that if you

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.720 
sometimes you'll see like that if you
try<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.830> make<00:04:54.980> a<00:04:55.010> rush<00:04:55.220> in<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.400> middle<00:04:55.610> isn't

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
try to make a rush in the middle isn't

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.400 
try to make a rush in the middle isn't
there<00:04:56.000> like<00:04:56.180> I<00:04:56.480> would<00:04:56.660> never<00:04:56.840> actually<00:04:57.080> go<00:04:57.380> up

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
there like I would never actually go up

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.020 
there like I would never actually go up
the<00:04:57.590> middle<00:04:57.680> there<00:04:57.950> now<00:04:58.580> sometimes<00:04:58.910> you'll

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
the middle there now sometimes you'll

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.520 
the middle there now sometimes you'll
see<00:04:59.180> this<00:04:59.330> now<00:04:59.570> look<00:04:59.720> at<00:04:59.810> that<00:04:59.930> he<00:05:00.080> gets<00:05:00.260> open

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
see this now look at that he gets open

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.840 
see this now look at that he gets open
up<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:00.740> middle<00:05:00.860> and<00:05:01.070> you<00:05:01.100> make<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:01.520> stretch

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
up the middle and you make that stretch

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.460 
up the middle and you make that stretch
pass<00:05:02.090> now<00:05:02.540> that's<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:02.810> bit<00:05:02.960> risky<00:05:03.170> it's

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
pass now that's a bit risky it's

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.950 
pass now that's a bit risky it's
probably<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:03.950> hardest<00:05:04.340> to<00:05:04.460> go<00:05:04.550> up<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:04.730> middle

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
probably the hardest to go up the middle

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.850 
probably the hardest to go up the middle
but<00:05:05.960> it's<00:05:06.080> probably<00:05:06.320> also<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.740> most

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
but it's probably also the most

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.740 
but it's probably also the most
rewarding<00:05:06.980> when<00:05:07.490> you<00:05:07.610> can<00:05:07.760> make<00:05:07.880> it<00:05:08.060> work<00:05:08.180> when

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
rewarding when you can make it work when

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.820 
rewarding when you can make it work when
you<00:05:08.810> go<00:05:08.900> up<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.050> middle<00:05:09.140> off<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:09.620> you'll<00:05:09.710> get

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
you go up the middle off and you'll get

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.260 
you go up the middle off and you'll get
a<00:05:09.890> break<00:05:10.160> away<00:05:10.310> or<00:05:10.490> like<00:05:10.640> something<00:05:10.850> like<00:05:10.970> that

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
a break away or like something like that

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.810 
a break away or like something like that
so<00:05:12.080> I'll<00:05:12.140> show<00:05:12.290> you<00:05:12.380> one<00:05:12.500> more<00:05:12.560> time<00:05:12.730> you<00:05:13.730> know

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
so I'll show you one more time you know

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.060 
so I'll show you one more time you know
up<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.030> middle<00:05:14.230> no<00:05:15.230> sign<00:05:15.440> of<00:05:15.470> em<00:05:15.620> was<00:05:15.710> kind<00:05:15.980> of

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
up the middle no sign of em was kind of

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.830 
up the middle no sign of em was kind of
back<00:05:16.220> but<00:05:16.460> it's<00:05:16.610> very<00:05:16.880> very<00:05:17.240> dangerous<00:05:17.450> and

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
back but it's very very dangerous and

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.150 
back but it's very very dangerous and
hard<00:05:17.990> to<00:05:18.080> defend<00:05:18.260> a<00:05:18.410> rush<00:05:18.590> that's<00:05:18.860> coming

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
hard to defend a rush that's coming

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.180 
hard to defend a rush that's coming
right<00:05:19.460> up<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.640> middle<00:05:19.850> action<00:05:20.950> so<00:05:21.950> anyways

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
right up the middle action so anyways

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.280 
right up the middle action so anyways
that's<00:05:22.340> those<00:05:22.700> two<00:05:22.940> tricks<00:05:23.240> one<00:05:23.990> more<00:05:24.140> time

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
that's those two tricks one more time

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.570 
that's those two tricks one more time
with<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.530> RB<00:05:24.740> button<00:05:25.010> this<00:05:25.100> is<00:05:25.220> a<00:05:25.250> way<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.400> get

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
with the RB button this is a way to get

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.920 
with the RB button this is a way to get
the<00:05:25.730> puck<00:05:25.880> out<00:05:26.030> you<00:05:26.210> hold<00:05:26.420> our<00:05:26.540> be<00:05:26.720> and<00:05:26.840> you

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
the puck out you hold our be and you

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.300 
the puck out you hold our be and you
flick<00:05:27.140> it<00:05:27.170> and<00:05:27.440> you<00:05:27.800> can<00:05:27.920> actually<00:05:28.070> get

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
flick it and you can actually get

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.220 
flick it and you can actually get
breakaways<00:05:28.790> off<00:05:28.970> for<00:05:29.150> doing<00:05:29.330> this<00:05:29.480> because

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
breakaways off for doing this because

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.540 
breakaways off for doing this because
you<00:05:30.410> see<00:05:30.560> there<00:05:30.710> it's<00:05:30.830> really<00:05:31.010> hard<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.280> defend

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
you see there it's really hard to defend

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.070 
you see there it's really hard to defend
and<00:05:31.730> the<00:05:31.820> puck<00:05:31.970> kind<00:05:32.180> of<00:05:32.240> bounces<00:05:32.600> around<00:05:32.720> so

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
and the puck kind of bounces around so

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.250 
and the puck kind of bounces around so
it's<00:05:33.200> really<00:05:33.350> irritating<00:05:38.020> so<00:05:39.020> that's<00:05:39.170> a

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
it's really irritating so that's a

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.690 
it's really irritating so that's a
couple<00:05:39.500> different<00:05:39.770> ways<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.130> also<00:05:40.490> if<00:05:40.610> you

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
couple different ways and also if you

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.790 
couple different ways and also if you
get<00:05:40.850> in<00:05:40.940> big<00:05:41.120> trouble<00:05:41.150> all<00:05:42.080> you<00:05:42.350> can<00:05:42.500> do<00:05:42.590> too<00:05:42.770> is

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
get in big trouble all you can do too is

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.020 
get in big trouble all you can do too is
you<00:05:42.980> can<00:05:43.100> just<00:05:43.250> flick<00:05:43.430> it<00:05:43.460> off<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:43.790> boards

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
you can just flick it off the boards

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.610 
you can just flick it off the boards
like<00:05:44.120> that<00:05:44.330> with<00:05:44.510> the<00:05:44.630> shot<00:05:44.870> and<00:05:45.140> not<00:05:45.380> works

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
like that with the shot and not works

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.230 
like that with the shot and not works
just<00:05:46.040> as<00:05:46.250> well<00:05:46.310> as<00:05:46.640> most<00:05:46.820> things<00:05:47.030> the<00:05:47.090> only

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
just as well as most things the only

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.850 
just as well as most things the only
thing<00:05:47.390> I<00:05:47.480> wrote<00:05:47.720> like<00:05:47.840> i<00:05:48.080> like<00:05:48.410> to<00:05:48.530> use<00:05:48.560> our<00:05:48.740> be

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
thing I wrote like i like to use our be

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.020 
thing I wrote like i like to use our be
better<00:05:49.070> than<00:05:49.190> that<00:05:49.340> because<00:05:49.490> RB<00:05:49.820> is<00:05:49.850> more

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
better than that because RB is more

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.910 
better than that because RB is more
accurate<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.870> saucer<00:05:51.230> pass<00:05:51.380> buttons<00:05:51.770> more

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
accurate the saucer pass buttons more

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.920 
accurate the saucer pass buttons more
accurate<00:05:52.310> you<00:05:52.430> can<00:05:52.580> aim<00:05:52.730> it<00:05:52.760> better<00:05:53.030> but<00:05:53.780> with

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
accurate you can aim it better but with

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.570 
accurate you can aim it better but with
a<00:05:53.960> shot<00:05:54.290> in<00:05:54.470> a<00:05:54.560> panic<00:05:54.860> and<00:05:54.920> you<00:05:54.980> have<00:05:55.220> trying<00:05:55.490> to
