00:00:01.048 --> 00:00:09.314
 An exceptionally interesting query, repeating like a Halley comet with some frequency. 

00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:13.960
 Is it worth coming, or it is worth risking the coming of WOMP drivers for research, 

00:00:14.403 --> 00:00:18.374
 when we regularly abuse alcohol during weekends. 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.184
 "Good morning, Doctor, I have a question about liver function tests. 

00:00:33.338 --> 00:00:39.383
 My boyfriend 2 years ago lost his driving license for two years because of driving under the influence of alcohol. 

00:00:39.383 --> 00:00:46.659
 Fact, it became the only one and as you can see the last time because in the beginning, 

00:00:47.128 --> 00:00:51.064
 when he passed, even the apples would not eat before driving. 

00:00:51.348 --> 00:00:56.755
 In November, the deadline expires and must be registered for WOMP. 

00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:02.802
 We are young people and almost every weekend we go out - especially Saturdays are richly instilled. 

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:10.607
 I do not hide my boy on Saturday almost always gets drunk, because he does not drink because of work during the week, 

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:17.625
 where, after losing the driving license from the driver's seat, he was transferred to the post of assistant. 

00:01:18.213 --> 00:01:20.863
 During the week, he does not drink because he is an athlete, 

00:01:20.863 --> 00:01:25.938
 I regularly play football, go to the gym every day, sometimes to the pool. 

00:01:26.393 --> 00:01:30.376
 He leads a fairly active lifestyle compared to the average Pole " 

00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:34.658
 yes, on Saturdays I do not know if this is the average Pole, but it's fun. 

00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:41.990
 "His diet is" like we have "because we are standing with our parents, so there is no way to talk about thin foods." 

00:01:42.026 --> 00:01:48.280
 The main question is: "Does alcohol use once a week in large amounts, 

00:01:48.627 --> 00:01:53.840
 physical activity on average 5 times a week, normal "Polish" diet, age less than 30 years, 

00:01:54.427 --> 00:01:57.460
 is the threat that something will go wrong with liver tests? 

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.160
 And with this mode, how much would he have to drink before the tests? 

00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:07.980
 I believe that physical activity increases liver regeneration and there is less probability of the test result, 

00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:10.690
 which would be unsatisfactory. " 

00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:19.300
 Interesting way of life, we work hard all week, we break up on a Friday, on Saturday we come ... 

00:02:20.303 --> 00:02:23.220
 Is it possible to get down on Saturday, we arrive on Sunday. 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:31.360
 However, seriously answering this question: if he goes drunk and liver tests will come out to him 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:38.090
 elevated, it would rather lose right, I heard many translations for elevated enzymes, 

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:45.480
 someone insisted there that it could be in other diseases, but in WOMP they know very well, especially on Mondays 

00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:49.670
 that people come yesterday and no one will be squeezing with this boy. 

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:57.120
 Such indirect solution - you can of course, but before these tests in WOMP 

00:02:57.121 --> 00:03:03.500
 do liver tests in some other independent laboratory, do them on Monday after this drunkenness 

00:03:03.504 --> 00:03:09.460
 and everything will become clear as they are elevated, so the longer the abstinence the better. 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:16.630
 And it is not just my scaring, because I really get enormous, really huge correspondence 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.890
 describing practically identical situations. 

00:03:20.628 --> 00:03:26.730
 When someone has lost his driving license through increased liver tests, there are of course 100,000 excuses. 

00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:34.630
 why he had to drink on the day before this study, but the finale is, or we want to 

00:03:34.628 --> 00:03:39.520
 on a Saturday, or on a Sunday or weekend, or have a right. 

00:03:41.505 --> 00:03:47.430
 Privately, I think that if this person is unable to refrain from drinking for several weeks, despite the fact that he passes 

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:54.770
 realize that the possibility of losing a lawyer and not recovering it after two years, I see the passage of these in black 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:55.530
 research. 

00:03:56.273 --> 00:04:04.560
 Well ... with this pessimistic accent I am finishing for now, traditionally I invite you here to the comments below. 

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:05.510
 Under this video. 

00:04:06.157 --> 00:04:11.590
 You can find many more such classic cases on my website 

00:04:11.594 --> 00:04:14.280
 BadaniaLekarskieKierowcow.pl. 

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:16.250
 Darek Kraśnicki from Wrocław spoke. 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:25.060
 Well, unfortunately, the longer abstinence before the WOMP research, it certainly did not work for anyone. 

00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:28.740
 Once again, said Darek Kraśnicki from Wrocław.
