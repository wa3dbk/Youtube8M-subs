computer screen I use my right fucking
remote<00:03:09.080> presence<00:03:09.890> button<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.370> change<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
remote presence button that I change the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.270 
remote presence button that I change the
screen<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.239> my<00:03:11.360> pc<00:03:11.780> or<00:03:12.290> my<00:03:12.530> xbox<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.070> I<00:03:13.130> only

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
screen to my pc or my xbox so I only

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.760 
screen to my pc or my xbox so I only
have<00:03:13.430> one<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:13.790> only<00:03:13.940> have<00:03:14.060> one<00:03:14.239> monitor<00:03:14.680> which<00:03:15.680> I

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
have one I only have one monitor which I

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.520 
have one I only have one monitor which I
play<00:03:15.950> both<00:03:16.280> pc<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:16.760> xbox<00:03:17.420> on<00:03:18.050> so<00:03:18.200> it's<00:03:18.320> kind<00:03:18.500> of

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
play both pc and xbox on so it's kind of

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.440 
play both pc and xbox on so it's kind of
difficult<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.950> judge<00:03:19.459> where<00:03:19.850> my<00:03:20.060> controller

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
difficult to judge where my controller

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.350 
difficult to judge where my controller
is<00:03:20.720> on<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.620> camera<00:03:21.950> but<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.760> hope<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.090> wasn't

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
is on the camera but I hope it wasn't

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.260 
is on the camera but I hope it wasn't
too<00:03:23.390> bad<00:03:23.480> if<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.870> was<00:03:24.020> off<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.880> if<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.030> wasn't

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
too bad if it was off and if it wasn't

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.490 
too bad if it was off and if it wasn't
often<00:03:26.390> sweet<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.959> must<00:03:27.140> have<00:03:27.320> captured

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
often sweet it must have captured
