weren't<00:00:29.070> too<00:00:29.190> happy<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.610> us<00:00:29.789> with<00:00:30.029> that

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
weren't too happy with us with that

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.209 
weren't too happy with us with that
concept<00:00:30.600> but<00:00:31.110> what<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.320> did<00:00:31.500> realize<00:00:31.890> was<00:00:32.189> that

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
concept but what we did realize was that

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.130 
concept but what we did realize was that
the<00:00:32.430> kids<00:00:32.699> loved<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.149> audio<00:00:33.449> feedback<00:00:33.749> of

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the kids loved the audio feedback of

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.630 
the kids loved the audio feedback of
success<00:00:34.859> when<00:00:35.039> they<00:00:35.129> actually<00:00:35.399> hit<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
success when they actually hit the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.790 
success when they actually hit the
target<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.600> then<00:00:36.929> we<00:00:37.050> got<00:00:37.199> to<00:00:37.409> thinking<00:00:37.739> about

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
target so then we got to thinking about

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.189 
target so then we got to thinking about
how<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.159> could<00:00:38.489> incorporate<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.690> idea<00:00:39.749> of

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
how we could incorporate that idea of

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.229 
how we could incorporate that idea of
audio<00:00:40.499> feedback<00:00:40.949> in<00:00:41.190> targets<00:00:41.609> and<00:00:41.760> accuracy

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
audio feedback in targets and accuracy

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.689 
audio feedback in targets and accuracy
and<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.479> came<00:00:43.229> up<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.379> slap<00:00:43.829> targets<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.579> the

and we came up with slap targets so the

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.069 
and we came up with slap targets so the
idea<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:47.999> slap<00:00:48.210> targets<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.600> pretty<00:00:48.780> simple<00:00:48.989> we
