the<00:01:38.230> owner<00:01:38.470> about<00:01:39.220> this<00:01:39.690> these<00:01:40.690> are<00:01:40.900> Hardy<00:01:41.560> or

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
the owner about this these are Hardy or

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.060 
the owner about this these are Hardy or
at<00:01:42.340> least<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:42.730> area<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:44.140> coldest<00:01:44.620> they<00:01:44.770> get

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
at least this area the coldest they get

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.340 
at least this area the coldest they get
it's<00:01:45.280> kind<00:01:45.550> of<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.820> high<00:01:46.030> 20s<00:01:46.750> for<00:01:47.080> short

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
it's kind of the high 20s for short

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.500 
it's kind of the high 20s for short
periods<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:48.100> generally<00:01:48.670> they're<00:01:49.210> right<00:01:49.480> on

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
periods and generally they're right on

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.230 
periods and generally they're right on
the<00:01:49.810> frost<00:01:50.110> line<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:51.250> what<00:01:51.730> you're<00:01:51.940> seeing

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
the frost line so what you're seeing

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.540 
the frost line so what you're seeing
that's<00:01:52.600> grown<00:01:52.960> there<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.560> tolerant<00:01:54.400> of<00:01:54.490> that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
that's grown there is tolerant of that

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.630 
that's grown there is tolerant of that
at<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.659> very<00:01:55.690> least<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.500> then<00:01:57.040> many<00:01:57.280> of<00:01:57.400> these

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
at the very least and then many of these

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.640 
at the very least and then many of these
are<00:01:57.940> much<00:01:58.150> more<00:01:58.420> cold<00:01:58.780> tolerant<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.530> than

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
are much more cold tolerant and than

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.070 
are much more cold tolerant and than
finding<00:02:00.400> out<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.729> particular<00:02:01.060> zuv<00:02:01.570> those<00:02:01.780> is

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
finding out the particular zuv those is

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.930 
finding out the particular zuv those is
so<00:02:02.290> again<00:02:02.560> take<00:02:02.800> some<00:02:03.040> more<00:02:03.220> research<00:02:03.580> that<00:02:03.909> I

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
so again take some more research that I

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.570 
so again take some more research that I
haven't<00:02:04.180> done<00:02:04.479> yet<00:02:04.690> but<00:02:05.650> one<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.070> things<00:02:06.340> I

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
haven't done yet but one of the things I

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.690 
haven't done yet but one of the things I
would<00:02:06.790> say<00:02:07.030> is<00:02:07.240> reach<00:02:07.540> out<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:08.489> Brandon<00:02:09.489> if

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
would say is reach out to Brandon if

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.940 
would say is reach out to Brandon if
you're<00:02:10.030> in<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.420> area<00:02:10.810> at<00:02:10.929> all<00:02:11.049> he<00:02:11.739> does

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
you're in that area at all he does

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.110 
you're in that area at all he does
design

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
design

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.149
