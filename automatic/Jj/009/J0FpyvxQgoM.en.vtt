00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
really great but since you didn't really

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.270 
really great but since you didn't really
know<00:02:31.540> what<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.750> expect<00:02:31.900> because<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.980> didn't

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280

was<00:02:38.650> way<00:02:38.860> better<00:02:38.920> than<00:02:39.489> twilight<00:02:40.319> because<00:02:41.319> it

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
was way better than twilight because it

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.940 
was way better than twilight because it
