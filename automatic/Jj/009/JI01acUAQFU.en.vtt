 second bouquet with the remains of 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.240
 flowers I always tell them not to throw 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.120
 to the trash what's left over because 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.610
 many times these favorites save us 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.470

 what are the prostheses also of the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.570
 nape and despise this I did it in a 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.990
 principle with the idea of ​​maybe giving them 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.690
 a little hand with respect to what they are 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.750
 the bouquets of the ladies in case 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.240
 have them but in the end the result is 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.260
 very beautiful and that can be used up 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.980
 as a bridal bouquet 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.910
 if they like it because it's a bunch 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.280
 Compact is more uncomplicated 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.980
 but very nice the truth is that to me 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.890
 I really liked it, I hope you like it and serve it 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.580

 flowers not necessarily roses but with 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.370
