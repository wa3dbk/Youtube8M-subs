00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.909
 Welcome to a teaching video about Luton 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.639
 I will tell them how the cycle works 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.549
 its basic idea is to accelerate charged particles in a circle 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.519
 to divert attention to a train 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.779
 and thus carry out further experiments 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.449
 but how do you manage to get shares around a bend or even in a circle? 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.519
 accelerate 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.669
 Let's start with the construction first 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.669
 in the middle of the cycle we can get a million 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.640
 and the seniors source are two you can tell the tour on the 10th 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.940
 Broder because the company looks like this 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.250
 the officials are pushed so close to each other 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.670
 better still a small gap between Fahrn 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.670
 The whole is then sealed by a vacuum chamber 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.940
 each on the top and bottom of the dream cycle 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.160
 There are electro magnets 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.170
 which sometimes weigh over a hundred tons 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.560
 next to the cycle of stands then high frequency generator 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.989
 the Andy this is connected 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.460
 and determine it on one 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.570
 Frequency supplied with alternating current 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.360
 Let us now turn to the mode of operation 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.610
 generate the electromagnetic at the top and bottom of the dreaming cycle 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.430
 a strong homogeneous magnetic field 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.490
 where frequency generator is put into operation 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.600
 and currently a positive at the dual 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 and the other negative 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.480
 PÃ¶s the well room drill well 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.820
 they act like a Faraday cage 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.870
 and thus prevent an electric field inside the DUH 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.330
 in the acceleration strip between them 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.290
 However, an electric field is formed 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.070
 in the further course observers electrons 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.510
 due to the negative electrical charge, 17 positively charged only migrate 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.640
 on 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.590
 as already mentioned, there is everywhere 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.560
 No no electric field 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.450
 Jokes only what the electron now feels is the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.680
 Initial speed has experienced this by the electrical attraction 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.220
 and the homogeneous magnetic field that is perpendicular to the wrong path 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.169
 So the electron is the Lawrence Croft 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.369
 The Lawrence Croft results when you load Kuhn with speed 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.089
 Mrs 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.379
 multiplied by the magnetic field strength b 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.870
 The direction of Lawrence Croft can be with the three fingers rule the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.159
 left hand at negative 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.560
 Pole of the right hand when positively charged 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.549
 see wrong 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.219
 because in this example electronics 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.089
 consider the three tenors 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:37.010
 the thumb points in the direction 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.889
 the electrons are moving at the moment 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.379
 The index finger is directed to the magnetic field lines 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.469
 which in this case run from bottom to top 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.469
 the middle finger showed in the hour Lawrence Croft 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.559
 by the three fingers rule we know now 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.510
 that the electron is deflected to the left as long 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.419
 is again in the acceleration gap comes 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.789
 At the same time, the high-frequency generators console tours 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.119
 so that the electron starts up again 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.659
 because that electrons 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.639
 now at a higher speed in London where 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:11.689
 the entry 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.879
 But the Lawrence Croft gets stronger 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.879
 but the distance covered in the hallways is even greater 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.939
 but what does that mean for the frequency 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.549
 the frequency is of little interest 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.329
 it does not have to be changed in the course of the experiment 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.509
 because the sign is faster but also on further way 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.650
 come at a certain point on the edge of the cycle 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.329
 that there are those last by a positively charged condensate but there 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.520
 filed and thus leaves the wrong circles schwalm-eder 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.139
 Basically, that's how the Superb works
