all<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.549> data<00:01:14.760> back<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:15.540> talk<00:01:15.720> about

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
all the data back and then talk about

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.060 
all the data back and then talk about
doing<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> editing<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.770> stuff<00:01:16.830> behind

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
doing all the editing and stuff behind

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.770 
doing all the editing and stuff behind
so<00:01:17.790> that's<00:01:17.939> why<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> takes<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.659> bit

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
so that's why it takes a little bit

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.120 
so that's why it takes a little bit
longer<00:01:18.990> than<00:01:19.259> any<00:01:19.380> release<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.770> look<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:19.979> it

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
longer than any release it look like it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.910 
longer than any release it look like it
