00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
for flavor steamed vegetables are great

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.990 
for flavor steamed vegetables are great
but<00:02:14.410> now<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.650> add<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.130> flavor<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.910> the

but now you add that flavor of the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.729 
but now you add that flavor of the
charcoal<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:17.170> really<00:02:17.470> makes<00:02:17.650> a

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
charcoal to it it really makes a

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.500 
charcoal to it it really makes a
difference<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.280> think<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.880> key<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.180> making

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
difference I think the key to making

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.180 
difference I think the key to making
