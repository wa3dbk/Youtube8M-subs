goals<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.150> all<00:00:24.150> rights<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.510> first<00:00:24.720> type

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
goals for you all rights the first type

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.720 
goals for you all rights the first type
of<00:00:25.019> goal<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.380> against<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.010> grain<00:00:26.250> these<00:00:26.580> are

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
of goal is against the grain these are

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.169 
of goal is against the grain these are
sort<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.970> new<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.210> NHL<00:00:28.140> 13<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.150> a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
sort of new to NHL 13 so it just is a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.440 
sort of new to NHL 13 so it just is a
matter<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:31.430> basically<00:00:32.430> shooting<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
matter of basically shooting in the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.760 
matter of basically shooting in the
opposite<00:00:33.899> direction<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.380> you're<00:00:34.469> skating

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
opposite direction that you're skating

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.000 
opposite direction that you're skating
so<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.790> use<00:00:35.969> vision<00:00:36.360> control<00:00:36.860> you<00:00:37.860> can

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
so if you use vision control you can

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.459 
so if you use vision control you can
really<00:00:38.219> get<00:00:38.879> these<00:00:39.030> goals<00:00:39.329> important<00:00:42.320> it's<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
really get these goals important it's a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.779 
really get these goals important it's a
good<00:00:43.620> way<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.739> practice<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.579> sort<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
good way to practice that just sort of

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.900 
good way to practice that just sort of
killing<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.420> corners<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.910> using

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
killing out of the corners and using

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400 
killing out of the corners and using
vision<00:00:48.180> control<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.629> skate<00:00:48.840> backwards<00:00:49.020> across

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
vision control to skate backwards across

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
vision control to skate backwards across
the<00:00:49.739> ice<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.850> throw<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> puck

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the ice and then just throw the puck

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.240 
the ice and then just throw the puck
into<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.289> opposite<00:00:52.980> side<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> net<00:00:55.039> so<00:00:56.039> far

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
into the opposite side the net so far

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.410 
into the opposite side the net so far
this<00:00:56.399> actually<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:56.940> been<00:00:57.120> really<00:00:57.239> effective

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
this actually have been really effective

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.590 
this actually have been really effective
in<00:00:57.870> NHL<00:00:58.230> 13<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> definitely<00:01:00.000> learn<00:01:00.239> how<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> do

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
in NHL 13 so definitely learn how to do

in NHL 13 so definitely learn how to do
those<00:01:00.750> goals<00:01:08.240> next<00:01:09.240> type<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.750> I've<00:01:09.869> got<00:01:10.080> is

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
those goals next type of all I've got is

those goals next type of all I've got is
Robin<00:01:11.100> goal<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.790> call<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.299> Robin<00:01:12.600> Bowl

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
Robin goal and I call the Robin Bowl

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.320 
Robin goal and I call the Robin Bowl
because<00:01:13.040> they<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.400> nastiest<00:01:15.119> you

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
because they are the nastiest you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.050 
because they are the nastiest you
can<00:01:15.509> score<00:01:16.220> it's<00:01:17.220> actually<00:01:17.340> named<00:01:17.670> after<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
can score it's actually named after a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
can score it's actually named after a
buddy<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.360> mine<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.960> only<00:01:19.080> score<00:01:19.439> garbage

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
buddy of mine you can only score garbage

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.880 
buddy of mine you can only score garbage
boat<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.990> sort<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> involved<00:01:22.740> like

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
boat so you sort of involved like

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.859 
boat so you sort of involved like
killing<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> from<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> corners<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.570> getting

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
killing it from the corners and getting

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.460 
killing it from the corners and getting
those<00:01:24.990> snails<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.710> glitch<00:01:25.979> goals<00:01:27.470> something

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
those snails to glitch goals something

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.149 
those snails to glitch goals something
like<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:30.350> they're<00:01:31.350> quite<00:01:31.530> easy<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> defend

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
like this they're quite easy to defend

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.580 
like this they're quite easy to defend
against<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.729> long<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.210> should<00:01:33.479> stay<00:01:34.470> in

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
against so long as you should stay in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.640 
against so long as you should stay in
the<00:01:34.680> corners<00:01:34.979> internet<00:01:35.720> but<00:01:36.720> definitely<00:01:37.500> very

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the corners internet but definitely very

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.469 
the corners internet but definitely very
annoying<00:01:37.979> goals<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.520> scored<00:01:38.790> again<00:01:38.939> soon

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.690 

and<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.840> next<00:01:43.079> type<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.380> goal<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.799> short<00:01:44.250> cycle

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and the next type of goal is short cycle

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.420 
and the next type of goal is short cycle
so<00:01:44.970> these<00:01:45.090> always<00:01:45.329> sort<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.689> involve<00:01:46.189> d<00:01:47.189> king

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
so these always sort of involve d king

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.130 
so these always sort of involve d king
and<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:47.880> sort<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.420> waiting<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.930> goalie

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and then sort of waiting for the goalie

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.819 
and then sort of waiting for the goalie
to<00:01:49.439> make<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> move<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.829> short

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
to make a move and going for the short

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.690 
to make a move and going for the short
side<00:01:53.100> holmen's<00:01:54.060> got<00:01:54.360> open<00:01:55.310> these<00:01:56.310> girls<00:01:56.549> are

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
side holmen's got open these girls are

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.270 
side holmen's got open these girls are
really<00:01:56.850> good<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.320> one<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.439> those<00:01:58.560> situations

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
really good in one on those situations

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.050 
really good in one on those situations
breakaways

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.690 

as<00:02:04.720> well<00:02:04.990> as<00:02:05.170> she<00:02:05.770> download<00:02:06.159> that<00:02:06.399> sort<00:02:06.670> of

as well as she download that sort of
thing<00:02:08.340> they<00:02:09.340> are<00:02:09.459> always<00:02:09.610> involving<00:02:10.119> sort<00:02:10.390> of

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
thing they are always involving sort of

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.059 
thing they are always involving sort of
like<00:02:10.599> one<00:02:10.840> sort<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.200> deep<00:02:11.530> just<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:11.860> get<00:02:12.010> the

like one sort of deep just to get the
goalie<00:02:12.250> moving<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.940> then<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.080> quickly<00:02:14.349> tuck

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
in the past him some of them are a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.940 
in the past him some of them are a
little<00:02:34.209> bit<00:02:34.540> flukey<00:02:34.989> but<00:02:35.170> most<00:02:35.410> some<00:02:35.680> are

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
little bit flukey but most some are
