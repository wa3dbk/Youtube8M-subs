00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.870
 hello everyone here are the products for the 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.550
 body that I used in recent months that 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.000
 I liked which I would like 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:20.180
 talk then this body oil I have it 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.870
 bought from the cores that is a supermarket 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.730
 of organic and natural products 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.090
 finds here in Italy also here in 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.340
 genova is not one very close to home e 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.620
 I had a discount because there is a card 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.710
 in points of course with discounts and I have 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.790
 bought this original oil the oil 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.120
 white birch stimulates the system 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.920
 lymphatic eliminate toxins 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.680
 I liked this oil that has base 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.800
 sweet almonds with so many oils 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.800
 essential draining inside a 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:00.160
 sweet almond and sesame oil base e 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:08.030
 then lemon ginger with turmeric 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:11.000
 these are the ingredients i hope ok of 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.960
 having them focused and I liked it 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.150
 this oil costs more than 18 19 euros 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.650
 at full price I'm talking about the price 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.560
 full so it costs a little more than 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.320
 the sails from the sails of the birch oil 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.240
 which is very good fabulous leaves 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.890
 legs really with a silky skin 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.600
 But I also liked this is the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.950
 most practical dispenser because it has a 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.900
 spray dispenser and I left it on 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.460
 doser from there in the bathroom because I have it 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.189
 a little bit more to finish the bottle 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.369
 it is very united, however, if you have it 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.290
 the discount card points will Ecor 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.240
 I recommend trying it because it's not bad 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.280
 certainly sorry a little 20 euros 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.770
 for a base of sweet almond oil 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.140
 so I would tell you to develop one 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.610
 wisdom on essential oils so as to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:04.160
 dial you your one 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:07.400
 and targeted anti-cellulite oil try the 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.740
 essential oils observed in the effects 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.840
 on your body look at what i am 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.700
 most effective for you and make up a 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.340
 single oil 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.550
 if this topic interests you in 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.550
 future 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.890
 let's say I can write a post about mine 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.930
 blog www holistic ario dot com e 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.020
 maybe put together a wording 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.060
 to make an oil an anti oil 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.090
 cellulite or a draining oil 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.670
 for the swollen legs and in short for us 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.860
 who stays a long time so long 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.500
 most likely sitting at women 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.420
 who do these shop jobs always 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.810
 standing or in the office always sitting 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.610
 will be problems of swollen legs then a 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.459
 other oil closed for the body both for 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.160
 me that for the baby that now a boy 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.959
 this is the oil of sweet almond oil 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.780
 sweet almond butterfly which I had 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.400
 bought his cover for convenience for 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.230
 comfort because green 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.769
 deliver the products directly to your home 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.080
 but yours is always an almond oil 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.090
 homemade desserts or butterflies 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.900
 in short, the brand is not important enough 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.730
 that it is organic and cold pressed 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.620
 then I used this peeling which is not 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.209
 a novelty if you follow this channel of 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.920
 sails from a shower peeling completely 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.690
 natural and works well very good e 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.580
 as good and cheaper as 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.700
 Homemade peeling with simple 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.599
 sugar and an oil of your choice between 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.090
 sometimes you don't even have time to do it again 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.549
 the recipes are so simple and so 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.030
 in short, sometimes you buy i 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:51.430
 ready-made first courses already beautiful and made 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.340
 then I finished this soap of 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.319
 coop that 100 per 100 vegetable you 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.989
 you know that now the coop has understood the 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.630
 trend of entirely natural products 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.940
 to a whole line of green products and 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.760
 then also of the soaps completely 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.980
 organic vegetables are good I use them 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.459
 for the whole body for rice sometimes 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.630
 even for the hair with successfully 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.039
 in short, without contraindications 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:21.190
 details you know that I am 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:24.100
 minimalist so did not want to cumulate e 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.960
 take extra products even if I can 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.510
 become even better at it 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.450
 because in reality I still buy too many i 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.720
 tricks I buy a few tricks but always 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.550
 too many for how little I don't 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.270
 I make up every day I leave a lot of it 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.820
 skin as free as now 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.830
 and then in short and then I show three 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.960
 essential oils 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.690
 that there are almost always in my house that 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.600
 really really happy to use e 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.720

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.060

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.000

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.660
 the brands you want of flora to mention 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.520

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.400
 what i use this oil 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.890

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:16.060

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:35.040
 essential of lemon grass that I use 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.820
 for basically to buy from 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:45.990
 only an entirely natural deodorant 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:50.040

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.170

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.930
 give a boost of energy for 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.300
 feeling a little sparkling and then like 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.300
 deodorant put in a base oil a 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.160

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.720
 I finished this essential oil that it was 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.610
 that of flora frangipani and I have it 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.380
 used primarily to perfume i 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.880
 hair 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.850
 I'll show you the bottle why 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:26.460
 too much too pretty and this voice 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:28.860
 flora tamini with its dropper 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.790
 frangipani is to be understood a 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:36.390
 slightly white floret already 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:38.790
 yellowish and is what makes up the 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.980
 famous wreaths wreaths of flowers there

 typical dessert of the white flowers 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.790
 in short, that brings a big smile 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:59.280
 and that helps to counter moods e 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:02.790
 from a delicious scent to hair 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.410
