00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 Hello everyone, welcome this new one 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.540
 video 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.500
 minecraft pocket edition 0.5.0 theme with 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.330
 the novelty the first are the paintings like 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.599
 now you see this glau here 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.640
 instead of exactly like the computer 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.560
 makes light I say instead I put there 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.939
 paintings are exactly the same as the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.510
 pc version 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:32.759
 just that those between three are missing here 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:34.079
 they are all there and there are melons and not 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.960
 I have no idea how you are keeping in 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.399
 survival mode 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.680
 these have almost all grown this 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.370
 can not small of these instead are i 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.590
 melons ready too from 3 to 7 melons then 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.360
 this is the rector of the mater the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.250
 little temple of the tower of nat laughing 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.160
 as you see below the block added 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.079
 of grass in the creative inventory then how 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:07.280
 you see was added glau stone e 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:09.869
 terre actor the paintings and ipam king sid 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.549
 fuck the leaves sex names 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.670
 then this is you do klaus 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.040
 enough light is found in the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.110
 subspecies to put this reactor 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.030
 instead of people on the subject that yes 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.500
 can do on survival us 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.970
 let us make species of temple 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.979
 we click and go to a dimension 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.240
 full of zombies big man there 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.650
 they want to go out not yesterday as you are 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.680
 Also your part in the video I 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.360
 seen it was not there we will see it does not think 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.009
 not even to have gold in my world on 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.170
 then the march not farming that when that 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.579
 in the dark the mushrooms these mushrooms 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.170
 grow 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.170
 so we close down here 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.720
 ok let's put a mushroom and in theory after yes 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.130
 should then spread naturally i 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.520
 mushrooms grow everywhere yes 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.530
 this was spreading all this is the 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.900
 melon instead you can see though 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.840
 dark then we pass lover survival 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.340
 to my world where I show you 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.230
 zombie p how sorry but the power of attorney 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.860
 to be reviewed 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.510
 first the bar has been moved 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.480
 of health in the upper left 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.440
 this thing I like for nothing ok then 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.220
 now we sleep that there are monsters 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.070
 near so I show you the 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.840
 Crafty click crafting have been 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.550
 added rag austria mind in check 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.080
 the dust is the fact to put the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.910
 contrary to many and 6 gold bars 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.120
 trapdoors told me they have already been 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.209
 added in the last version of the app 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.239
 dated to the point 4 people 2 but not me 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.010
 seems to have tried it but nothing here not 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.750
 melon seeds were added 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.380
 so in my opinion they just can't be found 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.530
 in survival and the cadres 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.840
 here they are the paintings that a game of wool 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.010
 and 8 toothpicks exactly like the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.780
 pc version 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.320
 then we move on to the bug fixes now no 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.640
 expect 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.950
 now we will get more food 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.769
 therefore worth a bit of food here 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:38.760
 on the other side the food 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:40.800
 so the food we see is a steak 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.820
 Ok we'll see 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.080
 in the last version it gave me heart 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:55.500
 now it 's much better 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:57.420
 and then then I must admit German 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.810
 moment in peaceful if I can not 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.810
 to sleep 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.540
 now sleeping there will return 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.040
 they will return, hearts will return 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.640
 in fact now I will wake up to have it all 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.810
 the full bar in fact that forecast of 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.910
 you the fog has been reduced now 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.850
 I'll show you in fact I can see 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.430
 much of geography and in the world 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.300
 I see a lot row also try to 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.300
 process is as above 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:34.770
 also because to test a new one 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:38.700
 new bug fix that I hope is true yes yes 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:43.290
 you see a lot more 28 June now I throw myself 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:46.669
 then they would be suicidal 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:50.460
 because I want to see and have said that 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.230
 i make morivo lamis pona goes much more 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.480
 above I measured above all of the 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.180
 my big boy and now in theory I owe myself 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.950
 answer him about the bed because then I have 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.120
 always get down to always have to 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.250
 operational of races I died histoia they 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.260
 we dispose of at home finally do not lose 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.690
 more life when I have to answer is now 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.450
 there are objects to answer me 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.380
 also some bug fixes for example now 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.210
 even objects when we die not 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:29.400
 all remain our point but on 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:31.320
 family then when every so often I play that 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.840
 left when mommy loaded him 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.700
 success very often interiano her that 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.280
 then animals do not happen 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.430
 by now they saved a map this not 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.620
 it seems to me that it has changed because 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.980
 it's not true of animals now I'm going to look 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.730
 two is now easier to get into 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.130
 beds 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.150
 it was time because it was impossible to get into it 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.640
 first but this is not a bug fix this 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.930
 this time for 60 members still alone 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.400
 which then did nothing to do 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.860
 something for those as described on 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.120
 what did inter 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.170
 anyway thanks to all my 96 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.240
 subscribers 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:10.280
 then a lot more bug fixes are 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.460
 important is that when they used it 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.460
 hoe 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.770
 the blog will block the seeds of the wheat to the 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.480
 place to drop over the block 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.150
 We could not find under the block 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.410
 take them that happened to me even in the 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:32.300
 tutorial I did to take i 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:37.460
 seeds I would not say that I would say that I said 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:39.230
 all naturally omit the video of 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.820
 my download description download 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:48.500
 direct without having or wanting genre me 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:50.450
 write like you put yourself I like and 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.400
 subscribe 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:56.120
 look at my gameplay by di monica 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.970
 that computer having nothing fast 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.370
 but now I don't think this is alone 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.500
 diamonds and iron 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:07.720
 in fact only iron diamond why 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.720
 maybe if one day I will find more than gold 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.729
 I will show you the reactor bye bye to 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.599
