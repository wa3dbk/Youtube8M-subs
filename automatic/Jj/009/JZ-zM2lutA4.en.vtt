00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.240
 Welcome to the jockey utv i 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.340
 am john keller and today is turning 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.880
 all about the question I am the first 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.349
 Sometime in the studio what I do everywhere 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.120
 so the whole pumped up guys and me 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.510
 I'm afraid I do not want to dare 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.689
 not so now I come and say makes 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 It just goes in the wrists and 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.789
 trained like the bad big states 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.260
 guys my should take a first 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.090
 seek competent help 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.440
 with the man of you accordingly 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.300
 either in training 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.059
 permanently accompanied and training partner 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 and personal trainer or you asked 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.700
 trainer of my training plan 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.100
 write or whatever on everyone 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.930
 In the beginning, you should start correctly 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.850
 train and train properly 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.800
 does not mean anywhere in the whole 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.680
 equipment rusel goes into the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.390
 free trade corner where the whole 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.840
 inflated guys are and do yours 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.960
 thing 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.260
 do not be afraid they were all too 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.730
 They did not start that way 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.199
 so everyone had to start somehow 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.689
 work your way up and if there is somebody 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.729
 times rumo with 300 kilo then follows 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.360
 he has earned it then with 39 kilos around 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.130
 to handle 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.720
 nobody can easily change from one day to the next 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.600
 so lift 300 kilograms 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.950
 that is when you start and you trust 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.630
 Do not really press yourself too hard 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.970
 because just because someone was there 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.299
 with 150 at the bank after cemat input 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.530
 just pressed 110 and then you come 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.329
 and pushes 30 does not need to be afraid 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.799
 why why it's about you 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.780
 your training for your goals 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.280
 that means you should just go 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.530
 really work out 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.590
 go and just do not give 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.640
 just sphinx the rest of the time 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.740
 hide out world 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.780
 in doubt, even the judicial 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.729
 most boys are pumped up 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.450
 they will be yours if they are not 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.790
 Just jumping around on something like that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.950
 Most of the guys are right 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.840
 can help in the training and the also 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.579
 can ask and the people that the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.210
 The boys are also seriously active 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.220
 in doubt sometimes help too 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.500
 step or support accordingly 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.360
 and do not just laugh because you 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.560
 third of that pushes what the press 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.680
 or pull or whatever 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.810
 That means go to the studio is looking for you 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.480
 your competent help you in the plan 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.540
 do or you in the training generally the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.740
 accompanied all the time 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.320
 and then it goes to the people 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.240
 she asks it's it's nobody 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.400
 granted to ask for help 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.770
 that means you jump over your own 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.120
 shadow goes in the direction of the corner 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.270

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.450
