00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.619
 ideas, I'm coming back here to hit 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.010
 I chat with my readers and 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:37.080

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.530

 well-known books and have my 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.080
 also the chronicles of the end of 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.630
 the world came out in April 2013 has had a 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.030
 very great success with the readers is 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.890
 A great novel talking about is how 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.410
 says the title in the chronicles of the end of 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.380
 world at night damn one night when 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.539
 half the world 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.160
 half asleep fell asleep 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.729
 and people wake up to live with it 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.369
 huh 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.319
 What's more, it's just that first night. 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.190
 also dropped all the systems of 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:45.890
 common telecommunications 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.060
 internet radio television had no way 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.230
 of the person knowing what was happening 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.130
 on the street above unless she was 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.960
 up the street and find out if what was 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.460
 happening there in another neighborhood 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.920
 later in history, the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.000
 vampires then the perfect setting for 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.220
 end of the world 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 today here in a handful of ideas I will 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:12.290
 Talk is with you answering questions. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.560
 of the former are writers who are 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.050
 there at a crossroads with doubts and 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.810
 have written and left the question 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.470
 comments from episode 2 a handful of 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.110
 ideas is the first one I'm going to answer 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:33.200
 and luiz fernando is Luiz Felipe 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:37.490
 barreto and also elton sdl are the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.500
 initials ah his last name make a 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.510
 very similar question ask questions 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.020
 very similar, right? 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:49.400
 if you have so many ideas at the same time 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.110
 time they all seem more legal 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.810
 than the one you chose to 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.500
 work at the moment how to concentrate 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.590
 what you are writing and the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.019
 The question and very similar question is to have 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.930
 ideas for a short period of time. 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:09.380
 and how to deal with this flood of 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.850
 10 and stay focused on the book you 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.769
 You are writing to and precisely to 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.330
 answering this question again 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.910
 remember that story of the first 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.950
 passion episode is you have to elect 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.370
 a title you're passionate about 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.640
 compromise with him is also to end 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.440
 that this narrative finish this book 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.320
 Can I go for another idea? 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.570
 eventually an idea that has it goes 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.440
 burn in your mind more than that 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.840
 book that is working is advice 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.050
 that I give listen to discuss if you have 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.739
 more in love with a new idea leaves 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.980
 to leave that creative flow is to go 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.650
 Go there, pro 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.060
 type of text and see how far you 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.860
 reach right 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.019
 to where it is contaminated by that 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.790
 story you suddenly end up 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:06.360
 book is before the other it already happened 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.620
 It's possible with me and with 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.629
 many people 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.780
 which will determine in which story 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.640
 you go to work is your passion exists 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.530
 a trap too 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:23.550
 if you have good ideas and always 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:27.479
 lot is thinking activating 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.090
 is there and does not let your 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.280
 your work your main book has a 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.919
 portion lot of good ideas not one 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.210
 free run will not do devotion 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.199
 published author 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.110
 you need to run your ideas have a 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:47.370
 a good principle is to choose the book that 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.220
 I want to write the name, it's done. 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.330
 task will consume months perhaps in 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:58.530
 some cases it consumes 100 years it is 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.810
 you have to focus and index if your 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.810
 Then you come back to 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.590
 in love all over again and I will write 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:11.639
 is another question that has been asked in 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.240
 reviews was geovane garcia's as 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.240
 do you balance narratives with 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.240
 dialogues 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.200
 this is a very particular thing of 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.250
 each author is difficult I do not have one 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.560
 something I know to put 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.900
 here in words because it is something that 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:36.270
 Do you feel when you're saying show? 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.889
 balance is the amount of dialogue 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.729
 which should have 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.409
 verse the amount of narrative nÃ© 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.639
 this is a thing a balance that the 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:50.460
 author even in account something else is you 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:54.569
 realize the narrative tone you 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.590
 you are using and the dialog 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.659
 will use 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.840
 for me who determines the tone of the dialogue 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:03.930
 it's the characters you're going to follow 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.120
 the lifestyle you have designed to 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.060
 that character she is going to talk about 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.279
 according to a role it plays 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.710
 if you have a doctor you will have a failure 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:16.439
 technical and inside the hospital and can 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.270
 be more relaxed when they had to 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:21.300
 to live socially was a bar with 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.969
 friends if you have a character that is 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.520
 fisherman will study the jargon of 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:29.460
 fishermen as they talk about what 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.219
 they talk is to have the likelihood 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:37.379
 happened the character opens his mouth 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:39.330
 is speaking something coherent or 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:41.339
 always the characters do it neither 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.400
 always consistent 

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:46.919
 if you're going to use profanity not all of this 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.139
 depends a lot on the character in my 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:51.120
 books when the curse happens in 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.699
 when a character is speaking 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.149
 if you're the kind of person who would 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:07:01.259
 accuses the curse is colloquially is like 

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:02.939
 one speaks not talk on a daily basis is 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:05.819
 That's it for today.
