00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:32.480
 It's very important that we keep the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.590
 Foot done because not give it a rest 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:40.770

 that he gave me the whole picture of the match 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.160
 football he took me to all 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.210
 places of the world 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:04.200
 my foot is now and then once in a while 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.160
 when she takes some pets that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.670
 when she cuts there beach walk 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.280
 also forgive because it's a long time we 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.560
 we met working with me already 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.050
 a lot of time then every once in a while 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:27.800
 When she hurts then this is a 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:31.380

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.810
 moments of the most peaceful moments in 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.840

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.050
 health care is also very important 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.830
 in every part of the body but it is one thing 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.830
 well laid out a very quiet thing
