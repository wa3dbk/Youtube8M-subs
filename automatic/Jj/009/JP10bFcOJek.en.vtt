the<00:00:42.510> Chinese<00:00:42.840> packaging<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:44.399> was<00:00:44.520> worth

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the Chinese packaging but it was worth

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.360 
the Chinese packaging but it was worth
it<00:00:44.969> because<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> Lee<00:00:46.140> only<00:00:46.350> cost<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.739> 195

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and that price is right this time

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.680 
and that price is right this time
because<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> last<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.610> wrong<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.510> my

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
should have a look at the lead so I just

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.780 
should have a look at the lead so I just
Carlo<00:01:22.110> Haarlem<00:01:22.530> ripped<00:01:22.710> open<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.700> was

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
Carlo Haarlem ripped open because it was

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.429 
Carlo Haarlem ripped open because it was
Layton's<00:01:24.210> concentrate<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.080> because<00:01:25.320> of

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
Layton's concentrate for it because of

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.630 
Layton's concentrate for it because of
the<00:01:25.530> plastic<00:01:25.710> obviously<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.430> gonna<00:01:26.549> be

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the plastic obviously it's gonna be

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.200 
the plastic obviously it's gonna be
really<00:01:26.850> awkward<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.270> open<00:01:28.189> but<00:01:29.189> yeah<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.970> think

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
really awkward to open but yeah I think

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.319 
really awkward to open but yeah I think
this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.750> zero<00:01:30.990> point<00:01:31.079> two<00:01:31.439> meters<00:01:31.770> long<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.299> I

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
this is zero point two meters long so I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.140 
this is zero point two meters long so I
something<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.659> was<00:01:33.840> measurements<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.290> it

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
something that was measurements of it

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.819 
something that was measurements of it
yeah<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.479> see<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.409> side<00:01:37.590> I'm

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
yeah as you can see that's the side I'm

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.230 
yeah as you can see that's the side I'm
showing<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.400> camera<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.000> where<00:01:39.180> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
showing for the camera now is where you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.249
