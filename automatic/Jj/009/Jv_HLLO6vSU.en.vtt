00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.819 
tools gonna need that just to take off
some<00:00:39.819> things<00:00:39.999> especially<00:00:40.690> I<00:00:41.229> think<00:00:41.499> my<00:00:41.649> back

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
some things especially I think my back

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.180

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and suppose take off one of the fairings

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.410 
and suppose take off one of the fairings
so<00:00:45.190> I'll<00:00:45.309> need<00:00:45.460> those<00:00:45.639> Allen<00:00:45.909> wrenches<00:00:46.210> up

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
so I'll need those Allen wrenches up

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.069 
so I'll need those Allen wrenches up
there<00:00:46.629> then<00:00:47.489> obviously<00:00:48.489> just<00:00:49.059> normal<00:00:49.659> sockets

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
there then obviously just normal sockets

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.629 
there then obviously just normal sockets

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
pounds of torque that I will be needing

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.459 
pounds of torque that I will be needing
to<00:01:08.380> tighten<00:01:09.130> everything<00:01:09.219> to<00:01:09.670> UM<00:01:10.289> some<00:01:11.289> other

well I guess it has a filter on the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.300 
well I guess it has a filter on the
bottom<00:02:25.170> which<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.560> actually<00:02:25.650> think<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.100> pretty

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
foot-pounds tortilla then another thing

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.670 
foot-pounds tortilla then another thing
that<00:04:05.520> I'm<00:04:05.610> using<00:04:05.850> which<00:04:06.420> actually<00:04:06.750> used

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
that I'm using which actually used

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.430 
that I'm using which actually used
before<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.459> really<00:04:09.000> convenient<00:04:09.510> is<00:04:09.870> this

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
before and is really convenient is this

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.240 
before and is really convenient is this
role<00:04:10.680> stand<00:04:10.980> um<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.880> lot<00:04:12.239> of<00:04:12.360> people<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.810> know

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
role stand um a lot of people you know

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.880 
role stand um a lot of people you know
probably<00:04:14.250> use<00:04:14.489> rear<00:04:14.760> stands<00:04:15.300> to<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:16.500> lube

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
probably use rear stands to to lube

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.199 
probably use rear stands to to lube
their<00:04:17.100> chain<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.520> stop<00:04:17.669> just<00:04:17.880> so<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.030> tire

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
their chain and stop just so the tire

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.479 
their chain and stop just so the tire
can<00:04:18.239> move<00:04:18.510> freely<00:04:18.690> but<00:04:19.109> pretty<00:04:19.859> much<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.340> best

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
can move freely but pretty much the best

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.210 
can move freely but pretty much the best

450 so this one works um this was only
thirty<00:04:57.690> bucks<00:04:57.930> okay<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.220> what<00:04:59.340> it<00:04:59.460> does<00:04:59.580> is

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
thirty bucks okay and what it does is

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.940 
thirty bucks okay and what it does is
your<00:04:59.940> tire<00:05:00.120> sits<00:05:00.510> you<00:05:00.810> know<00:05:00.900> on<00:05:01.139> here<00:05:01.410> like<00:05:01.590> so

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
and then you can move the tat wall it

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.830 
and then you can move the tat wall it
doesn't<00:05:04.950> move<00:05:05.040> extremely<00:05:05.430> freely<00:05:06.060> but<00:05:06.240> if<00:05:06.720> you

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
doesn't move extremely freely but if you

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.150 
doesn't move extremely freely but if you
move<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.110> with<00:05:07.200> your<00:05:07.320> foot<00:05:07.500> moves<00:05:07.800> pretty<00:05:07.919> easy

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
move it with your foot moves pretty easy

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.800 
move it with your foot moves pretty easy
still<00:05:08.490> but<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.090> move<00:05:09.270> your<00:05:09.419> time<00:05:09.570> in<00:05:09.690> there
