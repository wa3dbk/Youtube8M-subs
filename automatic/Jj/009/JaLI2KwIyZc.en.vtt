I've been playing around with animating

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.730 
I've been playing around with animating
software<00:05:03.790> myself<00:05:04.360> so<00:05:05.050> that<00:05:05.230> I<00:05:05.320> can<00:05:05.500> start

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
software myself so that I can start

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.100 
software myself so that I can start
animating<00:05:06.280> maybe<00:05:06.880> some<00:05:07.210> of<00:05:07.330> my<00:05:07.420> story<00:05:07.750> times

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110
