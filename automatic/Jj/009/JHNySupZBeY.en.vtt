delivering from the case in perfect

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.209 
delivering from the case in perfect
casein<00:01:31.659> is<00:01:31.810> also<00:01:32.140> optimal<00:01:32.649> so<00:01:32.829> that<00:01:32.950> makes<00:01:33.130> it

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
casein is also optimal so that makes it

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.120 
casein is also optimal so that makes it
optimal<00:01:33.640> for<00:01:33.850> our<00:01:33.909> pre-bedtime<00:01:34.479> yep<00:01:35.319> and

optimal for our pre-bedtime yep and
everything<00:01:36.520> else<00:01:36.729> makes<00:01:36.969> it<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.179> best

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
everything else makes it the best

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.239 
everything else makes it the best
protein<00:01:37.569> for<00:01:38.020> pre<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.350> post-workout<00:01:38.679> you

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.249 
protein for pre and post-workout you

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.279 
protein for pre and post-workout you
know<00:01:39.399> take<00:01:39.609> it<00:01:39.729> upon<00:01:39.969> waking<00:01:40.450> yep<00:01:40.899> basically

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
know take it upon waking yep basically

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.169 
know take it upon waking yep basically
you<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.770> it's<00:01:42.009> very<00:01:42.069> versatile<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:42.909> can<00:01:42.939> use

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
you can it's very versatile you can use

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.300 
you can it's very versatile you can use
at<00:01:43.329> any<00:01:43.450> time<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.840> day<00:01:44.020> that's<00:01:44.590> right<00:01:44.859> it<00:01:45.069> gets
