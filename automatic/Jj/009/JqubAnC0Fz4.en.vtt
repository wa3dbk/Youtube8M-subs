you<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:34.050> hear<00:00:34.200> me<00:00:34.649> say<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.520> think<00:00:35.670> they

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
you to hear me say this but I think they

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.380 
you to hear me say this but I think they
make<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.750> great<00:00:37.020> point<00:00:37.260> times<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.250> changed<00:00:38.390> we

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
make a great point times have changed we

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.780 
make a great point times have changed we
do<00:00:39.570> need<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.750> broaden<00:00:40.079> our<00:00:40.290> peel<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.640> need

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
do need to broaden our peel and we need

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.090 
do need to broaden our peel and we need
to<00:00:41.820> change<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.540> way<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.320> talk<00:00:43.590> about<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
to change the way that we talk about the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.209 
to change the way that we talk about the
family<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:45.329> ultimately<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.649> critics<00:00:46.980> have

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
family but ultimately the critics have

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.270 
family but ultimately the critics have
it<00:00:47.370> exactly<00:00:47.940> backwards<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:49.559> problem<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.129> not

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it exactly backwards the problem is not

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.010 
it exactly backwards the problem is not
that<00:00:50.340> conservatives<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.270> focused<00:00:51.719> too<00:00:51.989> much

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
that conservatives have focused too much

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.299 
that conservatives have focused too much
on<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:53.010> family<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:54.030> far<00:00:54.449> too<00:00:54.780> little<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
on the family but far too little so I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.479 
on the family but far too little so I
think<00:00:56.460> Louis<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> kind<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.570> an<00:00:57.719> issue<00:00:57.870> of

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
think Louis this is kind of an issue of

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.029 
think Louis this is kind of an issue of
quality<00:00:59.489> versus<00:01:00.449> quantity<00:01:00.649> they<00:01:01.649> have

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
quality versus quantity they have

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.670 
quality versus quantity they have
focused<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.090> fact<00:01:03.390> so-called<00:01:04.229> family

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
focused on it in fact so-called family

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.710 
focused on it in fact so-called family
values<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.549> been<00:01:05.610> almost<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.180> exclusive

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
values have been almost the exclusive

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.140 
values have been almost the exclusive
focus<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.409> many<00:01:07.830> right-wing<00:01:08.189> groups<00:01:08.640> it's

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
focus of many right-wing groups it's

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.940 
focus of many right-wing groups it's
just<00:01:09.479> all<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.869> wrong<00:01:10.080> ways<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.799> they've

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
just all the wrong ways that they've

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.620

there was more focus on the family from
the<00:02:00.689> right<00:02:00.869> wing<00:02:01.079> from<00:02:01.290> those<00:02:01.500> from<00:02:01.829> these

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the right wing from those from these

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.789 
the right wing from those from these
so-called<00:02:02.189> Values<00:02:02.850> Voters<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> only

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
so-called Values Voters I think the only

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.649

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
sure it's it's really tough to figure

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.959 
sure it's it's really tough to figure
out<00:02:32.819> but<00:02:32.849> i<00:02:33.359> think<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.609> the

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
out but i think that the if if the

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.149 
out but i think that the if if the
argument<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.719> going<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.139> be<00:02:37.319> that

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
argument is going to be that

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.759 
argument is going to be that
conservative<00:02:38.909> values<00:02:39.599> voters<00:02:40.019> need<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.500> focus

conservative values voters need to focus

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.459 
conservative values voters need to focus
more<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.730> family<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.750> has<00:02:43.139> to<00:02:43.319> be<00:02:43.349> a

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469 
more on the family it has to be a

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.949 
more on the family it has to be a
different<00:02:43.889> type<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:44.099> focus<00:02:44.639> or<00:02:44.909> or<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.239> can't

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
different type of focus or or I can't
