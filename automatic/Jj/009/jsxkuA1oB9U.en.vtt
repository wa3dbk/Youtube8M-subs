00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.560

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
know so what we know is like I said it

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.290 
know so what we know is like I said it
will<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.770> TNT<00:00:34.950> if<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.579> show<00:00:35.730> gets<00:00:35.880> greenlit

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
will be on TNT if the show gets greenlit

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.840 
will be on TNT if the show gets greenlit
which<00:00:36.510> I'm<00:00:36.750> assuming<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.469> will<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:38.370> probably

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
which I'm assuming it will it probably

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.040 
which I'm assuming it will it probably
will<00:00:38.969> because<00:00:39.120> they're<00:00:39.300> looking<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:39.809> good

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
will because they're looking at how good

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.200 
will because they're looking at how good
arrow<00:00:40.379> did<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.010> how<00:00:41.460> good<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.820> flash<00:00:42.000> is

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
arrow did and how good the flash is

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.810 
arrow did and how good the flash is
probably<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.670> probably

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
probably going to do so it's probably

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.180 
probably going to do so it's probably
going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.149> greenlit<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:46.079> said<00:00:46.379> raven

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
going to get greenlit they said raven

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.869 
going to get greenlit they said raven
and<00:00:47.340> starfire<00:00:47.370> will<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.780> many<00:00:49.530> more

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
and starfire will be in it and many more

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.630 
and starfire will be in it and many more
so<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.239> Titans<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:52.289> don't<00:00:52.500> know<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> big

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so the Titans we don't know I have a big

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.389 
so the Titans we don't know I have a big
feeling<00:00:54.059> beat<00:00:54.600> not<00:00:55.110> Beast<00:00:55.320> Boy<00:00:55.469> cyborg<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.250> not

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
feeling beat not Beast Boy cyborg is not

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.369 
feeling beat not Beast Boy cyborg is not
going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.879> into<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.809> which<00:00:58.020> makes<00:00:58.199> me

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
going to be into it in it which makes me

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.490 
going to be into it in it which makes me
sad<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.730> because<00:01:00.149> since<00:01:00.750> they've<00:01:01.320> been

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
sad but it's because since they've been

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.869 
sad but it's because since they've been
trying<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:01.890> him<00:01:02.039> associated<00:01:02.789> with

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
trying to get him associated with

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.119 
trying to get him associated with
Justice<00:01:03.329> League<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.780> since<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.799> new<00:01:04.949> 52

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
Justice League more since the new 52

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.920

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
added him to the Justice League which I

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.300 
added him to the Justice League which I
didn't<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.710> always<00:01:07.950> loved<00:01:08.159> him

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
didn't like because I always loved him

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
didn't like because I always loved him
with<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> Titans<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.439> always

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.289 
was awesome but with Justice League he
seems<00:01:15.090> very<00:01:15.180> out<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> place<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.049> me<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.299> yeah

gonna be with Justice League i highly

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.090

doubt he'll be in the show I wish he

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.490 
doubt he'll be in the show I wish he
would<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.610> probably<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.320> really

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
would be but probably not so this really

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.920 
would be but probably not so this really
leads<00:01:40.829> us<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.310> speculate<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:42.000> who<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.750> other

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
leads us to speculate on who the other

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.219 
leads us to speculate on who the other
characters<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:44.610> don't<00:01:44.640> know

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
characters are going to be we don't know

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.450 
characters are going to be we don't know
another<00:01:46.229> thing<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.740> they<00:01:47.009> said<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.369> gonna

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
another thing is they said it's gonna

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.160 
another thing is they said it's gonna
focus<00:01:47.820> around<00:01:48.149> Nightwing<00:01:48.630> which<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.930> great

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
focus around Nightwing which is great

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.940 
focus around Nightwing which is great
because<00:01:49.409> he<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.060> he's<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> easiest<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.799> me

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
because he is he's the easiest and to me

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.149 
because he is he's the easiest and to me
the<00:01:53.130> best<00:01:53.280> choice<00:01:54.140> out<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.590> all<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.920> Teen

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the best choice out of all the Teen

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.100 
the best choice out of all the Teen
Titans<00:01:56.579> even<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.390> no<00:01:57.570> matter<00:01:57.719> who<00:01:57.899> they

Titans even you know no matter who they

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.380 
Titans even you know no matter who they
choose<00:01:58.579> obviously<00:01:59.579> Roy<00:01:59.790> won't<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.360> it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
choose obviously Roy won't be in it

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.840 
choose obviously Roy won't be in it
since<00:02:00.689> he's<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> CW<00:02:01.740> even<00:02:02.579> though<00:02:02.670> that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
since he's on the CW even though that

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.060 
since he's on the CW even though that
would<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.030> awesome<00:02:03.180> he's<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.899> going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.229> an

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.830 
would be awesome he's not going to be an
um<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> let's<00:02:07.680> think<00:02:07.850> Kid<00:02:08.850> Flash<00:02:08.880> probably

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
um so let's think Kid Flash probably

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.240 
um so let's think Kid Flash probably
isn't<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.560> Wally's<00:02:10.979> probably

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
isn't going to be so Wally's probably

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.140 
isn't going to be so Wally's probably
not<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.790> because<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.030> would

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
not going to be in it because it would

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670 
not going to be in it because it would
have<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.510> walleye<00:02:12.840> since<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.440> Dick

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
awesome this is probably what was

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.070

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
show this is probably what it actually

was<00:05:12.919> I'm<00:05:13.919> super<00:05:14.640> excited<00:05:14.729> I<00:05:15.300> can't<00:05:15.810> wait<00:05:16.250> they

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
was I'm super excited I can't wait they

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.650 
was I'm super excited I can't wait they
got<00:05:17.460> so<00:05:17.700> many<00:05:17.850> possibilities<00:05:18.090> with

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
got so many possibilities with

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.680 
got so many possibilities with
characters<00:05:19.410> but<00:05:20.280> then<00:05:20.580> they<00:05:20.820> are<00:05:20.850> limited<00:05:21.510> as

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
characters but then they are limited as

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.540 
characters but then they are limited as
well<00:05:21.750> with<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.650> fact<00:05:22.860> that<00:05:22.979> they<00:05:23.160> can't<00:05:23.370> use

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
well with the fact that they can't use

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.370 
well with the fact that they can't use
Roy<00:05:23.850> they<00:05:24.120> can't<00:05:24.360> use<00:05:24.510> Wally<00:05:24.780> because<00:05:25.169> while<00:05:25.350> I
