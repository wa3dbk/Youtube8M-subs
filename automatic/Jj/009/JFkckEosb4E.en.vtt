00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.950
 so 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.230
 that's true we had to wait a long time 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.020
 on metal gear solid 5 respectively 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.790
 on ground zero the prologue to the right one 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.740
 metal gear solid 5 what a fan tim payne 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.130
 Hot what will eventually appear 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.110
 I was in Japan at Konami's all 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.990
 Missions complete in two days 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.160
 by ding on xbox and ps 410 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.630
 I'll come soon 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.120
 first of all here 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.370
 the basic principle is a camp that 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.590
 means camp omega and there you have to 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.450
 finally get two people out 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.619
 it's always the same game world so 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.360
 there are not different levels or 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.940
 Anything like that but that's the way it is 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.490
 spacious and so exciting that made 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.360
 it still offers enough scope 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.830
 I for the price of just under 30 euros 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.690
 Gaststar almost two days almost through 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.280
 gambled how long is going to say that 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.530
 if you only have this main mission 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.970
 plays and there a bit 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.160
 So experimenting happens when 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.479
 you play it normally and also 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.790
 really like that here really 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.340
 environment and not by it 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.930
 then runs with a creak and then bangs 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.250
 It takes one and a half hours 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.930
 about just for this 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.220
 main mission there are just since ops 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.290
 In addition, I will also come missions later 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.300
 this is just the first part 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.040
 the main mission you have to get out of these 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.220
 cages there the chico that's a fool 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.050
 free from the peace walker psp share 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.400
 and what is very cool is just easy 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.659
 that the sneak is really right 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.860
 it works like splinter 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.090
 cell or not so one now 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.860
 hakelige control 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.720
 There are such cool gags as here that one 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.370
 just the people from behind threatened the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.600
 then note oh god obstacle one with 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.489
 clear one can then for example 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.799
 choose if you want to say here 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.780
 los gives information or leg 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.130
 lying down and staying is pretty 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.290
 made exciting and it works 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.459
 just everything wonderful, something very cool 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.570
 just that one is not real 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.989
 show in the game so you see it 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.510
 Yes here 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.519
 It is very reduced you have to 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.570
 even a bit the environment and 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.010
 so on 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.840
 Of course there is also a map 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.430
 You can either use second screen app 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.709
 So with iphone and so on 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.030
 or even then in the menu but the time 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.080
 keeps going and that's why you have to 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.200
 always watch what you meanwhile 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.030
 Power and this guy is here 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.300
 no advertised mission goal 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.010
 but it's optional exactly that way 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.459
 they are also free 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.390
 can 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.740
 that was here on the left one 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.170
 we'll snap up and 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.000
 bring in the heli is the cool thing about it 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.250
 when you get rid of those in the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.110
 base is returned and the base becomes 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.430
 subsequently taken over in templin means 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.890
 So if I'm playing it by brauns 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.240
 Heroes have freed ten types here 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.010
 then i have these ten guys too 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.440
 afterwards in vent payne because there is 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.090
 then a whole game was about one 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.370
 base has to build up so a bit 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.260
 even strategy that was at peace walker 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.090
 yes very popular this part 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.450
 but is quite interesting because the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.830
 The basic entertainer is destroyed 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.100
 built in peace walker one had build 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.480
 then apparently again a new one 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.860
 and now you grab the guy like that 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.330
 that even the only number is this one 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.010
 Control technology is a bit annoying 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.019
 because you just like the same button 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.030
 People are collected here too 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.260
 ammunition and weapons picks up and 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.239
 Sometimes life is so scarce 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.980
 fails and you at the same time the quasi 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.510
 takes a creak while you pick it up 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.489
 and then it will be different 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.290
 pistol and do not know why the heli 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.600
 History here is very cool made it 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.489
 There are prefabricated places where the heli 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.200
 can land but only if made it 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.940
 because it is just safe but you can 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.380
 also risk and say come easy yes 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.910
 Freundchen but can also 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.530
 to be shot that is also completely 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.030
 was cool you think for example deduction then in 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.590
 mission ranking the coolness of this 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.489
 Actually, you always have a game 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.489
 where you are right now 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.410
 whether on the ground or just here so 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.000
 Find a truck on it how to 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.500
 different possibilities is total 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.610
 everything is working too 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.440
 everything really wonderful what that 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.310
 control is very context sensitive 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.860
 very intuitive as really real very 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.060
 very well mediated solid 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.860
 this will also be the player community 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.270
 happy because metal gear was just you 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.160
 necessarily known for the catchy 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.840
 easy control but he gave it so 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.460
 many feel the different stuff 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.050
 if it is so fluid now 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.400
 works as it looks like then 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.380
 that is really a huge win for the 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.090
 series 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.919
 easy to win a good keyword man 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.620
 can now also drive around with vehicles 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.540
 their truck one can just simply 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.160
 take over there are still tanks and 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.220
 anything else heli can do 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.510
 actually control everything and here 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.160
 Now suddenly it gets light 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.889
 this is an example of the site ops 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.510
 Missions There are a total of 54 pieces 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.770
 are in the beginning it was once 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.960
 played through unlocked the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.490
 fifth you have to say I do not like with 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.960
 unlock the specific story 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.490
 and here you can see what you can do 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.620
 tactically we can have four c4 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.270
 there is a truck sitting there 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:18.010
 Target person in it and it just makes 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:20.889
 still by remote control and is considered open 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.990
 and nobody knows who and why that 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.120
 so far, one has done with it 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.950
 a good ranking and here it is 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.450
 Of course, then the variant does not 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.500
 quite as tactical as it is smart 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.780
 sits in the tank and everything 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.130
 want to shoot down but can do too 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.260
 take over this protected here 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.389
 however, it does have that 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.820
 ki system reacts to it and next to it 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.260
 replenishment also comes in other tanks 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.270
 enter the game world as I have it 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.050
 times you can even on the 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.910
 normal of the two 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.260
 difficulty levels that actually 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.090
 do not pack and you can also do his 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.139
 by the way, shoot your own heli 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.830
 Of course, no sense results but 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:57.120
 Still good , but I think it's good 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.120
 that he will have another one right away 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.290
 and here a dream for all metal gear 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.030
 solid fans on the ps4 are just the 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:11.260
 Fifth from mission is exclusive to the 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.390
 ps4 a quasi flashback where you can metal 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.100
 gear solid 1 finally recreates in 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.080
 the game world and what he is now 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.210
 just as the next door has this 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.890
 polygon number you have to first 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.450
 free spins the man still a quiz triggers 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.360
 otherwise the mission is very very cool 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.830
 made and on the xbox one there is 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.300
 then there is a mission for it 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.310
 just for microsoft consoles are 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.870
 that it's the ones riding here with you 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.870
 in the spirit of ledger, then 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.550
 still has to destroy body eater 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.030
 the psp version is clearly better 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.430
 runs 1080p and 60 frames xbox only 27 p 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.720
 So you really have to say that's sony 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.720
 better with it
