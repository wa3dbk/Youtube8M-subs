Claire wheel which has more change in
gravity<00:03:41.129> one<00:03:42.420> switch<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.569> around<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:48.329> now

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
gravity one switch it around so and now

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.119 
gravity one switch it around so and now
i<00:03:49.629> will<00:03:49.690> assemble<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:50.379> I<00:03:50.500> will<00:03:50.650> be<00:03:50.739> right<00:03:50.769> back

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
i will assemble it I will be right back

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.360 
i will assemble it I will be right back
put<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:51.909> stickers<00:03:52.209> on<00:03:52.329> it<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.540> everything

your<00:03:54.370> guys<00:03:54.579> is<00:03:54.879> what<00:03:55.180> gravity<00:03:55.930> perseus<00:03:56.260> looks

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
your guys is what gravity perseus looks

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.400 
your guys is what gravity perseus looks
like<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.010> solid<00:03:57.370> stickers<00:03:57.959> this<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.200> I

launch here without the cap the bay
launcher<00:04:48.880> lr<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.150> awesome<00:04:50.700> so<00:04:51.700> it's<00:04:51.880> gravity

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
launcher lr is awesome so it's gravity

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.089 
launcher lr is awesome so it's gravity
perseus<00:04:52.419> this<00:04:52.870> is<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.020> totally<00:04:53.470> great<00:04:53.620> buy<00:04:53.889> I
