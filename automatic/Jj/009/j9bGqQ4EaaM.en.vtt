when<00:00:58.399> you're<00:00:58.520> doing<00:00:58.700> a<00:00:58.790> stencil<00:00:59.270> like<00:00:59.420> this

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
when you're doing a stencil like this

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.319 
when you're doing a stencil like this
just<00:01:00.230> go<00:01:00.770> from<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.010> outside<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.460> stencil<00:01:02.180> in

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
just go from the outside the stencil in

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.420 
just go from the outside the stencil in
you<00:01:03.110> hold<00:01:03.320> it<00:01:03.440> down<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:03.710> get<00:01:03.829> you<00:01:04.070> get<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:04.280> get

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
you hold it down you get you get it get

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.279 
you hold it down you get you get it get
it<00:01:04.460> tighter<00:01:04.759> can<00:01:05.390> you<00:01:05.449> just<00:01:05.630> hold<00:01:05.749> it<00:01:05.899> down<00:01:06.049> and

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
it tighter can you just hold it down and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.169 
it tighter can you just hold it down and
just<00:01:06.409> just<00:01:06.649> push<00:01:06.889> it<00:01:06.920> across<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:07.969> I<00:01:07.999> guess<00:01:08.149> it's

00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:08.179 
just just push it across so I guess it's

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:09.910 
just just push it across so I guess it's
not<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:08.509> difficult<00:01:08.869> because<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:09.799> have<00:01:09.889> a

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
not so difficult because you have a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.830 
not so difficult because you have a
stencil<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.759> this<00:01:10.939> essential<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:11.509> you<00:01:11.659> made
