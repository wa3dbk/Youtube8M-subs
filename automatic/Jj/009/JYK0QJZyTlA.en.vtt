were<00:00:41.179> out<00:00:41.329> checking<00:00:41.659> out<00:00:41.929> chemtrails<00:00:42.589> and<00:00:43.539> we

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
were out checking out chemtrails and we

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.719 
were out checking out chemtrails and we
spotted<00:00:44.839> this<00:00:45.170> shiny<00:00:45.469> thing<00:00:45.589> blinking<00:00:46.339> so<00:00:46.609> we

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:46.729 
spotted this shiny thing blinking so we

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.660 
spotted this shiny thing blinking so we
got<00:00:46.909> the<00:00:47.059> by<00:00:47.210> nose<00:00:47.420> on<00:00:47.659> it<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:48.339> this<00:00:49.339> thing<00:00:49.550> was

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
got the by nose on it and this thing was

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.239 
got the by nose on it and this thing was
metallic<00:00:50.269> and<00:00:50.479> rectangular<00:00:51.019> it<00:00:51.469> was<00:00:51.769> a<00:00:51.800> very

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
metallic and rectangular it was a very

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.180 
metallic and rectangular it was a very
strange<00:00:52.699> thing<00:00:53.379> we<00:00:54.379> got<00:00:54.589> the<00:00:54.710> by<00:00:54.829> nose<00:00:55.039> on<00:00:55.159> it

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
strange thing we got the by nose on it

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.709 
strange thing we got the by nose on it
to<00:00:55.370> be<00:00:55.460> sure<00:00:55.639> it<00:00:55.760> wasn't<00:00:55.940> balloons<00:00:56.299> because<00:00:56.569> we

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
to be sure it wasn't balloons because we

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.509 
to be sure it wasn't balloons because we
see<00:00:56.899> those<00:00:57.079> kind<00:00:57.769> of<00:00:57.829> metallic<00:00:58.249> looking

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
see those kind of metallic looking

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.039 
see those kind of metallic looking
balloons<00:00:58.850> sometimes<00:00:59.359> but<00:00:59.600> you<00:00:59.690> can<00:00:59.839> tell

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
balloons sometimes but you can tell

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.829 
balloons sometimes but you can tell
through<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.350> binoculars<00:01:00.699> so<00:01:01.699> I<00:01:01.729> shot<00:01:02.030> it<00:01:02.089> with

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
through the binoculars so I shot it with

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.840 
through the binoculars so I shot it with
a<00:01:02.870> handheld<00:01:03.289> shot<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.040> then<00:01:04.190> I<00:01:04.220> rushed<00:01:04.549> in<00:01:04.760> to

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
a handheld shot and then I rushed in to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.430 
a handheld shot and then I rushed in to
get<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.089> scope<00:01:05.299> set<00:01:05.600> up<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:05.900> I<00:01:05.930> could<00:01:06.110> get<00:01:06.229> more

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
get the scope set up so I could get more

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.310 
get the scope set up so I could get more
resolution<00:01:07.119> but<00:01:08.119> by<00:01:08.240> then<00:01:08.479> it<00:01:08.630> had<00:01:08.780> fallen<00:01:09.020> too

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
resolution but by then it had fallen too

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.840 
resolution but by then it had fallen too
low<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.710> horizon<00:01:09.829> and<00:01:10.310> we<00:01:10.399> couldn't<00:01:10.640> get

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
low to the horizon and we couldn't get

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.260 
low to the horizon and we couldn't get
it

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.870 
it
it<00:01:11.990> ain't<00:01:12.140> rate<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:12.500> is<00:01:12.649> the<00:01:12.829> object<00:01:13.100> and

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
it ain't rate this is the object and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.999 
it ain't rate this is the object and
right<00:01:14.420> now<00:01:14.630> it's<00:01:14.960> actually<00:01:15.350> flashing<00:01:15.860> and

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
right now it's actually flashing and

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.279 
right now it's actually flashing and
this<00:01:16.159> still<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:16.460> took<00:01:16.789> one<00:01:17.000> still<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:18.020> get<00:01:18.170> my

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
this still I took one still to get my

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.980 
this still I took one still to get my
focus<00:01:18.530> adjusted<00:01:19.219> as<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:19.460> began<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.850> video<00:01:21.189> and

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
focus adjusted as I began to video and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.240 
focus adjusted as I began to video and
I'm<00:01:23.990> gonna<00:01:24.140> load<00:01:24.350> up<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.619> video<00:01:24.859> here<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:25.189> a

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
I'm gonna load up the video here in a

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.130 
I'm gonna load up the video here in a
second<00:01:25.579> but<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:25.729> have<00:01:26.000> never<00:01:26.180> seen<00:01:26.509> anything

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
second but I have never seen anything

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.260 
second but I have never seen anything
quite<00:01:27.350> like<00:01:27.560> this<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.159> came<00:01:28.399> in<00:01:28.640> from<00:01:28.939> above

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
quite like this it came in from above

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.969 
quite like this it came in from above
the<00:01:29.539> chemtrail<00:01:30.049> as<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:30.320> can<00:01:30.439> see<00:01:30.590> right<00:01:30.770> there

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
the chemtrail as you can see right there

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.279 
the chemtrail as you can see right there
it's<00:01:31.159> right<00:01:31.340> above<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.729> chemtrail<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.539> it

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
it's right above the chemtrail and it

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.160 
it's right above the chemtrail and it
flashes<00:01:34.189> in<00:01:34.399> the<00:01:34.670> sunlight<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:35.420> looks<00:01:35.960> like

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
flashes in the sunlight it looks like

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.440 
flashes in the sunlight it looks like
it's<00:01:36.380> blinking<00:01:36.950> but<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.700> think<00:01:38.119> that's

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
it's blinking but I think that's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.020 
it's blinking but I think that's
actually<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.289> thing<00:01:39.619> moving<00:01:40.280> around<00:01:40.549> and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
actually the thing moving around and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.669 
actually the thing moving around and
catching<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> angle<00:01:42.049> of<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.229> Sun<00:01:42.439> and

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
catching the angle of the Sun and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.160 
catching the angle of the Sun and
flashing<00:01:43.189> you'll<00:01:44.000> notice<00:01:44.299> for<00:01:44.509> long<00:01:44.689> periods

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
flashing you'll notice for long periods

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.749 
flashing you'll notice for long periods
sometimes<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.740> doesn't<00:01:45.950> flash<00:01:46.249> at<00:01:46.429> all<00:01:46.549> and

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
sometimes it doesn't flash at all and

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.330 
sometimes it doesn't flash at all and
other<00:01:46.880> times<00:01:47.149> it<00:01:47.359> stays<00:01:47.600> lit<00:01:47.899> but<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:49.100> could

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
other times it stays lit but you could

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.219 
other times it stays lit but you could
tell<00:01:49.579> very<00:01:49.640> easily<00:01:50.210> through<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.020> binoculars

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
tell very easily through the binoculars

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.169 
tell very easily through the binoculars
that<00:01:51.560> this<00:01:51.890> thing<00:01:52.070> was<00:01:52.219> rectangular<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:53.030> was

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
that this thing was rectangular it was

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.349 
that this thing was rectangular it was
very<00:01:53.539> angular<00:01:54.310> nothing<00:01:55.310> hanging<00:01:55.520> from<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:56.179> and

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
very angular nothing hanging from it and

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.679 
very angular nothing hanging from it and
it<00:01:56.929> slowly<00:01:57.350> meandered<00:01:58.039> down<00:01:58.249> and<00:01:58.640> headed<00:01:59.450> into

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
it slowly meandered down and headed into

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.109 
it slowly meandered down and headed into
this<00:01:59.929> chemtrail<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.490> other<00:02:01.609> thing<00:02:01.850> was

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
this chemtrail and the other thing was

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.209 
this chemtrail and the other thing was
the<00:02:02.149> chemtrails<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:03.049> were<00:02:03.140> laying<00:02:03.319> this<00:02:03.979> day

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
the chemtrails that were laying this day

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.099 
the chemtrails that were laying this day
were<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.759> lot<00:02:05.179> of<00:02:05.210> them<00:02:05.390> were<00:02:05.539> really<00:02:05.719> short

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
were a lot of them were really short

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.590 
were a lot of them were really short
like<00:02:06.950> I<00:02:07.159> don't<00:02:07.340> know<00:02:07.399> two<00:02:08.060> or<00:02:08.210> three<00:02:08.240> football

fields long and they got really wide and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.000 
fields long and they got really wide and
you'll<00:02:11.090> see<00:02:11.270> in<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.510> wide<00:02:11.720> shot<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:12.740> chem

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
you'll see in a wide shot of this chem

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.580 
you'll see in a wide shot of this chem
trail<00:02:13.310> what<00:02:13.490> I'm<00:02:13.580> talking<00:02:13.970> about

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
trail what I'm talking about

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.030 
trail what I'm talking about
and<00:02:14.680> we<00:02:15.430> actually<00:02:15.640> saw<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.120> plane<00:02:16.739> turn<00:02:17.739> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
and we actually saw the plane turn the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.280 
and we actually saw the plane turn the
sprayer<00:02:18.340> on<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.910> turn<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.270> sprayer<00:02:19.569> off<00:02:19.840> and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
sprayer on and turn the sprayer off and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.870 
sprayer on and turn the sprayer off and
we<00:02:20.500> were<00:02:20.590> getting<00:02:20.800> ready<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.310> try<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.580> catch

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
we were getting ready to try to catch

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.660 
we were getting ready to try to catch
that<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:23.290> actually<00:02:23.530> do<00:02:23.890> have<00:02:23.920> footage<00:02:24.520> of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
that and I actually do have footage of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.080 
that and I actually do have footage of
one<00:02:24.849> plane<00:02:25.120> turning<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.630> sprayer<00:02:25.930> on<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.440> off

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
one plane turning the sprayer on and off

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.089 
one plane turning the sprayer on and off
and<00:02:28.090> then<00:02:28.300> we<00:02:28.450> saw<00:02:28.630> this<00:02:28.810> shiny<00:02:29.140> thing<00:02:29.260> now

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
and then we saw this shiny thing now

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.490 
and then we saw this shiny thing now
here<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.459> can<00:02:30.610> see<00:02:30.880> it's<00:02:31.470> meandering<00:02:32.470> down

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
here you can see it's meandering down

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.100 
here you can see it's meandering down
into<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.459> chemtrail<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.840> see<00:02:34.989> that

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
into the chemtrail and you see that

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.990 
into the chemtrail and you see that
little<00:02:35.290> dark<00:02:35.620> spot<00:02:35.950> down<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.519> right<00:02:36.700> he

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
little dark spot down to the right he

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.180 
little dark spot down to the right he
kind<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.390> turns<00:02:37.660> in<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:38.050> direction<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.830> ends

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
kind of turns in that direction and ends

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.770 
kind of turns in that direction and ends
up<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.489> as<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.700> load<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.060> next<00:02:40.300> clip<00:02:40.540> you'll

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
up and as I load the next clip you'll

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.199 
up and as I load the next clip you'll
see<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:41.680> he<00:02:41.800> goes<00:02:41.980> down<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.459> way<00:02:42.519> so<00:02:42.700> here's

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
see that he goes down that way so here's

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.780 
see that he goes down that way so here's
the<00:02:43.390> next<00:02:43.540> clip<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.769> let<00:02:48.069> me<00:02:48.190> spot<00:02:48.459> him<00:02:48.610> here<00:02:48.760> I

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
the next clip and let me spot him here I

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.570 
the next clip and let me spot him here I
think<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.150> put<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> circle<00:02:50.019> up<00:02:50.170> -<00:02:50.560> yeah<00:02:51.069> there

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
think I put a circle up - yeah there

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.039 
think I put a circle up - yeah there
will<00:02:51.640> be<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.790> circle<00:02:52.150> up<00:02:52.299> in<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.540> second<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:52.989> show

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
will be a circle up in a second to show

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.900 
will be a circle up in a second to show
you<00:02:53.260> where<00:02:53.410> he<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.590> he's<00:02:54.100> there<00:02:54.370> but<00:02:54.580> he's<00:02:54.760> just

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
you where he is he's there but he's just

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.650 
you where he is he's there but he's just
not<00:02:55.120> lit<00:02:55.600> by<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.810> Sun<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.170> guess<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:58.090> there<00:02:58.450> is

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
not lit by the Sun I guess so there is

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.589 
not lit by the Sun I guess so there is
entering<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.500> chemtrail<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.340> as<00:03:01.090> he<00:03:01.209> got<00:03:01.390> in

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
entering the chemtrail and as he got in

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.900 
entering the chemtrail and as he got in
there<00:03:01.810> he<00:03:02.410> kind<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.799> went<00:03:02.980> back<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.280> forth<00:03:03.549> a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
there he kind of went back and forth a

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.199 
there he kind of went back and forth a
bit<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:05.290> I've<00:03:05.950> never<00:03:06.190> really<00:03:06.580> seen<00:03:06.880> anything

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
bit and I've never really seen anything

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.110 
bit and I've never really seen anything
that<00:03:07.690> didn't<00:03:08.049> look<00:03:08.170> round<00:03:08.670> all<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.910> things

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
that didn't look round all the things

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.180 
that didn't look round all the things
that<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:10.360> filmed<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:10.870> chemtrails<00:03:11.410> we<00:03:11.799> call<00:03:12.010> him

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
that I filmed in chemtrails we call him

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.009 
that I filmed in chemtrails we call him
orbs<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:12.880> part<00:03:13.150> of<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.299> reason<00:03:13.569> we<00:03:13.660> call<00:03:13.870> them

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
orbs and part of the reason we call them

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.620 
orbs and part of the reason we call them
orbs<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.440> because<00:03:14.739> they're<00:03:14.920> round<00:03:15.190> but<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.299> can

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
orbs is because they're round but I can

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.210 
orbs is because they're round but I can
guarantee<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.830> thing<00:03:18.069> was

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
guarantee you that this thing was

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.490 
guarantee you that this thing was
rectangular<00:03:18.970> whatever<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.690> was<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:23.200> here<00:03:23.410> I'm

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
rectangular whatever it was and here I'm

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.680 
rectangular whatever it was and here I'm
gonna<00:03:23.620> load<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.920> next<00:03:24.160> clip<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:25.420> can<00:03:25.450> see

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
gonna load the next clip and you can see

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.349 
gonna load the next clip and you can see
that<00:03:25.840> chemtrails<00:03:26.440> very<00:03:26.680> short<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.220> fat<00:03:27.459> he

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
that chemtrails very short and fat he

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.030 
that chemtrails very short and fat he
turned<00:03:28.600> on<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.930> sprayer<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.530> turned<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:29.920> off

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
turned on the sprayer and turned it off

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.640 
turned on the sprayer and turned it off
almost<00:03:30.280> immediately<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:31.780> here<00:03:31.989> is<00:03:32.140> coming<00:03:32.470> out

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
almost immediately so here is coming out

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.229 
almost immediately so here is coming out
of<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.829> bottom<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.310> chemtrail<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.090> I

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
of the bottom of the chemtrail and I

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.180 
of the bottom of the chemtrail and I
take<00:03:34.480> one<00:03:34.720> more<00:03:34.959> short<00:03:35.260> clip<00:03:35.590> out<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:35.890> this<00:03:36.010> and

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
take one more short clip out of this and

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.479 
take one more short clip out of this and
I<00:03:36.220> run<00:03:36.459> in<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:37.329> drag<00:03:37.569> the<00:03:37.780> scope<00:03:38.079> out<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.650> try

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
I run in to drag the scope out and try

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.520 
I run in to drag the scope out and try
to<00:03:39.549> get<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:40.090> scope<00:03:40.420> shot<00:03:40.690> which<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.140> very

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
to get a scope shot which is very

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.110 
to get a scope shot which is very
difficult<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.130> do<00:03:42.250> I<00:03:42.280> might<00:03:42.579> not<00:03:42.730> even<00:03:43.000> been

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
difficult to do I might not even been

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.660 
difficult to do I might not even been
able<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.420> get<00:03:43.540> this<00:03:43.660> thing<00:03:43.840> in<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.049> viewfinder

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
able to get this thing in the viewfinder

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.750 
able to get this thing in the viewfinder
it's<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.819> very<00:03:46.000> tough<00:03:46.269> thing<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.510> do<00:03:46.750> and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
it's a very tough thing to do and

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.520 
it's a very tough thing to do and
there's<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.940> last<00:03:49.060> shot<00:03:49.359> of<00:03:49.480> this<00:03:49.600> very<00:03:50.109> weird

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
there's the last shot of this very weird

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.349 
there's the last shot of this very weird
angular<00:03:51.310> object<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:52.000> went<00:03:52.150> into<00:03:52.269> the

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
angular object that went into the
