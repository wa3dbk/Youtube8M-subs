shortly<00:01:14.360> after<00:01:14.600> his<00:01:14.690> tweet<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.409> was<00:01:15.620> reported

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
shortly after his tweet it was reported

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.390 
shortly after his tweet it was reported
on<00:01:16.630> mojo<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:17.870> think<00:01:18.140> it's<00:01:18.229> moving<00:01:18.530> mojo<00:01:18.860> that

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
on mojo I think it's moving mojo that

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.620 
on mojo I think it's moving mojo that
was<00:01:19.580> going<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.820> be<00:01:19.880> released<00:01:20.180> may<00:01:20.570> 27th<00:01:21.580> 2016

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
was going to be released may 27th 2016

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.120 
was going to be released may 27th 2016
now<00:01:23.630> we<00:01:23.690> know<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:23.990> obviously<00:01:24.320> next<00:01:24.890> year<00:01:25.070> is

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
now we know that obviously next year is

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.090 
now we know that obviously next year is
going<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:25.310> be<00:01:25.369> days<00:01:25.640> of<00:01:25.850> future<00:01:25.970> past<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.100> it's

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
going to be days of future past and it's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.010 
going to be days of future past and it's
very<00:01:28.369> likely<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:28.790> that<00:01:29.000> could<00:01:29.450> lead<00:01:29.659> into<00:01:29.840> a

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
very likely that that could lead into a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.500 
very likely that that could lead into a
scenario<00:01:30.530> where<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:31.400> x-men<00:01:31.850> meet<00:01:32.060> up<00:01:32.240> with

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
scenario where the x-men meet up with

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.319 
scenario where the x-men meet up with
the<00:01:33.080> infamous<00:01:33.759> apocalypse<00:01:34.759> from<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.030> x-men

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
the infamous apocalypse from the x-men

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.910 
the infamous apocalypse from the x-men
universe<00:01:35.619> now<00:01:36.619> I<00:01:37.840> think<00:01:38.840> if<00:01:39.380> this<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.710> true

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
universe now I think if this is true

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.469 
universe now I think if this is true
which<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.340> must<00:01:40.430> ensure<00:01:40.969> it's<00:01:41.119> true<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.329> don't

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
which it must ensure it's true I don't

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.690 
which it must ensure it's true I don't
think<00:01:41.780> Bryan<00:01:41.990> Singer<00:01:42.380> would<00:01:42.590> tweet<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.490> if

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
think Bryan Singer would tweet that if

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.099 
think Bryan Singer would tweet that if
there<00:01:43.850> wasn't<00:01:44.149> anything<00:01:44.420> already<00:01:44.899> in<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
there wasn't anything already in the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:46.719 
there wasn't anything already in the
works<00:01:45.289> and<00:01:45.740> when<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.310> think<00:01:46.429> about<00:01:46.520> the

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729

comic book series in the x-men universe

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.470 
comic book series in the x-men universe
which<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.350> age<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.620> apocalypse<00:02:52.860> which

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
which is the age of apocalypse which

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.830 
which is the age of apocalypse which
obviously<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:55.260> villain<00:02:55.650> comes<00:02:56.250> out<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.840> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
obviously the villain comes out and the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.260 
obviously the villain comes out and the
original<00:02:58.260> x-men<00:02:58.560> come<00:02:59.070> back<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.850> fight<00:03:00.090> him

original x-men come back to to fight him
which<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.930> think<00:03:00.960> Jean<00:03:01.380> Grey<00:03:01.620> Cyclops<00:03:02.450> I

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
which is I think Jean Grey Cyclops I

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.390 
which is I think Jean Grey Cyclops I
think<00:03:04.200> they<00:03:04.290> mentioned<00:03:04.710> there<00:03:04.800> was<00:03:04.890> ice<00:03:05.100> man

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
think they mentioned there was ice man

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.800 
think they mentioned there was ice man
beast<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:07.700> possibly<00:03:08.700> angel<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:09.450> that's

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
beast and possibly angel and that's

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.300 
beast and possibly angel and that's
another<00:03:10.080> thing<00:03:10.320> we<00:03:10.530> also<00:03:10.950> know<00:03:11.280> that

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
another thing we also know that

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.460 
another thing we also know that
apocalypse<00:03:12.210> played<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> big<00:03:12.780> role<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:13.080> the

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
apocalypse played a big role in the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.130 
apocalypse played a big role in the
development<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.520> Archangel<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.780> and

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
something that's surrounding the actual

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.740 
something that's surrounding the actual
character<00:03:32.130> apocalypse<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:32.970> not<00:03:33.510> just

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
character apocalypse and not just

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.810 
character apocalypse and not just
calling<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.200> apocalypse<00:03:34.740> because<00:03:35.070> that's<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
calling it apocalypse because that's the

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.850 
calling it apocalypse because that's the
scenario<00:03:36.060> they're<00:03:36.570> gonna<00:03:36.660> be<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:37.080> then<00:03:37.770> I

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
scenario they're gonna be in then I

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.950 
scenario they're gonna be in then I
would<00:03:38.010> love<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.280> see<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.120> Archangel<00:03:39.630> come<00:03:39.810> out

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
would love to see the Archangel come out

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.390 
would love to see the Archangel come out
so<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:41.340> whether<00:03:41.640> or<00:03:41.790> not<00:03:41.910> it's<00:03:42.240> um<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:44.280> know

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
so so whether or not it's um you know

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.040 
so so whether or not it's um you know
the<00:03:44.670> apocalypse<00:03:45.180> character<00:03:45.540> or<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.930> an

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
the apocalypse character or just an

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.020 
the apocalypse character or just an
apocalypse<00:03:46.440> scenario<00:03:46.590> obviously<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.460> think<00:03:47.820> we

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
apocalypse scenario obviously I think we

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.320 
apocalypse scenario obviously I think we
will<00:03:48.210> probably<00:03:48.270> find<00:03:49.170> out<00:03:49.490> during<00:03:50.490> x-men<00:03:51.060> days

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
will probably find out during x-men days

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.090 
will probably find out during x-men days
of<00:03:51.360> future<00:03:51.540> past<00:03:51.840> I'm<00:03:52.350> sure<00:03:52.740> we're<00:03:52.950> going<00:03:53.040> to

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
of future past I'm sure we're going to

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.550 
of future past I'm sure we're going to
get<00:03:53.220> an<00:03:53.340> end<00:03:53.490> credits<00:03:53.850> scene<00:03:54.060> I'm<00:03:54.360> sure<00:03:55.290> they

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
get an end credits scene I'm sure they

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.020 
get an end credits scene I'm sure they
might<00:03:55.740> even<00:03:55.950> do<00:03:56.160> something<00:03:56.400> similar<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.880> what

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
might even do something similar to what
