to make a choice okay sometimes you do

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.680 
to make a choice okay sometimes you do
need<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.280> taxes<00:03:23.670> maybe<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.239> late<00:03:24.420> at<00:03:24.570> night

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
need the taxes maybe it is late at night

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.060 
need the taxes maybe it is late at night
you<00:03:24.870> don't<00:03:25.019> want<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.200> deal<00:03:25.320> with<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.590> yes<00:03:25.860> and

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you don't want to deal with it yes and

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.340 
you don't want to deal with it yes and
it's<00:03:26.190> worth<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.519> but<00:03:26.670> overall<00:03:27.080> find<00:03:28.080> places

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
it's worth it but overall find places

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.960 
it's worth it but overall find places
that<00:03:28.500> are<00:03:28.650> near<00:03:28.800> metro<00:03:29.130> stops<00:03:29.580> or<00:03:29.760> subway

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
that are near metro stops or subway

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.000 
that are near metro stops or subway
stops<00:03:30.360> bus<00:03:30.780> stops<00:03:31.110> things<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.830> so<00:03:31.980> you

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
stops bus stops things like that so you

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.670 
stops bus stops things like that so you
can<00:03:32.220> get<00:03:32.340> in<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.640> out<00:03:32.700> relatively<00:03:33.360> easily

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
can get in and out relatively easily

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.840 
can get in and out relatively easily
then<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.709> don't<00:03:34.950> have<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.160> take<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.430> taxis

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
then you don't have to take the taxis

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.580 
then you don't have to take the taxis
because<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.390> mean<00:03:36.750> for<00:03:36.930> example<00:03:36.959> in<00:03:37.290> Berlin

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
because I mean for example in Berlin

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.590 
because I mean for example in Berlin
from<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.430> from<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:38.910> airport<00:03:39.269> there<00:03:39.390> should

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
from the from the airport there should

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.960 
from the from the airport there should
have<00:03:39.690> failed<00:03:39.840> or<00:03:40.080> BBI<00:03:40.650> when<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.040> opens<00:03:41.310> up<00:03:41.459> the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
have failed or BBI when it opens up the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.830 
have failed or BBI when it opens up the

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
train is like 4 euros ok a taxi is 60

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.250 
train is like 4 euros ok a taxi is 60
euros<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.860> worth<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.220> no<00:03:47.640> ok<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:48.810> make<00:03:49.230> sure

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
euros is it worth it no ok so make sure

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
you find out what it is because a lot of

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.350 
you find out what it is because a lot of
times<00:03:51.690> you're<00:03:51.840> not<00:03:51.870> sure

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360
