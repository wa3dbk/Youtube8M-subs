called the layout view the bottom frame

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.219 
called the layout view the bottom frame
is<00:01:44.590> called<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.400> cut<00:01:45.670> table<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.659> cut<00:01:46.840> table

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
is called the cut table so the cut table

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.320 
is called the cut table so the cut table
is<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.350> representation<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.580> film<00:01:48.850> on<00:01:49.150> your

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
is a representation of the film on your

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.960 
is a representation of the film on your
plotter<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.100> first<00:01:51.280> thing<00:01:51.460> we<00:01:51.550> want<00:01:51.759> us<00:01:51.850> to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
plotter so the first thing we want us to

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.240 
plotter so the first thing we want us to
do<00:01:52.119> is<00:01:52.360> select<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.810> material<00:01:53.350> width<00:01:53.650> from<00:01:54.160> the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
do is select the material width from the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.700 
do is select the material width from the
right<00:01:54.700> hand<00:01:54.880> side<00:01:54.970> here<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:55.420> in<00:01:56.200> this<00:01:56.290> case<00:01:56.530> I'm

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
right hand side here so in this case I'm

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.590 
right hand side here so in this case I'm
just<00:01:56.740> gonna<00:01:56.979> pick<00:01:57.220> 40<00:01:58.060> inch<00:01:58.210> because<00:01:58.450> that's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
just gonna pick 40 inch because that's

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.359 
just gonna pick 40 inch because that's
the<00:01:59.020> width<00:01:59.229> of<00:01:59.380> film<00:01:59.560> that's<00:01:59.770> on<00:01:59.950> my<00:02:00.100> platter

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
the width of film that's on my platter

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.359 
the width of film that's on my platter
right<00:02:00.610> now<00:02:00.960> now<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.320> can<00:02:02.500> edit<00:02:02.680> different

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
right now now you can edit different

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.770 
right now now you can edit different
material<00:02:03.790> widths<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.390> have<00:02:04.540> in<00:02:04.659> your

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
material widths that you have in your

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.529

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
shop in the Edit command we'll go over

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.199 
shop in the Edit command we'll go over
that<00:02:07.630> in<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.050> later<00:02:08.259> video<00:02:09.030> once<00:02:10.030> we've

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
that in a later video once we've

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.750 
that in a later video once we've
selected<00:02:10.420> our<00:02:10.780> material<00:02:11.260> with<00:02:11.410> we<00:02:12.310> can<00:02:12.459> start

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
selected our material with we can start

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.910 
selected our material with we can start
placing<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.330> patterns<00:02:13.690> on<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.930> cut<00:02:14.110> table<00:02:14.470> so

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
placing the patterns on the cut table so

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.380 
placing the patterns on the cut table so
there's<00:02:15.130> multiple<00:02:15.310> ways<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.700> we<00:02:16.000> can<00:02:16.150> bring

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
there's multiple ways that we can bring

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.120 
there's multiple ways that we can bring
patterns<00:02:16.810> down<00:02:17.050> from<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.530> layout<00:02:17.739> view<00:02:17.950> to

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
the cut table one in the most simplistic

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.620 
the cut table one in the most simplistic
way<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.550> probably<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.330> double

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
way to do that is probably the double

rotations once we have the patterns on
the<00:02:40.450> table<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:41.200> can<00:02:41.440> move<00:02:41.769> those<00:02:41.980> patterns

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
the table we can move those patterns

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.039 
the table we can move those patterns
around<00:02:42.670> with<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> left<00:02:43.120> click<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.720> if<00:02:43.780> we<00:02:43.900> hold

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
around with a left click so if we hold

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.750 
around with a left click so if we hold
down<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.350> left<00:02:44.380> mouse<00:02:44.620> button<00:02:44.799> we<00:02:45.430> can<00:02:45.579> move

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
down the left mouse button we can move

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.539 
down the left mouse button we can move
them<00:02:46.000> into<00:02:46.150> different<00:02:46.420> positions<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:47.459> in<00:02:48.459> this

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
them into different positions so in this

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.190 
them into different positions so in this
case<00:02:48.790> I've<00:02:48.970> overlapped<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.630> patterns<00:02:49.989> just

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
case I've overlapped the patterns just

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.020 
case I've overlapped the patterns just
to<00:02:50.380> show<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.650> if<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:51.160> pattern<00:02:51.519> does<00:02:51.730> touch

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
to show you if a pattern does touch

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.539 
to show you if a pattern does touch
another<00:02:52.329> pattern<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.930> any<00:02:53.110> way<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:54.130> will<00:02:54.310> see

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
another pattern in any way you will see

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.090 
another pattern in any way you will see
red<00:02:55.200> outlines<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.470> patterns<00:02:56.829> which

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
red outlines of the patterns which

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.610 
red outlines of the patterns which
basically<00:02:57.579> is<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.060> warning<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.630> say<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.440> these

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
basically is a warning to say that these

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.069 
basically is a warning to say that these
patterns<00:02:59.860> are<00:03:00.130> overlapping<00:03:00.579> so<00:03:01.360> now<00:03:01.870> I'm

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
patterns are overlapping so now I'm

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.470 
patterns are overlapping so now I'm
going<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.290> show<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.620> rotate<00:03:03.130> command<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:03.910> hold

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
going to show the rotate command so hold

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.870 
going to show the rotate command so hold
down<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.750> right<00:03:04.930> mouse<00:03:04.989> button<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.650> move

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
down the right mouse button and move

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.060 
down the right mouse button and move
your<00:03:06.880> mouse<00:03:07.090> side-to-side<00:03:07.739> this<00:03:08.739> will<00:03:08.920> rotate

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
your mouse side-to-side this will rotate

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.710 
your mouse side-to-side this will rotate
your<00:03:09.370> pattern<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.000> then<00:03:10.120> we<00:03:10.269> can<00:03:10.420> left-click

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
your pattern and then we can left-click

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.970 
your pattern and then we can left-click
