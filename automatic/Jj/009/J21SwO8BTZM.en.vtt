over<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.690> fork<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.200> how<00:04:49.500> long<00:04:49.740> are<00:04:49.830> we<00:04:49.860> gonna

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
over the fork and how long are we gonna

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.350 
over the fork and how long are we gonna
have<00:04:50.160> this<00:04:50.250> in<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.460> boiling<00:04:50.730> water<00:04:50.880> for<00:04:50.940> going

have this in the boiling water for going
right<00:04:51.540> in<00:04:51.690> now<00:04:51.870> okay<00:04:52.760> this<00:04:53.760> is<00:04:53.820> gonna<00:04:54.000> go<00:04:54.210> in

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
right in now okay this is gonna go in

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.820 
right in now okay this is gonna go in
one<00:04:54.570> egg<00:04:54.720> enormo<00:04:55.020> pasta<00:04:55.380> right
