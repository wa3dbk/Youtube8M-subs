00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So you're going across the states in your batmobile?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Do you seriously think it's possible?
Yes I'm sure.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I don't have time for this, I gotta go.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Hey, I've got something going on.
Yep, you usually do.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, don't panic...maybe this is something you don't ask for twice.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What can you say? He's building a new one.
There's always something. It never stops.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I got in touch with a bunch of people and some of them thinks I'm crazy.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But with you it's sort of a father and son relationship...
Robban likes crazy stuff.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So I said to myself go ask Robban. Just maybe he's got one more Lincoln.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I remember a christmas eve.
We got a batman head that could record your voice.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:38.000
After two days dad took it back and placed it in his collection.
And said it's mine now.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Wow, this is brand new!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The chrome is perfect.
Guys, it's over here...we've got it in black too.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We just have to move some stuff away and...
Do you mean we can take it right away?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Of course!
I even think there's gas in it.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I belive in this. It's gonna be fun!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Not an ordinary childhood. Pretty strange actually.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Not going on vacations like other familys. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
More like hanging in the garage eating pie from the broken microwave oven.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Robban screwed us!
That old crook!

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
What the hell...!
