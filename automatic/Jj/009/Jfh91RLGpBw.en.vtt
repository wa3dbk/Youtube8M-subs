00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.740
 odds 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.180
 and it was the masses that rival but what 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.880
 degrees could stand and align 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.540
 holder cogs important cookies exit 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.020
 maybe even 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020
 of teeth 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.410

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.579
 who prefer well 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:08.630
 so that garbage that you have a rival 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.700
 let's say we sow comfortable and can't be 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.349
 desler so convenient for us to surrender in the west 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.650
 than to return to the combo rus then 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.650
 about 50 from traveling in a month 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.239
 it was hard of course to play it with 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.709
 status 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.709
 come back right again 5 come here 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.840
 Joseph how many functionally satisfied 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.390
 while trade is seen season sees 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.910
 what can even be somewhat physical 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.770
 how many of these emotions do not apply to Canada 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:55.440
 put on it no goat affect then 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.440
 that we are such drops we get 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:04.760
 Well, the fact that people who is a substitute yes 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.989
 they turned out 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.549
 it helps and the coin of 11 players but 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:17.360
 even cooler you never do 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:19.989
 Complicated Dead Lands I wrote did not start 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.989
 very important 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.410
 again the risks that I said it again 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:36.850
 to speak more there were teams and about 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:40.790
 hard everything was hard nothing there 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:53.930
 can be installed released 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:59.450
 and tonight well surely then 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:04.390
 What does this mean now? 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:21.500
 this situation is great moments are driving 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:22.450
 positive is sure to score 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.910

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.280
 It has 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.800
 so let's hope you intend 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.870
 and steps to the roller and how 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.449

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:56.260
 we 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.260
 strongly
