00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.680
 Everyone cormorant Hello 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.340
 It is a good of world rubber market . Thank you again for this table tennis Chie blog. 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.290
 I will 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:15.130
 I think today's theme will be about rotating drive 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:21.160
 I 've put out a lot of videos of the rotary drive I 've done so far 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.760
 This chic finely do we go form, such as how to capture try by all means incorporated into this mainstream time 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.190
 Please give me 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.450
 End ball 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.420
 I think j 1 If you want to aim'll do it by all means car rotation live who want a cool play 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.460
 Since quite suffered comprising 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:38.699
 Please refer to the immediately play Dogan Please try to try 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:43.730
 The point when using this downward rotation drive is when it jumps to the power when you hit the batting point 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:48.440
 It is very effective as a connection technique at the time of pinch etc. 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:52.970
 Instead of returning with a normal drive when hitting hard to beat 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:58.400
 It is said that the number can be taken when it is chased by doing the drive which put the rotation 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.239
 A strong player who makes a deadly drive sometimes uses this kind of spinning drive as well. 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.750
 You Teki 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:09.240
 So the players who hit the drive that the ball falls or changes suddenly 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.300
 Not the chance to have here in the mix a rotation drive of will continue to leverage from behind 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.700
 If you think it is a ball and you hit it, it will drop 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.090
 It is this down spin drive that the opponent is driven down and it is said that this downturn drive will miss 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.690
 But 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:29.700
 The place of the now will you cormorant Ma this desperation that have been using traffic well 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.610
 When I dropped the RBI when was east molars because from the time when the jump is that this lower rotary drive 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:39.140
 We recommend using a drive of killing 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:41.930
 When you break the time painful pinch of in strictly rather than ancillary meaning of using the main 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:47.870
 please use it 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:52.000
 It is a rotating drive like this . It looks like a rotating drive when you look normally . 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:56.580
 Rotation has entered that while visible to the ordinary on a rotating diagonal 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.660
 To be precise, it will be rotation called side down rotation 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.660
 At first, I think it is easier to remember if this lateral rotation is strong 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.960
 When it is said how much it actually cuts 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.780
 I will avoid 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:18.600
 I'm in surgery or in the courtroom, so let's do it with telnet 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.800
 Because it was an imaginary position that makes the lower rotation drive, I hit this when it is included. 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.600
 Will fall 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:30.310
 In the first one to which I think you So first one large point and want to do the way from here 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:34.090
 In the first place, it is important to wrap the face of the racket inside 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.849
 That are doing is to now this super please go out consciousness, such as curve drive 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.030
 In the sense of driving a curve 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:45.180
 Take in the face of the racket 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:49.770
 Let's meet this way Take in the racket, step on the inside as well and use the wrist to wind it 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.490
 I feel lucky as I feel when I racket the surface of the racket is involved 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.210
 Face the racket 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.410
 Truly tucking inside with the wrist 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.410
 I will give you a spin 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.280
 As it is really important to get in the most important love inside, please be aware 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.870
 The second important thing is that you drop the batting point after that 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:15.030
 After all the live of the rotation which I did this I would drop it if I dropped the ball down this way 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.030
 It is easy to put a dodger rotation 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:24.610
 The batting speed was high and I was bogged down and the speed got out 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:30.170
 When it always lower rotary drive-oriented in order not to be multiplied by the rotation play is 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:34.940
 Please be aware that you will attract as many strikes as possible 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.520
 It is the third one It was feeling like throwing a bowling People who put a turn are recommended 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.880
 It becomes the way of 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:47.410
 Now actually pretend to look at this kinda funny child form that beats the lower rotational drive 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.819
 It doesn't look like I'm throwing bowling now I'm throwing bowling now 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:55.200
 Feeling to enter If you are throwing this bowling 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.370
 It feels like throwing a ball, but throwing a bowling ball is considered to be disadvantageous 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.769
 It is easy to put a turn 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:04.650
 It's hard to get started at first, so it's hard to drive the rotation so it's side down 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:09.450
 It is recommended because rotation go out 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.810
 I feel like I do the Meiji curve long I do the curve long and do the curve drive 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.739
 Later society 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.190
 It can be said that it will gradually put in a tongue if it is a procedure of feeling like 10 drive. 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:23.200
 I think it will be like 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:27.850
 When looking at this real super slow, this real rotational drive looks good 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:32.080
 The lower rotation is also included, but it is mixed with the lateral rotation . 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.570
 The ball is now turning downside down like this I'm finally like a head 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.650
 Swing to the top of your head with camouflage 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:42.340
 It looks like an upturn drive 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.639
 Apply the lower rotation drive and finally raise it just above the racket 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.800
 If you look at this now, this is 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:53.810
 It looks like it looks like a normal up-turn drive 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.270
 Say that rotation was'm ne This fact rotation looks full rotation Poku in camouflage 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:01.430
 Become a drive for rotation 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:04.800
 It's even more effective for the other party by doing a little better camouflage like this 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.870
 Rotation drive that everyone did by all means 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.760
 Please try a challenge 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:14.270
 Escape as a tool at the time of painful and frantic Special Move Pinch 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.680
 I think it is a very corner, yes 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:21.150
 High place 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:23.200
 The point is put together easily and pull in one eye side inside 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.410
 The second 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:31.360
 Three eyes attract as a shield 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.440
 I felt like I was throwing O-rings. At this time, it is okay to mix the side turn at this time. 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.140
 is 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:42.060
 Finally put it like a spinning drive on top of your head with a camouflage and swing over 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:44.630
 It means that cancellation becomes more effective 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.340
 Rotation drive that everyone did by all means 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.670
 Since It was remember and try to go to during the break because to do it is while playing try to try 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.670
 Please give me
