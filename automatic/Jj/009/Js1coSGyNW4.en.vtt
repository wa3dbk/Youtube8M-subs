00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.270 
bought a new one today from Best Buy and
this<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.349> actually<00:00:13.740> one<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.980> ones<00:00:14.160> that

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
this is actually one of the ones that

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.640 
this is actually one of the ones that
was<00:00:14.460> around<00:00:14.700> during<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> holiday<00:00:15.299> season

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
was around during the holiday season

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.040 
was around during the holiday season
that<00:00:16.650> comes<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.039> two<00:00:17.490> games<00:00:17.720> so<00:00:18.720> it's<00:00:18.960> going

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
that comes with two games so it's going

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.420 
that comes with two games so it's going
to<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.199> pretty<00:00:19.289> much<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> same<00:00:19.740> thing<00:00:19.800> but<00:00:20.010> I

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
to be pretty much the same thing but I

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.689 
to be pretty much the same thing but I
figure<00:00:20.910> I'll<00:00:21.090> unbox<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.570> anyway<00:00:21.869> because<00:00:22.050> I

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
figure I'll unbox it anyway because I

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.870 
figure I'll unbox it anyway because I
like<00:00:23.699> making<00:00:23.939> videos<00:00:24.029> an<00:00:24.449> abort<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.880> don't

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
like making videos an abort so I don't

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.130 
like making videos an abort so I don't
know<00:00:26.939> maybe<00:00:27.060> haven't<00:00:27.390> seen<00:00:27.539> my<00:00:27.660> other<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
know maybe haven't seen my other one and

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.280 
know maybe haven't seen my other one and
you're<00:00:28.349> too<00:00:28.500> lazy<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.920> look<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:32.989> get<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.020> out

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
you're too lazy to look so get that out

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.660 
you're too lazy to look so get that out
of<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> way<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> these<00:00:37.950> little<00:00:38.219> foam<00:00:38.399> things

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
of the way so these little foam things

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.340 
of the way so these little foam things
out<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> way<00:00:40.550> this<00:00:41.550> thing<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.809> 250<00:00:43.230> gig

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
out of the way this thing is the 250 gig

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.690 
out of the way this thing is the 250 gig
version<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> be<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> glossy

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
version so it's going to be a glossy

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.850 
version so it's going to be a glossy
finish<00:00:45.110> which<00:00:46.110> means<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.680> like

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
finish which means it's going to be like

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.720 
finish which means it's going to be like
a<00:00:46.920> fingerprint<00:00:47.309> magnet<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.489> don't<00:00:50.640> even

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
a fingerprint magnet and I don't even

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.650 
a fingerprint magnet and I don't even
have<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.110> good<00:00:52.110> place<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.530> put<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> I

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
have a good place to put this now that I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.090 
have a good place to put this now that I
switched<00:00:54.660> my<00:00:54.780> little<00:00:55.110> white<00:00:55.350> shelf<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:55.949> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
switched my little white shelf for that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.340 
switched my little white shelf for that
taller<00:00:56.340> bookcase<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> don't<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.079> have

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
taller bookcase so I don't really have

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.970 
taller bookcase so I don't really have
any<00:00:58.649> place<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.309> put<00:00:59.430> my<00:00:59.640> systems<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.680> this

drive<00:02:14.100> goes<00:02:14.340> there's<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.790> little<00:02:14.910> tab<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.360> it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
drive goes there's a little tab on it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.530 
drive goes there's a little tab on it
says<00:02:16.080> 250<00:02:16.980> gigabytes<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.970> just<00:02:18.150> pull<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
says 250 gigabytes you just pull on the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.230 
says 250 gigabytes you just pull on the
tab<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.050> then<00:02:19.520> that's<00:02:20.520> how<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.060> hard

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
tab and then that's how you get the hard

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.360 
tab and then that's how you get the hard
drive<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.690> then<00:02:21.900> I'm<00:02:23.360> there's<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> system

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
drive and then I'm there's the system

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.530 
drive and then I'm there's the system
see<00:02:26.370> what<00:02:26.490> else<00:02:26.610> comes<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.030> box<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:27.480> time

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
see what else comes in the box this time

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.290 
see what else comes in the box this time
now<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:27.959> we<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.880> okay<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
now that we have the okay so we have the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.060 
now that we have the okay so we have the
actual<00:02:30.450> shrink-wrapped<00:02:31.290> copy<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.920> box

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
actual shrink-wrapped copy of the box

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.030 
actual shrink-wrapped copy of the box
for<00:02:32.540> forza<00:02:33.540> motorsport<00:02:34.140> three<00:02:34.170> which<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.860> don't

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
for forza motorsport three which I don't

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.830 
for forza motorsport three which I don't
really<00:02:35.220> care<00:02:36.090> about<00:02:36.209> because<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.630> like<00:02:36.780> a

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
really care about because it's like a

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.490 
really care about because it's like a
realistic<00:02:37.350> driving<00:02:37.740> sim<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:40.020> says<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.380> comes

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
realistic driving sim it says it comes

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.360 
realistic driving sim it says it comes
with<00:02:40.650> Alan<00:02:40.950> Wake<00:02:41.100> but<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.820> download

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
with Alan Wake but it's a download

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.770 
with Alan Wake but it's a download
version<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.550> game<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.910> don't<00:02:45.180> know<00:02:45.300> why<00:02:45.480> I

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
version of the game I don't know why I

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.990 
version of the game I don't know why I
have<00:02:46.380> like<00:02:46.890> no<00:02:46.920> idea<00:02:47.250> why<00:02:47.520> they<00:02:47.640> wouldn't<00:02:47.850> just

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
have like no idea why they wouldn't just

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.670 
have like no idea why they wouldn't just
give<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.239> actual<00:02:48.600> disc<00:02:49.110> version<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
give you the actual disc version of the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.130 
give you the actual disc version of the
game<00:02:49.830> but<00:02:50.190> yeah<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.390> there's<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.630> code<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:52.019> that

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
game but yeah so there's a code for that

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.040 
game but yeah so there's a code for that
and<00:02:52.500> then<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.489> looks<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.760> there's<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.269> demo<00:02:54.870> of

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
and then it looks like there's a demo of

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.770 
and then it looks like there's a demo of
modern<00:02:55.739> warfare<00:02:55.890> 2<00:02:56.160> which<00:02:56.540> normally<00:02:57.540> would<00:02:57.570> be

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
modern warfare 2 which normally would be

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.509 
modern warfare 2 which normally would be
cool<00:02:58.019> but<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.530> cliffhanger<00:02:59.040> part<00:02:59.310> which

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
cool but it's the cliffhanger part which

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.640 
cool but it's the cliffhanger part which
is<00:02:59.550> kind<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.030> boring<00:03:00.300> spend<00:03:01.290> half<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.530> time

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
is kind of boring spend half the time

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.620 
is kind of boring spend half the time
just<00:03:01.860> like<00:03:01.980> climbing<00:03:02.459> up<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.760> mountain<00:03:05.630> so

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.580

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
immediately notice the difference in the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.460 
immediately notice the difference in the
power<00:03:36.710> brick<00:03:40.150> yeah<00:03:41.150> this<00:03:41.420> one<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:42.110> lot

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
power brick yeah this one is a lot

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.010 
power brick yeah this one is a lot
simpler<00:03:42.830> still<00:03:43.460> big<00:03:43.640> still<00:03:44.630> bigger<00:03:44.810> than<00:03:44.930> a

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
simpler still big still bigger than a

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.500 
simpler still big still bigger than a
laptop<00:03:45.230> power<00:03:45.620> brick<00:03:45.830> but<00:03:46.130> at<00:03:47.030> least<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:47.420> a

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
laptop power brick but at least it's a

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:56.230 
laptop power brick but at least it's a
little<00:03:47.720> bit<00:03:47.840> smaller<00:03:54.880> headset<00:03:55.880> which<00:03:56.120> is

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
little bit smaller headset which is

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.170 
little bit smaller headset which is
always<00:03:56.450> next<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:58.990> and<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:01.670> controller

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
always next to have and the controller

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.000 
always next to have and the controller
unfortunately<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.170> cables<00:04:03.500> in<00:04:03.590> their<00:04:03.710> events

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
unfortunately the cables in their events

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.460 
unfortunately the cables in their events
are<00:04:04.100> just<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.370> V<00:04:04.640> but<00:04:05.420> I<00:04:05.750> haven't<00:04:06.020> each<00:04:06.170> TMI

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
are just a V but I haven't each TMI

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.070 
are just a V but I haven't each TMI
cable<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:06.890> it's<00:04:07.010> all<00:04:07.130> good<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.960> the<00:04:08.960> last

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
cable so it's all good and the last

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.420 
cable so it's all good and the last
thing<00:04:09.320> they<00:04:09.440> improved<00:04:09.770> with<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.070> controller

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
thing they improved with the controller

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.740 
thing they improved with the controller
well<00:04:10.790> it's<00:04:10.880> not<00:04:10.940> really<00:04:11.060> an<00:04:11.210> improvement<00:04:11.510> it's

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
well it's not really an improvement it's

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.160 
well it's not really an improvement it's
just<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:11.960> change<00:04:12.410> i<00:04:12.650> guess<00:04:12.680> but<00:04:13.580> um<00:04:14.170> the

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
just a change i guess but um the

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.409 
just a change i guess but um the
joysticks<00:04:15.590> used<00:04:15.770> to<00:04:15.890> be<00:04:16.040> like<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:17.000> grayish

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
joysticks used to be like a grayish

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:18.849 
joysticks used to be like a grayish
color<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:17.989> they<00:04:18.049> would<00:04:18.200> turn<00:04:18.320> yellow<00:04:18.590> very

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
color and they would turn yellow very

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.080 
color and they would turn yellow very
quickly<00:04:19.299> now<00:04:20.299> they're<00:04:20.540> black<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:22.090> this

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
quickly now they're black and this

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.730 
quickly now they're black and this
little<00:04:23.390> button<00:04:23.930> here<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.169> you<00:04:24.380> used<00:04:24.530> to

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
little button here that you used to

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.320 
little button here that you used to
bring<00:04:24.919> up<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.160> menu<00:04:25.280> is<00:04:25.580> actually<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.000> chrome

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
bring up the menu is actually the chrome

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.830 
bring up the menu is actually the chrome
which<00:04:26.990> is<00:04:27.140> why<00:04:27.260> it's<00:04:27.410> all<00:04:27.500> shiny<00:04:27.770> and<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:29.510> top

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
which is why it's all shiny and the top

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.900 
which is why it's all shiny and the top
glossy<00:04:30.620> part<00:04:30.830> in<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.070> bottom<00:04:31.310> glossy<00:04:31.669> part

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
glossy part in the bottom glossy part

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.630 
glossy part in the bottom glossy part
used<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.600> be<00:04:32.750> I<00:04:32.990> think<00:04:33.110> like<00:04:33.380> grey<00:04:33.620> but<00:04:34.400> now

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
used to be I think like grey but now

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.020 
used to be I think like grey but now

black<00:04:43.790> headset<00:04:44.300> obviously<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:45.050> go<00:04:45.110> with<00:04:45.200> the

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
black headset obviously to go with the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.580 
black headset obviously to go with the
black<00:04:45.410> system<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:47.000> then<00:04:47.900> like<00:04:48.080> I<00:04:48.110> said<00:04:48.230> the

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
black system and then like I said the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.820 
black system and then like I said the
last<00:04:48.740> thing<00:04:48.919> in<00:04:49.010> here<00:04:49.130> should<00:04:49.310> be<00:04:50.590> standard<00:04:51.590> AV

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.540 

yeah<00:05:00.660> standard<00:05:01.470> a/v<00:05:01.560> cables<00:05:02.040> which<00:05:02.220> I'm<00:05:02.340> never

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
yeah standard a/v cables which I'm never

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.630 
yeah standard a/v cables which I'm never
going<00:05:02.730> to<00:05:02.790> use<00:05:02.940> so<00:05:03.890> right<00:05:04.890> back<00:05:05.070> in<00:05:05.250> there<00:05:05.400> I

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
going to use so right back in there I

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.700 
going to use so right back in there I
don't<00:05:05.970> know<00:05:06.030> why<00:05:06.210> they<00:05:06.390> bother<00:05:07.170> giving<00:05:07.440> you<00:05:07.620> at

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
don't know why they bother giving you at

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.550 
don't know why they bother giving you at
least<00:05:07.860> component<00:05:08.400> those<00:05:08.550> aren't<00:05:08.730> expensive

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
least component those aren't expensive

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.870 
least component those aren't expensive
but<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:10.650> like<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.890> way<00:05:10.980> that<00:05:11.130> this<00:05:11.310> box<00:05:11.580> has<00:05:11.760> got

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
but I like the way that this box has got

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.160 
but I like the way that this box has got
little<00:05:12.240> compartments<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:12.870> stuff<00:05:13.050> because

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
little compartments and stuff because

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.990 
little compartments and stuff because
you<00:05:13.800> know<00:05:13.920> exactly<00:05:14.370> where<00:05:14.550> everything<00:05:14.610> goes

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
you know exactly where everything goes

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.390 
you know exactly where everything goes
back<00:05:15.270> in<00:05:15.480> and<00:05:15.900> then<00:05:16.710> it's<00:05:16.890> like<00:05:16.980> really<00:05:17.190> easy

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
back in and then it's like really easy

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.430 
back in and then it's like really easy
to<00:05:17.580> pack<00:05:17.760> it<00:05:17.910> up<00:05:18.000> nice<00:05:18.420> if<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:19.020> need<00:05:19.170> to<00:05:19.290> you

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
to pack it up nice if you need to you

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.590 
to pack it up nice if you need to you
know<00:05:19.530> bring<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.950> somewhere<00:05:20.250> pack<00:05:21.240> it<00:05:21.270> away<00:05:21.390> or

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
know bring it somewhere pack it away or

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.990 
know bring it somewhere pack it away or
whatever<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:23.010> then<00:05:23.190> of<00:05:23.310> course<00:05:23.340> paperwork<00:05:23.940> a

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
whatever and then of course paperwork a

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.760 
whatever and then of course paperwork a
nobody<00:05:24.240> cares<00:05:24.540> about<00:05:25.280> but<00:05:27.350> so<00:05:28.350> basically<00:05:28.740> I

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
nobody cares about but so basically I

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.730 
nobody cares about but so basically I
guess<00:05:28.860> my<00:05:29.160> system<00:05:29.550> is<00:05:29.580> going<00:05:29.790> to<00:05:29.850> have<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.150> go

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
guess my system is going to have to go

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:39.010 
guess my system is going to have to go
