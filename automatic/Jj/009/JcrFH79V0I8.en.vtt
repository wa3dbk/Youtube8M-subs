talking<00:00:26.340> about<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.820> remember<00:00:27.599> coming<00:00:27.779> out<00:00:28.109> i

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
talking about I remember coming out i

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.859 
talking about I remember coming out i
had<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.800> definitive<00:00:29.550> step<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.420> kind<00:00:30.750> of

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
had that definitive step that kind of

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
had that definitive step that kind of
gets<00:00:31.109> washed<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:32.099> everything<00:00:32.489> they

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
gets washed out because everything they

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760 
gets washed out because everything they
teach<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:34.050> they<00:00:34.230> want<00:00:34.380> everything

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
teach you is that they want everything

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.920 
teach you is that they want everything
to<00:00:35.040> look<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.399> same<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.940> definitive<00:00:36.270> step

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
to look the same the definitive step

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.310 
to look the same the definitive step
starts<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.399> fade<00:00:38.640> away<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.629> that's

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
starts to kind of fade away but that's

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.139 
starts to kind of fade away but that's
what<00:00:40.620> that's<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.040> creates<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.670> separation

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
what that's what creates that separation

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.930 
what that's what creates that separation
i<00:00:42.480> just<00:00:42.719> told<00:00:42.930> him<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:43.649> lose<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.280> because

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
i just told him do not lose that because

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
i just told him do not lose that because
the<00:00:45.090> more<00:00:45.300> i<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.600> him<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.710> more<00:00:46.739> i

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the more i see him do that the more i

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.680 
the more i see him do that the more i
remember<00:00:47.550> when<00:00:47.670> i<00:00:47.700> used<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.329> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
remember when i used to do that and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.779 
remember when i used to do that and
create<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.170> much<00:00:49.350> even<00:00:49.710> more<00:00:49.920> separation<00:00:50.610> I'm

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
create so much even more separation I'm

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.240 
create so much even more separation I'm
starting<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.600> creep<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.110> back<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.620> by<00:00:53.039> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
starting to creep that back in by that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.860 
starting to creep that back in by that
he<00:00:53.370> means<00:00:53.489> creating<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.090> used<00:00:54.329> use<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
he means creating a used use the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.830 
he means creating a used use the
definitive<00:00:55.199> step<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.100> game<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:57.600> so

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
definitive step back in this game and so

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.939 
definitive step back in this game and so
he's<00:00:58.020> talking<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.829> um<00:00:59.809> coaches<00:01:00.949> try

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
route you're supposed to so that

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.170 
route you're supposed to so that
defenders<00:01:17.070> can't<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> hint<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.850> what<00:01:18.030> type

defenders can't get a hint of what type

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.929 
defenders can't get a hint of what type
of<00:01:18.210> route<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.930> i<00:01:19.080> know<00:01:19.229> from<00:01:19.640> playing<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
of route it is i know from playing that

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.730 
of route it is i know from playing that
there's<00:01:21.119> certain<00:01:21.270> receivers<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.710> a

towel at the line of scrimmage than just

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.039 
towel at the line of scrimmage than just
the<00:01:25.170> way<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:26.240> compose<00:01:27.240> themselves<00:01:27.570> or

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the way that they compose themselves or

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.590 
the way that they compose themselves or
their<00:01:29.009> posture<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> line<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.180> script

their posture at the line of the script
the<00:01:30.750> line<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.049> scrimmage<00:01:31.140> gives<00:01:31.680> away<00:01:31.920> what

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
the line of scrimmage gives away what

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.260 
the line of scrimmage gives away what
type<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.490> route<00:01:32.790> they're<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> be

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
type of route they're going to be

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.460 
type of route they're going to be
running<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.840> i<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.020> an<00:01:34.110> edge<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.409> that

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
running and so i have an edge on that

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.780 
running and so i have an edge on that
because<00:01:34.829> i<00:01:34.920> know<00:01:34.979> exactly<00:01:35.159> what<00:01:35.549> they're

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
because i know exactly what they're

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.670 
because i know exactly what they're
going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.180> where<00:01:36.810> they're<00:01:37.020> both<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> be

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
going to where they're both going to be

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.069 
going to where they're both going to be
going<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.759> course<00:01:39.329> i<00:01:39.420> don't<00:01:39.479> tell<00:01:39.750> who<00:01:39.930> they

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
going of course i don't tell who they

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.039 
going of course i don't tell who they
are<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.409> i<00:01:40.650> want<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.860> keep<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.130> edge<00:01:42.049> but

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
are because i want to keep that edge but

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.840 
are because i want to keep that edge but
that's<00:01:43.530> sort<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.189> sort<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.700> the
