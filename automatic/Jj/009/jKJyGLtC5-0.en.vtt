00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
we maybe if we exit the world and simply

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
we maybe if we exit the world and simply
go<00:01:58.350> back<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> menu<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.759> go<00:01:59.820> to

go back to the menu like this and go to
popsicle<00:02:00.680> then<00:02:01.680> sometimes<00:02:02.189> it'll<00:02:02.430> generate

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
popsicle then sometimes it'll generate

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.789 
popsicle then sometimes it'll generate
properly<00:02:03.119> there<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.509> go<00:02:03.719> okay<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.259> forgot<00:02:04.649> about

understand<00:02:11.840> exactly<00:02:12.080> why<00:02:12.890> that's<00:02:13.069> an<00:02:13.159> issue

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
understand exactly why that's an issue

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.610 
understand exactly why that's an issue
but<00:02:13.700> at<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.239> moment<00:02:14.329> it's<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:14.629> problem<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.110> be

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
but at the moment it's a problem so be

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.500 
but at the moment it's a problem so be
aware<00:02:15.799> of<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.099> so<00:02:16.310> this<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:16.819> village<00:02:17.360> is

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
aware of that so this this village is

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.240 
aware of that so this this village is
very<00:02:17.750> unique<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:18.290> several<00:02:18.709> ways<00:02:18.890> and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
very unique in several ways and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.860 
very unique in several ways and
obviously<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.390> placement<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.810> the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
obviously the placement in the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.270 
obviously the placement in the
environment<00:02:21.170> I'm<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.680> many<00:02:21.799> of<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.010> found

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
environment I'm so many of you found

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.630 
environment I'm so many of you found
villages<00:02:23.150> by<00:02:23.739> forest<00:02:24.739> like<00:02:24.980> places<00:02:25.489> there

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
villages by forest like places there

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.119 
villages by forest like places there
before<00:02:26.000> now<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.900> difference<00:02:27.019> here<00:02:27.349> is<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
before now the difference here is the

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.069 
before now the difference here is the
fact<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.459> is<00:02:28.610> basically<00:02:29.000> butted<00:02:29.420> up<00:02:29.510> against

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
fact that is basically butted up against

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.670 
fact that is basically butted up against
a<00:02:30.200> mountain<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:31.280> not<00:02:32.000> only<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.360> got<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.750> hole

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
a mountain and not only that got a hole

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.899 
a mountain and not only that got a hole
through<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:33.980> middle<00:02:34.220> age<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.730> can

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
through the middle age so you can

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.330 
through the middle age so you can
actually<00:02:35.150> take<00:02:35.420> over<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:35.840> area<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.470> you

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
actually take over this area and you

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.190 
actually take over this area and you
know<00:02:37.459> pop<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.120> bit<00:02:38.269> that<00:02:38.299> I<00:02:38.540> take<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.750> pickaxe

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
know pop the bit that I take a pickaxe

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.199 
know pop the bit that I take a pickaxe
and<00:02:39.439> then<00:02:39.650> cut<00:02:40.340> out<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.489> middle<00:02:40.819> of<00:02:40.909> it<00:02:41.060> and

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
and then cut out the middle of it and

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.089 
and then cut out the middle of it and
actually<00:02:41.569> make<00:02:41.989> something<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.769> place

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
actually make something of this place

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.030 
actually make something of this place
you<00:02:43.579> can<00:02:43.700> make<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:43.849> way<00:02:44.150> cool<00:02:44.720> town<00:02:45.560> right<00:02:45.859> here

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
you can make a way cool town right here

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.949 
you can make a way cool town right here
which<00:02:46.430> there's<00:02:46.819> already<00:02:47.000> buildings<00:02:47.780> you've

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
which there's already buildings you've

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.629 
which there's already buildings you've

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639 
got farms and here's the other thing

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.660 
got farms and here's the other thing
though<00:02:50.109> it's<00:02:51.109> against<00:02:51.739> at<00:02:51.889> forest<00:02:52.370> here

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
though it's against at forest here

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.569 
though it's against at forest here
against<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.359> mountain<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.980> even<00:02:55.190> goes<00:02:55.400> out

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
against a mountain and it even goes out

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:56.830 
against a mountain and it even goes out
to<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> water<00:02:55.940> because<00:02:56.329> if<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.510> goes<00:02:56.599> out<00:02:56.750> to

to the water because if it goes out to

to the water because if it goes out to
the<00:02:56.900> water<00:02:57.079> it<00:02:57.530> spawns<00:02:58.040> these<00:02:58.250> miniature

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
the water it spawns these miniature
