00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.650
 hi both of a text not that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.580
 I hope you're doing a lot less 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.870
 perfectly find themselves today 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.380
 for episode number three of the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.480
 dynasty 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.940
 we open the weekly pack you know 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.350
 that I bought the ultimate version of 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.119
 alive to this account 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.439
 finally it's a new club in some 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.400
 so so I'm going to have the right to have the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.769
 right to 24 points 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 and that's why I have 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.590
 weekly packs go on it's always 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.660
 in division 5 years so against a beautiful 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.399
 team in 5.3 late May the team way 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.399
 to speak a pretty powerful team in 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.649
 5-3-2 and then I proposed you two 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.780
 are for for the purposes of saint-anne 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.480
 here is the newt of ikea 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.640
 here it is down here I hope there is a little 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.510
 for this episode and then there will be 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.739
 a second 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.750
 a second version that I you 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.739
 were proposing a little bit right there all of 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.300
 next because well you know that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.920
 zlatan it's a bit of a star the subject 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.649
 jimenez who accelerated on side up the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.969
 little pass and ben laden who is going 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.460
 allow to conclude on a small goal 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.039
 disgusting early so here are two 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.650
 solutions that I propose you it is the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.540
 here's newt and the one with two 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.159
 eclipses with ibrahimovic here it is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.170
 even offers himself his trip and this gives a 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.909
 little what otherwise it's not funny you 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.830
 to say it we'll see it in slow motion 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.210
 beautiful corner shot by gourcuff and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.590
 the big cabeza so it's up to you to tell me 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.540
 in the comments what you 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.640
 prefer game me it puts me frankly 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.700
 equal 1 that it heals August or even the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.500
 first its here so there is 4,040 there 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.630
 frankly it's here he even stopped 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.670
 to play at the end of the period so hop I 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.500
 allow me one last goal with catane 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.210
 this is the gemmi of newt but enough like 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.259
 so you want me to be told 5-0 at the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.220
 half-time I accelerate a little bit 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.619
 sequence everything that is a special and 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.600
 there it told me ok we had not yet 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.890
 arrived here it is left rights watch 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.299
 it was a long time ago 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.360
 a long time ago so we're still 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.280
 not in division 4 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 it's an egg thing frankly if 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.950
 it's a phew but we'll go there 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.229
 to arrive one day we'll get there Iy 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.720
 believe 3 wins 2 draws 3 losses 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.730
 it's really a 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.320
 a disgusting balance we follow on a 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.540
 second match and wassit against a 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.560
 team full of gold with side 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.780
 players hours good players 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.220
 by the way but yeah I do not understand 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.120
 too much the goal of making a team like 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.230
 that may be players he has 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.540
 seen in the time I know strictly 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.040
 nothing but I was pretty serene 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.330
 frankly the cei we start having 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.120
 a little more success on 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.130
 start to win matches so that's it 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.770
 we left for this second match of 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.910
 the episode the team that begins to have 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.990
 we miss some small 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.730
 players still to have a team 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.440
 completely 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.880
 finally completely simply alas 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.290
 these attacks that will light up on the side 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.880
 here's the little typing brother 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.970
 this go back to earth and it's gourcuff 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.770
 which marks this purpose disgusting etoro role 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.850
 very very ugly this goal but there is no 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.310
 of pity there is no pool at 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.880
 least 200m if I lead 5-0 I put some 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.920
 goals of the gunners 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.080
 ah ah no i have no respect 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.330
 frankly I'm a guy that a big 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.340
 creveur he'll succeed here at the 31st 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.630
 minute and kroos and callejón to lose the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.880
 ball it's monnet package that goes 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.800
 to recover the good work of menez to 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.270
 who will give back for monnet package 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.360
 decidedly who was on the left side 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.519
 from the beginning to then shifted 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.060
 singing that centers the doubled of yoann 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.130
 gourcuff 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.560
 that's 2 0 that's how it's 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.060
 pass here this is the perfect little center of 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.320
 chantôme the head of gourcuff above 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.530
 to prick it was a little mytho I 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.459
 you admit the here I clear like I 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.480
 can there frankly they were in the process 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.459
 to push at the beginning of the second period 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.030
 I really it really undeserved 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.950
 score a goal 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.510
 and there the guard who shuts himself on that 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.940
 contains more one clears by releasing 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.870
 clear it's really complicated 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.010
 the opponent who push to try 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.160
 to reduce the brand 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.750
 he has the key I try to defend but 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.850
 there I find myself completely abate 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.769
 who wants to let go for modric modric who 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.420
 make a little pass on the side and ben 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.450
 this is cameron crosser who had good 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.519
 follow-up that marks the goal to reduce the 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.500
 score it's 2-1 in the 53rd minute beautiful 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.600
 pass here for chantme for ménez 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.890
 who is alone he accelerates and 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.970
 you know what's going to happen it's not 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.260
 the disgusting ideal for phantom 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.180
 big hit at the bottom of the post 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.830
 Jeremy a very good player who is 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.160
 frankly a good recruit I like 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.870
 a lot 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.660
 not very expensive besides you are not 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.640
 obliged to take it in md in this 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.640
 composition there since I have a seat 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.900
 collective aria 6.2 collective on 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.549
 three so it still gives him nine 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.220
 of collectives here I'm going to take a 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.620
 red card with sokratis and by the 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.900
 same occasion a penalty in the 83rd 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.099
 he will not take care of it with the that 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.299
 fabregas since he was injured but 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.549
 with radamel falcao 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.230
 I say he'll shoot him in the middle of thursday 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.680
 morning in the middle and no he shot at 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.479
 right 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.709
 he comes back to the score just before the end 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.630
 of the match I tell myself why 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.220
 not a little free kick exane statham 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.150
 I'm trying to try to show a 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.040
 little bit of a free kick with him 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.900
 unfortunately I lose the ball I 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.169
 recover I try to make small 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.760
 move is lost but hey he will not 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.120
 the time to play counterattack and 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.220
 maybe to equalize so here is finally a 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.660
 episode we win sokratis matches 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.789
 who takes a red card 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.590
 no problem but here we are finally 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:48.860
 in division 4 finally promised it was 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.910
 long it was galley but finally here we are 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.280
 is in division 4 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.650
 yes so it took the form I 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.120
 also in nabbing a pure 2000 credit and he 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.650
 I needed new players because 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.500
 I want to finish this team 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.580
 so here is after playing the card 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.650
 form I invested in a defender 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.270
 right this is gedre this one i do not 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.919
 I'm not sure yet to have it but 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.860
 I made an offer on it and then 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.220
 there is to taste here is the player of 2 in 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.750
 purse I believe well I have not more I 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.710
 not been successful at too much in 4 4 1 but that's 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.360
 no big deal so that's it's the 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.680
 players who are two sides yves renaud 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.389
 cohade also the Saint-Etienne player 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.310
 speed of a rate we end up Thursday 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.310
