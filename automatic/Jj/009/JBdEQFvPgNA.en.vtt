00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.420
 braid arm and with the most under this 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.000

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.759
 caster nickname from which grew all 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.189
 famous fresh columbia river 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.130

 solid wood carving and such 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.369
 crazy chupacabra funny interesting 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.189
 weird knife surely in a single 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.860
 instance yes probably so 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.460
 customize knives too and everything is possible 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.530
 equals some trash in this present but 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.420
 nevertheless the person who did it 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.230
 understood why he did it understood 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.540
 communes 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.890
 and it came out agree very, very 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.480
 not bad here is kostanaya enduro 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.880
 back to the topic of my favorite hijacking 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.960
 cliff this knives with straight cutting 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.900
 by the edge i stumbled upon andrew williams and 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.260
 three kinds will make these knives in many 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.080
 dimensional and designer finds 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.080
 he makes them smaller more makes them 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.560
 with Damascus sti mask himself basically everything 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.200
 Blades had come from the 35 veins made 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.010
 they are polished and chromed 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.110
 stounvosh other good things he and good 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.470
 interesting flippers damn it think 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.160
 I want to lean over to see how much 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:54.060
 worth it probably donâ€™t want the most basic 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.510
 model costs $ 500 model 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.940
 more interesting is already 800 well and premium 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.660
 with every tricky stage go mask yourself 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.110
 inserts worth already under 2 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.420
 with all that, the knife is interesting and fun 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.410
 I do not know the reasons will start someone to do 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.120
 and Syria yshchikov or not yet unclear but 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.660
 surely designer interesting knives 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.040

 Ponomareva look at their news twice 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.219
 in a week you can still subscribe to 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:35.379
 VKontakte group vk.com hears was given 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:37.480
 stumbled across the internet several times 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.840
 photos of the next and products 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.500
 crazy dude direst and this is liza 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.209
 mansur 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.370
 whose clip is welded watch that 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.829
 tear out the eye was completely sure that it 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.439
 Calypso is such an arc originally 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.060
 welded and all on this direct mad 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.889
 dude from him you can expect all of that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.489
 I thought that on this 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:02.409
 it turns out nothing for a long time 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.500
 saw the next photo where such 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:08.980
 clip type cute two closed hooks 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.659
 without a middle segment I think here that 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.970
 it turns out everything opens 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.430
 the tool doesn't work like I used to 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.789
 thought started googling video and yes 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.310
 Indeed this is the most crooked clip 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:24.090
 which initially seemed to lock 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.260
 this tool is for ever 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.650
 it turns out neatly 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.039
 thin sawing 06 probably sawn 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.289
 exactly at the joints and it turns out that calypso 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.330
 looks solid and the tool itself 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.669
 you can fold it 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.060
 absolutely normal working as usual 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.280
 dream why this crazy welder again 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.620
 it took to scoff at other man 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.720
 we do not understand but it's his chip he 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.880
 works in this segment if anyone and 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.159
 welding machine and a piece of good 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.310
 bar why not so too 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:59.310
 mock algeria mana 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.700
 as they say on the Internet tremendous 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.120
 woes post long ago can not find 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.490
 not even wholesalers have retail of 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.380
 a wonderful sharpener from the company Bird 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.540
 which was called income income this 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:19.530
 duck paw it looks like this 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.290
 way cool great piece of iron 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.220
 diamond-covered and having a bunch 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:29.310
 inflated surfaces handy thing 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.310
 unconditionally enjoyed and about 5 years ago and in 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.860
 sharpen knives 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.900
 this is someone's scissors even this 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.160
 sharpeners have a special surface for 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.390
 sharpening chisels even siry tara 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.150
 most spider jack 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:48.030
 radius and verified were so even the sea 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.400
 adhesion rayder could be corrected 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.150
 This sharpener and suddenly three or four years 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.810
 ago this sharpener disappeared everywhere 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.030
 Amazons 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.940
 for I sometimes slips and here at 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.930
 I do not see serious retailers very much and 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.180
 a long time ago 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.730
 with all the same income 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.040
 releases the riser itself so far but 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.420
 do they somehow ceramics and 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.070
 absolutely flat 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.100
 not only is it three times as expensive 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.240
 bard she eighty-five times 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.540
 unambiguously 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.950
 for some reason it is not clear my dear 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.310
 I ask you mate 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.810

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.400
