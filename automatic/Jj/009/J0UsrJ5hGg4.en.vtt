you almost don't have time to make the
up<00:03:47.800> shift<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.250> really<00:03:48.490> sort<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:49.000> shows<00:03:49.240> the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
up shift it really sort of shows the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.080 
up shift it really sort of shows the
slow<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.130> automatic<00:03:51.490> transmission<00:03:51.970> is

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
slow and automatic transmission is

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.660 
slow and automatic transmission is
compared<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.840> just<00:03:53.770> raw<00:03:53.980> power<00:03:54.370> this

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
compared to the just raw power this

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.600 
compared to the just raw power this
thing<00:03:54.820> can<00:03:54.970> lay<00:03:55.090> down

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.700 

and<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.450> will<00:04:00.630> lay<00:04:00.810> down<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.110> power<00:04:01.320> it's

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
and it will lay down the power it's

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:19.500 
and it will lay down the power it's
pretty<00:04:02.010> outrageous

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.860 

and<00:04:19.780> there<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.140> is<00:04:20.290> I<00:04:20.560> love<00:04:20.980> Monticello<00:04:21.870> its
