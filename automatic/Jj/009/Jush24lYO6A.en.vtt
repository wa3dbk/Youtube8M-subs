00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
now got a gigabyte of ram instead of the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.819 
now got a gigabyte of ram instead of the
previous<00:01:53.899> 512<00:01:54.899> megabytes<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.649> had

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
previous 512 megabytes that we had

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.319 
previous 512 megabytes that we had
before<00:01:55.979> obviously<00:01:56.909> that's<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.240> to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
before obviously that's going to

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.120 
before obviously that's going to
contribute<00:01:57.630> towards<00:01:58.290> giving<00:01:58.409> us<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.710> faster

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
contribute towards giving us a faster

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.700 
contribute towards giving us a faster
device<00:01:59.460> we've<00:02:00.119> also<00:02:00.299> got<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.719> new<00:02:00.869> au<00:02:01.110> 5x

graphics processing that's going on in
the<00:02:09.209> background<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.899> that's<00:02:10.289> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> give

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the background and that's going to give

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.100 
the background and that's going to give
us<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.890> much<00:02:11.250> better<00:02:11.640> level<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.660> detailing

the new graphics processing power that
we've<00:02:21.569> got<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.049> think<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.310> way<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.819> you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
we've got I think the way that you

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.089 
we've got I think the way that you
notice<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.200> all<00:02:25.409> of<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.709> games<00:02:25.920> that

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
notice it is that all of the games that

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.820 
notice it is that all of the games that
went<00:02:26.370> before<00:02:26.489> don't<00:02:27.480> run<00:02:27.810> any<00:02:28.080> slower<00:02:28.440> with

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
went before don't run any slower with

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.410 
went before don't run any slower with
the<00:02:28.860> new<00:02:29.099> Retina<00:02:29.519> display<00:02:29.879> which<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.209> might

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
the new Retina display which you might

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.569 
the new Retina display which you might
expect<00:02:30.870> obviously<00:02:31.290> because<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.890> kind<00:02:32.489> of

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
expect obviously because of the kind of

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.130 
expect obviously because of the kind of
extra<00:02:32.970> power<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.599> would<00:02:33.750> need<00:02:33.900> to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
extra power that you would need to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.780 
extra power that you would need to
actually<00:02:34.260> run<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.980> high-definition

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
actually run that high-definition

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.080 
actually run that high-definition
display<00:02:36.599> on<00:02:36.959> top<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.069> when<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:38.640> do<00:02:38.879> get

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
display on top of that when you do get

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.240 
display on top of that when you do get
games<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.810> actually<00:02:39.840> utilize<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.920> retina

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
games that actually utilize the retina

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.819 
games that actually utilize the retina
display<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:41.970> new<00:02:42.209> a5x<00:02:42.810> processor<00:02:42.930> they

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
display and the new a5x processor they

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.470 
display and the new a5x processor they
definitely<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.489> lot<00:02:44.700> more<00:02:44.849> detail<00:02:45.299> in

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
definitely have a lot more detail in

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.180 
definitely have a lot more detail in
them<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.840> they<00:02:46.140> really<00:02:46.500> do<00:02:46.620> look<00:02:46.799> absolutely

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
them and they really do look absolutely

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.130 
them and they really do look absolutely
fantastic<00:02:47.609> and<00:02:48.299> that's<00:02:48.660> definitely<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.079> good

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
fantastic and that's definitely a good

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.920 
fantastic and that's definitely a good
way<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> kind<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.609> bump<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.180> performance<00:02:51.750> from

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
way to kind of bump the performance from

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.619 
way to kind of bump the performance from
Apple<00:02:52.379> when<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.310> processors<00:02:54.060> didn't<00:02:54.329> really

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
Apple when the processors didn't really

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.410 
Apple when the processors didn't really
need<00:02:54.810> improving<00:02:55.670> we've<00:02:56.670> also<00:02:56.819> got<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.239> new

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
need improving we've also got that new

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.869 
need improving we've also got that new
camera<00:02:57.870> as<00:02:57.989> well<00:02:58.019> on<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.739> back<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.129> ipad<00:02:59.489> 3

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
camera as well on the back of the ipad 3

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.750 
camera as well on the back of the ipad 3
it's<00:03:00.299> now<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> 5<00:03:00.810> megapixel<00:03:01.079> camera<00:03:01.890> capable<00:03:02.069> of

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
it's now a 5 megapixel camera capable of

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.050 
it's now a 5 megapixel camera capable of
recording<00:03:03.109> Full<00:03:04.109> 1080p<00:03:04.470> up<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.400> 30<00:03:05.609> frames<00:03:05.909> per

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
recording Full 1080p up to 30 frames per

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.030 
recording Full 1080p up to 30 frames per
second<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.079> huge<00:03:07.379> improvement<00:03:07.530> over

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
second and it's a huge improvement over

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.190 
second and it's a huge improvement over
what<00:03:08.220> went<00:03:08.579> before<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:09.299> then<00:03:09.450> again<00:03:09.569> you<00:03:09.900> know

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
what went before but then again you know

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.979 
what went before but then again you know
even<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.709> ten-pound<00:03:11.280> phone<00:03:11.579> from<00:03:11.790> Tesco's<00:03:12.299> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
even a ten-pound phone from Tesco's the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.030 
even a ten-pound phone from Tesco's the
camera<00:03:13.319> on<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.500> would<00:03:13.739> have<00:03:13.829> been<00:03:13.920> an

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
camera on that would have been an

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.130 
camera on that would have been an
improvement<00:03:14.310> over<00:03:14.700> what<00:03:14.879> went<00:03:15.269> before<00:03:15.420> so

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
improvement over what went before so

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.809 
improvement over what went before so
they've<00:03:16.470> definitely<00:03:16.680> bummed<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.159> up<00:03:17.370> it's

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
they've definitely bummed that up it's

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.190 
they've definitely bummed that up it's
pretty<00:03:18.060> much<00:03:18.239> equal<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.840> terms<00:03:18.870> of

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
pretty much equal in terms of

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.490 
pretty much equal in terms of
performance<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.700> iphone<00:03:21.180> 4s<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:22.319> only

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
performance to the iphone 4s the only

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.589 
performance to the iphone 4s the only
problem<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:22.919> the<00:03:23.190> front-facing<00:03:23.669> camera<00:03:24.239> they

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
problem is the front-facing camera they

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.089 
problem is the front-facing camera they
haven't<00:03:24.810> changed<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.380> whatsoever<00:03:25.739> it's

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
haven't changed that whatsoever it's

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.250 
haven't changed that whatsoever it's
still<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.340> VGA<00:03:26.819> camera<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.810> quality<00:03:28.049> is

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
still a VGA camera and the quality is

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.319 
still a VGA camera and the quality is
absolutely<00:03:28.500> abysmal<00:03:29.099> I<00:03:29.459> really<00:03:30.060> wish<00:03:30.180> they

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
absolutely abysmal I really wish they

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.190 
absolutely abysmal I really wish they
would<00:03:30.510> have<00:03:30.599> done<00:03:30.750> sent<00:03:30.989> with<00:03:31.169> the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
would have done sent with the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.069 
would have done sent with the
front-facing<00:03:32.010> camera<00:03:32.690> now<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:33.810> terms<00:03:33.959> of

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
front-facing camera now in terms of

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.809

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
of the iPad and I find that that's made

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.680 
of the iPad and I find that that's made
their<00:05:10.860> slightly<00:05:11.550> less<00:05:11.910> comfortable<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.540> hold

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
their slightly less comfortable to hold

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.540 
their slightly less comfortable to hold
than<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.110> was<00:05:13.260> before<00:05:13.440> when<00:05:14.070> we<00:05:14.100> had<00:05:14.190> much<00:05:14.520> more

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
than it was before when we had much more

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.570 
than it was before when we had much more
rounded<00:05:15.270> corners<00:05:15.690> on<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.470> previous<00:05:16.860> ipad<00:05:17.280> 2

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
rounded corners on the previous ipad 2

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.180 
rounded corners on the previous ipad 2
but<00:05:18.180> that's<00:05:18.539> a<00:05:18.690> minor<00:05:18.900> detail<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.710> pretty

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
but that's a minor detail and pretty

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.040 
but that's a minor detail and pretty
much<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.580> styling<00:05:20.970> and<00:05:21.120> stayed<00:05:21.389> exactly<00:05:21.660> the

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
much the styling and stayed exactly the

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.830 
much the styling and stayed exactly the
same<00:05:22.700> you<00:05:23.700> can<00:05:23.850> still<00:05:24.060> get<00:05:24.210> it<00:05:24.330> in<00:05:24.479> the<00:05:24.600> white

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
same you can still get it in the white

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.900 
same you can still get it in the white
and<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.289> black<00:05:25.470> version<00:05:25.740> I<00:05:26.130> actually<00:05:26.490> opted

and the black version I actually opted

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.600 
and the black version I actually opted
for<00:05:27.090> the<00:05:27.120> white<00:05:27.360> version<00:05:27.630> this<00:05:27.960> time<00:05:28.020> and

for the white version this time and

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.560 
for the white version this time and
normally<00:05:29.610> I<00:05:29.699> would<00:05:29.910> go<00:05:30.060> for<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.360> black

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570

black one when you're looking at movies

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.670 
black one when you're looking at movies
or<00:05:41.370> watching<00:05:41.729> TV<00:05:41.940> it<00:05:42.630> really<00:05:42.930> kind<00:05:43.289> of<00:05:43.440> puts

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
or watching TV it really kind of puts

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.170 
or watching TV it really kind of puts
you<00:05:43.800> off<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.099> viewing<00:05:44.460> and<00:05:44.610> I<00:05:44.669> just<00:05:44.849> feel<00:05:45.030> it

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
you off the viewing and I just feel it

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.120 
you off the viewing and I just feel it
looks<00:05:45.270> a<00:05:45.419> bit<00:05:45.539> plasticky<00:05:45.780> as<00:05:46.260> well<00:05:46.470> I<00:05:46.650> much

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
looks a bit plasticky as well I much

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.890 
looks a bit plasticky as well I much
prefer<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.520> black<00:05:47.820> one<00:05:48.060> and<00:05:48.300> next<00:05:48.539> time<00:05:48.630> I'll

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
your iPad 2 I think the retina display

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.339 
your iPad 2 I think the retina display
is<00:06:35.219> a<00:06:35.280> huge<00:06:35.640> improvement<00:06:36.060> over<00:06:36.479> what's<00:06:37.110> gone

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
is a huge improvement over what's gone
