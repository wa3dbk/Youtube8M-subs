00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.869
 it all started calling for help with the letter 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.779
 from carrots and addressed van Helsing 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.020
 the great monster fighter my father 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.990
 it is no longer taken for the work but then 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.359
 I am a hunter so I went to 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.089
 travel with my lady katharina 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.400
 amazing companion 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:39.309
 I am an expert on the supernatural me 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.829
 like a situation sometimes 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.979
 gets out of control and then us 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.710
 you have to hurry to blow your legs sometimes 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.600
 blame katharina 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.510
 at times she is extremely careless and 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.140
 yet she always helps me get out 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.769
 provisions and it just so happened that 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.080
 ghost my father save from borgore and 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.890
 from then on she is forced to serve our 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.380
 the katharina family often complain about it but 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.159
 I think she likes dangerous 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.670
 Adventure 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:16.150
 her beautiful soul but there are 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.180
 the dark side is good because it is very 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.400
 by the way when i'm in danger on the road we 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.460
 gradually learn to work together 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.760
 until finally in the cold rain of venice 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.400
 do not become a team last part 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.980
 travel runs by sea â€‹â€‹except 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.280
 kraken pirates and storm there is nothing 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.530
 remarkable but i have time 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.909
 think about the mission 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.790
 never borgore and was a dark place 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.470
 where are the monsters 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.080
 long ago my father defeated the immortals 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.270
 kings made a truce and handed the land 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.690
 under the management of some enlightened persons 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.700
 that there already could happen that could 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.430
 to be even worse than the power of monsters 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.720
 the closer we got to borgore and the 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.940
 country and became rumors 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.850
 the land on the other side of the mountains was shrouded 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.130
 mystery cost the crew to get close 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.390
 mountain pass as I arose 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.550
 foreboding 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.800
 I was not even particularly surprised when 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.790
 I heard an explosion 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.790
 the adventure has just begun
