00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.530 

so<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> little<00:00:12.599> commentary<00:00:13.370> you<00:00:14.370> will<00:00:14.670> do<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
so a little commentary you will do the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.040 
so a little commentary you will do the
best<00:00:15.719> probably<00:00:16.289> if<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.100> take<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> time<00:00:18.050> to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
best probably if you take the time to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.540 
best probably if you take the time to
play<00:00:19.320> with<00:00:19.470> each<00:00:19.650> step<00:00:19.890> until<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.279> becomes

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
play with each step until it becomes

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.300 
play with each step until it becomes
muscle<00:00:21.119> memory<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.890> crossing<00:00:22.890> them<00:00:22.980> turning

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
muscle memory and crossing them turning

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.179 
muscle memory and crossing them turning
with<00:00:23.430> one<00:00:23.730> poi<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:25.109> great<00:00:25.500> example<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:26.010> that

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
with one poi is a great example of that

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.250 
with one poi is a great example of that
and<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:27.119> actually<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> pretty<00:00:27.660> defining

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
and it's actually a pretty defining

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.790 
and it's actually a pretty defining
moment<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.800> learning<00:00:29.640> poi<00:00:30.439> so<00:00:31.439> we've<00:00:31.560> talked

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
moment in learning poi so we've talked

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.860 
moment in learning poi so we've talked
to<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.040> how<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.489> mean<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.300> also<00:00:33.450> by<00:00:33.690> just

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to it how I mean it's also by just

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.870 
to it how I mean it's also by just
making<00:00:33.989> being<00:00:34.410> consistent<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.579> we've<00:00:35.670> talked

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
making being consistent so we've talked

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.760 
making being consistent so we've talked
about<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.390> mean<00:00:37.050> Here<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.200> am<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.410> tracks

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
about I mean Here I am with my tracks

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.430 
about I mean Here I am with my tracks
right<00:00:38.670> I've<00:00:38.910> got<00:00:39.059> my<00:00:39.090> tracks<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.290> gonna

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
right I've got my tracks and I'm gonna

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.709 
right I've got my tracks and I'm gonna
decide<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.430> my<00:00:41.820> play<00:00:42.090> are<00:00:42.239> always<00:00:42.480> rolling

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
decide that my play are always rolling

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.350 
decide that my play are always rolling
towards<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.649> land<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.879> when<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.030> look<00:00:45.210> at<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
towards the land so when I look at the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.260 
towards the land so when I look at the
land<00:00:45.600> I'm<00:00:46.550> crossing<00:00:47.550> foots<00:00:47.820> forwards

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
land I'm crossing foots forwards

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.119 
land I'm crossing foots forwards
crossing<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.200> they're<00:00:49.320> coming<00:00:49.590> down<00:00:49.800> through

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
crossing so they're coming down through

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
crossing so they're coming down through
that<00:00:50.280> cross<00:00:50.520> point<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> middle<00:00:51.180> now<00:00:52.020> this

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
that cross point in the middle now this

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.840 
that cross point in the middle now this
is<00:00:52.410> counterclockwise<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.610> clockwise

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
is counterclockwise this is clockwise

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.650 
is counterclockwise this is clockwise
this<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.960> crossing<00:00:55.230> forwards<00:00:56.059> if<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.149> turn<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this is crossing forwards if I turn it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.830 
this is crossing forwards if I turn it
and<00:00:57.809> look<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> other<00:00:58.289> way<00:00:59.359> from<00:01:00.359> my<00:01:00.510> point<00:01:00.780> of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and look the other way from my point of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.720 
and look the other way from my point of
view<00:01:00.899> that's<00:01:01.140> crossing<00:01:01.530> backwards<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.670> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
view that's crossing backwards so you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
view that's crossing backwards so you
see<00:01:02.879> how<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.090> poi<00:01:03.390> you're<00:01:03.600> rolling<00:01:03.989> away<00:01:04.290> from

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
see how the poi you're rolling away from

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.310 
see how the poi you're rolling away from
the<00:01:04.650> water<00:01:04.860> still<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.630> face<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.110> way

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the water still so if I face this way

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.770 
the water still so if I face this way
it's<00:01:07.470> forwards<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.700> face<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:08.970> way<00:01:09.630> it's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
it's forwards if I face that way it's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.260 
it's forwards if I face that way it's
it's<00:01:10.110> backwards<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.790> learn<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> cross

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it's backwards I can learn the cross

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.719 
it's backwards I can learn the cross
forwards<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.080> direction<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.580> can

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
forwards in this direction and I can

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
forwards in this direction and I can
learn<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.180> cross<00:01:15.360> backwards<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
learn to cross backwards in that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.980 
learn to cross backwards in that
direction<00:01:17.090> but<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.360> learning<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
direction but if I'm just learning that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.600 
direction but if I'm just learning that
doesn't<00:01:19.350> mean<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.740> time<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.100> move<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
doesn't mean it's time to move on to the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.370 
doesn't mean it's time to move on to the
next<00:01:20.700> step<00:01:21.119> because<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.049> has<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.259> become

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
next step because it has to become

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.830 
next step because it has to become
muscle<00:01:22.740> memory<00:01:23.390> otherwise<00:01:24.390> what'll<00:01:24.659> happen

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
muscle memory otherwise what'll happen

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.170 
muscle memory otherwise what'll happen
is<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.409> soon<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.920> start<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.610> play<00:01:26.729> you'll

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
is as soon as you start to play you'll

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.840 
is as soon as you start to play you'll
go<00:01:27.299> forwards<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.140> lot<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.380> people<00:01:28.619> will<00:01:28.850> you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
go forwards and a lot of people will you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.370 
go forwards and a lot of people will you
can<00:01:30.000> see<00:01:30.210> how<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.360> changed<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:31.110> I'm<00:01:31.229> doing

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
can see how I changed now I'm doing

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.719 
can see how I changed now I'm doing
forwards<00:01:31.890> towards<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> water

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
forwards towards the water

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.130 
forwards towards the water
most<00:01:33.329> people<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.869> when<00:01:34.049> they're

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
most people do this when they're

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.560 
most people do this when they're
starting<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.710> they'll<00:01:35.400> keep<00:01:35.579> they'll<00:01:36.390> keep

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
starting and they'll keep they'll keep

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.060 
starting and they'll keep they'll keep
doing<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:38.420> unless<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:40.229> let<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.650> become<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
doing that unless they let it become I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.410 
doing that unless they let it become I
must<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:41.850> they<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.270> think

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
must have to really if they really think

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.330 
must have to really if they really think
about<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.840> then<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.229> forwards<00:01:43.740> okay

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
about it then it's forwards okay

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
about it then it's forwards okay
thinking<00:01:44.700> thinking<00:01:45.090> thinking<00:01:45.149> thinking<00:01:45.540> what

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
thinking thinking thinking thinking what

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.130 
thinking thinking thinking thinking what
I<00:01:46.560> needed<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:46.950> okay<00:01:47.369> thinking<00:01:47.759> backwards

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
I needed to do okay thinking backwards

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.969 
I needed to do okay thinking backwards
right<00:01:49.140> thinking<00:01:49.530> thinking<00:01:49.920> thinking

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
right thinking thinking thinking

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.539 
right thinking thinking thinking
thinking<00:01:50.340> forwards<00:01:51.090> well<00:01:51.509> that's<00:01:51.659> no<00:01:51.780> fun<00:01:52.549> so

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
thinking forwards well that's no fun so

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.910 
thinking forwards well that's no fun so
what<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.090> play<00:01:54.390> until<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.530> find

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
what you do is you play until you find

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.050 
what you do is you play until you find
you<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.070> I'm<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.460> backwards<00:01:56.909> this

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
you know I'm going to go backwards this

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.730 
you know I'm going to go backwards this
way<00:01:58.159> forwards<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.340> way<00:02:01.100> backwards<00:02:02.719> forwards

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
way forwards this way backwards forwards

anymore that's the moment when you're

anymore that's the moment when you're
really<00:02:19.760> ready<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.060> move<00:02:20.210> on<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.140> can

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
really ready to move on and that can

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.480 
really ready to move on and that can
actually<00:02:21.290> be<00:02:21.470> really<00:02:21.620> fun<00:02:21.890> getting<00:02:22.070> there<00:02:22.370> you

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
actually be really fun getting there you

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.130 
actually be really fun getting there you
put<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.730> music<00:02:22.880> on<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.510> start<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.990> you

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
put the music on and you start that you

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
put the music on and you start that you
have<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.320> feeling<00:02:24.650> at<00:02:24.770> first<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.040> have<00:02:25.130> to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
have that feeling at first you have to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.460 
have that feeling at first you have to
think<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.670> slowly<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.870> becomes<00:02:27.110> muscle

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
think and slowly it becomes muscle

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.160 
think and slowly it becomes muscle
memory<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:29.450> then<00:02:29.600> after<00:02:29.840> then<00:02:29.960> all<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.080> a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
memory so then after then all of a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
memory so then after then all of a
sudden<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.560> know<00:02:30.590> we're<00:02:30.830> not<00:02:30.920> all<00:02:31.070> of<00:02:31.160> a

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
sudden you know we're not all of a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.940 
sudden you know we're not all of a
sudden<00:02:31.400> but<00:02:31.490> with<00:02:31.700> practice<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:33.650> begin<00:02:33.860> to

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
sudden but with practice you begin to

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.890 
sudden but with practice you begin to
really<00:02:34.070> flow<00:02:34.430> with<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.060> then<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.780> don't

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
really flow with it and then you don't

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.199 
really flow with it and then you don't
have<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.080> think<00:02:36.380> anymore<00:02:36.590> it's<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.820> you

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
have to think anymore it's you you

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.490 
have to think anymore it's you you
naturally<00:02:38.720> know<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:39.020> this<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.260> gonna<00:02:39.320> be

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
naturally know that this is gonna be

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.140 
naturally know that this is gonna be
backwards<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.550> know<00:02:40.580> you're<00:02:40.760> thinking<00:02:41.060> about

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
backwards you know you're thinking about

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.449 
backwards you know you're thinking about
it<00:02:41.360> it's<00:02:41.570> just<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.230> backwards<00:02:42.740> this<00:02:43.310> is

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
it it's just this is backwards this is

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.510 
it it's just this is backwards this is
forwards<00:02:43.850> it<00:02:43.940> happens<00:02:44.240> all<00:02:44.480> on<00:02:44.630> its<00:02:44.780> own<00:02:45.020> and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
forwards it happens all on its own and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.300 
forwards it happens all on its own and
that's<00:02:46.520> when<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:48.170> pick<00:02:48.380> up<00:02:48.470> another<00:02:48.590> ploy<00:02:48.980> and

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
that's when you pick up another ploy and

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.100 
that's when you pick up another ploy and
you<00:02:49.400> start<00:02:49.670> being<00:02:49.910> very<00:02:50.270> easily<00:02:50.540> able<00:02:50.930> to

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
you start being very easily able to

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.260 
you start being very easily able to
learn<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.500> next<00:02:51.650> moves<00:02:52.060> because<00:02:53.060> if<00:02:53.180> you

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
learn the next moves because if you

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.470 
learn the next moves because if you
haven't<00:02:53.630> learned<00:02:53.810> this<00:02:54.080> right<00:02:54.440> with<00:02:54.950> one<00:02:55.160> poi

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
haven't learned this right with one poi

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.310 
haven't learned this right with one poi
trust<00:02:56.480> me<00:02:56.600> you're<00:02:56.690> going<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.870> spend<00:02:57.080> forever

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
trust me you're going to spend forever

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.430 
trust me you're going to spend forever
learning<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.340> other<00:02:58.459> stuff<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:59.780> take<00:03:00.080> enough

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
learning the other stuff you take enough

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.360 
learning the other stuff you take enough
time<00:03:00.709> with<00:03:01.610> one<00:03:01.850> point<00:03:02.450> it's<00:03:02.930> easy<00:03:03.140> then<00:03:04.040> these

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
time with one point it's easy then these

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.330 
time with one point it's easy then these
moves<00:03:04.700> your<00:03:05.120> hip<00:03:05.600> reels<00:03:05.959> your<00:03:06.350> turning<00:03:07.250> with

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
moves your hip reels your turning with

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.410 
moves your hip reels your turning with
the<00:03:07.430> weaves<00:03:07.610> it's<00:03:07.910> all<00:03:08.030> going<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.300> come

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
the weaves it's all going to come

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.740 
the weaves it's all going to come
intuitively<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:11.000> that's<00:03:11.209> what<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.720> I

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
intuitively so that's what I and I

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.360 
intuitively so that's what I and I
recommend<00:03:12.050> that<00:03:12.290> as<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.680> learn<00:03:12.860> play<00:03:13.160> out

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
recommend that as you learn play out

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.640 
recommend that as you learn play out
enjoy<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.330> basics<00:03:14.780> like<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.260> people<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.590> know

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
enjoy the basics like the people I know

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.830 
enjoy the basics like the people I know
who<00:03:15.860> got<00:03:16.010> really<00:03:16.220> good<00:03:16.600> they're<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.720> people

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
who got really good they're the people

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.350 
who got really good they're the people
who<00:03:18.019> just<00:03:18.200> who<00:03:18.500> really<00:03:18.799> enjoy<00:03:19.160> playing<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.209> so

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
who just who really enjoy playing and so

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.850 
who just who really enjoy playing and so
they<00:03:20.480> just<00:03:20.510> really<00:03:20.989> spend<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.290> time<00:03:21.350> with

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
they just really spend the time with

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.810 
they just really spend the time with
each<00:03:22.519> step<00:03:22.880> until<00:03:23.209> become<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:23.750> natural<00:03:23.959> and

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
each step until become so natural and

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.400 
each step until become so natural and
then<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.940> step<00:03:26.330> after<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.630> also<00:03:26.989> comes

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
then the step after that also comes

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.310 
then the step after that also comes
quickly<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:29.330> this<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:29.810> your<00:03:29.959> moment<00:03:30.080> if

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
quickly so that this is your moment if

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.479 
quickly so that this is your moment if
you're<00:03:30.410> learning<00:03:30.560> for<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:30.950> first<00:03:30.980> time<00:03:31.340> you

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
you're learning for the first time you

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.930 
you're learning for the first time you
got<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.790> one<00:03:31.970> poor<00:03:32.239> crossing<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.019> turning

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
got the one poor crossing and turning

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.460 
got the one poor crossing and turning
give<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.090> give<00:03:35.480> an<00:03:35.570> extra<00:03:35.930> day<00:03:36.170> than<00:03:36.350> you'd

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
give it give an extra day than you'd

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.960 
give it give an extra day than you'd
expect<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:37.190> then<00:03:37.370> you'll<00:03:37.519> just<00:03:37.580> steal<00:03:37.940> from

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
expect and then you'll just steal from

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.690 
expect and then you'll just steal from
there<00:03:38.480> on<00:03:38.600> in<00:03:38.750> everything<00:03:39.260> will<00:03:39.380> come<00:03:39.700> readily

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
there on in everything will come readily

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.920 
there on in everything will come readily
to<00:03:40.880> you<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:43.269> that's<00:03:44.269> what<00:03:44.450> you<00:03:44.570> need<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.810> know

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
to you so that's what you need to know

00:03:44.930 --> 00:04:01.400 
to you so that's what you need to know
and<00:03:45.850> enjoy<00:03:46.850> it

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410
