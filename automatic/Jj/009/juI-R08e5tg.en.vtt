00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
series in this episode we're gonna take

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.089 
series in this episode we're gonna take
a<00:00:23.279> look<00:00:23.550> at<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.810> blocks<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.470> we're

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
a look at the the blocks that we're

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.950 
a look at the the blocks that we're
going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.460> need<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:27.240> order<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.570> build

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
going to need in order to build

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.080 
going to need in order to build
ourselves<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.949> breeder<00:00:29.369> reactor<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:30.000> you

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
ourselves a breeder reactor if you

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.990 
ourselves a breeder reactor if you
remember<00:00:30.390> last<00:00:31.099> episode<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> series<00:00:32.309> we

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
remember last episode in the series we

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.780 
remember last episode in the series we
use<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.230> electrolyzer<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.219> produce<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
use the electrolyzer to produce the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.819 
use the electrolyzer to produce the
molten<00:00:36.420> sodium<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.290> we're<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.739> need

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
molten sodium that we're going to need

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.680 
molten sodium that we're going to need
for<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> breeder<00:00:38.460> reactor<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.360> now<00:00:39.510> we're

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
for the breeder reactor but now we're

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.270 
for the breeder reactor but now we're
going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> look<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.590> three<00:00:40.800> blocks<00:00:41.070> that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
going to look at the three blocks that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.889 
going to look at the three blocks that
we<00:00:41.489> haven't<00:00:41.820> looked<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.390> you're<00:00:42.750> going

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
we haven't looked at that you're going

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.660 
we haven't looked at that you're going
to<00:00:42.930> need<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.230> able<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.469> craft<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:44.610> well

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to need to be able to craft as well

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.740 
to need to be able to craft as well
let's<00:00:44.940> take<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> look<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
let's take a look at all of the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
let's take a look at all of the
components<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.590> need<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.250> setup

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
components are going to need to setup

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.729 
components are going to need to setup
the<00:00:47.879> breeder<00:00:48.090> reactor<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.590> most

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the breeder reactor so the most

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.619 
the breeder reactor so the most
important<00:00:50.219> thing<00:00:50.399> obviously<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.390> breeder

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
important thing obviously the breeder

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.799 
important thing obviously the breeder
reactor<00:00:52.140> core<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:54.059> that's<00:00:54.180> crafted<00:00:54.629> very

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
reactor core and that's crafted very

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.410 
reactor core and that's crafted very
simply<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.530> fuel<00:00:55.860> core<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.760> base<00:00:57.000> panels

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
simply with a fuel core for base panels

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.990 
simply with a fuel core for base panels
and<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:58.140> steel<00:00:58.500> ingots<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.399> gives<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and for steel ingots that gives you the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.810 
and for steel ingots that gives you the
breeder<00:01:00.270> reactor<00:01:00.809> core<00:01:01.430> okay<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.609> you're

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
breeder reactor core okay so you're

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.160 
breeder reactor core okay so you're
gonna<00:01:02.879> need<00:01:03.120> these<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:05.630> they<00:01:06.630> work<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
gonna need these and they work in the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.399 
gonna need these and they work in the
same<00:01:07.380> way<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.340> fission<00:01:09.170> reactor<00:01:10.170> cores

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
same way as the fission reactor cores

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.350 
same way as the fission reactor cores
the<00:01:10.680> regular<00:01:10.979> fuel<00:01:11.369> core<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.119> we'll<00:01:12.210> take<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the regular fuel core and we'll take a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.190 
the regular fuel core and we'll take a
look<00:01:12.510> at<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.840> moment

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
look at that in a moment

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320 
look at that in a moment
have<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> GUI<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.920> whatnot<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:15.090> we're<00:01:15.240> gonna

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
have a GUI and whatnot then we're gonna

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.840 
have a GUI and whatnot then we're gonna
need<00:01:15.600> breeder<00:01:16.110> reactor<00:01:16.590> fuel<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.130> breeder

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
need breeder reactor fuel and breeder

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.690 
need breeder reactor fuel and breeder
reactor<00:01:18.210> fuel<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.840> simply<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.470> fresh<00:01:20.070> uranium

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
reactor fuel is simply a fresh uranium

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.820 
reactor fuel is simply a fresh uranium
fuel<00:01:20.880> pellet<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.570> four<00:01:21.960> depleted<00:01:22.710> uranium

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
fuel pellet with four depleted uranium

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.310 
fuel pellet with four depleted uranium
pellets<00:01:23.340> around<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.060> okay<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.290> gives

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
pellets around it okay and that gives

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.280 
pellets around it okay and that gives
you<00:01:25.560> four<00:01:25.979> breeder<00:01:26.880> reactor<00:01:27.360> fuel<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
you four breeder reactor fuel and it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.760 
you four breeder reactor fuel and it
says<00:01:28.470> 0%<00:01:29.220> converted<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.320> what<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> breeder

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
says 0% converted so what the breeder

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.950 
says 0% converted so what the breeder
reactor<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:33.060> way<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.600> take<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
reactor is is a way for you to take that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.740 
reactor is is a way for you to take that
depleted<00:01:34.770> uranium<00:01:34.890> which<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.939> output<00:01:36.090> one

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
depleted uranium which is the output one

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.330 
depleted uranium which is the output one
of<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> outputs<00:01:37.290> from<00:01:37.530> your<00:01:37.740> fission

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
of the outputs from your fission

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.210 
of the outputs from your fission
reactors<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.780> turn<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.470> into<00:01:40.890> something

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
reactors and to turn it into something

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.670 
reactors and to turn it into something
useful<00:01:41.520> again<00:01:42.000> okay<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.840> you're<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
useful again okay so you're not going to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.319 
useful again okay so you're not going to
need<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> breeder<00:01:44.100> reactor<00:01:44.549> until<00:01:44.880> after<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
need a breeder reactor until after you

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.560 
need a breeder reactor until after you
have<00:01:45.540> accumulated<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.009> some<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.729> certain

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
have accumulated you know some a certain

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.359 
have accumulated you know some a certain
amount<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.840> depleted<00:01:49.290> uranium<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.009> then

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
amount of depleted uranium and then

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.190 
amount of depleted uranium and then
you're<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.640> okay<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.180> want<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.720> use<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.049> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
you're like okay I want to use this to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.539 
you're like okay I want to use this to
please<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:52.560> rhenium<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.070> want<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.430> make

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
please your rhenium I want to make

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.399 
please your rhenium I want to make
myself<00:01:53.729> something<00:01:54.360> better<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.229> course

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
myself something better and of course

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.170 
myself something better and of course
and<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.979> eventually<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.759> produces

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and this eventually it produces

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.899 
and this eventually it produces
plutonium<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.020> what<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.790> and<00:01:59.790> you're

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
plutonium is what it's for and you're

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.139 
plutonium is what it's for and you're
going<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.090> need<00:02:00.210> sodium<00:02:00.540> heaters<00:02:02.000> which<00:02:03.000> is

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
going to need sodium heaters which is

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.850 
going to need sodium heaters which is
simply<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> steam<00:02:03.869> boiler<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.439> four<00:02:04.649> iron

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860

that<00:02:09.610> gives<00:02:09.790> you<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.000> sodium<00:02:10.420> heater<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:11.530> in

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
that gives you the sodium heater so in

reactor 1800 C it emits neutrons just

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.980 
reactor 1800 C it emits neutrons just

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
like the regular fission reactor and it

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.310 
like the regular fission reactor and it
does<00:03:02.170> heat<00:03:02.590> up<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.980> faster<00:03:03.840> okay<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.990> heats<00:03:05.170> up

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
does heat up the faster okay it heats up

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.650 
does heat up the faster okay it heats up
somewhat<00:03:05.680> faster<00:03:06.070> than<00:03:06.220> normal

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
somewhat faster than normal

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.540 
somewhat faster than normal
okay<00:03:07.660> there's<00:03:08.290> also<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.709> sodium<00:03:09.310> heater

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
okay there's also the sodium heater

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.270 
okay there's also the sodium heater
which<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.660> like<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.440> steam<00:03:11.709> boiler<00:03:11.890> but<00:03:12.160> it's

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
which is like a steam boiler but it's

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.940 
which is like a steam boiler but it's
actually<00:03:12.670> more<00:03:12.940> like<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:16.030> co2<00:03:16.950> boilers

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
actually more like the the co2 boilers

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.550 
actually more like the the co2 boilers
the<00:03:17.980> co2<00:03:18.670> carbon<00:03:19.480> dioxide<00:03:19.600> heat<00:03:20.080> exchangers

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
the co2 carbon dioxide heat exchangers

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.560 
the co2 carbon dioxide heat exchangers
that<00:03:20.709> we<00:03:21.160> use<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.790> high-temperature<00:03:22.300> gas

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
that we use in the high-temperature gas

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.990 
that we use in the high-temperature gas
reactor<00:03:23.019> because<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.680> accepts<00:03:24.070> molten<00:03:24.700> sodium

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000

I<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.350> bottom<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.820> outputs<00:03:31.030> hot

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630

molten sodium out the top once the

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.870 
molten sodium out the top once the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
temperature it's 300 degrees so if we go

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.570 
temperature it's 300 degrees so if we go
back<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.209> we<00:03:37.300> look<00:03:37.330> at<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.630> HG<00:03:38.050> gr<00:03:38.380> we<00:03:39.250> can<00:03:39.400> see

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
back and we look at the HG gr we can see

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.520 
back and we look at the HG gr we can see

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
that compared to the carbon dioxide heat

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.320 
that compared to the carbon dioxide heat
exchanger<00:03:42.070> it<00:03:42.519> doesn't<00:03:42.880> need<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.180> reach

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
exchanger it doesn't need to reach

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.110 
exchanger it doesn't need to reach
nearly<00:03:43.690> as<00:03:43.930> high<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.290> temperature<00:03:44.340> only<00:03:45.340> 300

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
nearly as high of a temperature only 300

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.540 
nearly as high of a temperature only 300
but<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.360> still<00:03:46.600> needs<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.870> heat<00:03:47.050> up<00:03:47.080> higher

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
but it still needs to heat up higher

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.009 
but it still needs to heat up higher
than<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.850> regular<00:03:49.120> steam<00:03:49.360> boilers<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.810> only

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
than the regular steam boilers you only

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.930 
than the regular steam boilers you only
have<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.260> hit<00:03:50.350> 100<00:03:50.980> okay<00:03:51.430> so<00:03:51.519> keep<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:51.880> in

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
have to hit 100 okay so keep that in

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.160 
have to hit 100 okay so keep that in
mind<00:03:52.060> if<00:03:52.360> you<00:03:52.450> wondering<00:03:52.810> why<00:03:52.959> it's<00:03:53.110> not

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
mind if you wondering why it's not

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.050 
mind if you wondering why it's not
working<00:03:53.590> after<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.860> hits<00:03:54.010> 100<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.790> needs<00:03:54.940> to

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
working after it hits 100 it needs to

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.110 
working after it hits 100 it needs to
hit<00:03:55.180> 300<00:03:55.900> okay<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:56.590> then<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:57.640> can<00:03:57.820> put<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
hit 300 okay and then you can put the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.460 
hit 300 okay and then you can put the
hot<00:03:58.269> molten<00:03:58.450> sodium<00:03:58.780> through<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.200> heat

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
hot molten sodium through a heat

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.610 
hot molten sodium through a heat
exchanger<00:04:00.010> so<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:01.060> reactor<00:04:01.480> itself

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
exchanger so the reactor itself

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.830 
exchanger so the reactor itself
functions<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.370> same<00:04:03.610> way<00:04:03.850> as<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.450> fission

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
functions in the same way as a fission

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.380 
functions in the same way as a fission
reactor<00:04:05.260> but<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:05.769> cool<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.400> like<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.269> would

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
reactor but you cool it like you would

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.750 
reactor but you cool it like you would
cool<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.959> high<00:04:08.470> temperature<00:04:08.799> gas<00:04:09.100> reactor<00:04:09.549> all

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
cool a high temperature gas reactor all

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.250 
cool a high temperature gas reactor all
right<00:04:09.910> so<00:04:10.120> let's<00:04:10.269> cut<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.750> little<00:04:10.900> bit<00:04:10.989> of<00:04:11.140> both

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
right so let's cut a little bit of both

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.020 
right so let's cut a little bit of both
there<00:04:11.530> okay<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:12.310> that's<00:04:12.519> what<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.700> sodium

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
there okay so that's what the sodium

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.170 
there okay so that's what the sodium
heater<00:04:13.209> looks<00:04:13.480> like<00:04:13.600> of<00:04:13.720> course<00:04:13.900> no<00:04:14.110> gooey<00:04:14.350> and

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
heater looks like of course no gooey and

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.390 
heater looks like of course no gooey and
it<00:04:16.180> will<00:04:16.330> except<00:04:16.720> look<00:04:16.930> good<00:04:16.989> pipe

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
it will except look good pipe

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.860 
it will except look good pipe
connections<00:04:18.400> on<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.640> top<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.150> also<00:04:19.690> on<00:04:19.780> the

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
connections on the top and also on the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.420 
connections on the top and also on the
bottom<00:04:20.200> but<00:04:20.560> not<00:04:20.650> from<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.919> sides

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
bottom but not from the sides

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.950 
bottom but not from the sides
okay<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.030> you're<00:04:22.210> gonna<00:04:22.330> need<00:04:22.509> that<00:04:22.720> you're

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
okay so you're gonna need that you're

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.080 
okay so you're gonna need that you're
gonna<00:04:23.080> need<00:04:23.259> liquid<00:04:23.590> pipe<00:04:23.800> obviously<00:04:24.460> you're

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
gonna need liquid pipe obviously you're

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.390 
gonna need liquid pipe obviously you're
gonna<00:04:25.180> need<00:04:25.419> heat<00:04:25.630> exchangers<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:27.070> number<00:04:27.250> of

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
gonna need heat exchangers the number of

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.560 
gonna need heat exchangers the number of
these<00:04:27.460> you're<00:04:27.699> going<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:27.880> need<00:04:28.060> will<00:04:28.270> depend

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
these you're going to need will depend

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.540 
these you're going to need will depend
on<00:04:28.720> how<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.380> know<00:04:29.500> big<00:04:29.919> of<00:04:30.039> a<00:04:30.100> reactor<00:04:30.430> you've

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
on how you know big of a reactor you've

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.879 
on how you know big of a reactor you've
got<00:04:30.729> and<00:04:31.690> then<00:04:32.320> you're<00:04:32.410> gonna<00:04:32.500> need<00:04:32.650> steam

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
got and then you're gonna need steam

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:33.960 
got and then you're gonna need steam
boilers<00:04:33.190> because<00:04:33.340> remember<00:04:33.610> how<00:04:33.699> the<00:04:33.759> heat

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
boilers because remember how the heat

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.520 
boilers because remember how the heat
exchangers<00:04:34.389> work<00:04:34.539> you<00:04:34.690> put<00:04:34.900> steam<00:04:35.139> boilers

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
exchangers work you put steam boilers

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.990 
exchangers work you put steam boilers
around<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.520> heat<00:04:37.090> exchangers<00:04:38.820> or<00:04:39.820> in<00:04:39.910> the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
around the heat exchangers or in the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.730 
around the heat exchangers or in the
case<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.270> my<00:04:40.360> stew<00:04:40.630> jar<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:40.930> put<00:04:41.080> one<00:04:41.229> but<00:04:41.680> you

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
case of my stew jar you put one but you

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.320 
case of my stew jar you put one but you
put<00:04:41.889> steam<00:04:42.100> boilers<00:04:42.370> next<00:04:42.639> to<00:04:42.729> it<00:04:42.850> this<00:04:43.060> heats

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
put steam boilers next to it this heats

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.120 
put steam boilers next to it this heats
up<00:04:43.539> from<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.780> hot<00:04:43.930> molten<00:04:44.110> sodium<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.770> then

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
up from the hot molten sodium and then

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.830 
up from the hot molten sodium and then
it<00:04:45.250> will<00:04:45.370> heat<00:04:45.610> water<00:04:46.210> in<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.509> steam<00:04:46.720> boiler

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
it will heat water in the steam boiler

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.420 
it will heat water in the steam boiler
although<00:04:47.440> you<00:04:47.560> could<00:04:47.710> use<00:04:47.860> ammonia<00:04:48.160> if<00:04:48.340> you

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
although you could use ammonia if you

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.860 
although you could use ammonia if you
wanted<00:04:48.639> to<00:04:48.759> oh<00:04:48.789> I<00:04:49.030> don't<00:04:49.120> know<00:04:49.539> if<00:04:49.690> you<00:04:49.810> would

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
wanted to oh I don't know if you would

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.469 
wanted to oh I don't know if you would
end<00:04:50.050> up<00:04:50.199> with<00:04:50.259> a<00:04:50.440> massive<00:04:51.070> explosion<00:04:51.490> and

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
end up with a massive explosion and

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.790 
end up with a massive explosion and
you're<00:04:52.600> gonna<00:04:52.690> need<00:04:52.840> steam<00:04:53.080> lines<00:04:53.289> all<00:04:53.650> right

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
you're gonna need steam lines all right

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.260 
you're gonna need steam lines all right
so<00:04:54.340> these<00:04:54.430> are<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.639> components<00:04:54.940> that<00:04:55.150> you're

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
so these are the components that you're

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.270 
so these are the components that you're
gonna<00:04:55.389> need<00:04:55.600> to<00:04:55.810> build<00:04:55.930> your<00:04:56.169> breeder<00:04:56.800> reactor

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
gonna need to build your breeder reactor

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.840 
gonna need to build your breeder reactor
all<00:04:57.490> right<00:04:59.340> that's<00:05:00.340> pretty<00:05:00.430> much<00:05:00.610> what<00:05:00.760> we've

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
all right that's pretty much what we've

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.700 
all right that's pretty much what we've
got<00:05:00.970> for<00:05:01.449> today<00:05:01.510> Thursday<00:05:02.110> is<00:05:02.169> when<00:05:02.440> I'm<00:05:02.530> going

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
got for today Thursday is when I'm going

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.850 
got for today Thursday is when I'm going
to<00:05:02.800> actually<00:05:03.250> build<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:04.539> breeder<00:05:05.440> reactor

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
to actually build the breeder reactor

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.800 
to actually build the breeder reactor
get<00:05:06.010> when<00:05:06.100> working<00:05:06.490> and<00:05:06.699> show<00:05:07.360> you<00:05:07.419> how<00:05:07.660> it's

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
get when working and show you how it's

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.810 
get when working and show you how it's
working<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.530> breeder<00:05:08.770> reactor<00:05:09.190> does<00:05:09.400> output

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
working the breeder reactor does output

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.080 
working the breeder reactor does output
power<00:05:10.139> but<00:05:11.139> not<00:05:11.289> much<00:05:11.590> okay<00:05:12.340> not<00:05:12.699> a<00:05:12.729> lot<00:05:12.940> its

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
power but not much okay not a lot its

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.230 
power but not much okay not a lot its
primary<00:05:13.539> purpose<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.440> not<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:14.979> produce<00:05:15.789> power

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
primary purpose is not to produce power

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.550 
primary purpose is not to produce power
its<00:05:16.479> primary<00:05:16.870> purpose<00:05:17.530> is<00:05:17.789> to<00:05:18.870> cycle<00:05:19.870> your

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
its primary purpose is to cycle your

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.170 
its primary purpose is to cycle your
breeder<00:05:20.830> reactor<00:05:21.280> fuel<00:05:21.460> your<00:05:21.849> depleted

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
breeder reactor fuel your depleted

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.570 
breeder reactor fuel your depleted
uranium<00:05:22.240> into<00:05:22.990> plutonium<00:05:23.229> all<00:05:24.009> right<00:05:24.190> which

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
uranium into plutonium all right which

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.890 
uranium into plutonium all right which
you<00:05:24.610> can<00:05:24.849> throw<00:05:25.090> it<00:05:25.150> back<00:05:25.300> into<00:05:25.479> a<00:05:25.570> fission

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
you can throw it back into a fission

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.409 
you can throw it back into a fission
reactor<00:05:26.169> for<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:26.770> lot<00:05:27.160> more<00:05:27.310> power<00:05:27.610> but<00:05:28.120> also<00:05:28.240> a

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
reactor for a lot more power but also a

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.320 
reactor for a lot more power but also a
lot<00:05:28.570> more<00:05:28.599> huge<00:05:28.930> okay<00:05:29.860> so<00:05:30.669> yeah<00:05:30.820> that's<00:05:31.090> the

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
lot more huge okay so yeah that's the

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.969 
lot more huge okay so yeah that's the
purpose<00:05:31.660> of<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.810> breeder<00:05:32.050> reactor<00:05:32.440> so<00:05:32.620> you<00:05:32.680> at

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
purpose of the breeder reactor so you at

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.140 
purpose of the breeder reactor so you at
while<00:05:33.220> you<00:05:33.370> might<00:05:33.490> be<00:05:33.610> able<00:05:33.789> to<00:05:33.849> get<00:05:34.000> some

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
while you might be able to get some

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.409 
while you might be able to get some
