easier to set up you only need to make a

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.740 
easier to set up you only need to make a
server<00:00:58.770> setup<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> server<00:00:59.730> properties<00:01:00.210> port

will be teleported and so on then it

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.110 
will be teleported and so on then it

different squids so if in the end the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.920 
different squids so if in the end the
color<00:03:20.859> counter<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.370> 3<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:22.120> means<00:03:22.299> blue<00:03:22.660> won

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
color counter is 3 that means blue won

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.289 
color counter is 3 that means blue won
the<00:03:23.079> game<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.380> if<00:03:23.680> it's<00:03:23.859> minus<00:03:24.400> 3<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:25.090> means

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
the game and if it's minus 3 that means

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.690 
the game and if it's minus 3 that means
red<00:03:25.630> won<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.989> game<00:03:26.139> if<00:03:26.920> you<00:03:27.130> didn't<00:03:27.519> really

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
red won the game if you didn't really

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.699 
red won the game if you didn't really
understand<00:03:28.299> that<00:03:28.420> part<00:03:28.810> just<00:03:29.019> trust<00:03:29.530> me<00:03:29.680> when

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
understand that part just trust me when

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.440 
understand that part just trust me when
I<00:03:29.889> say<00:03:29.950> these<00:03:30.340> command<00:03:30.670> blocks<00:03:30.730> check<00:03:31.180> if<00:03:31.359> a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
I say these command blocks check if a

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.509 
I say these command blocks check if a
game<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.690> won<00:03:31.989> by<00:03:32.170> someone<00:03:32.560> now<00:03:33.160> we'll<00:03:33.310> do<00:03:33.459> the

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
game is won by someone now we'll do the

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.640 
game is won by someone now we'll do the
same<00:03:33.670> thing<00:03:34.120> but<00:03:34.299> with<00:03:34.480> these<00:03:34.810> 9<00:03:35.110> squids<00:03:35.500> and

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
same thing but with these 9 squids and

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.619 
same thing but with these 9 squids and
instead<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.310> looking<00:03:36.640> for<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.909> color<00:03:37.239> we'll

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
instead of looking for the color we'll

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.720 
instead of looking for the color we'll
look<00:03:37.810> at<00:03:38.019> one<00:03:38.620> by<00:03:38.650> another

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
look at one by another

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.399 
look at one by another
or<00:03:39.819> that<00:03:40.000> gets<00:03:40.269> added<00:03:40.540> when<00:03:40.930> one<00:03:41.140> of<00:03:41.290> these

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
or that gets added when one of these

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.649 
or that gets added when one of these
nine<00:03:41.680> games<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.190> won<00:03:42.370> by<00:03:42.550> someone<00:03:42.940> when<00:03:43.480> we're

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
nine games is won by someone when we're

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.420 
nine games is won by someone when we're
done<00:03:43.840> testing<00:03:44.049> if<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.560> game<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:44.860> finished<00:03:45.040> we

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
done testing if the game is finished we

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.309 
done testing if the game is finished we
can<00:03:45.640> redraw<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.120> chest<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:46.750> case<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.140> game

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
can redraw the chest in case the game

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.500 
can redraw the chest in case the game
isn't<00:03:47.739> finished<00:03:47.950> that's<00:03:48.700> done<00:03:49.000> by<00:03:49.239> these

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
isn't finished that's done by these

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.330 
isn't finished that's done by these
command<00:03:49.870> blocks<00:03:50.049> over<00:03:50.200> here<00:03:50.319> when<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.010> place<00:03:51.310> a

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
command blocks over here when I place a

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.070 
command blocks over here when I place a
redstone<00:03:51.610> block<00:03:51.819> over<00:03:52.269> here<00:03:52.299> you'll<00:03:52.690> see<00:03:52.930> it

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
redstone block over here you'll see it

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.140 
redstone block over here you'll see it
moves<00:03:53.349> this<00:03:54.010> way<00:03:54.280> these<00:03:54.489> command<00:03:54.819> blocks<00:03:55.000> are

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
moves this way these command blocks are

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.630 
moves this way these command blocks are
powered<00:03:55.390> one<00:03:55.629> tick<00:03:55.930> after<00:03:56.410> another<00:03:56.680> in<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.430> very

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
powered one tick after another in a very

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.460 
powered one tick after another in a very
old<00:03:57.819> video<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.209> show<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:58.510> how<00:03:58.810> to<00:03:58.840> create<00:03:59.290> this

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
old video I show you how to create this

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.390 
old video I show you how to create this
clock<00:03:59.830> thingy

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
clock thingy

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.490 
clock thingy
these<00:04:01.209> command<00:04:01.569> blocks<00:04:01.629> basically<00:04:02.200> change

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
these command blocks basically change

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.619 
these command blocks basically change
the<00:04:02.680> items<00:04:02.980> in<00:04:03.160> these<00:04:03.280> hoppers<00:04:03.640> over<00:04:04.000> here<00:04:04.330> so

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
the items in these hoppers over here so

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.509 
the items in these hoppers over here so
they<00:04:04.989> get<00:04:05.200> filled<00:04:05.470> in<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.739> right<00:04:05.920> order<00:04:06.190> and

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
they get filled in the right order and

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.880 
they get filled in the right order and
then<00:04:07.239> it<00:04:07.420> will<00:04:07.629> clone<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.959> chests<00:04:08.349> over<00:04:08.470> here

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
then it will clone the chests over here

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.979 
then it will clone the chests over here
-<00:04:09.159> over<00:04:09.340> there<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.970> that's<00:04:10.480> how<00:04:10.629> you<00:04:10.720> get

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
- over there and that's how you get

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.509 
- over there and that's how you get
three<00:04:11.200> chests<00:04:11.470> next<00:04:11.829> to<00:04:11.920> each<00:04:12.040> other<00:04:12.190> because

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
three chests next to each other because

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.250 
three chests next to each other because
you<00:04:12.849> can't<00:04:13.030> place<00:04:13.239> them<00:04:13.450> by<00:04:13.690> hand<00:04:13.900> of<00:04:14.049> course

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
you can't place them by hand of course

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.520 
you can't place them by hand of course
that's<00:04:14.980> about<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.430> thanks<00:04:15.910> for<00:04:15.940> watching<00:04:16.530> wait
