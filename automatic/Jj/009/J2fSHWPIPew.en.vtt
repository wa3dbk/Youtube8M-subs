00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.579
 african 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.250
 so this is a typical afro baiana dish 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:52.039
 the Africans they used in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.190
 Indigenous, then, on account of 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.710
 income on account of price then 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.699
 started to use the im in everything and he 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.260
 has the same practically the same 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:11.040
 texture, the taste changes so that it 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.740
 football with miami and also 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 can be made breadfruit body if that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.470
 it's delicious 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.640
 The first step is to prepare the mashed 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.100
 year 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.490
 love you, you'll get peanuts 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:36.610
 Are you going to bring cashew nuts? 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:40.360
 dry chili onion and coconut milk 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.030
 So you cook Iran and hit the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.530
 blender with all these 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.630
 Ingredients 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.680
 you will cook up turned om 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.130
 by him 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.250
 so it's good that it is cooked the 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.750
 end you put the olive oil to understand right? 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.850
 so that it has the African flavor 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.120
 true oil palm oil and 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.570
 Let's do the composing and after the pre- 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.990
 is that we are going to start preparing the 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.990
 shrimp dumpling 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.080
 the first step is a good frying pan 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.080
 hot 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:27.470
 we'll put it later 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:32.330
 the olive oil in possession of it enters the preparation 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.950
 of the puree and it enters the time of preparation 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.390
 of the prawn bobo 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:45.760
 now we'll put the onion the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.760
 pepper and chopped coriander 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.580
 big kiss 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:12.890
 now we put the fresh shrimp and we 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.890
 already overtaken with a little salt 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:32.830
 it is good to remember that the shrimp he can not 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.830
 take too much because otherwise it hardens 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.630
 all for free 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:54.650
 this is the shrimp that is already good 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:57.549
 When he's already white, he's already got it. 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.549
 a little bit 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.750
 now I earn with 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:12.040
 she won from anyone to make 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:28.490
 flour breaks complicated and then the rest 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.010
 of shrimp cooking will do the same 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.220
 virus does not happen with pyran where it 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.300
 will also absorb the seasoning that is 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.500
 not yet but many want victory 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.540
 How long does it take a little longer? 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.580
 put the coconut milk as the point 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.650
 ideal to put it has to be 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.400
 creamier because as it was 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.100
 prepared and it is well concentrated 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.530
 then it will absorb the oil to understand 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.820
 It will warm up and it will get creamier. 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.820
 but the link 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.389
 and now the coconut milk 80 told me a 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.699
 that coconut milk in the 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.199
 truth is a novelty in the middle of 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.470
 African matrix 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.900
 so why coconut milk you do not use 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.169
 uses when to use when to use 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.069
 looks just as much the fifth shrimp bobo 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:30.919
 while the underwear is you put the milk 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:33.229
 coconut to suit the palate of 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.870
 clients of the people who are 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:40.009
 very accustomed to eating with milk of 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.349
 Coconut is more authentic African food than 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:45.229
 moqueca both moqueca and bobÃ³ de 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:48.199
 shrimp does not use coconut milk is always the 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.990
 people always want to do tv 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:54.229
 so know a silly one is ready 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.729
 if you have a clay pot stay 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.300
 presentation line 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.300
 come on 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:08.349
 and a detail that the box has to clean 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:16.330
 hot in the series make good you leave it 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:19.479

 served with white rice and is always good 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.840
 a small pepper of olive oil can give 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.390
 a special orange tone for sure I 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.940
 always put the first part because it 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.280
 You do not like it very much. 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:17.100
