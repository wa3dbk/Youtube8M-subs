00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
me if I'm wrong he could be the first

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.370 
me if I'm wrong he could be the first
blow<00:05:02.810> under<00:05:03.050> pop<00:05:03.560> pop<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.400> pop<00:05:04.580> teaching

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:17.290 

maybe<00:05:09.380> is<00:05:15.280> all<00:05:16.280> right<00:05:16.580> let's<00:05:16.880> take<00:05:17.000> a<00:05:17.060> closer

look<00:05:17.419> at<00:05:17.690> him<00:05:18.220> let's<00:05:19.220> see<00:05:19.280> his<00:05:19.550> head's<00:05:19.760> the

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
look at him let's see his head's the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.270 
look at him let's see his head's the
same<00:05:20.060> way<00:05:20.240> I<00:05:20.479> think<00:05:21.200> it's<00:05:21.470> so<00:05:21.650> that<00:05:21.860> you<00:05:22.100> know

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.060 
same way I think it's so that you know
there<00:05:22.870> they<00:05:23.870> can<00:05:24.020> wiggle<00:05:24.200> around<00:05:24.410> if<00:05:24.889> you're

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
there they can wiggle around if you're

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.500 
there they can wiggle around if you're
actually<00:05:25.400> using<00:05:25.550> them<00:05:25.789> as<00:05:25.880> a<00:05:25.910> keychain<00:05:26.150> or<00:05:28.510> he
