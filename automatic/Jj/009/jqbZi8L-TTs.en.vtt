here's a great little router and of
course<00:00:10.210> it<00:00:10.420> isn't<00:00:10.570> around<00:00:10.930> anymore<00:00:11.290> but<00:00:11.620> I'll

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830

put you in jail for even thinking about
single-handed<00:00:40.690> routing<00:00:41.140> but<00:00:41.800> I'd<00:00:42.040> never<00:00:42.370> ever

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
single-handed routing but I'd never ever

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.120 
single-handed routing but I'd never ever
had<00:00:43.030> an<00:00:43.149> accident<00:00:43.570> with<00:00:43.720> a<00:00:43.780> router<00:00:44.079> in<00:00:44.440> over<00:00:44.770> 40

so<00:00:46.360> I<00:00:46.390> hope<00:00:46.540> there's<00:00:46.780> no<00:00:46.930> law<00:00:47.140> stating<00:00:47.739> you

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
so I hope there's no law stating you

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.180 
so I hope there's no law stating you
can't<00:00:48.160> use<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.399> router<00:00:48.730> with<00:00:49.030> just<00:00:49.270> one<00:00:49.480> hand

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can't use a router with just one hand

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.340 
can't use a router with just one hand

radius is not only practical but it's a

router but you'd soften the edge with
abrasive<00:01:14.560> paper<00:01:15.040> but<00:01:15.790> I'm<00:01:15.940> talking<00:01:16.390> about

kind of thing now what's so easy about
this<00:01:22.659> particular<00:01:23.020> router<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.950> I've<00:01:24.070> yet<00:01:24.430> to

this particular router and I've yet to

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.640 
this particular router and I've yet to
find<00:01:24.580> another<00:01:25.090> one<00:01:25.270> quite<00:01:25.689> so<00:01:25.990> light<00:01:26.290> and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
find another one quite so light and

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.950 
find another one quite so light and
comfortable<00:01:27.070> to<00:01:27.310> handle<00:01:27.729> is<00:01:28.180> that<00:01:28.540> you<00:01:28.630> simply

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
comfortable to handle is that you simply

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.609 
comfortable to handle is that you simply
hold<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.530> work<00:01:29.770> in<00:01:29.979> one<00:01:30.220> hand<00:01:30.549> and<00:01:31.350> run<00:01:32.350> the

the other hand now whether you work

backwards or forwards doesn't really

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.710 
backwards or forwards doesn't really
matter<00:01:42.100> because<00:01:42.310> you're<00:01:42.670> taking<00:01:43.060> off<00:01:43.180> a<00:01:43.210> tiny

it smooth I find this method

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.460 
it smooth I find this method

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
significantly faster than conventional

significantly faster than conventional
