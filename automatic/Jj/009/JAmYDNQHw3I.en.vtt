so<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:10.650> does<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.950> mean<00:00:11.130> for<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.429> future<00:00:11.580> of

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
so what does this mean for the future of

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.539 
so what does this mean for the future of
space<00:00:12.450> exploration<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:13.380> mankind<00:00:13.920> I'm<00:00:14.370> joy

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
implications for mankind now that we

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.390 
implications for mankind now that we
have<00:00:27.240> found<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.230> rocket<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.279> was

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
have found with that rocket that was

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.820 
have found with that rocket that was
shot<00:00:29.640> into<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.359> earth<00:00:30.660> or<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.170> surface<00:00:31.619> of

shot into the earth or the surface of
the<00:00:32.009> Moon<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.180> found<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.660> water<00:00:33.960> there

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the Moon that we found this water there

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.990 
the Moon that we found this water there
what<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.649> implications<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:35.399> us<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
what are the implications for us this is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.110 
what are the implications for us this is
a<00:00:36.329> potential<00:00:37.050> game-changer<00:00:37.469> nASA<00:00:38.430> has<00:00:38.670> hit

a potential game-changer nASA has hit
pay<00:00:39.570> dirt<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:40.079> realize<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.500> ice<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.010> worth

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
pay dirt you realize that ice is worth

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.270 
pay dirt you realize that ice is worth
five<00:00:41.969> times<00:00:42.079> pound-for-pound<00:00:43.079> five<00:00:43.920> times

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the value of gold on the moon this could

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.340 
the value of gold on the moon this could
change<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.579> way<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:47.879> view<00:00:47.910> space<00:00:48.480> exploration

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
change the way we view space exploration

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.979 
change the way we view space exploration
living<00:00:49.890> off<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.430> land<00:00:50.460> using<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> ice<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.899> the

living off the land using the ice of the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.619 
living off the land using the ice of the
Moon<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.379> because<00:00:53.129> if<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.760> then<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
Moon and because if we then go to the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.900 
Moon and because if we then go to the
moon<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.410> could<00:00:55.620> then<00:00:55.739> set<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> permanent<00:00:56.520> basis

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
moon we could then set a permanent basis

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.700 
moon we could then set a permanent basis
there<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.480> deeper<00:00:57.780> exploration<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.559> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
there for deeper exploration is that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.529 
there for deeper exploration is that
right<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:58.920> right<00:00:59.399> hydrogen<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.329> used

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
right that's right hydrogen can be used

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.420 
right that's right hydrogen can be used
for<00:01:00.629> rocket<00:01:01.079> fuel<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.620> oxygen<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> water

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
for rocket fuel the oxygen in the water

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
for rocket fuel the oxygen in the water
could<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.969> used<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.239> breathing<00:01:03.780> water<00:01:04.379> could

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
could be used for breathing water could

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.399 
could be used for breathing water could
be<00:01:04.769> purified<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.369> drunk<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.240> also<00:01:06.960> water<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
be purified and drunk and also water is

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.530 
be purified and drunk and also water is
a<00:01:07.439> good<00:01:07.710> shielding<00:01:08.369> against<00:01:08.850> solar<00:01:09.180> flares

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
a good shielding against solar flares

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.230 
a good shielding against solar flares
and<00:01:09.840> cosmic<00:01:10.020> rays<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.860> out<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.220> space<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:12.060> was

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and cosmic rays in out of space this was

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.140 
and cosmic rays in out of space this was
an<00:01:12.360> 80<00:01:12.630> million<00:01:13.020> dollar<00:01:13.350> gamble<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.820> it

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
an 80 million dollar gamble it's it's it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.570 
an 80 million dollar gamble it's it's it
simply<00:01:15.570> paid<00:01:15.869> off<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.110> spades<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.430> this

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
simply paid off in spades so is this

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.039 
simply paid off in spades so is this
politically<00:01:18.240> important<00:01:18.689> though<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
politically important though if the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.480 
politically important though if the
President<00:01:19.439> Obama<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.890> lot<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.130> people<00:01:20.220> saying

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
President Obama a lot of people saying

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.679 
President Obama a lot of people saying
well<00:01:20.580> how<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.000> afford<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.570> that

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
well how can we afford this right that

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.870 
well how can we afford this right that
mission<00:01:22.290> where<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.799> blasted<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.490> thing<00:01:23.729> into

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
mission where we blasted that thing into

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.630 
mission where we blasted that thing into
the<00:01:23.970> surface<00:01:24.330> cost<00:01:24.540> 80<00:01:24.810> million<00:01:25.140> dollars<00:01:25.710> does

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the surface cost 80 million dollars does

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940 
the surface cost 80 million dollars does
this<00:01:26.850> gamble<00:01:27.299> pay<00:01:27.509> off<00:01:27.740> politically<00:01:28.740> for

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
this gamble pay off politically for

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
this gamble pay off politically for
President<00:01:29.310> Obama<00:01:29.340> puts<00:01:29.790> pressure<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.420> obama

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
President Obama puts pressure on obama

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
President Obama puts pressure on obama
because<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> augustine<00:01:31.920> report<00:01:32.369> has<00:01:32.549> said

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
because the augustine report has said

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.060 
because the augustine report has said
more<00:01:33.180> or<00:01:33.329> less<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.720> yanks<00:01:34.170> are<00:01:34.350> not<00:01:34.590> coming

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
more or less the yanks are not coming

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.830 
more or less the yanks are not coming
we're<00:01:35.579> not<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> go<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.329> moon<00:01:36.600> we're

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
we're not going to go to the moon we're

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
much to see but it was really what the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.520 
much to see but it was really what the

that<00:02:07.799> was<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.129> important<00:02:08.550> right<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:09.270> in

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that was really important right back in

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.610 
that was really important right back in
October<00:02:09.929> NASA<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.349> got<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> black<00:02:10.890> eye
