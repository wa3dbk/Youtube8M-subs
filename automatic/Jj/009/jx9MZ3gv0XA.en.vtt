the other hand makes the setup process a
lot<00:01:27.980> easier<00:01:28.010> by<00:01:28.610> eliminating<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.450> separate

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
lot easier by eliminating the separate

lot easier by eliminating the separate
driver<00:01:30.110> disk<00:01:30.470> all<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.460> drivers<00:01:31.670> are<00:01:31.880> actually

driver disk all the drivers are actually

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.850 
driver disk all the drivers are actually
pre<00:01:32.480> bundled<00:01:32.960> into<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.290> printers<00:01:33.590> firmware

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
pre bundled into the printers firmware

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.980 
pre bundled into the printers firmware
so<00:01:34.610> all<00:01:34.760> you<00:01:34.880> got<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.120> do<00:01:35.240> is<00:01:35.450> connect<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:35.960> USB

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
so all you got to do is connect a USB

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.350 
so all you got to do is connect a USB
cable<00:01:36.560> from<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.070> printer<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.820> your<00:01:37.910> computer

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
cable from the printer to your computer

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.750 
cable from the printer to your computer
and<00:01:38.510> it'll<00:01:39.020> do<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.170> rest<00:01:39.410> it<00:01:40.100> also<00:01:40.280> saves<00:01:40.670> time

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
and it'll do the rest it also saves time

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.340 
and it'll do the rest it also saves time
when<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:41.150> want<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.360> install<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:41.930> printer<00:01:42.200> on

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
when you want to install this printer on

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.190 
when you want to install this printer on
multiple<00:01:42.830> computers<00:01:43.340> but<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.270> only<00:01:44.510> works<00:01:44.930> for

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
multiple computers but it only works for

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.180 
multiple computers but it only works for
Windows<00:01:45.350> machines

so unfortunately Mac users will need to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.530 
so unfortunately Mac users will need to
install<00:01:48.560> drivers<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.940> old-fashioned<00:01:50.420> way
