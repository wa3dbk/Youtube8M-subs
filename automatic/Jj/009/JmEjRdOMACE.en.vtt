00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.770 
that we're going to use baking paper and
all<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.280> rest<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.700> it's<00:02:49.820> flexible<00:02:50.270> doesn't

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
all the rest of it it's flexible doesn't

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.960 
all the rest of it it's flexible doesn't
stick<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.170> comes<00:02:51.350> straight<00:02:51.440> off<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:52.790> is

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
stick and it comes straight off this is

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.000 
stick and it comes straight off this is
now<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.180> fun<00:02:53.480> part<00:02:53.510> with<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.350> dough<00:02:54.650> just

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
now the fun part with this dough just

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.880 
now the fun part with this dough just
roll<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.550> however<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.450> want<00:02:56.600> basically<00:02:57.170> the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
roll it however you want basically the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.040 
roll it however you want basically the
idea<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.250> now<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.520> make<00:02:58.790> lots<00:02:59.060> of<00:02:59.180> shapes<00:02:59.480> so<00:03:02.050> it

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
idea is now to make lots of shapes so it

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.630 
idea is now to make lots of shapes so it
should<00:03:03.260> be<00:03:03.350> die<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:03.980> should<00:03:04.190> just<00:03:04.310> stick

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
should be die so it should just stick

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.590 
should be die so it should just stick
together<00:03:04.940> nicely<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:05.960> just<00:03:06.700> roll<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:11.510> have

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
together nicely so just roll it to have

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.630 
together nicely so just roll it to have
a<00:03:11.690> big<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.959> want<00:03:16.660> there<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:17.780> go<00:03:18.370> so<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.400> can

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
a big you want there you go so you can

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.699 
a big you want there you go so you can
make<00:03:19.820> any<00:03:20.120> sort<00:03:20.450> of<00:03:20.540> shape<00:03:20.780> tradition<00:03:21.590> there

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
make any sort of shape tradition there
