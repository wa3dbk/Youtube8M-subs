00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
off the road and because I almost really

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.400 
off the road and because I almost really
hit<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.790> one<00:03:02.000> car<00:03:02.210> she<00:03:02.780> was<00:03:02.810> very<00:03:03.050> fortunate

been a barrier there there would have

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.530 
been a barrier there there would have
been<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.860> crash<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:07.790> course<00:03:08.000> Alicia<00:03:08.300> was
