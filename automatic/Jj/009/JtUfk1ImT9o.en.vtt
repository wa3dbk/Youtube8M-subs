00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.600
 at the gate 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.930
 about 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.140
 in this lesson we will learn boosts 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.419
 risk of photos in two ways 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.129
 avoids the appearance 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.449
 additional noise and distortion 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.500
 however, do not think that 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.370
 they can correct photos taken 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.449
 nor foksha 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.449
 first way pieces 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.569
 open images and if 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.050
 it contains more than one layer 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.749
 switch to how 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.840
 still need to increase the risk of eating 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.840
 but in our case the layer is all day 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.440
 duplicate this layer 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.660
 flying it on the badge 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.710
 create on services 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.470
 we will use it in 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.390
 as a collective account 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.790
 choose an item 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.790
 discoloration 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 apply a filter from a group of others 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.660
 mosyakin pass 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.510
 with a radius of 0 5 pixels 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.040
 as a certain average 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.830
 actually radius value 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.690
 can be controlled visually 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.070
 achieving in the blur of the picture 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 when watching 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.900
 now in its palette 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.049
 and keys overlay mode 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.110
 this is with a hundred more times 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.480
 with ok 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.480
 on the polar 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.410
 the result is growing 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.020
 this method is more complicated 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.430
 it is based on preparing a mask for 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.860
 contour extraction 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.490
 contrast which is necessary 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.040
 sharpen to sharpen 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.590
 Images 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.080
 translate image format 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 paw 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.290
 we copy channels light us 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.260
 the new channel will be automatically 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.860
 given the name light as far as it is and he 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.239
 will become active 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.079
 and the received channel 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.830
 apply filter 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.830
 of large stylization flaming edges 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:21.429
 this case is used 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:24.059
 edge width 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.059
 unit 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.269
 edge brightness 14 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:36.499
 smoothness 3 st 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.199
 useful when experimenting outdoors 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.629
 different values ​​on construction sites to understand 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.629
 their impact on the final result 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.879
 channel is already using another filter 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.569
 Nose blur with a value of one 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.569
 pixel 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.489
 the parameter is usually equal to the width of the edge 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.489
 from previous Yushchenko 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.319
 already highlighting 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.969
 can be made through the menu selection but easier 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.700
 hold keystrokes on contour 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.700
 clicking on the channel that's how much 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.499
 switching to the channel from us 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.609
 now it is highlighted by the authorities 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.609
 obtained using the light layer as far as 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.499
 applying filter German mask 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:40.669
 our case uses such 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.400
 values ​​amount 400 percent this 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:46.430
 the parameter is responsible for the degree 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.270
 having filter effects on 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.739
 picture 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.459
 radius but pixel again 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.459
 he determines the thickness of the contours without casting 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.569
 zero guide 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.439
 when processing large 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.669
 Nation can increase the radius value 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.039
 i don't overdo the value radius rarely 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.919
 exceeds unit a for a polygraph printer 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.349
 reaches four 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:13.309
 playing parameter values 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.309
 be guided by the image 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.799
 achieve optimal 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.900
 result by changing the value of the quantity 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.310
 and he only by these two parameters 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.539
 quantity and size 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.499
 threshold value should always 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:29.330
 remain indifferent 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.539
 Now we take the excess we remove the selection 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.529
 read the coffin 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.840
 remove the channel clyde jumps 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.430
 switch it 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.259
 on the trash can image 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.900
 at the bottom of the palette channels 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.340
 translate the image 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.090
 necessary for further work 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.090
 color model kgb of them 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.539
 conclusion should be noted 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.110
 that the second method in some cases increases 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.279
 sharpen better quality 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:00.139
 but wrong selection of parameters 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.159
 of tools 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:03.459
 may result in a distinct
