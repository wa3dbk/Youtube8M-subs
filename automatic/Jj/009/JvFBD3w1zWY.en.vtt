00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
all right so I'm still scoping out all

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.400 
all right so I'm still scoping out all
this<00:02:36.180> that's<00:02:36.360> how<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.540> saw<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.020> low<00:02:37.170> plank

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
this that's how I saw that low plank

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.460 
this that's how I saw that low plank
just<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.770> edge<00:02:38.030> maybe<00:02:39.030> there's<00:02:39.300> more<00:02:39.390> never<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
just the edge maybe there's more never a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.760 
just the edge maybe there's more never a
sliver<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.340> gold<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.510> keep<00:02:42.780> checking<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.320> got

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
sliver of gold so I keep checking I got

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.250 
sliver of gold so I keep checking I got
four<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.130> pulled<00:02:44.610> three<00:02:44.880> out<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> bedrock<00:02:45.510> at

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
four I pulled three out the bedrock at

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.930 
four I pulled three out the bedrock at
that<00:02:46.530> first<00:02:46.739> pan<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.250> then<00:02:47.340> one<00:02:47.489> got<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.820> there

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
that first pan and then one got in there

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.240 
that first pan and then one got in there
from<00:02:48.090> cleaning<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.570> drop<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.020> guess<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
from cleaning a drop I guess this is the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.760 
from cleaning a drop I guess this is the
fifth<00:02:50.489> piece<00:02:50.730> all<00:02:51.540> within<00:02:51.840> about<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.380> foot<00:02:52.620> of

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
fifth piece all within about a foot of

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.140 
fifth piece all within about a foot of
each<00:02:52.860> other<00:02:53.100> not<00:02:53.340> even<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.640> maybe<00:02:53.850> six

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
each other not even that maybe six

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.180

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
check this out let me zoom in my

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.700 
check this out let me zoom in my
thinking<00:05:28.790> getting<00:05:29.000> better<00:05:29.419> no<00:05:29.870> but<00:05:30.110> I<00:05:30.320> can<00:05:30.530> see

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
thinking getting better no but I can see

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.190 
thinking getting better no but I can see
it<00:05:30.800> from<00:05:30.919> here<00:05:31.190> they're<00:05:31.580> right<00:05:32.030> on<00:05:32.090> it<00:05:32.360> that

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
it from here they're right on it that

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.230 
it from here they're right on it that
probably<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.770> tenth<00:05:34.100> of<00:05:34.220> a<00:05:34.310> gram<00:05:34.460> it's<00:05:35.030> in<00:05:35.210> a

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
probably a tenth of a gram it's in a

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.880 
probably a tenth of a gram it's in a
crevice<00:05:35.810> so<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:36.050> could<00:05:36.200> be<00:05:36.320> bigger<00:05:36.500> than<00:05:36.620> what

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
crevice so it could be bigger than what

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.650 
crevice so it could be bigger than what
it<00:05:37.010> looks<00:05:37.040> like<00:05:37.340> but<00:05:37.610> there<00:05:38.210> you<00:05:38.300> go<00:05:38.330> how<00:05:38.600> many

but I bet that's between half and three

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.420 
but I bet that's between half and three
quarters<00:06:30.200> of<00:06:30.470> a<00:06:30.560> gram<00:06:30.770> not<00:06:31.040> counting<00:06:31.370> that

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
quarters of a gram not counting that

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.120 
quarters of a gram not counting that
nugget<00:06:31.670> look<00:06:32.240> at<00:06:32.330> it<00:06:32.450> it<00:06:33.170> just<00:06:33.410> I<00:06:33.620> mean<00:06:34.010> that

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
nugget look at it it just I mean that

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.400 
nugget look at it it just I mean that
right<00:06:34.280> there<00:06:34.340> it's<00:06:34.640> two<00:06:34.820> tenths<00:06:35.060> of<00:06:35.180> a<00:06:35.240> gram

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
right there it's two tenths of a gram

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.570 
right there it's two tenths of a gram
probably<00:06:36.410> and<00:06:36.590> so<00:06:36.740> is<00:06:36.860> that<00:06:37.040> one
