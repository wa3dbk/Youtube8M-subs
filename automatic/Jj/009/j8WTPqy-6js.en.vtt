wall<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.240> chase<00:02:49.450> begins

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
wall in the chase begins

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.750

he<00:02:50.380> runs<00:02:50.620> near<00:02:50.830> golems<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.250> Q's<00:02:51.490> over<00:02:51.670> the

he runs near golems and Q's over the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.130 
he runs near golems and Q's over the
