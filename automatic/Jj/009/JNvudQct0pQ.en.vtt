00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
has just been bought off eBay so let's

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.600 
has just been bought off eBay so let's
get<00:00:11.160> straight<00:00:11.519> into<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.940> without<00:00:12.120> further<00:00:12.540> ado

out that screw turns out and that lets
the<00:00:23.850> reflector<00:00:24.420> quite<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> new<00:00:25.619> reflector<00:00:26.099> come

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the reflector quite a new reflector come

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.759 
the reflector quite a new reflector come
out<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> front<00:00:26.640> revealing<00:00:27.359> an<00:00:27.570> unusual<00:00:28.349> LED

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
out the front revealing an unusual LED

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.099 
out the front revealing an unusual LED
it<00:00:28.890> looks<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.189> bit<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.490> Luxan<00:00:29.970> star<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:30.990> has

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
it looks a bit like a Luxan star but has

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.350 
it looks a bit like a Luxan star but has
actually<00:00:31.470> chip<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.859> board<00:00:31.890> now<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.880> seems<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
actually chip on board now this seems to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.940 
actually chip on board now this seems to
be<00:00:33.450> something<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.809> Chinese<00:00:34.290> manufacturer

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
be something that Chinese manufacturer

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.290 
be something that Chinese manufacturer
doing<00:00:35.160> quite<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.399> lot<00:00:35.579> these<00:00:35.700> days<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.120> here's

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
doing quite a lot these days and here's

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.770 
doing quite a lot these days and here's
a<00:00:36.360> bigger<00:00:36.630> Cobb<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.149> instead<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.329> getting<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
a bigger Cobb and instead of getting the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.619 
a bigger Cobb and instead of getting the
aluminium<00:00:40.879> substrate<00:00:41.879> circuit<00:00:42.210> board<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
aluminium substrate circuit board and

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.889 
aluminium substrate circuit board and
then<00:00:43.200> mounting<00:00:43.680> existing<00:00:44.460> packaged<00:00:45.300> LEDs<00:00:45.750> in

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
then mounting existing packaged LEDs in

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.080 
then mounting existing packaged LEDs in
it<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.440> deluxe<00:00:47.160> Eames<00:00:47.430> star<00:00:47.730> 1<00:00:47.910> watt

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
it like the deluxe Eames star 1 watt

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.750 
it like the deluxe Eames star 1 watt
chips<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.770> what<00:00:49.770> they're<00:00:49.890> doing<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.370> they're

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
chips and what they're doing is they're

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.810 
chips and what they're doing is they're
putting<00:00:51.500> surface<00:00:52.500> mount<00:00:52.710> chips<00:00:53.070> directly<00:00:53.610> on

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
putting surface mount chips directly on

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.119 
putting surface mount chips directly on
to<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> substrate<00:00:54.680> putting<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> little<00:00:55.980> sat

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
to the substrate putting a little sat

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.889 
to the substrate putting a little sat
down<00:00:56.370> round<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.120> flooding<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
down round and then flooding it with a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.080 
down round and then flooding it with a
set<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> almost<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> rubbery<00:00:59.489> silicon

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
set of almost like a rubbery silicon

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.229 
set of almost like a rubbery silicon
feeling<00:01:00.480> stuff<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.100> phosphor<00:01:02.969> M

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
feeling stuff with the phosphor M

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.740 
feeling stuff with the phosphor M
embedded<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> good<00:01:06.119> idea<00:01:06.270> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
embedded in it so it's a good idea it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.649 
embedded in it so it's a good idea it
makes<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:08.119> cheaping<00:01:09.119> easy<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.479> make

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
makes it really cheaping easy to make

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.410 
makes it really cheaping easy to make
these<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:10.049> their<00:01:10.200> perspective<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.520> is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
these from their perspective so this is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.859 
these from their perspective so this is
screwed<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.530> quite<00:01:13.860> tightly<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:18.420> other<00:01:18.509> chip

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
screwed and quite tightly the other chip

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.550 
screwed and quite tightly the other chip
I<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.170> showed<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.619> has<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:21.200> six<00:01:22.200> chips

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
I just showed you there has a six chips

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.420 
I just showed you there has a six chips
in<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.310> rated<00:01:24.049> about<00:01:25.049> five<00:01:25.979> watts

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
in it and it's rated about five watts

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.230 
in it and it's rated about five watts
and<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.210> word<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.640> three<00:01:30.060> in

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and the word is a I think it's three in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.380 
and the word is a I think it's three in
series<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:31.130> two<00:01:32.130> parallel<00:01:32.460> pair<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.060> something

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
series in two parallel pair or something

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.450 
series in two parallel pair or something
like<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.009> only<00:01:35.040> way<00:01:35.220> I'm<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
like that so the only way I'm going to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
like that so the only way I'm going to
get<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> back<00:01:35.880> office<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.840> lift<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
get the back office is to lift this up a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.340 
get the back office is to lift this up a
little<00:01:37.650> bit<00:01:38.479> it's<00:01:39.479> quite<00:01:39.689> unusual<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.259> this

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
little bit it's quite unusual that this

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.530 
little bit it's quite unusual that this
one<00:01:40.530> uses<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> standard<00:01:41.220> luckiest<00:01:42.090> irish-style

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
one uses a standard luckiest irish-style

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.090 
one uses a standard luckiest irish-style
housing<00:01:43.200> that's<00:01:43.350> quite<00:01:43.649> neat<00:01:43.860> that's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
housing that's quite neat that's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.630 
housing that's quite neat that's
interesting<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:46.100> three<00:01:47.100> screws<00:01:47.430> come

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
interesting to know three screws come

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.609 
interesting to know three screws come
out<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.240> cannot<00:01:48.570> know<00:01:48.840> what's<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.409> here

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
out here I cannot know what's in here

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380 
out here I cannot know what's in here
already<00:01:49.950> because<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.210> very

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
already because it's going to be very

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.690 
already because it's going to be very
similar<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> other<00:01:52.399> universal<00:01:53.399> voltage

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
similar to the other universal voltage

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.260 
similar to the other universal voltage
ones<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:55.460> it's<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.790> one<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.149> those

quite thick sleeving but it's going to

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.539 
quite thick sleeving but it's going to
be<00:02:04.530> another<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.890> those<00:02:05.040> little<00:02:05.369> worm

knock<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.149> about<00:02:09.209> here<00:02:09.569> roughly<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.379> this

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
knock you about here roughly like this

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.590 
knock you about here roughly like this
which<00:02:12.310> takes<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.700> means<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.120> through<00:02:13.360> erect

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
which takes a means in through erect

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.140 
which takes a means in through erect
fire<00:02:13.870> control<00:02:14.530> chip<00:02:14.830> little<00:02:15.370> transformer<00:02:15.970> and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
fire control chip little transformer and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.750 
fire control chip little transformer and
basically<00:02:16.630> oops<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.440> current<00:02:18.040> limited<00:02:18.460> our

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
basically oops so current limited our

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.670 
basically oops so current limited our
power<00:02:19.090> limited<00:02:19.840> em<00:02:21.180> power<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.840> LED<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.560> the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
power limited em power to the LED so the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.610 
power limited em power to the LED so the
LED<00:02:23.980> runs<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.400> specific<00:02:24.940> power<00:02:25.690> yeah<00:02:26.350> how<00:02:26.560> many

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
LED runs a specific power yeah how many

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.530 
LED runs a specific power yeah how many
times<00:02:26.770> can<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.190> see<00:02:27.370> power<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.880> that's<00:02:28.270> really

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
times can I see power and that's really

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.890 
times can I see power and that's really
it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
it

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.750 
it
so<00:02:28.990> em<00:02:29.140> that's<00:02:29.500> this<00:02:29.770> is<00:02:29.830> quite<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> neat<00:02:30.460> one<00:02:30.580> I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
so em that's this is quite a neat one I

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.310 
so em that's this is quite a neat one I
like<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.240> one<00:02:31.420> that's<00:02:31.630> quite<00:02:31.840> bright<00:02:32.140> when

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
like that one that's quite bright when

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.030 
like that one that's quite bright when
it's<00:02:32.440> list<00:02:32.620> as<00:02:32.710> well

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
it's list as well

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.290 
it's list as well
and<00:02:33.480> yeah<00:02:34.480> that's<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:35.020> good<00:02:35.170> one
