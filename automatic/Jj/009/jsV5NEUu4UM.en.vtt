00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.859 
you also have to learn the human anatomy
the<00:01:17.070> physiological<00:01:17.640> part<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.090> chemistry<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the physiological part the chemistry and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.570 
the physiological part the chemistry and
everything<00:01:19.619> else<00:01:19.740> which<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.100> your<00:01:20.280> proper

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
grammar when you're writing your chart

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.370 
grammar when you're writing your chart
also<00:01:22.409> give<00:01:23.100> holistic<00:01:24.000> care<00:01:24.390> okay<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.140> ten

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
also give holistic care okay that's ten

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.690 
also give holistic care okay that's ten
things<00:01:25.619> right<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.009> broke<00:01:26.189> down<00:01:26.220> quick

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
things right that I broke down quick

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.480 
things right that I broke down quick
okay<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.600> very<00:01:27.780> important<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.220> reason

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
okay it's very important so the reason

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.649 
okay it's very important so the reason
why<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> say<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:29.970> difficult<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.540> this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
why I say it's difficult for this

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.240 
why I say it's difficult for this
individual<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> go<00:01:31.380> into<00:01:31.560> nursing<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:32.009> because

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
individual to go into nursing is because

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.710 
individual to go into nursing is because
he<00:01:32.430> learns<00:01:32.640> something<00:01:33.060> different<00:01:33.390> correction

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
he learns something different correction

he learns something different correction
officer<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.229> can't<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:35.040> change<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
become a nurse but you have to have that

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.620 
become a nurse but you have to have that
compassion<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.100> learn<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:39.150> help<00:01:39.360> others

let me give you an example two examples
when<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.250> third<00:01:59.460> grade<00:01:59.640> what<00:01:59.820> do<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.939> like

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
entertaining you could pose so nursing

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.900 
entertaining you could pose so nursing
has<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.460> be<00:02:09.610> like<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:10.630> cartoon<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.790> let<00:02:12.790> me

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
has to be like a cartoon to you let me

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.520 
has to be like a cartoon to you let me
break<00:02:13.090> down<00:02:13.120> another<00:02:13.480> example<00:02:13.870> if<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.410> do

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
break down another example if you do

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.960 
break down another example if you do
math<00:02:14.770> when<00:02:15.160> you're<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.340> third<00:02:15.490> grade<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.880> was

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
math when you're in third grade it was

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.550 
math when you're in third grade it was
hard<00:02:16.210> because<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.570> have<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.140> know<00:02:17.260> do<00:02:17.470> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
hard because you have to you know do the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.290 
hard because you have to you know do the
mathematical<00:02:18.100> steps<00:02:18.430> if<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.700> mess<00:02:18.910> one<00:02:19.150> up

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
mathematical steps if you mess one up

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.060 
mathematical steps if you mess one up
your<00:02:19.540> answer<00:02:19.780> not<00:02:19.930> gonna<00:02:20.020> be<00:02:20.140> right<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:21.010> you

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
your answer not gonna be right so you

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.530 
your answer not gonna be right so you
had<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.370> be<00:02:21.490> proper<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.120> bring<00:02:22.300> your<00:02:22.390> a-game

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
had to be proper and bring your a-game

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.390 
had to be proper and bring your a-game
with<00:02:22.870> math<00:02:23.050> but<00:02:23.350> it's<00:02:23.500> boring<00:02:23.950> who<00:02:24.100> wants<00:02:24.340> to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
with math but it's boring who wants to

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.520 
with math but it's boring who wants to
do<00:02:24.490> math<00:02:24.810> nursing<00:02:25.810> can<00:02:26.350> be<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:26.740> math<00:02:26.950> too<00:02:27.450> so

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
do math nursing can be like math too so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.420 
do math nursing can be like math too so
this<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.650> why<00:02:29.800> I'm<00:02:29.920> saying<00:02:30.070> it's<00:02:30.250> gonna<00:02:30.340> be

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
this is why I'm saying it's gonna be

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.680 
this is why I'm saying it's gonna be
hard<00:02:30.610> for<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.910> Matthew<00:02:31.270> you're<00:02:31.420> gonna<00:02:31.510> look

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
hard for you Matthew you're gonna look

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.920 
hard for you Matthew you're gonna look
at<00:02:31.840> nursing<00:02:32.170> like<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.320> mathematical<00:02:33.190> problem

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
at nursing like a mathematical problem

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.910 
at nursing like a mathematical problem
you're<00:02:34.930> not<00:02:35.080> gonna<00:02:35.200> figure<00:02:35.470> out<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.709> couple

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
you're not gonna figure out a couple

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.320 
you're not gonna figure out a couple
steps<00:02:36.280> because<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.000> don't<00:02:37.150> have<00:02:37.239> that

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
steps because you don't have that

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.000 
steps because you don't have that
compassion<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.959> love<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.350> support<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.890> all

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
compassion that love and support and all

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.860 
compassion that love and support and all
that<00:02:39.160> other<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.370> do<00:02:39.489> as<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> nurse<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.600> when<00:02:40.780> you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
that other you do as a nurse so when you
