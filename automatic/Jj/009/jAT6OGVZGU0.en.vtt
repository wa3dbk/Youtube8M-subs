00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.380
 Hello, my friends, welcome to the new section of the heavy architect 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 The subject of this day Ersin Ã–lmez a question my brother asked me 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.400
 What is it 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.220
 People from a busy school period do not lose anything what they do on holiday 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.800
 They even add something to themselves 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.120
 Ersin brother problem is very nice 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.180
 Now I want to talk for architecture but I mean sleep for architects holiday 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.520
 Because as you know at school, we're not sleeping. 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.760
 I personally spent the first two months sleeping 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.340
 I mean, I've had a full winter sleep. 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.100
 But I don't regret it, of course. 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.080
 As a result, the sleep energy was collected and people started to get bored 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.080
 I guess my friend who asked the question 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.360
 He asked me this question because he was getting bored 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.680
 The holiday doesn't really know what to do because the holiday is also somewhere 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.780
 You wandered the dust, but the day came, schools started to approach 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.180
 And at the end you said, what am I doing? 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.200
 You didn't think there was anything to call the internet. 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.740
 If you were at school, you'd be looking for something to do with school 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.780
 There were a thousand things in your head because of the homework, but you're free now. 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.940
 No more games left. No more games left. 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.400
 But don't worry Heavy Architect here 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.420
 One of the most important rules of spending the holiday is not to abandon self-ignorance 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.940
 Okay, school might be over, but you can still find something about school. 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.560
 You can explore and learn about topics related to the next period 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.080
 Youtube Google Bing Yandex can ask a lot of questions 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.700
 If you don't want to have a site with a pile of books there is a minute you're not looking for information 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.180
 If the information you mean by efficiency is not 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.640
 What could it be? 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.540
 For example, it may be sport. We may have friends who don't have the chance to swim in the summer. 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.940
 You may be bored at home. 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.700
 You may be overwhelmed by the hours you spent on your computer. 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.840
 Get up, sport! 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.740
 If you don't want to improve your brain's efficiency, increase your body's efficiency. 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.620
 Because really the efficiency that your body has lost for a year is too much. 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.640
 An hour's walk in the evening can be a very nice training. 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.600
 If you want it, you can write to a gym. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 And if you have the muscles you've done, you can keep them vigorous. 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.560
 And the sport! 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.440
 Friends, relationships, if you read architecture, try to spend more time with your girlfriend 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.420
 Because during architecture, it's impossible to devote time to your lover! 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.220
 Meet your friends you may not have seen your friends! 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.480
 Stay in the cottage with them, stay in their house if they don't have a cottage ... 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.400
 Sit together at night! 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.020
 You're not a civil servant. 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.080
 Go have fun with my friend! 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.800
 You thought about school time, 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.440
 I'm gonna do this summer, I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna have fun like this, 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.580
 Where did they go? 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.660
 What are you doing now? 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.740
 Why are you sitting? 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.720
 Get up! Tired! 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.360
 You don't have to be an architect. 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.120
 You can do something about your own hobby, about what you're interested in. 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.120
 Or you can have more information. 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.680
 Nobody's keeping you on this! 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.260
 Watching this video won't make any difference to you. 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.920
 But at least this is a beginner. 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.060
 - Don't ever stop talking about-- 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.420
 I even came to gas: D 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.500
 Of course, this is a joke, but I really want to say my opinion. 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.420
 Life is short 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.140
 And in this short life, you're just as much as you can add to yourself. 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.460
 What makes you who you are. 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.140
 Others can't give you anything. 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.480
 You do anything if you want to do something and you have the key to the lock. 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.600
 If you ask me, it's time to unlock the lock ... 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.000
 You thought you were done? :D 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.940
 No, it's not! 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.040
 Now there's good news! 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.040
 Heavy Architect now has a Twitter channel (account). 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.140
 You can ask the questions you want from this channel and learn about the construction phase of the next video. 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.020
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.680
