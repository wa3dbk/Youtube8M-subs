well I mean by default as you saw the
image<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.990> going<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.260> repeat<00:02:25.590> both<00:02:25.890> left

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
image is just going to repeat both left

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.040 
image is just going to repeat both left
and<00:02:26.550> right<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:26.910> up<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.420> down<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:27.990> to

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
and right and up and down it's going to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.650 
and right and up and down it's going to
title<00:02:28.560> itself<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.910> don't<00:02:29.940> always<00:02:30.240> want

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
title itself so you don't always want

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.020 
title itself so you don't always want
this<00:02:30.840> effect<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.650> order<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.430> make<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.730> not

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
this effect so in order to make it not

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.620 
this effect so in order to make it not
repeat<00:02:33.570> go<00:02:33.930> ahead<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.230> type<00:02:35.810> background<00:02:36.810> -

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
repeat go ahead and type background -

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.600 
repeat go ahead and type background -
repeats<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.959> as<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.410> property<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.430> can

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
repeats and as the property you can

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.360 
repeats and as the property you can
either<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:43.260> think<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:43.739> repeat

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
either have it I think it's like repeat

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.280 
either have it I think it's like repeat
on<00:02:44.580> by<00:02:45.150> default<00:02:45.209> or<00:02:45.720> something<00:02:46.020> anyways

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
on by default or something anyways

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.320 
on by default or something anyways
default<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:47.010> what<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.310> saw<00:02:47.489> if<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.090> don't

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
default is what you saw if you don't

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.620 
default is what you saw if you don't
want<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.720> repeat<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.200> then<00:02:49.290> type<00:02:49.530> no

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
want it to repeat and then type no

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.840 
want it to repeat and then type no
repeats<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.900> check<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.320> out<00:02:52.410> if<00:02:52.620> we<00:02:53.310> save<00:02:53.550> this

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
repeats and check it out if we save this

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.110 
repeats and check it out if we save this

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.660 
going to come across a situation where
you<00:03:45.480> have<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:45.810> image<00:03:46.049> but<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.070> only<00:03:47.250> want<00:03:47.579> to

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
you have this image but you only want to

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.509 
you have this image but you only want to
tie<00:03:47.850> left<00:03:48.630> or<00:03:48.810> right<00:03:49.019> or<00:03:49.170> up<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.680> down<00:03:49.799> so<00:03:50.489> you

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
tie left or right or up and down so you

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.759 
tie left or right or up and down so you
can<00:03:50.880> do<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.209> using<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.720> same<00:03:51.769> background

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
can do that using the same background

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.319 
can do that using the same background
repeat'<00:03:53.220> property<00:03:53.700> but<00:03:53.880> instead<00:03:54.239> of

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
repeat' property but instead of

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.680 
repeat' property but instead of
no-repeat<00:03:54.720> go<00:03:55.530> ahead<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:55.860> change<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.690> repeat

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
no-repeat go ahead and change to repeat

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.890 
no-repeat go ahead and change to repeat
minus<00:03:58.320> X<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.610> is<00:03:59.820> going<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.150> tile<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.690> let

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
minus X and this is going to tile it let

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.520 
minus X and this is going to tile it let
me<00:04:00.959> show<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.280> left<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.489> right<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.989> x<00:04:04.200> axis

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
me show you left and right in the x axis

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.759 
me show you left and right in the x axis
the<00:04:04.980> x<00:04:05.190> axis<00:04:05.730> is<00:04:05.910> left<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.360> right<00:04:06.540> Y<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.290> up<00:04:07.620> and

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
the x axis is left and right Y is up and

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.460 
the x axis is left and right Y is up and
down<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.280> Z<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:09.150> forward<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.870> backward<00:04:10.230> but

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
down and Z is forward and backward but

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.289 
down and Z is forward and backward but
since<00:04:11.370> we're<00:04:11.519> working<00:04:11.549> with<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.940> computer

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
since we're working with a computer

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.090 
since we're working with a computer
screen<00:04:12.510> we<00:04:12.780> don't<00:04:12.930> have<00:04:13.049> Z<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.769> know<00:04:13.889> just

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
screen we don't have Z so you know just

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.069 
screen we don't have Z so you know just
a<00:04:14.190> little<00:04:14.280> tidbit<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.669> information<00:04:14.850> so<00:04:15.810> that's

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
a little tidbit of information so that's

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.759 
a little tidbit of information so that's
how<00:04:16.290> is<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.590> left<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:16.919> right

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
how is it left and right

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.990 
how is it left and right
why<00:04:17.859> if<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.609> repeat<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:20.459> titles<00:04:21.459> up<00:04:21.639> and<00:04:21.819> down

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
why if you repeat it titles up and down

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.270 
why if you repeat it titles up and down
this<00:04:22.930> kind<00:04:23.169> of<00:04:23.199> reminds<00:04:23.590> me<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:24.009> know<00:04:24.039> when

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
this kind of reminds me of you know when

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.040 
this kind of reminds me of you know when
you<00:04:24.430> go<00:04:24.849> to<00:04:24.879> the<00:04:25.060> mall<00:04:25.300> and<00:04:25.690> you<00:04:25.750> put<00:04:25.900> like<00:04:25.990> a

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
you go to the mall and you put like a

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.200 
you go to the mall and you put like a
dollar<00:04:26.349> in<00:04:26.560> those<00:04:26.710> photo<00:04:26.979> booths<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.610> know

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
dollar in those photo booths you know

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.600 
dollar in those photo booths you know
that's<00:04:28.690> what<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:28.960> reminds<00:04:29.259> me<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.590> kind<00:04:30.430> of

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
that's what it reminds me of kind of

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.399 
that's what it reminds me of kind of
freaky<00:04:31.000> seeing<00:04:31.270> me<00:04:31.419> staring<00:04:31.780> at<00:04:31.870> myself<00:04:32.199> but

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:32.409 
freaky seeing me staring at myself but

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.830 
freaky seeing me staring at myself but
anyways<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:33.819> how<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.030> title<00:04:34.479> it<00:04:34.509> up<00:04:34.659> and

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
anyways that is how you title it up and

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.890 
anyways that is how you title it up and
down<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:36.729> last<00:04:37.030> thing<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.599> want<00:04:37.840> to

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
mention is um let's go ahead and put

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.869 
mention is um let's go ahead and put
no-repeat<00:04:43.629> so<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.590> can<00:04:44.860> demonstrate<00:04:45.099> the<00:04:45.580> last

up in the top-left so in order to do
that<00:05:11.380> you<00:05:11.889> need<00:05:12.099> a<00:05:12.159> property<00:05:12.909> called

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
that you need a property called

that you need a property called
background<00:05:15.400> -<00:05:16.530> position<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.949> this<00:05:18.610> lets<00:05:18.940> you

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
background - position and this lets you

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.330 
background - position and this lets you
alter<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:19.960> position<00:05:20.169> of<00:05:20.740> your<00:05:21.069> background

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
alter the position of your background

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.689 
alter the position of your background
image<00:05:21.789> now<00:05:22.659> this<00:05:23.080> takes<00:05:23.289> two<00:05:23.650> parameters<00:05:24.219> the

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
image now this takes two parameters the

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.670 
image now this takes two parameters the
first<00:05:24.729> parameter<00:05:25.389> or<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.229> first<00:05:26.409> piece<00:05:26.650> of

first parameter or the first piece of
information<00:05:26.889> it<00:05:27.520> needs<00:05:27.699> is<00:05:27.880> how<00:05:28.449> far<00:05:28.840> from<00:05:29.139> the

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
information it needs is how far from the

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.770 
information it needs is how far from the
left<00:05:29.560> hand<00:05:29.830> side<00:05:29.979> do<00:05:30.699> you<00:05:30.759> want<00:05:30.819> to<00:05:31.060> move<00:05:31.180> it<00:05:31.389> so

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
left hand side do you want to move it so

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.230 
left hand side do you want to move it so
go<00:05:31.930> ahead<00:05:32.050> and<00:05:32.169> put<00:05:32.500> ten<00:05:32.770> pixels<00:05:33.159> now<00:05:33.909> your

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
go ahead and put ten pixels now your

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.080 
go ahead and put ten pixels now your
image<00:05:34.419> is<00:05:34.750> going<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.139> be<00:05:35.199> shifted<00:05:35.830> ten<00:05:36.639> pixels

image is going to be shifted ten pixels
to<00:05:37.389> the<00:05:37.419> right<00:05:37.509> and<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:39.130> next<00:05:39.490> piece<00:05:39.819> of

to the right and the next piece of

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.209 
to the right and the next piece of
information<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.750> need<00:05:40.930> to<00:05:40.960> give<00:05:41.199> is<00:05:41.409> how<00:05:41.949> far

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
information you need to give is how far

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.370 
information you need to give is how far
from<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.580> top<00:05:43.000> do<00:05:43.509> you<00:05:43.569> want<00:05:43.779> to<00:05:43.870> move<00:05:43.990> it<00:05:44.229> so

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
from the top do you want to move it so

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.409 
from the top do you want to move it so
let's<00:05:44.949> say<00:05:45.069> you<00:05:45.130> want<00:05:45.370> to<00:05:45.490> move<00:05:45.550> it<00:05:45.699> 60<00:05:46.180> pixels

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
let's say you want to move it 60 pixels

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.339 
let's say you want to move it 60 pixels
down<00:05:46.779> so<00:05:47.380> go<00:05:47.620> ahead<00:05:47.710> and<00:05:47.830> write<00:05:47.979> 60<00:05:48.400> pixels<00:05:48.639> and

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
down so go ahead and write 60 pixels and

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.839 
down so go ahead and write 60 pixels and
that's<00:05:50.349> it<00:05:50.590> just<00:05:50.620> save<00:05:51.069> it<00:05:51.099> and<00:05:51.430> see<00:05:51.610> what<00:05:51.729> we

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
that's it just save it and see what we

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:52.290 
that's it just save it and see what we
got

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
got

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.870 
got
so<00:05:52.900> now<00:05:53.199> that<00:05:53.259> we<00:05:53.590> change<00:05:53.919> that<00:05:54.340> background

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
so now that we change that background

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.809 
so now that we change that background
position<00:05:55.419> 10<00:05:55.870> pixels<00:05:56.349> 50<00:05:56.710> pixels<00:05:57.099> it<00:05:57.400> took

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
top left move the 10 pixels to the right

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.279 
top left move the 10 pixels to the right
in<00:06:02.460> 60<00:06:03.460> pixels<00:06:03.849> down<00:06:04.029> or<00:06:04.300> 50<00:06:04.779> I<00:06:04.810> forgot<00:06:05.139> what<00:06:05.259> I

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
in 60 pixels down or 50 I forgot what I

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.610 
in 60 pixels down or 50 I forgot what I
put<00:06:05.610> 60<00:06:06.610> there<00:06:06.789> we<00:06:06.969> go<00:06:07.120> we're<00:06:08.050> saying<00:06:08.259> alright

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
put 60 there we go we're saying alright

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.719 
put 60 there we go we're saying alright
that's<00:06:09.340> pretty<00:06:09.610> cool<00:06:09.759> Bucky<00:06:10.180> but<00:06:10.449> I<00:06:10.719> don't

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
that's pretty cool Bucky but I don't

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.219 
that's pretty cool Bucky but I don't

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
let's say I want something like I want

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.070 
let's say I want something like I want
this<00:06:14.349> picture<00:06:14.560> centered<00:06:15.370> on<00:06:15.550> my<00:06:16.090> webpage<00:06:16.330> but

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
this picture centered on my webpage but

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.450 
this picture centered on my webpage but
I<00:06:17.139> don't<00:06:17.469> know<00:06:17.590> how<00:06:17.770> big<00:06:18.009> their<00:06:18.219> browser

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
I don't know how big their browser

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.700 
I don't know how big their browser
window<00:06:18.940> is<00:06:19.000> going<00:06:19.150> to<00:06:19.240> be<00:06:19.360> so<00:06:20.259> how<00:06:20.529> am<00:06:20.620> I

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
window is going to be so how am I

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.680 
window is going to be so how am I
supposed<00:06:20.949> to<00:06:21.009> guess<00:06:21.219> how<00:06:21.400> many<00:06:21.460> pixels<00:06:22.029> well

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
supposed to guess how many pixels well

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.889 
supposed to guess how many pixels well
lucky<00:06:23.590> for<00:06:23.620> you<00:06:24.039> not<00:06:24.729> only<00:06:25.180> can<00:06:25.389> you<00:06:25.509> do<00:06:25.690> this

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:25.899 
lucky for you not only can you do this

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:28.350 
lucky for you not only can you do this
with<00:06:26.560> pixels<00:06:27.190> but<00:06:27.310> you<00:06:27.460> can<00:06:27.580> also<00:06:27.759> do<00:06:28.089> it<00:06:28.210> as

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
with pixels but you can also do it as

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.020 
with pixels but you can also do it as
percentages<00:06:29.349> so<00:06:29.979> if<00:06:30.250> you<00:06:30.370> want

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
percentages so if you want

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.000 
percentages so if you want
sixty<00:06:31.420> pixels<00:06:31.570> down<00:06:31.990> but<00:06:32.530> you<00:06:32.650> want<00:06:32.860> it

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
sixty pixels down but you want it

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.190 
sixty pixels down but you want it
centered<00:06:33.520> then<00:06:34.030> just<00:06:34.300> go<00:06:34.420> ahead<00:06:34.660> and<00:06:34.840> say<00:06:34.990> all

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
centered then just go ahead and say all

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.770 
centered then just go ahead and say all
right<00:06:35.230> move<00:06:35.920> it<00:06:36.100> fifty<00:06:36.610> percent<00:06:37.090> from<00:06:37.600> the

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
right move it fifty percent from the

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.020 
right move it fifty percent from the
left<00:06:38.020> and<00:06:38.260> this<00:06:38.440> is<00:06:38.650> going<00:06:38.830> to<00:06:38.890> Center<00:06:39.220> it<00:06:39.250> left

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
left and this is going to Center it left

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.630 
left and this is going to Center it left
and<00:06:40.180> right<00:06:40.390> or<00:06:41.340> horizontal<00:06:42.340> you<00:06:42.520> know

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
and right or horizontal you know

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.090 
and right or horizontal you know
whatever<00:06:42.910> so<00:06:43.600> let's<00:06:43.990> go<00:06:44.320> ahead<00:06:44.410> and<00:06:44.710> save<00:06:44.920> this

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
whatever so let's go ahead and save this

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.080 
whatever so let's go ahead and save this
and<00:06:45.310> see<00:06:45.430> what<00:06:45.550> we<00:06:45.670> got

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
and see what we got

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.470 
and see what we got
since<00:06:46.750> it's<00:06:46.960> 50<00:06:47.650> percent<00:06:48.340> to<00:06:48.580> the<00:06:48.910> left<00:06:49.180> that

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480 
since it's 50 percent to the left that

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.450 
since it's 50 percent to the left that
means<00:06:49.690> there's<00:06:50.110> 50<00:06:50.530> percent<00:06:50.950> to<00:06:51.010> the<00:06:51.250> right

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
means there's 50 percent to the right

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.340 
means there's 50 percent to the right
that<00:06:51.940> means<00:06:52.180> your<00:06:52.420> background<00:06:52.840> image<00:06:53.020> is

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
that means your background image is

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.590 
that means your background image is
perfectly<00:06:53.860> centered<00:06:54.250> in<00:06:54.580> the<00:06:55.060> middle<00:06:55.330> of<00:06:55.480> your

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
perfectly centered in the middle of your

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.080 
perfectly centered in the middle of your
website<00:06:56.050> so<00:06:56.290> this<00:06:56.980> is<00:06:57.160> perfectly<00:06:57.640> centered

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
website so this is perfectly centered

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.470 
website so this is perfectly centered
left<00:06:58.300> and<00:06:58.540> right<00:06:58.750> and<00:06:59.050> it's<00:06:59.830> also<00:07:00.130> down<00:07:00.610> 60

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.480 
left and right and it's also down 60

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.900 
left and right and it's also down 60
pixels<00:07:01.690> so<00:07:02.530> that<00:07:02.560> is<00:07:03.130> pretty<00:07:03.310> much<00:07:03.460> all<00:07:03.700> you

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910 
pixels so that is pretty much all you

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.220 
pixels so that is pretty much all you
need<00:07:03.940> to<00:07:04.210> know<00:07:04.390> with<00:07:04.780> working<00:07:05.080> with

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
need to know with working with

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.200 
need to know with working with
background<00:07:05.800> images<00:07:06.250> um

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
background images um

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.090 
background images um
again<00:07:07.870> there's<00:07:08.110> probably<00:07:08.410> some<00:07:08.620> more<00:07:08.860> but

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100 
again there's probably some more but

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.250 
again there's probably some more but
this<00:07:09.250> is<00:07:09.310> pretty<00:07:09.940> much<00:07:10.030> the<00:07:10.240> core<00:07:10.570> foundation

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.260 
this is pretty much the core foundation

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.710 
this is pretty much the core foundation
of<00:07:11.470> working<00:07:12.310> with<00:07:12.460> background<00:07:12.850> images<00:07:13.240> so<00:07:13.480> if

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 
of working with background images so if

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.660 
of working with background images so if
you<00:07:13.960> understand<00:07:14.620> this<00:07:14.830> then<00:07:15.160> you<00:07:15.370> should<00:07:15.400> be

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.670 
you understand this then you should be

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.790 
you understand this then you should be
good<00:07:15.820> to<00:07:15.910> go<00:07:16.000> from<00:07:16.240> now<00:07:16.420> on<00:07:16.570> so<00:07:16.810> anyways<00:07:17.140> that's

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
good to go from now on so anyways that's

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.560 
good to go from now on so anyways that's
