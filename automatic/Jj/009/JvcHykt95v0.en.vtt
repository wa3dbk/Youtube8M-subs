00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
little box of them here I also started

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.310

thing<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.620> had<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.980> was<00:00:41.370> Mel<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.210> my<00:00:42.329> chop<00:00:42.800> but

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
thing I had to do was Mel up my chop but

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860 
thing I had to do was Mel up my chop but
the<00:00:44.399> stock<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:45.030> playing<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.360> using<00:00:45.600> from<00:00:45.750> my

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the stock I was playing on using from my

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.410 
the stock I was playing on using from my
chop<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> few<00:00:46.770> inches<00:00:46.800> too<00:00:47.340> short<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
chop was a few inches too short so I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
chop was a few inches too short so I
have<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.750> something<00:00:49.079> kind<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.350> creative<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
have to do something kind of creative to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.639 
have to do something kind of creative to
lengthen<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.879> when<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.320> ended<00:00:52.559> up

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
