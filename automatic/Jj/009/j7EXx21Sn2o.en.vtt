00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
the back most of it is gone because I

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.090

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
horrible so I ended up cutting a whole

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.230 
horrible so I ended up cutting a whole
lot<00:01:32.530> of<00:01:32.680> analogies<00:01:33.250> you<00:01:33.460> know<00:01:33.550> pulled<00:01:33.850> my<00:01:34.030> hair

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
up and just cut a lot of it off the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.590 
up and just cut a lot of it off the
gentle<00:01:39.130> wave<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:39.760> worked<00:01:40.000> out<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:40.390> much<00:01:40.450> better

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
gentle wave it worked out so much better

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.490 
gentle wave it worked out so much better
but<00:01:41.410> because<00:01:41.950> my<00:01:42.910> hair<00:01:43.270> was<00:01:43.300> all<00:01:43.840> together

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
but because my hair was all together

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.990 
but because my hair was all together
with<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.340> loose<00:01:45.820> deep<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.690> UM<00:01:48.000> gentle

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
with the loose deep and the UM gentle

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.510 
with the loose deep and the UM gentle
wave<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.770> just<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:53.170> hangul<00:01:53.530> DUP<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:53.860> bad<00:01:54.160> I

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
wave it just it it's hangul DUP so bad I

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.090 
wave it just it it's hangul DUP so bad I
tried<00:01:55.000> different<00:01:55.360> things<00:01:56.260> and<00:01:56.650> I<00:01:56.740> think<00:01:56.770> they

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
tried different things and I think they

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.350 
tried different things and I think they
kind<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:57.520> helped<00:01:58.030> with<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.450> tangling<00:01:59.280> I<00:02:00.360> need

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360

adding any you know products to
synthetic<00:02:06.790> hair<00:02:07.120> it<00:02:07.330> just<00:02:07.930> works<00:02:08.140> better<00:02:08.349> when

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
synthetic hair it just works better when

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.250 
synthetic hair it just works better when
you<00:02:08.649> leave<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.039> alone<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:10.650> tried<00:02:11.910> using<00:02:12.910> a

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
you leave it alone I tried using a

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.330

log<00:02:23.319> they<00:02:23.530> came<00:02:23.769> out<00:02:23.980> with<00:02:24.040> normally<00:02:24.790> when<00:02:24.970> I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
log they came out with normally when I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.080 
log they came out with normally when I
put<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:27.060> weave<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.750> works<00:02:29.500> wonders<00:02:30.489> so<00:02:31.060> I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
put it in weave it works wonders so I

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.670 
put it in weave it works wonders so I
thought<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.569> would<00:02:31.660> do<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.930> same<00:02:32.140> thing<00:02:32.470> with

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
thought it would do the same thing with

thought it would do the same thing with
this<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:34.360> made<00:02:35.140> me<00:02:35.410> hear<00:02:35.950> worse<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:37.120> was<00:02:37.209> like

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
this it made me hear worse it was like

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.910 
this it made me hear worse it was like
the<00:02:37.569> worst<00:02:37.959> decision<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.530> could<00:02:38.680> have<00:02:38.709> ever

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
the worst decision I could have ever

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.860 
the worst decision I could have ever
made<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:40.530> from<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.799> I<00:02:42.310> tried<00:02:42.819> you<00:02:43.269> know<00:02:43.299> water

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
made so from that I tried you know water

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.780 
made so from that I tried you know water
and<00:02:45.900> images<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.290> just<00:02:47.560> went<00:02:47.799> downhill<00:02:48.010> sand

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
and images it just went downhill sand

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.920 
and images it just went downhill sand
from<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.780> start<00:02:50.140> of<00:02:50.440> putting<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:50.980> UM<00:02:51.930> miracle
