00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
much longer I'll start stripping the

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.830 
much longer I'll start stripping the
motor<00:03:58.630> probably<00:03:59.050> within<00:03:59.800> the<00:03:59.920> next<00:04:00.010> few<00:04:00.340> days

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
motor probably within the next few days

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.199 
motor probably within the next few days
stop<00:04:01.840> falling<00:04:02.170> at<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.380> end<00:04:02.550> but<00:04:03.550> yeah<00:04:03.760> got<00:04:03.970> got

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
stop falling at the end but yeah got got

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.910 
stop falling at the end but yeah got got
a<00:04:04.240> few<00:04:04.480> parts<00:04:04.780> ready<00:04:04.990> to<00:04:05.170> go<00:04:05.290> for<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.709> so

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
a few parts ready to go for it so

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.949 
a few parts ready to go for it so
hopefully<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.490> shouldn't<00:04:06.760> be<00:04:06.820> too<00:04:06.970> long<00:04:07.000> and

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
hopefully it shouldn't be too long and

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.590 
hopefully it shouldn't be too long and
it<00:04:08.110> should<00:04:08.350> be<00:04:08.380> built<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:09.209> back<00:04:10.209> in<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.390> car

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
it should be built and back in the car

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.940 
it should be built and back in the car
but<00:04:10.780> i'll<00:04:10.900> make<00:04:11.050> another<00:04:11.170> video<00:04:11.530> as<00:04:11.800> I'm

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
but i'll make another video as I'm

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.040 
but i'll make another video as I'm
pulling<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.220> motor<00:04:12.400> down<00:04:12.730> showing<00:04:13.690> you<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:13.840> few

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
pulling the motor down showing you a few

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.039 
pulling the motor down showing you a few
things<00:04:14.080> there<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:15.270> then<00:04:16.270> a<00:04:16.299> few<00:04:16.540> more<00:04:16.720> videos

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
things there and then a few more videos

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.630 
things there and then a few more videos
along<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.470> way<00:04:17.590> as<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:17.890> motor<00:04:18.220> gets<00:04:18.370> put<00:04:18.609> back

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
along the way as a motor gets put back

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.010 
along the way as a motor gets put back
together<00:04:18.880> as<00:04:19.180> somebody<00:04:19.450> gets<00:04:19.630> put<00:04:19.780> back<00:04:19.810> in

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
together as somebody gets put back in

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.260 
together as somebody gets put back in
the<00:04:20.049> car<00:04:20.320> as<00:04:20.590> it<00:04:21.190> goes<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.489> get<00:04:21.640> tuned<00:04:21.910> so

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
the car as it goes to get tuned so

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.700 
the car as it goes to get tuned so
there'll<00:04:22.479> be<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:22.600> few<00:04:22.780> more<00:04:23.110> videos<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:23.500> come

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
there'll be a few more videos to come

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.570 
there'll be a few more videos to come
back

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580
