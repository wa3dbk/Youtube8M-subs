00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120 
this is part two this is a sidewalk we

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.080 
this is part two this is a sidewalk we
just<00:00:07.359> finished<00:00:07.750> it's<00:00:08.530> a<00:00:08.680> flow<00:00:08.920> finish<00:00:09.430> just

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
just finished it's a flow finish just

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.699 
just finished it's a flow finish just
might<00:00:10.299> give<00:00:10.480> you<00:00:10.570> some<00:00:10.750> other<00:00:10.840> ideas<00:00:10.959> on<00:00:11.620> the

might give you some other ideas on the

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:18.570 
might give you some other ideas on the
way<00:00:11.860> we<00:00:12.610> go<00:00:16.800> we're<00:00:17.800> digging<00:00:17.949> out<00:00:18.220> for<00:00:18.490> the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
way we go we're digging out for the

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:29.620 
way we go we're digging out for the
sidewalk

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.900 

four<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> half<00:00:30.810> inches<00:00:34.760> little<00:00:35.760> big

four and a half inches little big

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.729 
four and a half inches little big
difference<00:00:36.420> when<00:00:36.780> you're<00:00:36.870> four<00:00:37.140> little<00:00:37.440> slabs

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
difference when you're four little slabs

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.910 
difference when you're four little slabs
in<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> big<00:00:38.250> slab

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
in a big slab

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.590 
in a big slab
that<00:00:40.309> they<00:00:40.489> use<00:00:40.730> it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
parts okay so we've got our edge marks

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.669 
parts okay so we've got our edge marks
and<00:00:59.469> already<00:01:00.370> this<00:01:00.609> is<00:01:00.820> soon<00:01:01.089> after<00:01:01.719> as<00:01:02.440> soon

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.809 
so because of all the salt in
Pennsylvania<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:05.840> use<00:04:06.840> sealers<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.819> wait

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
Pennsylvania I use sealers and wait

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.460 
Pennsylvania I use sealers and wait
about<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> month<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.690> I'll<00:04:09.750> put<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:09.989> sealer<00:04:10.349> on

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
about a month and I'll put a sealer on

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.860 
about a month and I'll put a sealer on
it<00:04:13.129> well<00:04:14.129> this<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:15.000> seal<00:04:15.239> or<00:04:15.390> use<00:04:15.599> that

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
it well this is the seal or use that

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.890 
it well this is the seal or use that
it's<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.109> concrete<00:04:16.769> cure<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:17.970> seal<00:04:18.539> which

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
it's a concrete cure and seal which

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.080 
it's a concrete cure and seal which
means<00:04:19.199> you<00:04:19.889> could<00:04:20.010> spray<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.489> on<00:04:20.609> as<00:04:20.789> soon<00:04:20.970> as

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
means you could spray it on as soon as

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.080 
means you could spray it on as soon as
the<00:04:21.209> concrete<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.870> set<00:04:22.199> up<00:04:22.850> instead<00:04:23.850> of<00:04:23.910> using

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
the concrete is set up instead of using

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.230 
the concrete is set up instead of using
plastic<00:04:24.389> some<00:04:24.990> contractors<00:04:25.710> do<00:04:25.949> that

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
plastic some contractors do that

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.480 
plastic some contractors do that
everybody's<00:04:27.240> got<00:04:27.389> a<00:04:27.419> different<00:04:27.630> opinion

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
everybody's got a different opinion

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.029 
everybody's got a different opinion
depends<00:04:29.490> on<00:04:29.610> where<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:29.940> live<00:04:30.260> but<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.770> salt

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
depends on where you live but the salt

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.689 
depends on where you live but the salt
in<00:04:32.220> Pennsylvania<00:04:32.940> is<00:04:33.180> killing<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.900> concrete

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
in Pennsylvania is killing the concrete

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.490 
in Pennsylvania is killing the concrete
so<00:04:35.699> a<00:04:35.729> lot<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.150> guys<00:04:36.300> are<00:04:36.539> starting<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:36.960> lean

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
so a lot of guys are starting to lean

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.000 
so a lot of guys are starting to lean
towards<00:04:37.919> this<00:04:38.160> but<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:39.380> think<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.500> have<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.860> ask

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
towards this but I think you have to ask

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.279 
towards this but I think you have to ask
the<00:04:41.729> locals<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.389> supply<00:04:42.750> companies

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
the locals and the supply companies

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.379 
the locals and the supply companies
because<00:04:43.949> there's<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.190> lot<00:04:44.430> of<00:04:44.580> pros<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:44.850> cons

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
because there's a lot of pros and cons

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.719 
because there's a lot of pros and cons
to<00:04:45.690> sealers<00:04:46.169> it<00:04:46.590> all<00:04:46.740> depends<00:04:47.220> on<00:04:47.310> what<00:04:47.580> you're

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
to sealers it all depends on what you're

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.760 
to sealers it all depends on what you're
doing
