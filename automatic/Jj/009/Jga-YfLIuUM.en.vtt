00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
this is an acceptable way to play if you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.730 
this is an acceptable way to play if you
don't<00:01:38.880> know<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> maps<00:01:39.570> no<00:01:39.840> don't<00:01:40.229> don't<00:01:40.560> play

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
don't know the maps no don't don't play

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.590 
don't know the maps no don't don't play
like<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.490> don't<00:01:41.670> know<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.360> map

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
like this if you don't know it the map

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.380 
like this if you don't know it the map
run<00:01:43.170> around<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.680> get<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.130> know<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.149> you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
run around it get to know it so then you

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.210 
run around it get to know it so then you
