 let's take a little moisture and the 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.909
 let's go through all our trail 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.570
 to eliminate all excess dust 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.570
 that can remain 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.830
 I'm going to take a beautiful and beautiful prime air 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.450
 that will help me hide all the 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.450
 reliefs that my skin has 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.340
 I'm going to use one I lived with the little color 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.960
 of nails already know if you do not have 0 not you 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.200
 worry because you can use some 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.270
 Let it be so very soft 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.380
 not so thick is for example is in 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.340
 gel form is his 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 the army and we're going to dilute everything very 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.520
 all right 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.740
 I'm going to put on a concealer are my 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.060
 dark circles doing it a little bit down 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.740
 so that he loses a bit with 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.240
 what are my cheeks and do not see 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.240
 like everything else in this area 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.350
 under a black robe that I'm going to put on 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.950
 5 in the tank and I'm going to pull it towards 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.950
 ahead 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.360
 I'm going to pull forward but trying 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.890
 to emphasize in this area 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.350
 me forever as I left the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.480
 different eyes but total that you 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.300
 are the most similar possible I 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.600
 because it's called custom since he visited coffee 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.140
 of the brand and I'm going to delineate my little eyes 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.160
 for the external part with my crime I'm going to 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.160
 leave it little 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.980
 here with a liner tip 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.850
 felt here in the corner I acedo a 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.620
 hairline to be here is with what is going to be 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.610
 you can put masquin tape here but 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.350
 I do not do it 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.730
 and here where it ends, you move away 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.730
 here you are going to draw a hairline 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.099
 without fear 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.650
 that did not work out 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.909
 you go back to do all I'll fix 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.819
 I'm going to do it a little more 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.010
 version of this area pretty much a 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.280
 little bit above half we're going to 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.280
 load 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.879
 and this hairline something else or blur to 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.579
 to fill in and I'm not an expert in 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:43.340
 eyeliner then do not worry a 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:47.170
 joke is to have fun if all stained 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.170
 does not know how to have fun 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.950
 I have love 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.340
 I really like it 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.739
 and if everything beautiful I do not like we are going to 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.959
 take a black eyeliner and I'll 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.620
 delineate what is the internal part to 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.620
 you my teddy 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.440
 with the same eyeliner I'm going to lift 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.949
 a little bit and I'm going to outline the part 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.949
 internal 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.039
 at this moment I'm going to tilt the 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.930
 eyelashes with a spoon I'm going to take a 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.130
 green color pistache I'm going to make a 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.130
 old man and I will place it in the part 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.130
 internal 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.310
 I'm going to put a mascara I 'm going to put it 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.690
 in all my eyelashes we are going to have a 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.690
 little bit of dust almost with the brush 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.110
 there are low 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:05.160
 to the Angels 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.520
 and rossi is here in our compete 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.650
 redondito 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.220
 Victor degrees 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.500
 it's a little bit that it's one buttock and another 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.990
 mark some we have bigger and 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.910
 another more truth and it's ok I want to get 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.259
 an illuminator but you have no illuminator 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.590
 What are you going to do ? 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:28.789
 show a very villous shady like 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.789
 this one we are going to put here 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.090
 and the analysis 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.870
 little joke is that of light 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.690
 light reflections and reflections that are noticeable 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:50.530
 very little or whatever you notice a 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:53.650
 stain and golden not only that it looks like 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.930
 a reflection so when you turn around and you 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.850
 pointed out that it looks very blurred all 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.360
 the colors on your face very blurred 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.360
 OK 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.400
 I'm going to use a crayon I owed them 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.180
 point not pink and I'll put it in the 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.180
 part of the center 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.880
 is so that my lips do not look very 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:23.500
 flat because it's a very matte color a 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.500
 little bit of golden shadow here 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:30.550
 and eyebrows 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.550
 well combed 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.620
 with a little bit of whit 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.990
 there is face 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.730
