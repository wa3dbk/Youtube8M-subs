in<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> off-road<00:00:22.650> industry<00:00:23.189> because<00:00:23.730> it's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
in the off-road industry because it's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.939

droop<00:00:48.350> it<00:00:49.350> would<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.649> bound<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.980> pretty

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
droop it would be bound up pretty

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010 
droop it would be bound up pretty
heavily<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:51.000> what<00:00:51.300> we're<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:51.989> a

and now we're going to remove this
little<00:00:57.930> crossmember<00:00:58.710> next<00:00:59.430> frame<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> other

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
little crossmember next frame the other

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.450 
little crossmember next frame the other
frame<00:01:00.329> rail<00:01:00.539> there's<00:01:00.989> only<00:01:01.170> three<00:01:01.469> bolts<00:01:01.770> so

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
frame rail there's only three bolts so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.100 
frame rail there's only three bolts so
just<00:01:02.699> back<00:01:02.850> those<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.629> drop<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
just back those out and drop the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.050 
just back those out and drop the
crossmember<00:01:04.559> down<00:01:04.739> set<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.400> aside<00:01:05.489> let's<00:01:05.939> get

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
crossmember down set it aside let's get

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.300 
crossmember down set it aside let's get
it<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> way<00:01:06.540> our<00:01:07.530> next<00:01:07.890> step<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.280> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it out of the way our next step is to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.969 
it out of the way our next step is to
loosen<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.909> clamp<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.260> coupler<00:01:10.680> where

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
loosen this clamp that's a coupler where

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.370 
loosen this clamp that's a coupler where
the<00:01:11.100> two<00:01:11.250> pipes<00:01:11.490> come<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> now<00:01:13.110> he's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the two pipes come into one and now he's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.620 
the two pipes come into one and now he's
removing<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.040> exhaust<00:01:14.340> stop<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.240> that's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
removing the exhaust stop now that's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.170 
removing the exhaust stop now that's
used<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.290> manufacturing<00:01:16.920> process<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
used in the manufacturing process so it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.109 
used in the manufacturing process so it
only<00:01:18.299> lets<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> pipe<00:01:18.900> slide<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.439> far<00:01:19.970> now<00:01:20.970> with

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
only lets the pipe slide so far now with

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.880 
only lets the pipe slide so far now with
that<00:01:21.240> little<00:01:21.479> stop<00:01:21.840> off<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.650> exhaust

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that little stop off and the exhaust

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.340 
that little stop off and the exhaust
clamps<00:01:23.310> loose<00:01:23.729> we're<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> remove<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
clamps loose we're going to remove the

next step now once you start installing
these<00:02:14.870> spacers<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.620> don't<00:02:15.800> have<00:02:15.950> to

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
these spacers you don't have to

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.170 
these spacers you don't have to
immediately<00:02:16.220> put<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:16.790> bolts<00:02:17.060> because

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
immediately put in bolts because

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.150 
immediately put in bolts because
leverage<00:02:17.569> will<00:02:17.780> hold<00:02:17.959> them<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.170> place<00:02:18.200> there

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
leverage will hold them in place there

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
now that both spacers are in place we're

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.970 
now that both spacers are in place we're
going<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.840> install<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.319> bolts<00:02:27.680> through<00:02:27.860> the

going to install the bolts through the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
going to install the bolts through the
flanges<00:02:29.080> now<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:31.069> install<00:02:31.280> these<00:02:31.519> bolts<00:02:31.880> we

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
flanges now to install these bolts we

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.460 
flanges now to install these bolts we
don't<00:02:32.180> throw<00:02:32.390> an<00:02:32.480> impact<00:02:32.840> wrench<00:02:33.019> or<00:02:33.230> socket
