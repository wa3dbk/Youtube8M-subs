00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.700 
days because I normally go and visit him
anyway<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.619> more

anyway and we just go to the one or more

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.260 
anyway and we just go to the one or more
mountain<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.430> was<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> good<00:01:11.700> day<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.119> also

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
mountain and it was a good day we also

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.429 
mountain and it was a good day we also
stopped<00:01:12.630> off<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.780> Birmingham<00:01:13.290> because

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
stopped off in Birmingham because

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.050 
stopped off in Birmingham because
Birmingham<00:01:14.159> set<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> way<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
Birmingham set on the way you have to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.210 
Birmingham set on the way you have to
change<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.750> Birmingham<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.590> get<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> train<00:01:17.189> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
change at Birmingham to get the train to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.560 
change at Birmingham to get the train to
Wolverhampton<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.420> made<00:01:18.540> sense

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
Wolverhampton so it just made sense

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
Wolverhampton so it just made sense
stopped<00:01:19.290> off<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.439> Birmingham<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.130> had<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
stopped off in Birmingham and we had a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.620 
stopped off in Birmingham and we had a
little<00:01:20.400> look<00:01:20.580> around<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.909> shopping<00:01:21.090> center

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
little look around the shopping center

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.330 
little look around the shopping center
and<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.170> weren't<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.470> wagon<00:01:22.830> mummers<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and it weren't for wagon mummers and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.340 
and it weren't for wagon mummers and
then<00:01:23.909> because<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.390> December<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:25.110> all

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
then because it was in December it's all

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.080 
then because it was in December it's all
