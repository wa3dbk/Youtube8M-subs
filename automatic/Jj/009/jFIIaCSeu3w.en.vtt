00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.080
 hello in this tutorial I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.910
 how can we easily clean a 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.240
 bottle is to remove the label 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.130
 so that we stay like this because sometimes 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.900
 when we take it off we reach 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.960
 get these waste that are here from 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.480
 paper and with glue and sometimes it's very 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.070
 difficult because removing it and now that 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.110
 we make him be doing this 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.259
 way we are left scratched what is 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.540
 the plastic and sometimes there are crafts 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.820
 in which we need completely 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.870
 well the bottle that is most careful 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.489
 possible 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.170
 Well, I'll show you then 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.260
 how come I do it first we go 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.490
 to do is let's pour a little bit of 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.430
 hot water inside our bottle 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.980
 and we're going to leave it around 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.770
 minute in this position that the glue 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.190
 stay down here so that it is what 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.410
 hot there and what follows is let's go with 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.100
 the scissors to cut this part 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.100
 In the label 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.230
 we detach it like that and now it's just 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.070
 let's go calando little by little for 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.070
 it off 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.479
 what was left was very minimal that this if 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:30.829
 we can remove it like that with our finger 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.829
 without mistreating the bottle 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.990
 and well look and nothing else what we 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.290
 is is now this is seen here still 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.030
 the glue alcohol sometimes because I have 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.160
 said that they do not know how it is that as 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.940
 remove it good for that we're going to 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:53.370
 need a piece of paper and we can 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.370
 apply little baby oil 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.040
 well if they do not have baby oil 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.500
 can apply tantito cooking oil 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.240
 also only that I use this already 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.510
 that cooking oil smells like a 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.880
 little bit like fat now we're going to 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.490
 put our bottle so the water 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.530
 hot follow in what is the glue 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.530
 and we are going to start cleaning like this 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.780
 here is a bit that we were left 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.780
 label 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.480
 we remove it like this 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.010
 and well look now if we have already left 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.800
 completely clean without any trace 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.770
 of glue and completely careful 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.780
 without having good scratches I hope 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.420
 let this simple tip serve them so that 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.340
 stay in their crafts better and more 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.440
 forward we will make one where we are going to 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.720
 need precisely that our 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.300
 bottle is perfectly well 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.700
 spic best to make it look good 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.150
 Well, see you in the next tutorial 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.150
 see you later
