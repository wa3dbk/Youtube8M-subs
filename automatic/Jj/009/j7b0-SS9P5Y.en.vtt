him to modern American life like a
modern<00:02:43.070> but<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.460> do<00:02:44.640> think<00:02:44.910> he<00:02:45.000> can<00:02:45.150> pitch

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.700 
modern but but you do think he can pitch
right<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.660> mean<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.990> know<00:02:46.110> pitching<00:02:46.350> when<00:02:46.620> you

see<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.010> yeah<00:02:47.570> I<00:02:48.570> think<00:02:48.630> he<00:02:49.110> can<00:02:49.320> pitch<00:02:49.830> dirty

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.550 

and<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:54.000> think<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.870> know<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.260> big<00:02:55.530> thing

and I think that you know the big thing

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.410 
and I think that you know the big thing
with<00:02:56.070> him<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.910> he<00:02:56.970> doesn't<00:02:57.300> become

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
with him is just that he doesn't become

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.100 
with him is just that he doesn't become
