00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
surprised that one of the judges had the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.090 
surprised that one of the judges had the

last five rounds forked CDs I thought

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.160 
last five rounds forked CDs I thought
Juan<00:02:42.280> Diaz<00:02:42.580> did<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.790> very<00:02:42.940> good<00:02:43.209> job<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.750> split

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
Juan Diaz did a very good job a split

Juan Diaz did a very good job a split
decision<00:02:44.290> went<00:02:44.770> look<00:02:45.010> before<00:02:45.850> before<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.330> start

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
decision went look before before I start

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.850

attacking<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.610> officials<00:02:49.120> let<00:02:49.720> me<00:02:49.840> say<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.680> is

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
attacking the officials let me say it is

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.729 
attacking the officials let me say it is
possible<00:02:51.190> that<00:02:51.760> sitting<00:02:52.330> ringside<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:53.410> three

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
possible that sitting ringside the three

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.280 
possible that sitting ringside the three
of<00:02:53.860> us<00:02:54.010> with<00:02:54.580> Harold<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.090> four<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.480> us<00:02:55.600> fell

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
of us with Harold the four of us fell

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.830 
of us with Harold the four of us fell
into<00:02:56.650> group<00:02:56.950> think<00:02:57.340> it's<00:02:57.970> possible<00:02:58.570> that<00:02:58.630> we

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
into group think it's possible that we

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.390 
into group think it's possible that we
all<00:02:58.989> start<00:02:59.260> agreeing<00:02:59.590> with<00:02:59.770> each<00:02:59.830> other<00:03:00.190> and

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
all start agreeing with each other and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.160 
all start agreeing with each other and
we<00:03:00.520> think<00:03:00.760> we're<00:03:00.940> seeing<00:03:01.150> something<00:03:01.540> that

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
we think we're seeing something that

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.080 
we think we're seeing something that
maybe<00:03:02.410> isn't<00:03:02.590> taking<00:03:03.010> place<00:03:03.250> it's<00:03:03.880> also

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
maybe isn't taking place it's also

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.680 
maybe isn't taking place it's also
possible<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.860> hometown<00:03:06.340> crowd

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
possible that the hometown crowd

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.260 
possible that the hometown crowd
influences<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.810> way<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:07.989> see<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.320> fight<00:03:08.650> or

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
influences the way you see a fight or

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.850 
influences the way you see a fight or
that<00:03:10.270> you<00:03:10.540> know<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.810> reason<00:03:11.170> judges<00:03:11.590> are<00:03:11.739> on

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
that you know the reason judges are on

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.920 
that you know the reason judges are on
three<00:03:12.370> different<00:03:12.640> sides<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.480> Ring<00:03:13.690> is

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
three different sides of the Ring is

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.810 
three different sides of the Ring is
because<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:14.560> get<00:03:14.769> different<00:03:15.040> angles<00:03:15.400> from

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
because you get different angles from

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.090 
because you get different angles from
different<00:03:16.239> sides<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.750> Ring<00:03:16.930> maybe<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:17.890> need

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
different sides of the Ring maybe I need

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.800 
different sides of the Ring maybe I need
to<00:03:18.220> go<00:03:18.370> back<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.820> watch<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.209> fight<00:03:19.390> on<00:03:19.420> tape

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
to go back and watch the fight on tape

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.400 
to go back and watch the fight on tape
and<00:03:20.050> rescore<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.769> that<00:03:21.730> said<00:03:22.209> that's<00:03:23.050> one<00:03:23.290> of

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
and rescore it that said that's one of

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.490 
and rescore it that said that's one of
the<00:03:23.500> worst<00:03:23.709> jobs<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.489> scoring<00:03:24.970> I've<00:03:25.390> ever<00:03:25.900> seen

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
the worst jobs of scoring I've ever seen

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.000 
the worst jobs of scoring I've ever seen
it<00:03:27.280> goes<00:03:27.550> beyond<00:03:28.030> just<00:03:28.239> bad<00:03:29.140> scoring<00:03:29.830> and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
it goes beyond just bad scoring and

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.400 
it goes beyond just bad scoring and
makes<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.610> question<00:03:30.940> whether<00:03:31.900> there<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.380> a

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
makes you question whether there is a

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.590 
makes you question whether there is a
corrupting<00:03:33.100> influence<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.239> scoring

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
corrupting influence in the scoring

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.009 
corrupting influence in the scoring
based<00:03:35.350> on<00:03:35.620> what<00:03:35.830> we<00:03:36.040> just<00:03:36.310> saw<00:03:36.640> it's<00:03:37.480> hard<00:03:37.810> to

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
based on what we just saw it's hard to

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.180 
based on what we just saw it's hard to
imagine<00:03:38.350> how<00:03:39.250> anyone<00:03:39.280> could

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
imagine how anyone could

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.850 
imagine how anyone could
for<00:03:40.660> seven<00:03:41.660> rounds<00:03:42.080> of<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.380> fight<00:03:42.650> for

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
for seven rounds of that fight for

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.670 
for seven rounds of that fight for
Michael<00:03:43.160> Katz<00:03:43.370> CDs<00:03:43.850> were<00:03:44.420> even<00:03:44.840> five<00:03:45.170> rounds

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
Michael Katz CDs were even five rounds

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.500 
Michael Katz CDs were even five rounds
of<00:03:45.770> that<00:03:45.920> fight<00:03:46.220> for<00:03:46.460> Michael<00:03:46.730> Katz<00:03:46.910> CDs<00:03:47.300> even

of that fight for Michael Katz CDs even

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.440 
of that fight for Michael Katz CDs even
the<00:03:48.230> score<00:03:48.530> cards<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:49.130> were<00:03:49.250> turned<00:03:49.490> in<00:03:49.820> for

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
the score cards that were turned in for

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.700 
the score cards that were turned in for
Diaz<00:03:50.960> seemed<00:03:51.800> way<00:03:52.640> too<00:03:52.670> close<00:03:53.330> for<00:03:53.630> me<00:03:53.810> in<00:03:54.020> fact

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
Diaz seemed way too close for me in fact

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.980 
Diaz seemed way too close for me in fact
if<00:03:55.490> you<00:03:55.730> really<00:03:56.120> want<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.420> think<00:03:56.600> about<00:03:56.840> how

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
if you really want to think about how

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.040 
if you really want to think about how
lopsided<00:03:57.710> the<00:03:57.800> fight<00:03:58.010> was<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.840> anticipated<00:03:59.840> we

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
lopsided the fight was I anticipated we
