00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.300
 ah 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.170
 therefore 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.390
 hello how about friends and welcome to 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.220

 back with magic the gathering and we're 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.989
 back with economy and this economy 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.430
 It's not like the others but what I'm going 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.130
 to do is a miniseries within this 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.080
 series that will go from the most letters 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.790
 relevant to the essentials of each 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.430
 one of the formats and today we are with a 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.140
 mother and let's start with cars 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.379
 cars is a card that is played in 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.900
 decks how hyun joong discard tokens to 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.229
 times and in voice benches and affinity 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.820
 and good for this amount of copies that 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.950
 we want in the format I recommend that 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.600
 have 4 x in your collection the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.130
 we can get in a pretty way 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.050
 cheap taking the one from the collection of 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.110
 heteros of the last reissue with a 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.660
 minimum price of 13 euros and a half of 15 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.220
 it's pretty well priced and what's said 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.250
 I recommend that you have four of yours 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.810
 collection we are going to go to the titan of 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.070
 this format that is the thermo oil and that 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.230
 unfortunately I touch recommend that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.170
 you have four collection 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.250
 I have recommended I have put here the edition 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.890
 old that is the cheapest and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.780
 I recommend that what you buy 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.570
 very heavy the cheaper and more 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.000
 heavy better is worth it friends that's 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.470
 worth and if you buy mobile spreads that 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.810
 has a rajas to a medium and that is not 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.540
 see the face that is only in cost and 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.180
 name and in the damage to the attributes 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.710
 that I'm already missing that's friends that's the 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.060
 best buy that you can do the best 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.840
 Christmas gift that you can do to 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.850
 self 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.710
 to buy them 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.200
 if you are going to take the 4 buy the very 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.700
 cheap because I really have them foley 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.140
 and such is only good you can do when 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.640
 you have an immense collection if you are 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.490
 commenting it is better that follow is a play 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.800
 set normalito and you have palante but 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.650
 I have to recommend that you have it 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.980
 let's go from grandfather I forgot to say 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.960
 what is played is water in almost all the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.720
 format or I have gone up nothing ago 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.700
 a video of giving mutual so imagine the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.700
 rest is that great game yum yum 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.670
 tribal zoo 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.079
 nobody makes all decks that are penn 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.370
 and aggressive where you can have something of 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.810
 You will also have a hole 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.980
 stay for legacy also means that very 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.389
 alright 95 euros you see here has some 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.940
 some sellers can put it in 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.070
 plan 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.260
 with tear and burst as I have 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.960
 said to 5 out there but good the price 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.670
 minimum minimum would be 90 euros and a half 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:05.750
 of 110 quite expensive we are going to spend another 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.860
 blue letter a blue letter of this 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.270
 format that is modern that all 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.950
 we know that a click is sold and the 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.920
 we can see in decks how they can be 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.650
 fairies and control decks and decks 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.210
 flash mallets time as root and in 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.920
 enough benches then we can 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.740
 see on bellver benches in 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.080
 ower to the best sprinter 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.490
 I could see and it's very very good letter of 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.510
 pretty control 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.100
 let's say skill I do not know how to call him 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.240
 it requires quite a lot of the player's skin 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.819
 so say it because you have to play a 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.640
 concrete phase but good 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.909
 it is a letter that the press to play and 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.349
 others is very very useful and what I said 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.650
 I recommend that you have between two 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.060
 interests because 4 is not going anywhere and 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.379
 we can get it from this collection 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.109
 which is ' the dwelling that is the first 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:56.379
 where it came out for a minimum of 39 38 euros 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.420
 and by a medium of 43 euros very good 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.180
 between two and three copies we already go to 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.049
 light 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.989
 owner and mistress of this format and according to 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.750
 decks like hyung jung discard tokens to 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.579
 Sometimes it is also played in four colors 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.620
 gifs that is called just reflect the mallet 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.500
 and we can get it for a 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.930
 minimum price of 48 to 54 euros yo 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.509
 I recommend to always have as much 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.370
 much three copies 4 would seem very 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.080
 rare to be played but well three 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.990
 copies would be fine 2 could reach 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.660
 fix it would not be bad and what was said 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.849
 you guys a pretty good letter and with a 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.090
 also quite high price is not 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.550
 worth it but you have to buy let's go 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.289
 go to the snack caster menu that you should 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.349
 to know that I would be here because it is 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:47.220
 play on all the damn sides the 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:51.520
 Chinese this is already everywhere sky 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:55.870
 shift 4x4 x 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.729
 of seeing four because I can not think of any more 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.039
 right now but I know it's in a 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.159
 burrada then figuring occasional 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.919
 another loose copy on solar flowers is 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.900
 I would play also I went to the zoo to 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.509
 make snacks castÃ©ra tribal flames bueno 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.330
 in many, many decks are played 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.069
 to this letter and it is very very good and 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.770
 of all we've seen is what 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:19.720
 cheaper together with the solstice and what 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:25.599
 You can buy it for a minimum of 22 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.610
 by means of 26 27 euros and 4 by 2 a 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.500
 4 for highlighting with play city or even 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.720
 two equal in more formats or if you 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.090
 you come in many decks because it's great 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.280
 and let's move on to the mana base 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.220
 essential that they are is not the mixed and 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.289
 rain forest vale is all shetland 4 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.969
 for now they have taken out all the houses 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.250
 opt kill I recommend everyone 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:48.069
 that has 4 x of all the fes land to 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.479
 just like what we have here are the no 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.849
 I can say exactly the price of the 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.230
 dates because they vary according to the colors 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.820
 that are 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.920
 but usually those wearing blue 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.170
 they are more expensive than all the others and 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.010
 of less let's say price are those that 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.780
 they have a red and white I think then 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.290
 more or less make you an idea that oscillate 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.180
 between 10 and 30 euros out there 4 port of 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.520
 all and then we would have our 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.110
 darlings are those that vary between six and 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.610
 ten euros all I recommend that you have 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.590
 four x also of all of the new 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.330
 collections are usually cheaper 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.640
 to buy them from return and the gate 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.140
 crush and little more also touch 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.490
 fas recommend which are the 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.500
 you look well that they come straightened if 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.220
 you have two or less lands three or less 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.220
 forgive land 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:37.280
 I recommend two or three or less 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.990
 I do not know and I also recommend the bad 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.970
 what are the lands like the colonnade or 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.500
 Rabin rahin that are very very lands 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.360
 good with these guys you can make a 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.190
 idea but before also touch recommend 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.050
 a series of relatively 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.400
 cheap that are instant most 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.470
 that are lightning we must have 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.060
 always a places pacts there we must 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.620
 have a play set rhyme we have to 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.770
 always have a place and then already as 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.720
 nothing of the style of being a visions in 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.340
 manna lic and all this type of letters 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.110
 I hope you liked it and above all 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.790

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.710
 I would like you to comment and if you want 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.390
 make more than different formats and 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.800
 even that deepen more a little 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.180
 in mother I can do it too 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.620
