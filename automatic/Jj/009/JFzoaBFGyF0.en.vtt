00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello and again a flop and that 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.089
 You may see it in one today 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.519
 background I think hardly anyone knows 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:14.030
 Friedrichshafen with worse 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.010
 Passengers were lying on one does not recognize 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.420
 Maybe now, maybe 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.980
 from a review trade today 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:27.090
 uploads offers her age that is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.900
 mw faster at home 41 is okay as well 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.809
 So is keeping about we would make 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.510
 here today again goes three review one 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.149
 plus one more thing with it of course 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.829
 Although several one plus one walter was never 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.510
 what to do with one it has in other 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.760
 also and as soon as several of them 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.289
 That's why we find children here 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.309
 a bit today and I hope so 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.239
 I always keep up to date 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.520
 So far, I even had it 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.190
 forget your union now we are on 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:02.100
 harbor harbor and marvin you see 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.350
 just fully working on it even extra 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.150
 this wooden post thus modified the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.280
 They have only keep cell phones 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.689
 but not now the ultras come here 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.810
 thematic rides with the account of what 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:19.170
 unfortunately the really good is really cool 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.470
 inclusive ducks in between 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.560
 make and muffins tripod i run well 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.270
 not sure if marvin also in the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.770
 flop may come he still has 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.570
 can not record only the beginning 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.630
 the light was always such a heavy one 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.439
 here tripod and marvin here with 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.159
 give him a picture on the front and so kidman 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.899
 Just dream here and it 's easy 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.240
 very very heavy but without contained 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.439
 to film this sun but in the harbor 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.570
 provides anyway because of the high 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.210
 Aperture to film because of background 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.390
 So they see that they are quite good 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.229
 out 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.229
 Now we drive even better 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.610
 who is that we are still alive 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.720
 not in the car and the pizza 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.060
 Eaten because and now it comes 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.640
 shit was in it is marvin makes her 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.580
 rational on because it is easy 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.920
 Of course, the car is incredibly warm 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.790
 white in the sun is the dslr 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.970
 warm or because of course the whole 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.260
 equipment and slowly melts 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.280
 who of course would be annoying and now 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.080
 I say go back to the lake 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.080
 actually or and then right now 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.040
 with pizza and you can go back 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.540
 go back and stuff and I think it is 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.140
 also the temperature quite pleasant me 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.140
 purely 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.840
 Now I need in the bracket but 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.400
 the bracket I have stupid here 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:57.170
 perhaps the tier 3 did not clean it 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:03:01.310
 I am already very broad you can only 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.050
 not hindered in the car by film before 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.490
 I only have the key if that 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.980
 Air conditioning a few others understands yes 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.980
 maybe even coffee and help 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.620
 goes I would say since all 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.620
 turn it slightly 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:33.840
 At the same time, what are we going to do today? 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.840
 very creative blog first answer 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.870
 I looked quickly and it is all 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.080
 good but still it was not so 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.080
 optimal 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.920
 remember someone friedrichshafen since 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.690
 fits and which is also very important in 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.280
 ludwigshafen one actually stops 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.920
 Every traffic light on because the traffic lights 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.450
 is really pretty handicapped and makes 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.240
 not much fun so the police 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:21.130
 but the swiss police in 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:23.280
 That's why I think detmold is 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.280
 times 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:48.580
 With Marvin, there is still a lot 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:51.750
 volume free because telecom actions so yes 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.879
 there was a break around cars and such 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:05:00.879
 We are now here in a marvin park 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:08.729
 is okay behind me, we are here 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:12.909
 he included such stuff and an office 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:15.550
 osterbrunnen everything behind the shield 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:19.509
 every fall in the wells are the whole 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.129
 small children with trunks also around leaves 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.580
 you take your kids together well 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.129
 no matter 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.129
 Marvin already has his blog at the lake 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:28.960
 said is incredibly busy 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:30.370
 somehow something is given away here 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.349
 There is a lot going on today or something 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.669
 would not have expected it but here 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.930
 A park can be quite cheap 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.620
 take pictures and here is too 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.599
 shadow 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.860
 and that in turn means that we have the 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.240
 Aperture a bit back and forth 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.250
 can and of course there's this 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.060
 cool gyro I am sitting on 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.710
 and now you actually hear it 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.990
 a bit dizzy and marvin before 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.340
 It seems good then I hang up 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.169
 why do I say I put on time 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.330
 Friendship 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:01.029
 So I want to go home now 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.759
 said still thrown out yet after 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.500
 except me is a train message or 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:10.060
 is picked up that comes now also completely 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.219
 It was pretty warm in the end of the day 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.199
 but very very cool couple chic 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:15.789
 At the end it was actually recordings 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.719
 so we did not know what 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:23.379
 We should record 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:25.930
 testify as the first energy drunk 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:28.360
 i think everything is a perfect day im 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.000
 bus was there and now I was still 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.870
 about an hour to the home hangs 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.879
 just so together that they have the 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.919
 traffic lights in the city because you need 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:39.900
 at 20 minutes outside again 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.900
 So we will see
