00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
easy to do so let's get started first

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.459 
easy to do so let's get started first
step<00:00:42.270> we're<00:00:42.450> gonna<00:00:42.510> look<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> perfect

log<00:00:43.649> slice<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.219> happen<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> bunch<00:00:45.120> of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
log slice I happen to have a bunch of

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.299 
log slice I happen to have a bunch of
these<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.629> cut<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> chainsaw<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:47.250> I'm

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
these that I cut with a chainsaw so I'm

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.590 
these that I cut with a chainsaw so I'm
going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.670> find<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.149> that's<00:00:48.360> thick

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
going to find the one that's thick

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.389 
going to find the one that's thick
enough<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.440> stand<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.129> edge

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
enough that I can stand it up on edge

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.639 
enough that I can stand it up on edge
pretty<00:00:51.000> easily<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.410> need<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
pretty easily so it's going to need to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.950 
pretty easily so it's going to need to
be<00:00:52.770> about<00:00:53.039> three<00:00:53.309> inches<00:00:53.610> thick<00:00:53.750> next<00:00:54.750> we'll

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
be about three inches thick next we'll

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.240 
be about three inches thick next we'll
take<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> jointer<00:00:55.590> I'm<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:56.129> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
take it to the jointer I'm going to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.529 
take it to the jointer I'm going to
fight<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> thickest<00:00:56.940> part<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> edge

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
fight in the thickest part of the edge

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.930 
fight in the thickest part of the edge
so<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:57.989> get<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> biggest<00:00:58.530> foot<00:00:58.949> possible<00:00:59.460> since

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
so I get the biggest foot possible since

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.880 
so I get the biggest foot possible since
I<00:01:00.059> cut<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> chainsaw<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.500> faces<00:01:01.859> of

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
I cut it with a chainsaw the faces of

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.500 
I cut it with a chainsaw the faces of
the<00:01:02.070> slice<00:01:02.309> won't<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.760> perfectly<00:01:03.180> parallel

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the slice won't be perfectly parallel

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.840 
the slice won't be perfectly parallel
with<00:01:03.809> each<00:01:03.840> other<00:01:04.140> I'll<00:01:04.650> use<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> fence<00:01:05.369> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
with each other I'll use the fence to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060 
with each other I'll use the fence to
join<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> edge<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.960> slice<00:01:07.200> perpendicular

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
join the edge of the slice perpendicular

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
join the edge of the slice perpendicular
to<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.490> face<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.299> slice<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.260> other<00:01:10.409> face

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
to one face of the slice the other face

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.730 
to one face of the slice the other face
will<00:01:11.130> sit<00:01:11.369> at<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> slight<00:01:11.850> angle<00:01:12.650> facing<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
will sit at a slight angle facing the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.190 
will sit at a slight angle facing the
log<00:01:13.950> slice<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> angle<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> face<00:01:15.869> down

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
log slice with the angle to face down

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
log slice with the angle to face down
I'm<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.860> draw<00:01:17.040> my<00:01:17.250> three<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> half

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I'm going to draw my three and a half

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.490 
I'm going to draw my three and a half
inch<00:01:18.030> diameter<00:01:18.210> holes<00:01:18.689> where<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.350> them

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
inch diameter holes where I want them

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.770 
inch diameter holes where I want them
I'm<00:01:20.009> using<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.490> cup<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> pattern<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.600> use

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
I'm using a cup as a pattern you use

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.420 
I'm using a cup as a pattern you use
whatever<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.200> want<00:01:22.259> three<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> half

whatever you want three and a half

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.010 
whatever you want three and a half
inches<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> pretty<00:01:24.180> standard<00:01:24.420> size<00:01:24.750> for

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
inches is a pretty standard size for

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
inches is a pretty standard size for
wine<00:01:25.200> bottles<00:01:25.560> since<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.549> don't<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> hole

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
wine bottles since I don't have a hole

saw that is deep enough to go all the
way<00:01:28.920> through<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> slice<00:01:29.549> I'm<00:01:29.880> going<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> drill

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
way through the slice I'm going to drill

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.539 
way through the slice I'm going to drill
several<00:01:30.659> smaller<00:01:31.140> holes<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.680> inside<00:01:32.400> the

several smaller holes just inside the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.149 
several smaller holes just inside the
circles<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.119> drew<00:01:33.390> using<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.049> drill<00:01:34.259> press<00:01:34.290> with

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
circles I drew using a drill press with

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.310 
circles I drew using a drill press with
the<00:01:35.310> angled<00:01:35.670> face<00:01:35.850> down<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.869> holes<00:01:37.110> will

the angled face down the holes will

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.289 
the angled face down the holes will
drill<00:01:37.560> at<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> same<00:01:37.979> angle<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.759> will<00:01:38.970> tilt

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
drill at the same angle this will tilt

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.850 
drill at the same angle this will tilt

going to do is I'm going to put these

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.860 
going to do is I'm going to put these
kind<00:04:11.810> of<00:04:11.930> inside<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:13.780> hole<00:04:14.780> here<00:04:16.660> just<00:04:17.660> kind

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
kind of inside the hole here just kind

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.550 
kind of inside the hole here just kind
of<00:04:17.900> like<00:04:18.020> that

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.270 

kind<00:04:21.400> of<00:04:21.459> not<00:04:22.120> on<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.660> bottom<00:04:23.410> but<00:04:23.860> off<00:04:24.010> the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
kind of not on the bottom but off the

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.920 
kind of not on the bottom but off the
side<00:04:24.520> from<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:24.910> bottom<00:04:25.210> okay<00:04:26.160> just<00:04:27.160> like<00:04:27.280> that

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930

now I think the bottle should rest on

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.940 
now I think the bottle should rest on
those<00:04:31.410> pretty<00:04:32.410> evenly<00:04:32.800> yeah<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:34.540> see<00:04:37.860> so<00:04:38.860> you
