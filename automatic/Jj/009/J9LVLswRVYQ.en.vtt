00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
did you think you know it was a good

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.499 
did you think you know it was a good
representation<00:00:14.490> obviously<00:00:15.179> there's<00:00:15.330> always

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
representation obviously there's always

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.760 
representation obviously there's always
gonna<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.690> people<00:00:15.780> complaining<00:00:16.289> about<00:00:16.440> snobs

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
gonna be people complaining about snobs

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.070 
gonna be people complaining about snobs
and<00:00:16.920> stuff<00:00:17.100> but<00:00:17.279> overall<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.970> general<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.690> mean

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
and stuff but overall in general I mean

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.720 
and stuff but overall in general I mean
so<00:00:19.289> many<00:00:19.410> artists<00:00:19.890> out<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.130> kind<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.430> like<00:00:20.580> I

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
so many artists out is kind of like I

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.920 
so many artists out is kind of like I
guess<00:00:20.910> whoever's<00:00:21.300> putting<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.630> together

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
guess whoever's putting that together

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.390 
guess whoever's putting that together
it's<00:00:22.289> probably<00:00:22.529> hard<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:22.769> them<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> decide

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
it's probably hard for them to decide

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400 
it's probably hard for them to decide
for<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.640> light<00:00:23.789> which<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.060> okay<00:00:24.779> man<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> know

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
for a light which is okay man so I know

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.720 
for a light which is okay man so I know
you<00:00:25.470> actually<00:00:25.800> push<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> album<00:00:26.310> back<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> heard

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
you actually push the album back I heard

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.460 
you actually push the album back I heard
because<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.119> clear<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.750> epic<00:00:28.080> sample

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
because of that clear this epic sample

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.779 
because of that clear this epic sample
you<00:00:28.890> never<00:00:29.070> said<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.400> was<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:29.670> I'm

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
you never said what it was but I'm

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.269 
you never said what it was but I'm
assuming<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.359> can<00:00:30.660> take<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> guess<00:00:31.230> yeah<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> was

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
assuming I can take a guess yeah it was

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.520 
assuming I can take a guess yeah it was
the<00:00:32.309> POC<00:00:32.579> sample<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.380> what

the POC sample but it was so what

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
the POC sample but it was so what
happened<00:00:34.829> was<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.280> cuz<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> final

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
happened was with that cuz it the final

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.639 
happened was with that cuz it the final
version<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.450> album<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> songs<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.440> there
