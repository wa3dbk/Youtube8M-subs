neutral and the Anastasia one is a

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.009 
neutral and the Anastasia one is a
little<00:02:58.800> bit<00:02:58.920> warm<00:02:59.220> sometimes<00:02:59.610> so<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.540> feel<00:03:00.989> that

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
little bit warm sometimes so I feel that

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.870 
little bit warm sometimes so I feel that
when<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.380> contour<00:03:01.830> with<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.100> one<00:03:02.340> sort<00:03:02.790> of

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
when I contour with this one sort of

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.300 
when I contour with this one sort of
looks<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.390> bit<00:03:03.420> more<00:03:03.720> like<00:03:03.860> shadows<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.190> bit

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
looks a bit more like shadows and a bit

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.979 
looks a bit more like shadows and a bit
more<00:03:05.489> natural<00:03:05.940> if<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.300> know<00:03:06.390> what<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.540> mean<00:03:06.750> so
