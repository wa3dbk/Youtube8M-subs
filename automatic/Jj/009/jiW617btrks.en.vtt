00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.719
 personal hello okay that since we 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.440
 Let's see how to make the rainbow nails. 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.440
 with glitter 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.890
 the nail polish I used was white 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.590
 creamy 1 blue pink one yellow and one 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.340
 brightness with click and a sponge 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.340
 make up 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.629
 here I already passed a base on my fingernail 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:43.480
 and I'll pass a layer of white 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:45.699
 creamy and I'll wait for that white to dry 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.019
 meanwhile I'll apply the enamels 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.780
 on the sponge 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.000
 I will apply these three colors starting 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:58.739
 by blue 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.739
 I'll make a band and then with the pink 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.659
 and we'll try to pass a color one 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.340
 little above the other 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.340
 to facilitate the gradient effect 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.020
 after applying the three colors on the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.030
 sponge 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.110
 I will quickly apply on the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.540
 nail has to be a fairly quick process 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.750
 and the first time the colors will stay 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.810
 so weak 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.310
 then repeat this same process more 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.610
 twice 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:41.009
 here is the second one that looks like this and here it is 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.460
 the third and last time I'm 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.860
 applying and then we will clean well in 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.450
 back with cotton and acetone and a toothpick 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.149
 and I will wait for the gradient to dry 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.899
 little and then I'll apply two 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.569
 Ceglie layers after that are 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.670
 ready your fingernails requires with glitter 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.729
 The legal of this union that you use three 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.880
 colors and you get five colors 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.000
 so we have there the pink purple blue the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.230
 orange and yellow and actually you just 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.690
 use three colors 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.850
 so I found super super cool are I hope 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.590
 that you have enjoyed yourself and 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.989
 Did you not forget to give a jewel? 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.030

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.120

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.120
 kiss
