00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.640 
full screen here and pie is also working
pi<00:01:18.240> does<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> slight<00:01:18.960> bug<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.560> see

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
pi does have a slight bug you can see

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.649 
pi does have a slight bug you can see
this<00:01:19.799> persistent<00:01:20.250> menu<00:01:20.520> button<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:20.970> doesn't

actually<00:01:21.780> work<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.670> again<00:01:23.670> that'll<00:01:23.909> probably

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
actually work so again that'll probably

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.789 
actually work so again that'll probably
be<00:01:24.240> fixed<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.140> later<00:01:25.350> build<00:01:25.619> but

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
be fixed in a later build but

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.260 
be fixed in a later build but
nonetheless<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.549> working<00:01:26.909> right<00:01:26.939> now

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
nonetheless it's not working right now

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.030 
nonetheless it's not working right now
if<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.600> dive<00:01:27.810> into<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.200> phone<00:01:28.590> app<00:01:28.799> right<00:01:28.979> here

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
if we dive into the phone app right here

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.850 
if we dive into the phone app right here
we<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.900> menu<00:01:31.140> button<00:01:31.500> isn't

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
we can see that that menu button isn't

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.399 
we can see that that menu button isn't
working<00:01:32.250> even<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.700> an<00:01:32.880> app<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.390> I'm<00:01:34.020> sure<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
working even in an app so I'm sure that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.569 
working even in an app so I'm sure that
will<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.590> fixed<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.100> that's<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
will be fixed but that's one of the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.980 
will be fixed but that's one of the
problems<00:01:35.759> right<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> isn't<00:01:36.810> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
problems right now that it isn't I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.260 
problems right now that it isn't I
should<00:01:37.409> also<00:01:37.590> mention<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.850> build

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
should also mention that this build

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630 
should also mention that this build
doesn't<00:01:39.840> come<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.619> PA<00:01:40.950> half-breed

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
doesn't come with the PA half-breed

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.219 
doesn't come with the PA half-breed
colors<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.299> kernel<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.810> these<00:01:43.020> stock

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
colors in the kernel is these stock

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.749 
colors in the kernel is these stock
Google<00:01:43.439> colors<00:01:43.860> again<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.280> sure<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.640> will

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
Google colors again I'm sure that will

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.030 
Google colors again I'm sure that will
be<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.720> know<00:01:45.840> included<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.530> later<00:01:46.710> build

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
be you know included in a later build

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.270 
be you know included in a later build
now<00:01:48.020> whoops<00:01:49.020> yeah<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.040> wanted<00:01:50.189> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
now whoops yeah that's what I wanted to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.880 
now whoops yeah that's what I wanted to
do<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.820> what<00:01:51.090> doesn't<00:01:51.509> work<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.380> kind<00:01:52.710> of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
do now what doesn't work is the kind of

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.100 
do now what doesn't work is the kind of
PA<00:01:53.399> press<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> hybrid<00:01:54.540> properties<00:01:54.899> now

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
PA press in the hybrid properties now

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.660 
PA press in the hybrid properties now
the<00:01:55.170> hybrid<00:01:55.590> properties<00:01:55.979> actually<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.490> work

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the hybrid properties actually do work

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.139 
the hybrid properties actually do work
but<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> P<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.290> PA<00:01:58.500> prefs<00:01:58.920> can't<00:01:59.430> control<00:01:59.939> it

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
but the P the PA prefs can't control it

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.969 
but the P the PA prefs can't control it
and<00:02:00.299> what<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.990> means<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.320> me<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.740> is

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and what that means to me in you is

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.639 
and what that means to me in you is
basically<00:02:02.939> we<00:02:03.299> can't<00:02:03.570> use<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
basically we can't use the the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.530 
basically we can't use the the
Preferences<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> hybrid<00:02:05.850> controls<00:02:06.360> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
Preferences and the hybrid controls to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.029 
Preferences and the hybrid controls to
change<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.869> settings<00:02:07.200> because<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:07.829> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
change the settings because we know that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.770 
change the settings because we know that
Android<00:02:08.310> 4.3<00:02:08.729> changed<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.270> hell<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.569> lot<00:02:09.690> of

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
Android 4.3 changed a hell of a lot of

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.750 
Android 4.3 changed a hell of a lot of
stuff<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.110> root<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:11.069> causing<00:02:11.580> havoc

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
stuff with root and it's causing havoc

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.520 
stuff with root and it's causing havoc
for<00:02:12.150> all<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.420> developers<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
for all the developers of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.530 
for all the developers of
custom<00:02:13.770> roms<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.610> for<00:02:14.790> example<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.360> dive

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
custom roms so for example if I dive

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.220 
custom roms so for example if I dive
into<00:02:15.780> these<00:02:16.020> settings<00:02:16.470> right<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:18.870> go

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
into these settings right here and I go

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.650 
into these settings right here and I go
to<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:20.520> settings<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.150> say<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.360> want<00:02:21.630> to

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
to the settings and I say I want to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.180 
to the settings and I say I want to
change<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.080> out<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.440> split-screen<00:02:22.830> mode

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
change this out of the split-screen mode

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.280 
change this out of the split-screen mode
so<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.240> see<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.540> change<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> size<00:02:24.990> and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
so you can see I can change the size and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.990 
so you can see I can change the size and
layout<00:02:25.410> normally<00:02:26.100> press<00:02:26.310> apply<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.670> would

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
layout normally press apply this would

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.460 
layout normally press apply this would
normally<00:02:27.150> just<00:02:27.510> do<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.720> all<00:02:27.810> for<00:02:28.050> me<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.319> can

normally just do it all for me you can

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.380 
normally just do it all for me you can

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
I'm still stuck with these so right now

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.309 
I'm still stuck with these so right now
the<00:02:35.520> hybrid<00:02:36.090> settings<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.569> PA<00:02:36.720> preferences

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
do not work on this ROM like I said it

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.900 
do not work on this ROM like I said it
is<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> preview<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.530> just<00:02:40.709> remember<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.100> that

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
is a preview so just remember that that

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.550 
is a preview so just remember that that
is<00:02:42.060> pretty<00:02:42.300> much<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:43.110> only<00:02:43.319> stuff<00:02:43.530> that

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
is pretty much the only stuff that

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.020 
is pretty much the only stuff that
really<00:02:43.800> isn't<00:02:44.069> working<00:02:44.310> on<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.700> build<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
really isn't working on this build the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.300 
really isn't working on this build the
rest<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.510> very<00:02:45.660> fast<00:02:46.019> very<00:02:46.170> fluid<00:02:46.769> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
rest of it is very fast very fluid the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.590 
rest of it is very fast very fluid the
lags<00:02:47.519> you've<00:02:47.760> probably<00:02:47.940> been<00:02:48.120> seeing<00:02:48.480> a

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
lags you've probably been seeing a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.790 
lags you've probably been seeing a
little<00:02:48.720> bit<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.080> due<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.440> fact<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.650> I've

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
little bit is due to the fact that I've

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.229 
little bit is due to the fact that I've
been<00:02:49.860> changing<00:02:50.340> through<00:02:50.580> full<00:02:50.880> screen<00:02:51.150> and

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
been changing through full screen and

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.610 
been changing through full screen and
that<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.420> full<00:02:51.690> screen<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.140> whenever<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.500> do

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
that a full screen and whenever you do

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.960
