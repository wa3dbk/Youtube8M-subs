00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.370
 we are present here at mecspe di parma 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.050
 as 3d z group 3d z group is a group 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.960
 of companies located throughout the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.119
 Italian territory that aims 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.580
 we say the goal of proposing 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.190
 three-dimensional and even printers 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.320
 we are rapid prototyping services 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.200
 one hundred percent focused on this 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.720
 business that we think is probably 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.640
 the business of the future as it also comes 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.229
 demonstrated by the interest we have 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.060
 found here directly at the fair 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.830
 as well as on all those who can 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.130
 to be the newspapers 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.580
 national but not only national between z 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.230
 born of professionals who in 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.140
 past have however developed 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.090
 software skills 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.670
 three-dimensional and today you are 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.710
 moved to these new technologies that 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.200
 they are enjoying both 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.390
 European national but I would say really 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.910
 even at very global absolute level 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.220
 interest in prototyping technologies 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.070
 rapid are in continuous development a 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.170
 level of printers are continuous 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.380
 development of new materials 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.970
 that will allow us to produce 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.640
 prototypes and objects also for the real e 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.190
 own production as 3d z group la 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.200
 our focus on 3D printing ci 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.850
 led to choosing a partner or 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.190
 better than the manufacturer of the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.230
 printers which is between and of system why 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.970
 we chose 3d system 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.520
 beyond the fact that it is definitely one 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.740
 of the most important leaders and players 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.209
 in rapid prototyping it was 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.760
 chosen by us because it gives us the 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.830
 possibility of offering the market well 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.180
 seven different technologies to be able to 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.250
 print out 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.340
 so we can turn to ours 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.100
 customers by offering entry technologies 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.200
 level to print prototypes 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.810
 conceptual professional technologies for 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.630
 being able to print functional prototypes e 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.370
 to be able to verify the projects 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.040
 production level technology for 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.830
 being able to print real objects that 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.600
 will just end up making some pre 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.940
 series rather than productions 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.920
 real 3d system a multinational 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.590
 American 13 stand gives us the chance 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.230
 to propose these technologies and to have 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.660
 a range of printers that go budget 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.050
 of 5 thousand euros even up to budget 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:20.030
 even half a million 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:22.740
 euro with this with this offer 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.260
 we can understand how you can move 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.200
 on a completely cross-market 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.540
 so we can move from customers to 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.640
 scope for example building to propose 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.710
 technologies that can be a lot 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.780
 useful for making plastic models 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.870
 architectural as well as we can 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.750
 move from mechanical customers where 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.660
 we can offer prototypes that 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.890
 will be used to evaluate effectiveness 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.940
 of products before going into 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.050
 production 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.060
 I would say that it is a market 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.150
 transversal therefore going from 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.460
 the mechanics of medical fashion is one 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.730
 the market is also an important part 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.730
 of jewelry 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.040
 Hello 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.630
 in order to reach this broad 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.730
 potential market on the whole 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.370
 Italian territory and therefore in all 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.550
 sectors as I said before we are 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.480
 structured in a localized manner 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.180
 areas that we consider strategic of 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:50.110
 of Italy so we have today five 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.090
 company five locations that move on 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.400
 absolutely independent territory 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.390
 from the point of view both commercial and 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.860
 technical 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.980
 we have an office in castelfranco veneto 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.380
 a seat in Brescia with a farmhouse chair 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:12.520
 monferrato a site in Arezzo and la 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:15.070
 a newborn Roman headquarters something certainly 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.250
 to know is that the printer does 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.840
 everything does not exist what is important 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.910
 is that we can move there 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.430
 we move on customers to understand with them 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.440
 which technology is the best 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.420
 suited to their needs and to them 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.420
 expectations and their peace
