00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
two days that I took the vitamins I

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.080 
two days that I took the vitamins I
noticed<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.509> got<00:01:34.110> headaches<00:01:35.030> by<00:01:36.030> day

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
noticed that I got headaches by day

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969 
noticed that I got headaches by day
three<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.869> headaches<00:01:37.229> had<00:01:37.590> sort<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
three the headaches had sort of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.969 
three the headaches had sort of
dissipated<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.170> I<00:01:40.170> didn't<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.619> them<00:01:40.799> any

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.920 
dissipated and I didn't get them any
further<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> guess<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.420> my<00:01:42.689> body

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930

experienced<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.579> terms<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> size<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
experienced it in terms of the size of

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.850

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
have been revived if anything I just

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.310 
have been revived if anything I just
experienced<00:05:03.560> growth<00:05:04.070> along<00:05:04.790> my<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.810> existing

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
experienced growth along my the existing

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.680 
experienced growth along my the existing
hairs<00:05:06.560> along<00:05:06.860> my<00:05:07.160> edges<00:05:07.550> so<00:05:07.850> I<00:05:10.690> would

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
hairs along my edges so I would

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.600 
hairs along my edges so I would
definitely<00:05:11.810> still<00:05:12.229> say<00:05:12.410> that<00:05:12.590> that<00:05:12.979> is<00:05:13.190> slight

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
definitely still say that that is slight

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.240 
definitely still say that that is slight
improvement<00:05:14.419> and<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.410> third<00:05:15.650> area<00:05:15.889> that<00:05:16.190> I

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
improvement and the third area that I

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.500 
improvement and the third area that I
was<00:05:16.370> monitoring<00:05:17.560> was<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:19.700> crown<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:20.120> my<00:05:20.270> hair

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
was monitoring was the crown of my hair

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.790 
was monitoring was the crown of my hair
where<00:05:20.720> I<00:05:20.780> get<00:05:21.020> a<00:05:21.050> lot<00:05:21.380> of<00:05:21.530> breakage<00:05:22.039> and<00:05:23.800> I'll

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
where I get a lot of breakage and I'll

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.610 
where I get a lot of breakage and I'll
do<00:05:25.010> a<00:05:25.039> before-and-after<00:05:25.490> of<00:05:26.300> that<00:05:26.840> area<00:05:27.440> as

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
do a before-and-after of that area as

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.590 
do a before-and-after of that area as
well<00:05:28.010> I<00:05:28.310> don't<00:05:28.639> think<00:05:28.700> I<00:05:28.910> experienced<00:05:29.450> any

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
well I don't think I experienced any

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.219 
well I don't think I experienced any
significant<00:05:30.289> growth<00:05:30.470> in<00:05:30.710> that<00:05:31.010> area<00:05:31.490> and

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
significant growth in that area and

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.320 
significant growth in that area and
unfortunately<00:05:33.229> I<00:05:33.530> still<00:05:33.740> experience<00:05:34.490> pretty

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
unfortunately I still experience pretty

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.820 
unfortunately I still experience pretty
much<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.660> same<00:05:35.810> amount<00:05:35.930> of<00:05:36.200> breakage<00:05:36.620> there

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
much the same amount of breakage there

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.980 
much the same amount of breakage there
so<00:05:37.070> I<00:05:37.340> don't<00:05:37.700> think<00:05:38.120> that<00:05:38.270> anything<00:05:38.810> has

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
so I don't think that anything has

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.820 
so I don't think that anything has
changed<00:05:39.020> in<00:05:39.940> in<00:05:40.940> terms<00:05:41.360> of<00:05:41.539> that<00:05:41.690> crown<00:05:42.349> area

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
changed in in terms of that crown area

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.370 
changed in in terms of that crown area
