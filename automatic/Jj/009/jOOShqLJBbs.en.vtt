button on the side of the pen so you can

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.100 
button on the side of the pen so you can
access<00:01:07.710> some<00:01:07.890> things<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> click<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
access some things like a click so the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.200 
access some things like a click so the
actual<00:01:10.590> drawing<00:01:10.830> capabilities<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.850> it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
actual drawing capabilities on it it's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.080 
actual drawing capabilities on it it's
very<00:01:12.450> accurate<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.260> very<00:01:13.650> good<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:14.790> not

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
very accurate and it's very good I'm not

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.719 
very accurate and it's very good I'm not
very<00:01:15.270> good<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.600> drawing<00:01:15.900> or<00:01:16.170> writing<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:16.619> even

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
very good at drawing or writing or even

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.399 
very good at drawing or writing or even
doodling<00:01:17.729> or<00:01:17.820> anything<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.409> I'm

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
doodling or anything like that so I'm

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.660 
doodling or anything like that so I'm
probably<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> target<00:01:20.189> audience<00:01:20.610> for

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
probably not the target audience for

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.550 
probably not the target audience for
something<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.290> are

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
something like this but if you are

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.469 
something like this but if you are

anywhere decent or if you want to even

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.820 
anywhere decent or if you want to even
just<00:01:24.720> try<00:01:24.930> out<00:01:25.080> something<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
just try out something like this is a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.620 
just try out something like this is a
great<00:01:26.130> option<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.759> into<00:01:27.119> because<00:01:27.330> it's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
great option to get into because it's

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.960 
great option to get into because it's
got<00:01:27.840> such<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> low<00:01:28.409> cost<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.979> entry<00:01:29.310> whereas

some<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> market<00:01:30.720> cost<00:01:30.960> five<00:01:31.259> six<00:01:32.250> seven

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
some on the market cost five six seven

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.310 
some on the market cost five six seven
up<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.939> thousands<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.450> dollars<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.079> want
