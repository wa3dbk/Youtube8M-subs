 hello to all of you meet again 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.709
 today for the presentation of the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.570
 boxo tweak hence this pipe allowing for 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.420
 freeze your control center with 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.010
 your multitasking if I make the gesture 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.990
 as if you're real the center of 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.810
 control in to oxo of who opens this 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.449
 once with center multitasking 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.369
 up you have access or air drop and 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.920
 enable or disable some time 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.600
 google such as plane mode underneath 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.030
 we always have the four shortcuts of 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.800
 applications such as george 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.109
 calculator 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.649
 the camera and the timer and you 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.170
 go power 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.690
 this time adjust the brightness and the 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.429
 volume with its two small sliders to 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.019
 left and right and center you 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.589
 you can of course control and 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.909
 of your music for multitasking I 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.809
 wanted to show you a little option 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.789
 which adds in more hawks is not enough 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.979
 slide around the corner of the screen 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.260
 like these and you're going to have access 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.450
 to your last six apps they 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.979
 were opened 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.620
 it is enough simply to release the 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.560
 thumb on the desired application like 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.000
 this you make a slip you 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.430
 say placed on the app you 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.370
 want and you let go of your finger for 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.700

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.920

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.900
 if I go back into multitasking so 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.970
 if I zoom from top to bottom 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.940
 it'll open up the application could 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.920

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.530

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.060
 to the top it's going to close it 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.590
 if they wanted to close all 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.030

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.100
