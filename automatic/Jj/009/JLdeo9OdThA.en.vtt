00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.169 
length of the gold outer bezel here on
these<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.590> hour<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.009> minute<00:02:08.340> hands<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.060> then

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
these the hour and minute hands and then

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.630 
these the hour and minute hands and then
also<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> hour<00:02:10.289> markers<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> 12<00:02:11.400> which

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
also at the hour markers so the 12 which

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.570 
also at the hour markers so the 12 which
does<00:02:11.819> not<00:02:11.940> rotate<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.660> then<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.500> hour<00:02:14.190> marker

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
does not rotate and then the hour marker

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.100 
does not rotate and then the hour marker
for<00:02:14.790> three<00:02:15.000> six<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.360> nine<00:02:15.569> are<00:02:15.870> also

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
for three six and nine are also

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.539 
for three six and nine are also
glow-in-the-dark<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.160> thing<00:02:17.370> really

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
glow-in-the-dark so this thing really

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.309 
glow-in-the-dark so this thing really
lights<00:02:17.849> up<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.360> know<00:02:18.510> tritium<00:02:19.230> was

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
lights up it is you know tritium was

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.809 
lights up it is you know tritium was
radioactive<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.260> does<00:02:22.440> not<00:02:22.590> require

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
radioactive and so it does not require

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.850 
radioactive and so it does not require
exposure<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:24.000> light<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.360> stay<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:25.470> keep<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
exposure to light to stay to keep the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.570 
exposure to light to stay to keep the
phosphor<00:02:26.370> lit<00:02:27.299> up<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.750> emanating<00:02:28.080> light

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
phosphor lit up and the emanating light

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.770 
phosphor lit up and the emanating light
25<00:02:29.580> years<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.030> what<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.239> believe<00:02:30.330> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
25 years is what I believe the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.500 
25 years is what I believe the
advertised<00:02:31.640> length<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.849> time<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.239> they<00:02:33.390> will

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
advertised length of time that they will

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.940 
advertised length of time that they will
work<00:02:33.720> without<00:02:33.959> having<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.440> put<00:02:34.680> some<00:02:34.829> more

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
work without having to put some more

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.680 
work without having to put some more
tritium<00:02:35.370> paint<00:02:35.579> on<00:02:35.730> there<00:02:35.910> but<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.510> that's

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
tritium paint on there but so that's

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.569 
tritium paint on there but so that's
very<00:02:36.900> cool<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.680> don't<00:02:38.069> have<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.430> even

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
very cool so you don't have to even

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.190 
very cool so you don't have to even
exposed<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.269> light<00:02:39.450> go<00:02:39.660> underwater<00:02:39.900> you

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
exposed to light go underwater you

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.470 
exposed to light go underwater you
should<00:02:40.349> be<00:02:40.440> able<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.620> keep<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.099> keep<00:02:41.730> being

here<00:02:44.579> it's<00:02:44.730> got<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:44.879> 24-hour<00:02:45.329> clock<00:02:45.599> which<00:02:46.019> is

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
here it's got a 24-hour clock which is

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.130 
here it's got a 24-hour clock which is
pretty<00:02:47.310> nice<00:02:47.519> if<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.940> if<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.569> use<00:02:48.750> military

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
pretty nice if you if you use military

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.039 
pretty nice if you if you use military

like to where it looks fairly small on
the<00:03:08.100> wrist<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:09.709> small<00:03:10.709> watches<00:03:11.100> are<00:03:11.280> on

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459

embossed on the back so very cool one of
the<00:03:42.239> things<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.630> really<00:03:42.900> like<00:03:43.049> about<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.560> the

the things I really like about the the
wall<00:03:44.579> watches<00:03:45.000> are<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.930> RR<00:03:46.380> logo<00:03:47.359> that<00:03:48.359> they

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
wall watches are the RR logo that they

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.860 
wall watches are the RR logo that they
stamp<00:03:48.840> into<00:03:49.169> the<00:03:49.769> backend<00:03:50.549> of<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.299> second

stamp into the backend of the second

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.960 
stamp into the backend of the second
hand<00:03:52.049> here<00:03:52.290> it's<00:03:52.530> kind<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.950> unique<00:03:53.730> feature

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
hand here it's kind of a unique feature

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.420 
hand here it's kind of a unique feature
because<00:03:54.510> it's<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.870> really<00:03:55.049> intricate<00:03:55.530> logo<00:03:56.130> and
