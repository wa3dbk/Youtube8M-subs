16:04<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.430> strength<00:01:07.790> too<00:01:08.090> much<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:09.130> threats

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
16:04 the strength too much the threats

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.730 
16:04 the strength too much the threats
are<00:01:10.460> not<00:01:10.700> strong<00:01:11.090> enough<00:01:11.119> to<00:01:11.690> hold<00:01:12.380> it

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
are not strong enough to hold it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.990 
are not strong enough to hold it
together<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:13.940> gets<00:01:14.380> bumpy<00:01:15.380> oh<00:01:15.880> yeah

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
together and it gets bumpy oh yeah

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.570 
together and it gets bumpy oh yeah
it's<00:01:17.330> bumpy<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:17.930> what<00:01:18.530> we<00:01:18.680> need<00:01:18.950> is<00:01:18.979> a<00:01:19.220> very

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
it's bumpy and what we need is a very

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.770 
it's bumpy and what we need is a very
even<00:01:20.149> surface<00:01:21.220> so<00:01:22.220> otherwise<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.240> code<00:01:23.479> the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
even surface so otherwise the code the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.570 
even surface so otherwise the code the
space<00:01:24.050> frame<00:01:24.259> system<00:01:24.680> doesn't<00:01:24.890> work<00:01:25.009> because

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
space frame system doesn't work because

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.760 
space frame system doesn't work because
we<00:01:25.910> have<00:01:26.090> to<00:01:26.330> maintain<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.830> peace<00:01:28.009> pace<00:01:29.770> yes

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
we have to maintain the peace pace yes

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.480 
we have to maintain the peace pace yes
we<00:01:30.950> have<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.220> work<00:01:31.250> precisely<00:01:32.110> with<00:01:33.110> such<00:01:33.380> a

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
we have to work precisely with such a

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.700 
we have to work precisely with such a
natural<00:01:35.440> uneven<00:01:36.670> material<00:01:37.670> that's<00:01:38.710> that's

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
natural uneven material that's that's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.690 
natural uneven material that's that's
the<00:01:40.810> challenge<00:01:41.900> Sharon<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.650> beauty<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.310> most

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
the challenge Sharon the beauty the most

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.630 
the challenge Sharon the beauty the most
interesting<00:01:44.210> thing<00:01:46.659> so<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:49.400> turn

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
interesting thing so and you turn

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
interesting thing so and you turn
downwards

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.310 

and<00:01:53.390> we<00:01:54.390> should<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.890> small<00:01:56.149> distances

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
and we should have small distances

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.690 
and we should have small distances
between<00:01:58.729> our<00:01:59.729> stitches<00:02:00.479> at<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> top<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:02.460> keep

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
between our stitches at the top to keep

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.109 
between our stitches at the top to keep
it<00:02:02.939> very<00:02:03.479> tight<00:02:05.090> at<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.299> top<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:07.049> can

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
it very tight at the top then we can

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.790 
it very tight at the top then we can
increase<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.810> distance

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.040 

so<00:02:14.069> when<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.370> say<00:02:14.550> small<00:02:14.880> give<00:02:15.180> me<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.840> top

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
so when you say small give me on the top

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.660 
so when you say small give me on the top
about<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:17.160> much<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.610> an<00:02:17.760> inch<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:19.670> can

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
about this much like an inch I can

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.559 
about this much like an inch I can
ensure<00:02:21.180> yeah<00:02:21.540> let's<00:02:21.989> say<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.380> an<00:02:22.500> inch<00:02:23.569> look

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
ensure yeah let's say like an inch look

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.250 
ensure yeah let's say like an inch look
at<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> look<00:02:25.410> at<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> angle<00:02:25.950> yeah<00:02:26.400> after<00:02:26.850> all

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
at the look at the angle yeah after all

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.979 
at the look at the angle yeah after all
look<00:02:28.260> look<00:02:28.709> at<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.920> end<00:02:29.100> look<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.430> all<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.120> it
