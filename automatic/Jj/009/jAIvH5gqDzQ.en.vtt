00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
think we've also got a little bit more

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.000 
think we've also got a little bit more
of<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.160> hang<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> technique<00:02:21.800> doing<00:02:22.800> some

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
of a hang of the technique doing some

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.740 
of a hang of the technique doing some
things<00:02:23.250> different<00:02:23.670> from<00:02:24.030> from<00:02:24.390> what<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.540> did

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
things different from from what I did

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.980 
things different from from what I did
yesterday<00:02:24.930> taking<00:02:25.590> some<00:02:25.740> tips<00:02:26.010> from<00:02:26.100> my<00:02:26.250> guide

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
yesterday taking some tips from my guide

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
yesterday taking some tips from my guide
started<00:02:27.990> singing<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.440> whistling<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.920> the

started singing and whistling to the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.950 
started singing and whistling to the
dogs<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.520> seems<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.850> help<00:02:30.000> motivate

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
dogs and that seems to help motivate

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.440 
dogs and that seems to help motivate
them<00:02:31.380> up<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> hills<00:02:32.750> yeah<00:02:33.750> really<00:02:34.290> good
