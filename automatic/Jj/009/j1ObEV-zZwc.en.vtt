invest a little bit of money in in them
manufacturing<00:03:55.990> these<00:03:56.140> things<00:03:56.470> designing

them engineering them whatever and they
would<00:03:59.680> not<00:03:59.860> they<00:04:00.550> would<00:04:00.700> not<00:04:00.880> tell<00:04:01.360> device

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
would not they would not tell device

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.460 
would not they would not tell device
exactly<00:04:02.709> how<00:04:03.340> much<00:04:03.730> money<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:05.140> know<00:04:05.260> was

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
exactly how much money you know was

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.380 
exactly how much money you know was
spent<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:05.950> develop<00:04:06.400> these<00:04:06.550> things<00:04:06.850> they

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
spent to develop these things they

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.180 
spent to develop these things they
wouldn't<00:04:07.570> give<00:04:07.720> him<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.930> dollar<00:04:08.170> figure<00:04:08.500> but

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
wouldn't give him a dollar figure but

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.740 
wouldn't give him a dollar figure but
instead<00:04:09.520> they<00:04:09.730> said<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.209> could<00:04:10.360> get<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.510> nice

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
instead they said you could get a nice

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.780 
instead they said you could get a nice
car<00:04:11.110> for<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.470> same<00:04:11.650> amount<00:04:11.800> of<00:04:11.980> money<00:04:12.040> so<00:04:12.430> this

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
car for the same amount of money so this

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.440 
car for the same amount of money so this
was<00:04:13.209> not<00:04:13.450> cheap<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:14.920> suppose<00:04:15.580> carbon<00:04:16.270> fiber

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
was not cheap and I suppose carbon fiber

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.330 
was not cheap and I suppose carbon fiber
I<00:04:16.690> mean<00:04:16.840> it's<00:04:16.959> tough<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.739> use<00:04:17.890> that<00:04:18.100> stuff

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
I mean it's tough to to use that stuff

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.070 
I mean it's tough to to use that stuff
to<00:04:18.489> manufacture<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.270> suppose<00:04:19.720> that's<00:04:19.900> the

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
to manufacture so I suppose that's the

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.020 
to manufacture so I suppose that's the
reason<00:04:20.320> why<00:04:20.350> it's<00:04:20.620> so<00:04:20.739> expensive<00:04:20.859> if<00:04:21.459> you<00:04:21.850> go

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
reason why it's so expensive if you go

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.310 
reason why it's so expensive if you go
to<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.180> website<00:04:22.270> you<00:04:22.690> can<00:04:22.960> see<00:04:23.140> them

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
to the website you can see them

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.100 
to the website you can see them
frolicking<00:04:23.950> around<00:04:24.120> like<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.150> happy<00:04:25.570> bunch<00:04:25.840> in
