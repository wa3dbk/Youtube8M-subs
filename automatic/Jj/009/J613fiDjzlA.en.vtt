00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
out from here you're actually going to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.290 
out from here you're actually going to
take<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.600> sit<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> face<00:00:53.300> you'll

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
take it and sit it on the face you'll

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.549 
take it and sit it on the face you'll
leave<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.809> five<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.230> ten<00:00:55.530> minutes

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
leave it there for five or ten minutes

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.459 
leave it there for five or ten minutes
um<00:00:56.160> five<00:00:57.149> minutes<00:00:57.510> probably<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:58.079> be<00:00:58.199> enough

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
um five minutes probably will be enough

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.349 
um five minutes probably will be enough
it's<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.129> allow<00:00:59.219> your<00:00:59.550> pores<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.030> open

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
it's going to allow your pores to open

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.380 
it's going to allow your pores to open
from<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.530> you're<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.070> take<00:01:02.250> your

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
from there you're going to take your

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.469 
from there you're going to take your
extractor<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.629> prefer<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.470> small<00:01:05.070> end<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
extractor I prefer the small end for the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.050 
extractor I prefer the small end for the
nose<00:01:06.689> area<00:01:07.020> because<00:01:07.590> uh<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.820> little

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
nose area because uh it's just a little

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.210 
nose area because uh it's just a little
bit<00:01:09.540> easier<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.049> maneuver<00:01:10.350> you're<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
bit easier to maneuver you're going to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.690 
bit easier to maneuver you're going to
find<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.960> blackheads<00:01:13.130> just<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.250> some<00:01:14.490> light

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
find the blackheads just do some light

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.140 
find the blackheads just do some light
pression<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:16.100> them<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.790> will<00:01:17.909> actually

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
pression on them and it will actually

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.840 
pression on them and it will actually
remove<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.810> dirt<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.170> oil<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.280> once<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.670> have

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
remove the dirt and oil so once you have

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.149 
remove the dirt and oil so once you have
done<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.119> you're<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.710> go<00:01:22.740> on

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
done that you're actually going to go on

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.240 
done that you're actually going to go on
to<00:01:23.520> adding<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.409> one<00:01:25.409> part<00:01:25.680> water<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.070> part

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
to adding the one part water one part

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.469 
to adding the one part water one part
baking<00:01:26.850> soda<00:01:27.090> mixture<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:29.150> let's<00:01:30.150> pretend

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
baking soda mixture and let's pretend

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.810 
baking soda mixture and let's pretend
for<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.720> minute<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.990> my<00:01:31.229> hand<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.070> my

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
for a minute that my hand here is my

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.429 
for a minute that my hand here is my
nose<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.360> you're<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> use<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.409> a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
nose and you're going to use it as a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:42.920 
nose and you're going to use it as a
mask<00:01:40.189> this<00:01:41.189> works<00:01:41.579> almost<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> magnet<00:01:42.780> for

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
mask this works almost like a magnet for

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.810 
mask this works almost like a magnet for
cleaning<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.649> pores<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.250> since<00:01:44.549> you've

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
cleaning out the pores and since you've

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.060 
cleaning out the pores and since you've
actually<00:01:45.119> opened<00:01:45.689> your<00:01:45.810> pores<00:01:46.110> done<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
actually opened your pores done the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.460 
actually opened your pores done the
compression<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.790> them<00:01:48.090> cleaned<00:01:48.930> out<00:01:49.079> some<00:01:49.350> of

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
compression on them cleaned out some of

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.950 
compression on them cleaned out some of
the<00:01:49.530> larger<00:01:49.979> dirt<00:01:50.220> particles<00:01:50.540> this<00:01:51.540> will<00:01:51.750> soak

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the larger dirt particles this will soak

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.160 
the larger dirt particles this will soak
up<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.350> remaining<00:01:52.829> oil<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.600> let<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.930> sit

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
up the remaining oil and let that sit

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.230 
up the remaining oil and let that sit
for<00:01:55.200> five<00:01:55.530> or<00:01:55.649> ten<00:01:55.829> minutes<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.399> wash<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:56.969> off

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
for five or ten minutes and wash it off

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.480 
for five or ten minutes and wash it off
and<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.689> course<00:01:57.719> after<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.409> you're<00:01:59.189> going<00:01:59.369> to
