00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.639
 a fucking tornado 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.490
 he had swept everything 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.050
 an absurd thing 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.370
 something never seen late 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.370
 Here I am 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.860
 and was a flash will surely be the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.860
 skipped some light pole 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.909
 to 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.909
 and I don't talk 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.090
 but certainly can it brought 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.560
 some phallus of the poor light of the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.430
 church after a flash it gets caught 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.430
 all the mineral 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.200
 here we are on Saturday the corner 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:44.240
 the lilac print that will end when there 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:50.080
 pushes the thorns never arrived 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.730
 watch the smoke watch what's there 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.430
 I look at the smoke 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:08.270
 no look at the machines look at the misses 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:16.600
 it's down but it's low and critical 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:19.600
 amaral and instead no male water 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 face 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:33.420
 you imagine less badly than they are at 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:38.569
 throat paddock and clean mo he is doing 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.569
 to the book asked to place it in detached 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.569
 but you know what I noticed me I 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:09.780
 I realized that the wind had changed 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:11.819
 from south to north of immediately try 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.700
 look at the veil look look look like 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.419
 he's puffing up how he's puffing 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.650
 that with high form as he looks at 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.389
 blast furnaces as they are puffing fears 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.800
 this the other moments that you ship 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:31.680
 bell the art for are snorting me 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.099
 the new tactic for new inzaghi 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.970
 tactic to pollute without making 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.970
 noticing anything 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:48.940

00:04:48.940 --> 00:05:03.100
 All the dogs mind the theme valves 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:06.100

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:32.500
