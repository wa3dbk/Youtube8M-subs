wham<00:01:31.790> bam<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.990> I<00:01:33.170> still<00:01:33.470> feel<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:33.800> that<00:01:34.310> way

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
wham bam and I still feel that that way

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.090 
wham bam and I still feel that that way
about<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.030> it's<00:01:35.180> just<00:01:35.240> it's<00:01:35.900> no<00:01:36.200> there's<00:01:36.920> no

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
about it it's just it's no there's no

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.150 
about it it's just it's no there's no
nonsense<00:01:37.520> about<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.210> cooking<00:01:38.690> it's<00:01:38.900> not

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
nonsense about the cooking it's not

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.630 
nonsense about the cooking it's not
particularly<00:01:40.160> subtle

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
particularly subtle

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.490 
particularly subtle
I<00:01:40.820> agree<00:01:41.150> although<00:01:41.330> there<00:01:41.690> are<00:01:41.810> subtle<00:01:42.320> notes

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
I agree although there are subtle notes

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.680 
I agree although there are subtle notes
everywhere<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.460> be<00:01:43.580> found<00:01:43.820> but<00:01:44.330> it's<00:01:44.510> just

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
everywhere to be found but it's just

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.080 
everywhere to be found but it's just
that<00:01:44.870> sort<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.220> immediacy<00:01:46.220> of<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.880> that's

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
that sort of immediacy of it and that's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.240 
that sort of immediacy of it and that's
what<00:01:47.300> I<00:01:47.330> love<00:01:47.720> but<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.500> other<00:01:48.680> thing<00:01:49.100> that<00:01:49.130> I

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
what I love but the other thing that I

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.340 
what I love but the other thing that I
loved<00:01:49.580> was<00:01:49.760> collecting<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.630> material<00:01:51.170> for

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350
