00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
you know no judges commit my the exit

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.010 
you know no judges commit my the exit
I'm<00:00:24.590> not<00:00:24.740> sure<00:00:25.270> what<00:00:26.270> objectives<00:00:26.390> did<00:00:26.779> I<00:00:26.840> not

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
I'm not sure what objectives did I not

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.790 
I'm not sure what objectives did I not
meet<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:28.160> Apple<00:00:28.369> up<00:00:28.430> all<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.640> cars<00:00:28.880> I<00:00:29.800> don't

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
meet and Apple up all the cars I don't

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.929 
meet and Apple up all the cars I don't
want<00:00:30.919> to<00:00:31.040> look<00:00:31.279> at<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.489> objectives<00:00:31.849> you<00:00:31.910> have

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
want to look at the objectives you have

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.569 
want to look at the objectives you have
to<00:00:32.060> shut<00:00:32.270> down<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.570> music<00:00:32.689> I<00:00:36.370> know<00:00:37.370> that's

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
to shut down the music I know that's

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.690 
to shut down the music I know that's
coming<00:00:37.700> from<00:00:37.970> oh<00:00:38.239> well<00:00:38.950> now<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.010> objectives

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
coming from oh well now the objectives

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.950 
coming from oh well now the objectives
would<00:00:40.850> have<00:00:40.940> blow<00:00:41.090> up<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.270> fuel<00:00:41.480> trucks<00:00:41.809> I

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
would have blow up the fuel trucks I

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.319 
would have blow up the fuel trucks I
guess<00:00:42.110> I<00:00:42.200> didn't<00:00:42.380> blow<00:00:42.470> them<00:00:42.649> all<00:00:42.770> up<00:00:42.800> then

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
guess I didn't blow them all up then

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.580 
guess I didn't blow them all up then
I'll<00:00:44.329> be<00:00:44.390> back<00:00:44.629> tracking<00:00:44.899> and<00:00:45.140> looking<00:00:45.350> for<00:00:45.530> my

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
I'll be back tracking and looking for my

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.310 
I'll be back tracking and looking for my
objectives<00:00:46.420> see<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:47.539> all<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:47.750> them<00:00:47.840> minute<00:00:48.230> I

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
objectives see you all of them minute I

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.310 
objectives see you all of them minute I
guess<00:00:48.940> actually<00:00:49.940> no<00:00:50.329> mine<00:00:50.539> I'll<00:00:51.170> deal<00:00:51.289> with

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
guess actually no mine I'll deal with

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.880 
guess actually no mine I'll deal with
that<00:00:55.690> might<00:00:56.690> be<00:00:56.839> amusing<00:00:57.170> just<00:00:57.469> me<00:00:57.620> looking

that might be amusing just me looking
off<00:00:58.339> all<00:00:58.699> around<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.120> level<00:00:59.390> for<00:00:59.570> something

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
off all around the level for something

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.900 
off all around the level for something
that<00:00:59.960> you<00:01:00.050> guys<00:01:00.199> know<00:01:00.589> is<00:01:00.920> there<00:01:01.460> but<00:01:01.730> I<00:01:01.760> don't

get it I'm just like yeah whatever
that's<00:01:09.530> why<00:01:09.650> mr.<00:01:09.920> completely<00:01:10.520> which<00:01:10.670> would

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
that's why mr. completely which would

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.370 
that's why mr. completely which would
not<00:01:11.090> be<00:01:11.120> fun<00:01:11.510> in<00:01:11.659> that<00:01:11.780> reading<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.260> entire

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
not be fun in that reading the entire

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.899 
not be fun in that reading the entire
level

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.370 

hmm<00:01:18.880> there's<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:19.969> ladder

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.640 

yeah<00:01:23.979> I'll<00:01:24.130> be<00:01:24.340> back<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.930> I<00:01:25.960> went<00:01:26.229> back<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.530> the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
yeah I'll be back so I went back to the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.649 
yeah I'll be back so I went back to the
very<00:01:27.060> beginning<00:01:28.060> of<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.210> level

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
very beginning of the level

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.140 
very beginning of the level
now<00:01:29.560> I'm<00:01:29.740> thinking<00:01:30.460> I<00:01:30.549> missed<00:01:30.759> something<00:01:30.939> here

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
now I'm thinking I missed something here

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.280 
now I'm thinking I missed something here
that<00:01:31.330> I'm<00:01:31.420> supposed<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.720> take<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.900> picture<00:01:31.960> of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
that I'm supposed to take a picture of

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:40.730 
that I'm supposed to take a picture of
the<00:01:32.619> cipher<00:01:33.009> whatever<00:01:33.549> that<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.850> whoa<00:01:36.960> no<00:01:37.960> I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.889 

assume<00:01:41.740> it's<00:01:41.979> behind<00:01:42.159> one<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.369> these<00:01:42.490> doors

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
assume it's behind one of these doors

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.850 
assume it's behind one of these doors
probably<00:01:43.899> want<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.049> forgot<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.409> shoot<00:01:44.649> and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
probably want to forgot to shoot and

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.810 
probably want to forgot to shoot and
didn't<00:01:45.159> notice<00:01:45.280> out<00:01:45.610> of<00:01:45.759> sheer<00:01:46.509> ignorance<00:01:47.759> hmm

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
didn't notice out of sheer ignorance hmm

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.430 
didn't notice out of sheer ignorance hmm
probably<00:01:49.119> very<00:01:49.270> obvious<00:01:49.659> this<00:01:50.110> door<00:01:50.350> is

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
probably very obvious this door is

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.430 
probably very obvious this door is
different<00:01:50.830> oh<00:01:51.009> all<00:01:51.670> right<00:01:51.909> oh<00:01:52.119> I'm<00:01:53.110> pressing

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
different oh all right oh I'm pressing

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.160 
different oh all right oh I'm pressing
action<00:01:54.840> hey<00:01:55.840> there<00:01:57.539> he<00:01:58.539> was<00:01:58.690> dead

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
action hey there he was dead

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.680 
action hey there he was dead
that's<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.250> all<00:02:00.580> right<00:02:00.819> I<00:02:00.880> can<00:02:01.060> handle<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.360> I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
that's it all right I can handle that I

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
got a pass to the armory but oh I could

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.290 
got a pass to the armory but oh I could
have<00:02:05.440> just<00:02:05.619> yeah<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.340> didn't<00:02:06.610> have<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.819> gun<00:02:07.149> my

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
way through but that's a fun way you

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.290 
way through but that's a fun way you
know<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:11.140> looks<00:02:11.290> like<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> cipher<00:02:11.890> oh<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
know that looks like a cipher oh it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.150 
know that looks like a cipher oh it
looks<00:02:13.480> more<00:02:13.600> like<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.780> book<00:02:14.019> but<00:02:14.340> take<00:02:15.340> pictures

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
looks more like a book but take pictures

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.220 
looks more like a book but take pictures
what<00:02:18.190> oh<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.640> thought<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.850> crows<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.330> little<00:02:20.140> bit
