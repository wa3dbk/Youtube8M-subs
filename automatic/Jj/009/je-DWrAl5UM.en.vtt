 Dortmund receives FC Augsburg the duel "Champions against promoted" 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.170
 one may be curious how the BVB after the unfortunate defeat in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.529
 presented the Champions League today 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.289
 Also in the league, it is not yet around current lease and backlog 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.289
 Leader in May in Munich 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.689
 the Borussia wants to know that clearly felt 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.460
 Waldemar fur blocked 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.460
 that was not safe in the 11th 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.180
 the direct return of the Augsburg long ball to the top Paulis and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.180
 Wine Queen hiding to the forest St 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.560
 the line 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.670
 Steinbach in the BVB 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.780
 who almost had it racy quarter with 1 4 90 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.110
 big enough 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.070
 the Borussia currently lie something takes up to 30 minutes now watch out 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.300
 the scene actually clarified 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.420
 And then this ball can still be so cool right next 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
 David Orlovsky 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.120
 Robert Lewandowski hits from the turn 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.480
 a third is it too 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.150
 how unnecessary is this hit unbelievable this blunder of busuu com 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.810
 later free kick idol ZDF and Jacek Kozlowski 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.110
 MK lowered 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.010
 the fire on the way a professional just so but has 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.420
 but defused 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.480
 short break again free kick limits 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 weakest defense consistently goes out 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.050
 from and falls with 2 10 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.830
 the result is alright but also here the Augsburg defense makes no 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.970
 good figure 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.170
 Operator's business report counter 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.170
 we hit the 2 0 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 then halftime is still 80,000 spectators 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.899
 The second round starts at first, but there is a lot of traffic 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.299
 he gives five times right here 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.629
 Thier WÃ¼rzberger met 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.759
 comes to case 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.999
 the decision is correct 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.999
 Istanbul allegedly enters Weidenfeller 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.509
 and leaves that ultimate chance to hit the net 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.309
 Sandro Joss not badly placed 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:00.759
 but Roman Weidenfeller shows his whole class 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:03.759
 at the two to zero for the Borussia 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:07.279
 a good one hour refuses to continue playing 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.299
 that's nonsense 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.959
 in the 60 not to stop actually with a number 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.649
 Simon Jentzsch finds her the final k 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.029
 again today with a top performance 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:24.019
 another quarter of an hour the Borussia on pushers 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.019
 it can not 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:32.609
 almost 1 billion 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.309
 in the case of the national player 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.149
 the beer gardens Gentner 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:39.009
 the 13 0 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.009
 second are 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.949
 and only three minutes later is new places with the groundwork 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:53.309
 at the farm Lewandowsky sports 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.639
 Doctors brought 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.639
 the BVB out now 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.719
 Borussia Dortmund won tend to print confidently with four to zero 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:20.819
 and shows that the reigning champion is definitely still to be expected 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:22.719
 now it is only six points behind
