00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
unfortunately that we're still in the

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.550 
unfortunately that we're still in the
era<00:03:51.880> of<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.330> has<00:03:52.660> royal<00:03:52.900> has<00:03:53.050> a<00:03:53.080> little<00:03:53.410> bit

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
era of that has royal has a little bit

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.290 
era of that has royal has a little bit
of<00:03:53.680> problems<00:03:54.660> applying<00:03:55.860> proper<00:03:56.860> gum<00:03:57.640> metallic

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
of problems applying proper gum metallic

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.830 
of problems applying proper gum metallic
paint<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.870> their<00:03:58.990> figures<00:04:00.510> another<00:04:01.510> thing<00:04:01.690> is

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
paint to their figures another thing is

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.910 
paint to their figures another thing is
that<00:04:01.870> his<00:04:03.030> wolf<00:04:04.030> like<00:04:04.300> for<00:04:05.020> a<00:04:05.050> collar<00:04:05.380> actually

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
that his wolf like for a collar actually

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.160 
that his wolf like for a collar actually
sticks<00:04:06.820> out<00:04:06.940> quite<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.210> bit<00:04:07.450> at<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.600> tip<00:04:07.870> there

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
sticks out quite a bit at the tip there

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.740 
sticks out quite a bit at the tip there
so<00:04:08.710> it's<00:04:08.860> very<00:04:08.980> easy<00:04:09.160> for<00:04:09.460> that<00:04:10.330> bit<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:10.720> the

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
so it's very easy for that bit of the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.960 
so it's very easy for that bit of the
paint<00:04:11.110> to<00:04:11.260> rub<00:04:11.500> off<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:15.070> even<00:04:15.550> though<00:04:15.790> it
