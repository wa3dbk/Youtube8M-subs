00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.670
 Hi I 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.160
 thought he would be nice 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.599
 make such see and stupid 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.879
 and show how I collect the Rubik's Cube 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.490
 because I looked all sorts 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.719
 various 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.410
 explanation and i they seem pretty to me 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.689
 buds because he 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.949
 on 11 and combinations 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.579
 I made this cube for the first time does not know 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.579
 recommendations though they were in analogue of life 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.480
 this is 83 1 year 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.860
 Yes, I was pleased 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.040
 understand this combination therefore 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 do it yourself 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.680
 because you understand better 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.260
 do something how are you doing all by yourself 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.990
 so if you 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.110
 using which combination 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.030
 in fact 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.510
 frankly speaking 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.260
 I don't know what to do 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.250
 so I decided alatau 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.100
 show the way I came up 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.230
 myself 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.670
 and I saw some similar ways on 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.100
 YouTube but 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.670
 they are all a little bit 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.200
 formally they don't care 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.370
 there is one meter as if without memorizing 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.180
 anyway this method 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.260
 as if collected from several meters 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.800
 I want to show the most 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.330
 in my opinion is not simple which I 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.560
 learned from collecting 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.170
 we will start as a tribe 3 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.170
 3 by 13 and then 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.660
 complex cubes 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.140
 corr basic idea is 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.920
 collect cube 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.170
 without destroying what you have already done 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.470
 and if you are going to both Slavs 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.620
 in order to collect the bottom layer 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.840
 need to destroy the top 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.780
 and it's not very nice 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.250
 so 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.440
 the main method will be somewhat 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.350
 other 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.120
 canvas actually 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.100
 It is interesting to look at Kupchino at me 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.480
 true therefore 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.910
 i think i need 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.120
 change camera position 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.300
 and we will continue 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.979
 the next day
