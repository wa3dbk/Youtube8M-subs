two sheets where the back of the sheet

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.339 
two sheets where the back of the sheet
is<00:02:20.430> orange<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.689> front<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.109> sheet<00:02:22.319> is

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
panels of patterned papers so what I did

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.920 
panels of patterned papers so what I did
is<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.650> cut<00:02:28.889> those<00:02:29.069> up<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.760> that's<00:02:30.540> where<00:02:30.719> I<00:02:30.750> got

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
is I cut those up and that's where I got

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.270 
is I cut those up and that's where I got
that<00:02:30.959> little<00:02:31.230> skinny<00:02:31.439> sheet<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:32.040> little

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
that little skinny sheet that little

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.679 
that little skinny sheet that little
skinny<00:02:32.459> bit<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.819> found<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.209> on<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.359> desk

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
skinny bit I found that on the desk

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.360 
skinny bit I found that on the desk
because<00:02:34.079> I<00:02:34.230> was<00:02:34.439> cutting<00:02:34.709> things<00:02:34.889> at<00:02:35.040> 1<00:02:35.189> and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
because I was cutting things at 1 and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.369 
because I was cutting things at 1 and
3/4<00:02:35.849> so<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.209> had<00:02:36.450> little<00:02:36.659> pieces<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.260> parts

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
3/4 so I had little pieces and parts

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.110 
3/4 so I had little pieces and parts
left<00:02:37.650> over<00:02:37.829> and<00:02:38.159> I<00:02:38.609> thought<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:38.969> would<00:02:39.090> make

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
left over and I thought that would make

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.240 
left over and I thought that would make
a<00:02:39.269> nice<00:02:39.510> little<00:02:39.780> juncture<00:02:40.379> between<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:41.099> two

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
a nice little juncture between the two

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.209 
a nice little juncture between the two
pieces<00:02:41.659> so<00:02:42.659> now<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:43.409> little<00:02:43.739> background<00:02:43.859> on

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
pieces so now a little background on

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.159 
pieces so now a little background on
that<00:02:44.249> this<00:02:44.639> is<00:02:44.760> how<00:02:44.879> you<00:02:44.939> make<00:02:45.180> nine<00:02:45.359> cards<00:02:45.599> you

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.169 
that this is how you make nine cards you

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:47.869 
that this is how you make nine cards you
start<00:02:46.469> using<00:02:46.680> little<00:02:47.040> pieces<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.579> parts<00:02:47.730> that

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
start using little pieces and parts that

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.069 
start using little pieces and parts that
you<00:02:48.090> find<00:02:48.620> as<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:50.069> mentioned<00:02:50.400> earlier<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:51.150> made

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
you find as I mentioned earlier I made

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.899 
you find as I mentioned earlier I made
nine<00:02:52.349> cards<00:02:52.650> with<00:02:52.859> this<00:02:53.010> kit<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.489> also<00:02:53.879> a

a desert sand but you could use craft I

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.839 
a desert sand but you could use craft I
added<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.269> in<00:03:03.449> myself<00:03:04.159> and<00:03:05.159> I<00:03:05.459> added<00:03:05.669> some

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
added that in myself and I added some

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.899 
added that in myself and I added some
white<00:03:06.120> paper<00:03:06.359> so<00:03:06.799> just<00:03:07.799> FYI<00:03:07.949> needed<00:03:08.669> to<00:03:08.760> add<00:03:08.879> a

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
white paper so just FYI needed to add a

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.580 
white paper so just FYI needed to add a
couple<00:03:09.150> things<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.540> i<00:03:09.659> added<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.109> sequins

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
couple things and i added the sequins

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.020 
couple things and i added the sequins
and<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:12.030> pop<00:03:12.180> dots<00:03:12.829> so<00:03:13.829> I<00:03:14.129> think<00:03:14.819> those

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
and the pop dots so I think those

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.399 
and the pop dots so I think those
sequins<00:03:15.419> are<00:03:15.540> really<00:03:15.719> fun<00:03:15.870> they're<00:03:16.049> kind<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.319> a

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
sequins are really fun they're kind of a

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.469 
sequins are really fun they're kind of a
nice<00:03:16.590> embellishment<00:03:17.310> because<00:03:17.609> those<00:03:18.269> gold

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:18.479 
nice embellishment because those gold

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.879 
nice embellishment because those gold
sequins<00:03:18.840> you'll<00:03:18.959> see<00:03:19.109> in<00:03:19.169> a<00:03:19.229> minute<00:03:19.439> because

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
sequins you'll see in a minute because

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.159 
sequins you'll see in a minute because
they<00:03:20.280> actually<00:03:20.699> are<00:03:20.790> rather<00:03:21.000> flat<00:03:21.509> so<00:03:21.930> it's<00:03:22.079> a

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
they actually are rather flat so it's a

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.080 
they actually are rather flat so it's a
nice<00:03:22.349> way<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.590> add<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.829> little<00:03:23.040> sparkle<00:03:23.400> without

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
nice way to add a little sparkle without

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.929 
nice way to add a little sparkle without
having<00:03:24.599> a<00:03:24.720> raised<00:03:24.989> bump<00:03:25.409> so<00:03:26.340> they're<00:03:26.759> real

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
having a raised bump so they're real

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.809 
having a raised bump so they're real
handy<00:03:27.359> now<00:03:28.079> on<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.439> cards<00:03:28.739> in<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:28.949> photo<00:03:29.159> you

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
handy now on the cards in the photo you

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.849 
handy now on the cards in the photo you
probably<00:03:30.239> didn't<00:03:30.449> notice<00:03:30.540> but<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.079> used<00:03:31.650> a

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
probably didn't notice but I used a

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.020 
probably didn't notice but I used a
variation<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:34.009> ways<00:03:35.009> I<00:03:35.189> put<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.489> sequins<00:03:35.879> on

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
variation of ways I put the sequins on

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.819 
variation of ways I put the sequins on
so<00:03:36.389> in<00:03:36.509> this<00:03:36.629> little<00:03:36.840> example<00:03:37.379> I<00:03:37.439> put<00:03:37.620> them<00:03:37.739> in

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
so in this little example I put them in

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.099 
so in this little example I put them in
the<00:03:37.919> corners<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.549> bottom<00:03:38.879> space<00:03:39.180> but<00:03:39.959> in

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
the corners of that bottom space but in
