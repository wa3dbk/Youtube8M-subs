clip it's a very strong belt clip you
can<00:01:19.380> clip<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:20.040> place<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
can clip it in place here like so and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.649 
can clip it in place here like so and
you<00:01:21.900> could<00:01:22.110> even<00:01:22.229> go<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> use<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> stand

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
you could even go to use it as a stand

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.160 
you could even go to use it as a stand
if<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.049> chose<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> desktop<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:28.110> can

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
if you chose on a desktop you can

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.429 
if you chose on a desktop you can
release<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.369> clip<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:29.820> well<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.810> rotate<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
release that clip as well and rotate it

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.010 
release that clip as well and rotate it
to<00:01:31.470> any<00:01:32.009> position<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.759> choose<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.750> that's<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to any position you choose so that's the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.719 
to any position you choose so that's the
belt<00:01:34.229> clip<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.490> case

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
belt clip and then we have the case

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.310 
belt clip and then we have the case
itself<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.479> here<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.780> see<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> very

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
itself so here you can see the very

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.760 
itself so here you can see the very
vibrant<00:01:37.590> atomic<00:01:38.280> colors<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> you've<00:01:40.560> got<00:01:40.619> this

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
vibrant atomic colors so you've got this

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.359 
vibrant atomic colors so you've got this
sort<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.060> green<00:01:42.060> inside<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> camera<00:01:44.220> lens

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
sort of green inside on the camera lens

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.830 
sort of green inside on the camera lens
and<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.630> these<00:01:46.159> let's<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.600> see

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and on these let's see you can just see

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.899 
and on these let's see you can just see
that<00:01:49.020> probably<00:01:49.409> looks<00:01:49.649> black<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> light

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
that probably looks black in the light

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.649 
that probably looks black in the light
and<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:52.560> does<00:01:52.799> have<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:53.220> blue<00:01:53.790> sort<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.180> purple

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
and it does have a blue sort of purple

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.859 
and it does have a blue sort of purple
tinge<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.590> do<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.579> can

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
tinge to it so what we can do is we can

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.330 
tinge to it so what we can do is we can
unclip<00:02:01.100> this<00:02:02.149> silicone<00:02:03.860> outer

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
unclip this silicone outer

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.220 
unclip this silicone outer
protective<00:02:07.270> layer<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:09.280> then<00:02:09.550> we've<00:02:10.300> got<00:02:10.539> is<00:02:10.750> a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
protective layer and then we've got is a

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.150 
protective layer and then we've got is a
harder<00:02:11.890> shell<00:02:12.670> in<00:02:13.120> which<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.900> galaxy<00:02:14.379> s3<00:02:14.890> will

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
harder shell in which the galaxy s3 will

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.530 
harder shell in which the galaxy s3 will
sit<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.459> two<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.780> disconnect<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:18.269> at<00:02:19.269> these

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
sit in two so you disconnect it at these

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.050 
sit in two so you disconnect it at these
positions<00:02:20.470> ground<00:02:22.440> edge<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:24.519> we're<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.760> so

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
positions ground edge and we're in so

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.470 
positions ground edge and we're in so
what<00:02:25.330> got<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.930> soft<00:02:28.709> lining<00:02:29.709> there<00:02:30.239> we<00:02:31.239> take

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
what got is a soft lining there we take

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.199 
what got is a soft lining there we take
the<00:02:31.569> device<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:32.200> sits<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:32.950> snugly<00:02:33.489> like<00:02:33.819> so

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209

and you can see got cut out for the
camera<00:02:36.910> lens<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:38.260> then<00:02:38.440> put<00:02:38.769> this<00:02:39.730> back<00:02:40.090> over

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
camera lens you then put this back over

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.270 
camera lens you then put this back over
the<00:02:40.599> top<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.440> can<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.769> see<00:02:41.860> here

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
the top and you can just see here

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.120 
the top and you can just see here
there's<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.549> clear<00:02:43.420> plastic<00:02:43.720> membrane<00:02:44.200> and

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
there's a clear plastic membrane and

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.250 
there's a clear plastic membrane and
it's<00:02:45.280> got<00:02:45.489> cut<00:02:45.970> out<00:02:46.180> for<00:02:46.390> some<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.690> senses

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
it's got cut out for some of the senses

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.009 
it's got cut out for some of the senses
I'd<00:02:47.829> also<00:02:48.069> cut<00:02:48.519> out<00:02:48.700> for<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.209> home<00:02:49.420> button<00:02:49.690> and

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
I'd also cut out for the home button and

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.770 
I'd also cut out for the home button and
then<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.910> clips<00:02:52.269> on<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.489> case<00:02:54.700> by<00:02:55.390> oxide

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
then that clips on to the case by oxide

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.930 
then that clips on to the case by oxide
so<00:02:56.560> that's<00:02:56.709> already<00:02:56.950> offering<00:02:57.459> quite<00:02:57.730> a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
so that's already offering quite a

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.150 
so that's already offering quite a
decent<00:02:58.660> level<00:02:59.019> of<00:02:59.230> protection<00:02:59.379> it's<00:02:59.920> added

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
decent level of protection it's added

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.610 
decent level of protection it's added
some<00:03:00.310> extra<00:03:00.400> thickness<00:03:00.910> still<00:03:01.810> go<00:03:01.959> access<00:03:02.410> to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
some extra thickness still go access to

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.830 
some extra thickness still go access to
the<00:03:02.739> charging<00:03:03.280> port<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:04.470> power<00:03:05.470> button<00:03:05.950> there

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
the charging port and power button there

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.830 
the charging port and power button there
screen<00:03:07.840> is<00:03:07.989> still<00:03:08.400> fully<00:03:09.400> usable<00:03:11.069> like<00:03:12.069> so<00:03:12.840> and

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
screen is still fully usable like so and

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.960 
screen is still fully usable like so and
then<00:03:13.989> we've<00:03:14.200> got<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:15.569> silicone<00:03:16.569> outer<00:03:17.970> shell

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
then we've got the silicone outer shell

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.470 
then we've got the silicone outer shell
that<00:03:19.180> we<00:03:19.269> clip<00:03:19.569> on<00:03:20.130> around<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.370> now<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:22.180> can

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
that we clip on around it now this can

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.020 
that we clip on around it now this can
take<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.750> minute<00:03:23.109> or<00:03:23.230> so<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.440> fit<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.549> all<00:03:24.670> quite

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
take a minute or so to fit it all quite

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.680 
take a minute or so to fit it all quite
nicely<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.130> but<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.370> get<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.579> idea<00:03:27.700> you've

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
nicely to it but you get the idea you've

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.550 
nicely to it but you get the idea you've
then<00:03:28.840> got<00:03:28.920> rubber<00:03:29.920> pieces<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.760> go<00:03:30.790> across

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
then got rubber pieces that go across

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.900 
then got rubber pieces that go across
the<00:03:32.560> charging<00:03:33.459> port<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.790> seal<00:03:37.269> it<00:03:37.419> up<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.930> got

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
the charging port to seal it up you got

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.059 
the charging port to seal it up you got
microphone<00:03:39.910> cuts<00:03:40.180> out<00:03:40.329> there<00:03:40.680> then<00:03:41.680> got<00:03:41.919> the

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
microphone cuts out there then got the

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.879 
microphone cuts out there then got the
same<00:03:42.340> for<00:03:42.669> the<00:03:43.000> headphone<00:03:43.989> jack<00:03:44.230> on<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.650> top

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
same for the headphone jack on the top

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.460 
same for the headphone jack on the top
so<00:03:45.579> that's<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.970> in<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.630> sort<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.019> defender

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
so that's it in the sort of defender

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.789 
so that's it in the sort of defender
case<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:49.239> power<00:03:49.450> button<00:03:49.720> is<00:03:49.959> now<00:03:50.169> sort<00:03:50.769> of

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
case the power button is now sort of

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.360 
case the power button is now sort of
replaced<00:03:51.160> with<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:51.579> raised<00:03:51.989> rubber<00:03:53.370> button

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
replaced with this raised rubber button

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.849 
replaced with this raised rubber button
same<00:03:55.090> for<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.299> volume<00:03:55.599> keys<00:03:55.840> and<00:03:56.530> then<00:03:56.680> that

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
same for the volume keys and then that

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.750 
same for the volume keys and then that
can<00:03:57.190> sit<00:03:58.030> within<00:03:58.599> the<00:03:58.840> belt<00:03:59.019> clip<00:03:59.290> like<00:03:59.799> so<00:04:00.069> so

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
can sit within the belt clip like so so

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.370 
can sit within the belt clip like so so
that's<00:04:00.880> an<00:04:00.970> unboxing<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.569> demonstration<00:04:02.200> of

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
that's an unboxing and demonstration of

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.080 
that's an unboxing and demonstration of
the<00:04:02.590> otterbox<00:04:03.040> defender<00:04:03.160> case<00:04:03.579> for<00:04:04.000> the
