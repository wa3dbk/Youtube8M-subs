00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.789
 space and tech friends 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.349
 welcome back for an appointment 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.630
 important 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.939
 here he is finally in our hands 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.150
 thanks as usual to friends of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.160
 breno via puntocom we can show you 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.220
 the htc one m8 unboxing this the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.460
 name that htc has decided to give to his 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.560
 new top of the range 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:47.820
 this is the gray version so to speak 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.630
 the one in brushed aluminum put 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.130
 a moment aside the terminal though 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.010
 definitely the thing that interests us most 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.790
 but already the packaging to a small one 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:06.180
 surprise in addition to the feeder from 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.229
 1.5 million wall for we cable 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.359
 usb micro usb 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.649
 the headphones that of course are not 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:18.329
 audio beats 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:21.179
 but still they look good and seem 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:24.499
 also have good sound quality 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.499
 we will try them 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:33.090
 the thing that surprised us the most 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:36.210
 in addition to the inevitable presence of the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.569
 paper clip to extract the nano sim is 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.499
 certainly the presence of a cover thing 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:46.679
 unfortunately unfortunately htc instead like 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:48.929
 it happened if i'm not mistaken for juan max ha 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:53.340
 decided to include this part of this one 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:55.020
 soft silicone cover and in this one 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.740
 coloring that a little takes up the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.100
 terminal nice surprise even if you 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.850
 I say that cover the aesthetics of this 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.929
 smartphone is a bit of a sacrilege 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.290
 let's get it out of his film 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.140
 protective 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.430
 here it is the case to say it all over the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.340
 its splendor this beautiful 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:27.010
 beautiful device the treatment 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.659
 which was given to aluminum 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.840
 extremely smooth surface 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.849
 it makes me think that the grip wo n't be 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.780
 strong of this terminal but aesthetics 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:41.980
 I can assure you it really benefits 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:47.530
 you can see a lot this beautiful 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:50.659
 brushing you know all like htc 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.980
 and above all its administrator 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:57.290
 delegate have been really careful 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.409
 to the oils used to obtain this later 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.000
 result we really talk about tens if 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:07.040
 I was perhaps not even 150 oils used 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.709
 to then arrive at this result 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.480
 really really not bad 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.810
 one of the novelties is the dual camera 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.659
 as well as a novelty is represented by the 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.010
 double flash led 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:22.819
 we will certainly have a way to deepen it 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:28.069
 the question we recall processor 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:32.780
 new snapdragon 801 larger display 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:39.519
 let's turn it on bigger display 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:43.659
 however, it does include the on-screen buttons 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:51.530
 new written as google wishes with 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:52.269
 the indication power and by android that 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.829
 to say 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:04:00.310
 we are really anxious to be able to test it 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:04.609
 a device that promises performance 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:08.840
 especially sensational from the point of 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:11.299
 audio view thanks to the two speakers that 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.080
 they are not an absolute novelty with respect to 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:19.010
 previous model but htc has 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.310
 reaffirmed to have increased the volumes to 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.830
 25 percent sound quality 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:31.070
 I show you in the sides this is the 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.750
 cart for the sim key ignition e 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.060
 shutdown has been moved here to 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:40.040
 right and I would say definitely better 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.800
 compared to before you don't go for me 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.990
 especially in the very first models in 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:51.710
 convenient entry way for the micro sd 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.500
 memory that is 16 gigabytes integrated 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.180
 with expansion someone will prefer this 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.340
 choice someone will say that maybe it was 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.850
 better to have 32 of them 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.340
 by default I say that 32 psd as notre 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.729
 would be the most beautiful thing but in short that 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.479
 16 more expansion is not bad 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:16.850
 volume rocker and below 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:21.990
 entry from three and a half for the jack e 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:24.320
 really great input the micro usb 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.740
 the very first sensations are really 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:32.490
 very good, I'm enjoying it and I have to tell you 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.360
 who was a bit skeptical about the 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.070
 new the fact that it could really 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.600
 give 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:44.640
 a truly new product sensation 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.020
 really improved and I owe myself instead 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.610
 to rethink the device in these first 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.080
 in these first hours of use me is 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.420
 thrilling speech that will come later 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.890
 pitted for good with regards to 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.680
 the camera 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.020
 let's see if htc this round managed to 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.440
 convince me more regarding 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.940
 photographic quality 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:14.070
 so I just have to leave you at 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:16.320
 next focus on this device and then 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.120
 I tell you stay tuned 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.810
 here on spaces and techno and we'll see some 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.810
 nice bye
