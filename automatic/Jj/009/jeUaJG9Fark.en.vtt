00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.769
 nuclear medicine is a specialty 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.070
 that conducts diagnostic studies by 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.959
 images called gamma grams are based 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.420
 in the detection of a small amount 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:20.060
 of gamma radiation that is introduced at 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.180
 patient usually in one's vein 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.850
 of his arms nuclear medicine has 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.789
 also therapeutic uses in diseases 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.070
 specific as is the elevated function 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.559
 thyroid cancer and 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.410
 thyroid among other ailments 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.479
 the graphic gamma images represent 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.600
 changes in the function of an organ 

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:42.769
 while radiological studies 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.260
 represent the alterations in 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.409
 structure of the same requiring a 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.780
 external source of x-rays both in the 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.030
 nuclear medicine studies like those of 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.089
 radiology can be made cuts 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.579
 sections of an organ known as 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.789
 tomographic cuts gamma grams 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.129
 spect zinc a photon emission tomography 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.590
 only then tomographic studies 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.820
 Functional and the act computer tomography 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.370
 they are studies like structural graphs 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.950
 currently there is no single method 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.220
 that is perfect and in each of them 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.250
 great advantages are known but also 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.470
 limitations that should be considered 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.869
 technological advances worldwide in 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.790
 the last years are focused on the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.369
 combination of imaging techniques 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.770
 complementary to each other and so 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.990
 natural fit perfectly 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.869
 benefits of a method covering the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.780
 weaknesses of the other tomography by 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.869
 nuclear medicine expert and radiological 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.240
 7 have been positioned as pillars in the 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.710
 non-invasive multiple diagnosis 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.990
 diseases 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.780
 the first one evaluates the function of a 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.360
 organ and the second the anatomy of the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.850
 very often the information 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.580
 of both methods can match between 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.920
 yes but it is not uncommon to find information 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.460
 different contributed by the two methods 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.050
 from different approaches which 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.310
 strengthens the medical diagnosis and 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.519
 decisionmaking 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.070
 the combined images expect 7 in a 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.630
 only equipment represent a technology 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.260
 of tip with great 3 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.400
 diagnostic and rapidity in its realization 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.160
 bringing a benefit to patients 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.670
 as well as his doctors who refer him 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.470
 thanks to the spectrum it is possible to combine 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.930
 and combine the two traditional methods 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.240
 of imaging the gammagram 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.910
 conventional nuclear medicine and the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.370
 study of x- rays both in cuts 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.860
 tomographic the equipment that we have 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.770
 currently has several detectors what 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.590
 which allows us to detect precisely 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.710
 the radiation in a patient in lower 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.530
 time allows us to be more agile in the 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.230
 evaluation of our study decreases 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.810
 50% acquisition time 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.970
 compared to the study of medicine 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.820
 conventional nuclear but when decreasing 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.470
 time also makes the amount 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.030
 of radiation that we administer 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.250
 the patient to do this study be 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.650
 50% lower than what is done in study 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.890
 conventional that is to say it is one more study 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.020
 fast with less variation compared to 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.270
 the 5 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.570
 and when combined with a tomography it 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.370
 more accurate forecasts taking 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.659
 false possibilities 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.060
 the minor of a conventional study the 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.730
 integration of spect images 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.599
 contributes studies with greater capacity of 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.879
 detection and greater diagnostic accuracy 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.060
 nuclear medicine is a specialty 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.879
 cutting edge medical is a very method 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.420
 insurance practically without risks for 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.970
 health is not invasive or painful and 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.360
 allows to obtain fast results and 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.609
 precise the speed and precision that 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.459
 help the patient and their clinician 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.560
 to make the most pertinent decision and without 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.560
 waste of time 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.900
 thanks to nuclear medicine it is possible 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.480
 make diagnoses about diseases 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.600
 related to the bones heart 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.090
 the brain the nervous blood system 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.060
 and lymphatic and diseases 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.720
 oncological ie the diseases 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.250
 related to cancer offers 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.530
 useful procedures for all 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.650
 specialties of medicine as 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.980
 cardiology pediatrics neuropsychiatry and 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.620
 nephrology medicine technology 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.030
 nuclear is very important and is at 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.030
 cutting edge of the methods of 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.979
 tip diagnostics however it is very 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.930
 important to have the support of the 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.450
 clinicians who are the ones 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.430
 work together with us to 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.090
 be able to offer the patient better 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.500
 best diagnostics technology 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.200
 more timely diagnoses for 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.510
 patient benefit medicine 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.700
 nuclear is a diagnostic technology 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.919
 that can be applied for patients 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.530
 from newborn infancy 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.590
 teenagers and adults both men 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.280
 as a women is a methodology 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.570
 sure that it provides accurate diagnoses 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.850
 basically the only limitation that 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.460
 may have is that it is not used in the 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.980
 female patients who are or have 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.440
 Suspected pregnancy and should have 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.690
 certain restrictions with people 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.970
 that lives during a period of 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.460
 short time that will be indicated in your 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.470
 moment but it's usually a 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.840
 methodology that can be used in 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.150
 all patients and both for the 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.350
 different medical specialties and 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.760
 general medicine 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:50.220
 the treatment is faster 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.190
 having the fastest type allows that 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.910
 the patients are less time in the 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.860
 equipment and this makes us have less 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.050
 delays in the programming of our 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.060
 appointments greater availability in the 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.380
 studies for passion and for the doctor 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.290
 that is not a day 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.660
 the nuclear medicine studies consist 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.180
 of three phases administration of the 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.130
 radioactive substance the taking of 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.050
 images by destroying a 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.520
 small amount of radioactive material 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.540
 and the interpretation of the images 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.060
 Our work team is 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.880
 made up of technical nurses 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.510
 administrative staff and a doctor 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.700
 all with high level of training with 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.200
 courses that give you training for 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.590
 the handling and use of substances 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:40.280
 radioactive considering these as 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:43.830
 Occupational staff mind exposed 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.740
 that gives security to the patient but 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:49.110
 security to our same staff all 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.810
 they have been working for several years 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.810
 with a very important experience in the 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.700
 nuclear medicine area allows me 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.330
 invite them to 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.800
 to participate with us in this 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.930
 development and in this evolution of the 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.550
 new measurement of nuclear with the great 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.550
 benefit you have for the patient
