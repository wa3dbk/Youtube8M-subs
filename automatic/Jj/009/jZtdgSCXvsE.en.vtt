00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.589
 there is a need and mud in mpdft 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.450
 Hi, my name is Victor Oak and 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.420
 Welcome to the chess central 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.780
 Today we are going to learn how to wear the watch. 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.750
 chess that piece in which you pull out of the act 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.779
 very important board in tournaments and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.369
 that leaves a game really 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.039
 interesting the chess clock are in the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.500
 true two clocks separated inside 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.840
 of a box that also contains two 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 drive pins 1 for each of the drive 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.030
 players and also a flag for 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
 each of the clocks indicating the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.050
 player timeout 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.149
 before departure 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.010
 each player receives an amount of 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.170
 predetermined time 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.539
 can be like an agreement in games 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.940
 or it is determined 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.930
 organization of the tournament when it is 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.629
 case 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.570
 the player has to perform all his 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.420
 bidding with a shorter amount of time 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.190
 of what he has available if he 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.170
 exceeds the amount of time you have 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.450
 available so he loses his 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.280
 departure and regardless of the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.729
 the triggering procedure 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.610
 of the clock is as follows the player 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.330
 makes its movement on the board and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.680
 subsequently pulls the pin on its side 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.170
 on the clock 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.420
 this way your own clock will 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.759
 stop working and the clock 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.030
 opponent will start working 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.000
 counting the time of the opponent his 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.970
 opponent to do the same 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.720
 his bid on the board will trigger 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.180
 then his pin on the clock doing 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.549
 that his watch will stop working 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.009
 and your watch starts working 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.740
 counting their time when the player 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.780
 let your flag fall it loses 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.979
 indefinite departure from the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.979
 position on the board 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.600
 there are two cases where the fall 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.610
 arrow does not result in victory 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.890
 the first one is what we see here 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.470
 in this image in which one of the players 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.580
 lost time but no one charged that 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.530
 It is to work 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.170
 with that the players continued 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.360
 playing until there is the second arrow in the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.940
 second player also fell 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.680
 in which case the match does not end with 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.920
 win to neither side 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.780
 it ends in a tie a second case is 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.269
 when one of the players has no more 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.040
 time to play but if the opponent does not 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.940
 enough material to overcome the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.709
 match 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.450
 as is the case of this image in which the 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.579
 white only the king has what is not 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.190
 enough to win the match 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.769
 white people do not win when I 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.880
 I tried black, the match ended. 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:52.250
 in a draw and that's it a lot of people 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.560
