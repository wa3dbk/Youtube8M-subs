foreshorten as I go around the skull and
also<00:00:47.070> where<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> need<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> go<00:00:48.510> back<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.989> space

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
also where I need to go back in space

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
going to have a little bit of volume so

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.110 
going to have a little bit of volume so
you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.739> how<00:00:59.460> I'm<00:00:59.850> going<00:01:02.120> back

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you can see here how I'm going back

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.630 
you can see here how I'm going back
across<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.629> skull<00:01:04.199> how<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> rope<00:01:04.830> would<00:01:05.070> go<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
across the skull how a rope would go you

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.250 
across the skull how a rope would go you
know<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.060> doesn't<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.810> hair<00:01:07.140> it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
know it doesn't it's not like hair it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740 
know it doesn't it's not like hair it
doesn't<00:01:07.470> fall<00:01:07.830> flat<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.540> got

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
doesn't fall flat it's actually got

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.320 
doesn't fall flat it's actually got
dimension<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.920> I'm<00:01:11.220> putting<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> ovals

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
dimension so I'm putting the ovals

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.880 
dimension so I'm putting the ovals
closer<00:01:12.750> together

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.010 

I'm<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.460> another<00:01:21.020> smaller

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
I'm going to do another smaller

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.340 
I'm going to do another smaller
dreadlock<00:01:22.590> again<00:01:23.210> kind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.360> an<00:01:24.479> oval<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.170> its

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
dreadlock again kind of an oval in its

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.640 
dreadlock again kind of an oval in its
total<00:01:25.710> shape<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:27.720> one's<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.350> kind<00:01:28.590> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
total shape this one's going to kind of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.749 
total shape this one's going to kind of
fall<00:01:29.450> like<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.750> against<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> face<00:01:32.570> and

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
fall like that against the face and

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.020 
fall like that against the face and
again<00:01:35.759> kind<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.390> always<00:01:37.009> marking<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.909> my

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
again kind of always marking to my

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.490 
again kind of always marking to my
perspective<00:01:39.689> lines<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.380> get<00:01:42.200> what<00:01:43.200> point

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
perspective lines so you get what point

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:54.859 
perspective lines so you get what point
these<00:01:43.680> lines<00:01:44.070> are<00:01:44.310> vanishing<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:50.960> again<00:01:53.869> this

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
these lines are vanishing to again this

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.780 
these lines are vanishing to again this
needs<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.320> little<00:01:55.470> body<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.340> top<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.729> the

of objects and the patterns that they

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.140 
of objects and the patterns that they
make<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.860> don't<00:02:17.100> want<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.460> concentrate<00:02:17.880> on

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
just because of the complexity but if I

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.410 
just because of the complexity but if I
knew<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.260> had<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> do<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.310> as<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:38.850> doing<00:02:39.090> Bob

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
knew I had to do that as I was doing Bob

knew I had to do that as I was doing Bob
Marley's<00:02:39.930> life<00:02:40.200> story<00:02:40.590> or<00:02:41.220> what<00:02:41.610> have<00:02:41.850> you

Marley's life story or what have you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.180 
Marley's life story or what have you

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
then I would find a way to make this

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.020 
then I would find a way to make this
these<00:02:47.190> dreadlocks<00:02:47.760> into<00:02:48.480> one<00:02:48.900> shape<00:02:50.030> other

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
these dreadlocks into one shape other

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.820 
these dreadlocks into one shape other
words<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.600> wouldn't<00:02:51.870> even<00:02:51.989> do<00:02:52.230> any<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.680> these

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
words I wouldn't even do any of these

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.180 
words I wouldn't even do any of these
sty<00:02:53.100> rations<00:02:53.550> I'd<00:02:53.760> kind<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.120> make<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.330> into<00:02:54.600> a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
sty rations I'd kind of make it into a

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.699 
sty rations I'd kind of make it into a
black<00:02:56.190> shape<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.910> has<00:02:57.090> kind<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.050> ropey<00:02:58.410> lines

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
black shape that has kind of ropey lines

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:08.090 
black shape that has kind of ropey lines
like<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.930> coming<00:03:00.930> off<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.650> know<00:03:07.100> make

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
like this coming off of it you know make

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.310 
like this coming off of it you know make
use<00:03:08.370> your<00:03:08.610> light<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.030> darks<00:03:10.250> if<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:12.180> must<00:03:12.510> go

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
use your light and darks if you must go

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.140 
use your light and darks if you must go
back<00:03:13.470> with<00:03:13.739> white<00:03:13.980> anchor<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.640> computer

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
back with white anchor on the computer

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.020 
back with white anchor on the computer
and<00:03:15.330> do<00:03:15.540> do<00:03:16.350> highlights<00:03:17.040> what<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.430> need<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.790> do

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
and do do highlights what you need to do

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.420 
and do do highlights what you need to do
is<00:03:18.510> make<00:03:19.230> sure<00:03:19.260> you've<00:03:19.709> got<00:03:19.739> enough<00:03:19.920> white

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
is make sure you've got enough white

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.699 
is make sure you've got enough white
space<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:21.030> there<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.540> establish<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:24.440> shape<00:03:25.440> of

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
space in there to establish the shape of

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.840 
space in there to establish the shape of
these<00:03:25.890> coils<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.640> hair<00:03:31.250> from<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.340> cartooning

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
these coils of hair from a cartooning

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.880 
these coils of hair from a cartooning
perspective<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.810> think<00:03:33.840> that's<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.530> safest

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
perspective I think that's the safest

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.759 
perspective I think that's the safest
way<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.160> go<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.790> put<00:03:36.690> them<00:03:36.840> in<00:03:36.989> as<00:03:37.260> big<00:03:37.530> black

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
way to go is to put them in as big black

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.690 
way to go is to put them in as big black
shapes<00:03:38.540> keeping<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.720> mind<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:41.040> underlying

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
shapes keeping in mind this underlying

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.840 
shapes keeping in mind this underlying
structure<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.810> is<00:03:42.989> here<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:46.640> is<00:03:47.640> how

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
structure that is here and that is how

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.630 
structure that is here and that is how
you<00:03:47.910> draw<00:03:48.150> dreadlocks
