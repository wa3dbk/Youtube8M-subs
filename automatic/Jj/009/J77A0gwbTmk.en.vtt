as<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:14.340> know<00:00:14.639> or<00:00:15.299> at<00:00:15.599> least<00:00:15.839> as<00:00:15.960> far<00:00:16.139> as

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
as we all know or at least as far as

as we all know or at least as far as
we're<00:00:16.440> concerned<00:00:17.029> backbreakers<00:00:18.029> gameplay<00:00:18.539> is

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
we're concerned backbreakers gameplay is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.320 
we're concerned backbreakers gameplay is
based<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.260> real-time<00:00:19.590> physics<00:00:20.400> many<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.150> us

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
based on real-time physics many of us

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.870 
based on real-time physics many of us
believe<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.380> even<00:00:23.070> believe<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.550> at<00:00:23.699> one

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
believe this I even believe it at one

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.939 
believe this I even believe it at one
point<00:00:24.090> still<00:00:24.990> believe<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> certain

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
point still believe it to a certain

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.950 
point still believe it to a certain
degree<00:00:26.119> now<00:00:27.119> I'm<00:00:27.269> coming<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.720> conclusion

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
degree now I'm coming to the conclusion

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.830 
degree now I'm coming to the conclusion
that<00:00:28.460> backbreakers<00:00:29.460> physics<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.630> not

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
that backbreakers physics is not

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.959 
that backbreakers physics is not
represented<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:32.250> hundred<00:00:32.550> percent<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
represented one hundred percent of the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.690 
represented one hundred percent of the
time<00:00:33.210> now<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.050> all<00:00:34.350> know<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> tackles

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
time now we all know that the tackles

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.420 
time now we all know that the tackles
you'll<00:00:36.480> never<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.960> those<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.500> duplicated

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you'll never see those are duplicated

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.700 
you'll never see those are duplicated
and<00:00:38.550> we're<00:00:39.239> all<00:00:39.329> aware<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.200> game<00:00:40.440> does

forth but the more I played this game
the<00:00:48.660> more<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.989> more<00:00:49.170> I'm<00:00:49.230> starting<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.620> see

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
the more and more I'm starting to see

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.689 
the more and more I'm starting to see
many<00:00:51.239> flaws<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.629> need<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.350> improved<00:00:52.890> I've

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
many flaws that need to be improved I've

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.029 
many flaws that need to be improved I've
made<00:00:53.910> videos<00:00:54.270> about<00:00:54.300> those<00:00:54.809> things<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.890> I

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
made videos about those things and I

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
made videos about those things and I
want<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> talk<00:00:56.460> about<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.820> physics<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
want to talk about the physics and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.250 
want to talk about the physics and
here's<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.989> question<00:00:58.230> how<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.960> physics<00:01:00.960> be

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
here's a question how can physics be

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.969 
here's a question how can physics be
fully<00:01:01.590> represented<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.550> back<00:01:02.850> breaker<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.979> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
fully represented in back breaker if the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.120 
fully represented in back breaker if the
physical<00:01:05.519> body<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.119> not<00:01:06.750> representing<00:01:07.590> our

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
physical body is not representing our

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.210 
physical body is not representing our
Pete<00:01:08.580> how<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.360> backbreaker<00:01:09.960> fully<00:01:10.409> represent

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
Pete how can backbreaker fully represent

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.539 
Pete how can backbreaker fully represent
physics<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:13.110> physical<00:01:13.650> body<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.250> not

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
physics if the physical body is not

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.960 
physics if the physical body is not
fully<00:01:15.170> represented<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:17.310> answer<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.850> we

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
fully represented and the answer that we

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600 
fully represented and the answer that we
all<00:01:18.119> should<00:01:18.390> conclude<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.979> there<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.460> no

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
all should conclude is that there is no

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.760 
all should conclude is that there is no
way<00:01:20.820> possible<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:22.200> game<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.740> be

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
way possible that this game can be

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310 
way possible that this game can be
completely<00:01:23.280> physics-based<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.840> physical

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
completely physics-based if the physical

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
game and from what we know logically yes

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.790 
game and from what we know logically yes
we<00:02:56.360> know<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.780> tackles<00:02:57.200> aren't<00:02:57.350> good<00:02:57.500> yes

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
we know that the tackles will not be

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.420 
we know that the tackles will not be
duplicated<00:02:59.570> yes<00:03:00.470> we<00:03:00.680> can<00:03:00.709> understand<00:03:01.340> that

duplicated yes we can understand that

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.520 
duplicated yes we can understand that
the<00:03:01.640> tackles<00:03:02.150> are<00:03:02.269> physics-based<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:03.350> what

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
the tackles are physics-based and what

the tackles are physics-based and what
about<00:03:03.650> everything<00:03:04.130> else<00:03:04.430> because<00:03:04.970> I've<00:03:05.090> been

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
about everything else because I've been

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.240 
about everything else because I've been
seeing<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.600> lot<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:05.810> players<00:03:06.170> fusing<00:03:07.040> together

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
seeing a lot of players fusing together

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.340 
seeing a lot of players fusing together
in<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:07.880> game<00:03:08.120> I've<00:03:08.360> been<00:03:08.570> seeing<00:03:08.810> players<00:03:09.080> go

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
in this game I've been seeing players go

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.440 
in this game I've been seeing players go
directly<00:03:09.830> through<00:03:10.010> each<00:03:10.370> other<00:03:10.610> what<00:03:11.209> makes

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
directly through each other what makes

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.660 
directly through each other what makes
this<00:03:11.630> game<00:03:11.870> superior<00:03:12.440> than<00:03:12.590> madden<00:03:13.040> well<00:03:13.580> as

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
this game superior than madden well as

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.550 
this game superior than madden well as
far<00:03:13.910> as<00:03:14.030> we<00:03:14.150> were<00:03:14.269> concerned<00:03:14.300> it<00:03:15.019> was<00:03:15.380> the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
far as we were concerned it was the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.400 
far as we were concerned it was the
physics<00:03:15.950> but<00:03:16.489> now<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.600> physics<00:03:18.049> is<00:03:18.200> not

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
physics but now the physics is not

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.319 
physics but now the physics is not
represented<00:03:19.160> completely<00:03:19.790> throughout<00:03:20.150> this

represented completely throughout this

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.170

game<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:21.350> is<00:03:21.470> clearly<00:03:21.769> evidence<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.700> that

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
game and it is clearly evidence of that

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.750 
game and it is clearly evidence of that
only<00:03:23.480> on<00:03:23.900> certain<00:03:24.110> place<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.829> only<00:03:25.250> under

times if this game was completely

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.080 
times if this game was completely
physics-based<00:03:33.829> then<00:03:34.730> there<00:03:34.940> would<00:03:35.060> be

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
physics-based then there would be

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.390 
physics-based then there would be
absolutely<00:03:35.269> no<00:03:35.930> way<00:03:36.230> he<00:03:36.860> would<00:03:37.040> be<00:03:37.160> able<00:03:37.250> to
