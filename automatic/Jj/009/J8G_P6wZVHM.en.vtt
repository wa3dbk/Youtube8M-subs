00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.770
 hello everyone and welcome to mac 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.960
 forever today we are in geneva 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.850
 for the international auto show 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.770
 hope to cross dominique chapatte sunu 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.239
 tim cook or so we can also go 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.800
 see all the builders who have 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.970
 so decided to equip their vehicles 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.830
 two cars please the new system 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.090
 of apple that allows to deport the screen 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.129
 iphone on the vehicle 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.540
 so here on the show there are brands 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.000
 who already have vehicles of 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.020
 presentation with the active system all 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.190
 throughout the year there are others 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.239
 vehicles that will be equipped ben it's 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.949
 will we see it today 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.480
 hope to have demos whose aura will 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.920
 is now on the volvo stand 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.390
 so volvo which is part of the few 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.190
 brands to present as pleasing 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.210
 today then because playes the present 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.070
 low in the form of small terminals 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.840
 interactive resources that will be accessible 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.089
 public I think where we can play 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.040
 with the interface the volvo presents so 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.810
 an interface that is mixed with that of 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.250
 vehicle so we have a part dedicated to 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.830
 the iphone is no longer a dedicated part down 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.420
 all the controls of the vehicle must be 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.470
 know in fact that this system it will be 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.450
 present on all models 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.310
 yeah so for now of course 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.990
 when the system will be set up this 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.060
 will be on hozjan models but the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.710
 brand account well suited that on all 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.820
 the volvo models and put to 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.820
 provision of all its users 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.910
 and then even beyond apple when we have 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.770
 asked the question about android 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.530
 about other compatible systems 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.209
 volvo was not at all closed off on 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.340
 apple in fact you see me that like a 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.380
 complement offered to its users in 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.209
 more of its integrated system but is not 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.410
 not at all closed to integrating others 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.190
 systems to satisfy others 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.229
 users 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:21.250
 school shaped carcass prospects 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:22.300
 vdn maybe do you then come from 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.800
 finish his press conference for 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.319
 present his new models and well 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.849
 heard because play with Joe Jack was there 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.140
 for the good occasion he does not have much 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.909
 spoken he especially said 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.769
 hello to the crowd in go way then after 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.730
 he left fairly quickly it's a little bit 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.989
 is also happening for bumps 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.879
 like knowing in that the terminals there 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.349
 do not allow to show in fact to 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.549
 journalists who are there 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.069
 the system in operation we see 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.569
 just icons of the home is 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.579
 currently there so there is a small 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.860
 crowd behind the prototype of 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.269
 volvo so do the demos then 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.030
 Apple as usual reserves 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.260
 obviously these little interviews so bsa 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.150
 all the big chains that are there 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.299
 so we will still try to do 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.299
 the forcing 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.380
 laura you were part of the few 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.000
 privileged who could thus return in 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.350
 the car with an engineer who 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.540
 is working for apple that 's exactly 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.700
 so I could get into the concept car 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.410
 who is right behind us at you 3 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.430
 million at it says here it's for 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.049
 that we are not allowed to open 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.040
 windows we did not have to do a lot of 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.880
 things actually even sit in 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.560
 it's already limit 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.630
 yeah actually someone opened me the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.620
 door and closed the door for me 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.790
 so that's a reflection of a little bit of 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.110
 play on living quarters ie that 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.340
 can touch it with the fingertips what 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.890
 you have the right to touch no 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.780
 I did not touch it 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.300
 the person who was with me from apple 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.130
 who did the whole demonstration that 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.750
 who made the orders I siri 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.580
 could not do the steel orders 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.410
 and call tim cook who did not want to 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.700
 he did not pick up so we called 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.470
 someone else or necessarily 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.120
 so if whose applications how 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.560
 you found them then it's still 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.480
 well finished well integrated good the sketch 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.550
 was advanced writing so they knew 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.980
 that they had to recall what 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.080
 destination they had to go back so we 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.540
 suspect that it was well prepared 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.070
 well honed otherwise compared to everything 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.150
 we saw in the living room you see we have 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.380
 saw that one of the apps that was 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.880
 not very accomplished which took time to 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.270
 connect there it was not the air 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.740
 to integrate 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.260
 it's still she had good 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.590
 integrated we make an order it happens 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.010
 in the process, we ask a 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.410
 sushi restaurant 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.850
 we find 10 in the wake and 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.350
 the touch screen is very responsive in the end 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.430
 week sailboats from the outside yes 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.820
 it's very very reactive 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.190
 there is also a button on the steering wheel 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.480
 so to use siri center 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.530
 directly in the applications so 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.610
 that's it's reminded that it's 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.070
 independent carp we can have 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.470
 six reais price yeah without necessarily because 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.570
 please and then yaakaar play with 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.850
 a touch interface that reminds low 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.110
 a lot to ios apple told us that 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.479
 it was voluntary who did not want 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.600
 lose but very simplified very 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.090
 involved so there is that the messages the 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.200
 phone and made music here 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.520
 then we can play the playlists we go 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.350
 not change them to all options 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.729
 were embalmed finally we just 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.260
 the essentials as soon as we are driving we have 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.640
 want to have immediate access 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.570
 to be able to easily call from 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.090
 hang up easily is always done 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.010
 a little hassle in cars yeah and 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.180
 then bad and music apps 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.440
 like spotify is for example blocked from 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.910
 third-party applications are not much 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.280
 for now that Apple has said that 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.510
 actually they had released a 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.890
 little bit of all these applications 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.390
 third alms imagines who will have a 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.919
 control that will be pretty drastic for 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.660
 because for now we have been told 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.340
 that it would only concern music 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.410
 that's it but eventually we could 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.789
 could perhaps see happen sometimes 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.550
 the news of mac forever sure as pleasing 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.930
 him directly by thierry finally 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.979
 the lucky me I found it anyway 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.720
 a bit frustrating because the 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.370
 system is actually presented forward 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.940
 first we feel that apple had like 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.140
 target the auto show but he 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.160
 just give the builders ways to 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.570
 to make small words like that in 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.610
 catimini to the journalist has not yet 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.410
 really present to the general public and 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.430
 even models that are available 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.780
 they will be at the end of the year 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.160
 so I think for for us 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.750
 actually that before cars that 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.190
 wanted to buy a car on 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.210
 will be a lot more information from 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.190
 builders who will put that 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.450
 really ahead of here maybe the 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.740
 World of Paris The World of Cars 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.450
 who arrives at school 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.100
 and then shows that will follow 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.100
 actually I think the real 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.490
 year of two cars play will be rather 2015 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.490
 what
