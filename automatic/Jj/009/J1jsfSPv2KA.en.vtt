the<00:01:58.140> middle<00:01:58.619> middle<00:01:59.009> part<00:01:59.250> we've<00:01:59.430> also<00:01:59.549> got

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the middle middle part we've also got

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.270 
the middle middle part we've also got
the<00:01:59.880> inner<00:02:00.119> inside<00:02:01.049> flaps<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.829> little<00:02:02.159> bit

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the inner inside flaps just a little bit

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.060 
the inner inside flaps just a little bit
of<00:02:02.340> extra<00:02:02.520> protection<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.119> guess<00:02:03.829> there<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:04.890> go

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
of extra protection I guess there we go

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.649 
of extra protection I guess there we go
fold<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.820> out<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.270> kind<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.509> looks

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
fold that out like that kind of looks

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.990 
fold that out like that kind of looks
like<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.810> nice<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> plus<00:02:07.770> sign<00:02:08.099> which<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.670> good

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
like a nice a plus sign which is good

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.490 
like a nice a plus sign which is good
Hey<00:02:10.039> alrighty<00:02:11.180> now<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.379> inside

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
Hey alrighty now the inside

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.730 
Hey alrighty now the inside
here<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.780> guess<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.350> could<00:02:16.470> say<00:02:16.620> this

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
here is the I guess you could say this

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.050 
here is the I guess you could say this
is<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.730> top<00:02:18.260> protective<00:02:19.260> layer<00:02:20.060> again

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
is the the top protective layer again

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.700 
is the the top protective layer again
i'm<00:02:21.600> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.900> try<00:02:22.020> i'm<00:02:22.260> not<00:02:22.350> going<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.530> throw

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
i'm going to try i'm not going to throw

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.400 
i'm going to try i'm not going to throw
this<00:02:22.740> out<00:02:22.980> i<00:02:23.520> really<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.900> shape<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
this out i really like the shape and the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.860 
this out i really like the shape and the
color<00:02:25.710> i<00:02:26.130> think<00:02:26.400> i<00:02:26.550> might<00:02:26.970> try<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.420> use<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.720> may

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
color i think i might try and use it may

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.949 
color i think i might try and use it may
be<00:02:27.930> for<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:29.160> don't<00:02:29.640> know<00:02:29.790> maybe<00:02:30.000> like<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> mouse

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
be for I don't know maybe like a mouse

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.230 
be for I don't know maybe like a mouse
pad<00:02:31.260> or<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:32.640> could<00:02:32.760> use<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:32.910> as<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.209> a

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
pad or you could use it as like a

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.600 
pad or you could use it as like a
display<00:02:33.690> display<00:02:34.590> table<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.160> could<00:02:35.250> even<00:02:35.370> put

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
display display table you could even put

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.480 
display display table you could even put
the<00:02:35.700> iphone<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.420> top<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.459> it

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
of the day that you got it buddy able to

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.970 
of the day that you got it buddy able to
put<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.500> aside<00:02:44.100> here<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.470> then<00:02:46.470> here<00:02:46.770> we<00:02:46.800> go

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
put that aside here and then here we go

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.760 
put that aside here and then here we go
so<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.820> iphone<00:02:48.150> there<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.600> middle<00:02:48.750> as<00:02:49.590> you

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
so the iphone there in the middle as you

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.110 
so the iphone there in the middle as you
can<00:02:49.890> see<00:02:50.010> i<00:02:50.040> guess<00:02:50.220> they<00:02:50.520> just<00:02:50.550> really<00:02:50.940> wanted

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
can see i guess they just really wanted

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.590 
can see i guess they just really wanted
to<00:02:51.239> put<00:02:51.420> its<00:02:51.540> central<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.530> box<00:02:53.600> surrounded

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
to put its central in the box surrounded

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.920 
to put its central in the box surrounded
by<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.720> bunch<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.709> packing<00:02:56.340> peanuts<00:02:56.700> now<00:02:56.910> i<00:02:57.180> can

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
by a bunch of packing peanuts now i can

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.620 
by a bunch of packing peanuts now i can
honestly<00:02:58.110> say<00:02:58.470> off<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.980> haven't<00:02:59.910> seen<00:03:00.120> packing

peanuts<00:03:00.930> like<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.590> while<00:03:01.820> it's<00:03:02.820> a

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
peanuts like this in a while it's a

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.420 
peanuts like this in a while it's a
strange<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.920> apple<00:03:04.920> would<00:03:05.010> go<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.340> this

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
strange that apple would go in this

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.640 
strange that apple would go in this
direction<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:06.180> think<00:03:06.989> last<00:03:07.170> year<00:03:07.350> they<00:03:07.530> went

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
direction I think last year they went

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.520 
direction I think last year they went
with<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.860> saw<00:03:08.070> wait<00:03:08.310> now<00:03:08.459> here<00:03:08.640> we<00:03:08.700> go<00:03:08.790> yeah<00:03:09.690> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
with a saw wait now here we go yeah the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.470 
with a saw wait now here we go yeah the
circular<00:03:10.980> ones<00:03:11.160> they<00:03:11.880> do<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.239> them<00:03:12.360> this

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
circular ones they do have them this

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.900 
circular ones they do have them this
year<00:03:12.540> as<00:03:12.810> well<00:03:13.070> which<00:03:14.070> is<00:03:14.220> good<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.610> guess<00:03:14.790> in

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
year as well which is good so I guess in

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
year as well which is good so I guess in
a<00:03:14.970> way<00:03:15.000> they<00:03:15.239> kind<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.420> giving<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.720> two<00:03:15.900> for

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
a way they kind of giving you two for

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.220 
a way they kind of giving you two for
one<00:03:16.320> deal<00:03:16.860> there<00:03:17.180> so<00:03:18.180> not<00:03:18.720> only<00:03:18.750> do<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.110> get

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
one deal there so not only do you get

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.229 
one deal there so not only do you get
the<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:20.280> older<00:03:20.640> generation<00:03:21.470> ii<00:03:22.880> peanut<00:03:23.880> as<00:03:24.090> we

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
the the older generation ii peanut as we

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.080 
the the older generation ii peanut as we
call<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.780> industry<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.380> also<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.670> the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
call it in the industry and also the the

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.289 
call it in the industry and also the the
circular<00:03:27.799> cylinder<00:03:28.799> ones<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.970> we'll<00:03:30.209> just

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
circular cylinder ones and we'll just

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.360 
circular cylinder ones and we'll just
put<00:03:30.780> those<00:03:31.110> aside<00:03:31.500> there<00:03:31.799> as<00:03:31.920> well<00:03:32.570> yeah<00:03:33.570> and

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
put those aside there as well yeah and

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.580 
put those aside there as well yeah and
ok<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.430> i<00:03:35.910> guess<00:03:36.000> if<00:03:36.390> we<00:03:36.510> just<00:03:36.690> start<00:03:36.900> shoveling

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
ok so i guess if we just start shoveling

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.530 
ok so i guess if we just start shoveling
some<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.130> these<00:03:38.280> out<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:39.030> i<00:03:39.239> don't<00:03:39.450> know<00:03:39.480> if

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
some of these out and i don't know if

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.490 
some of these out and i don't know if
you<00:03:39.660> can<00:03:39.750> actually<00:03:40.019> say<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.230> on<00:03:40.470> camera

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
you can actually say that on camera

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.380 
you can actually say that on camera
actually<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.340> know<00:03:41.430> i<00:03:41.459> might<00:03:41.700> put<00:03:41.970> them<00:03:42.090> on

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
actually you know i might put them on

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.030 
actually you know i might put them on
there<00:03:42.630> as<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.989> display<00:03:43.549> now<00:03:44.549> yeah<00:03:45.260> okay<00:03:46.260> yeah<00:03:46.470> i

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
there as a display now yeah okay yeah i

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.080 
there as a display now yeah okay yeah i
don't<00:03:47.130> know<00:03:47.280> if<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.400> can<00:03:47.489> actually<00:03:47.610> see<00:03:47.790> this

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
don't know if you can actually see this

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.170 
don't know if you can actually see this
but<00:03:49.130> there<00:03:50.130> seems<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.459> be<00:03:50.579> two<00:03:50.610> different

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
but there seems to be two different

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
this is intentional if Apple actually

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
this is intentional if Apple actually
wanted<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:04.130> go<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.519> way<00:04:05.760> or<00:04:06.030> if<00:04:06.570> this<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:06.989> just

there was an invoice in the in the
bottom<00:04:51.240> there<00:04:51.570> with<00:04:52.560> some<00:04:52.680> paperwork<00:04:53.190> it

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
bottom there with some paperwork it

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.760 
bottom there with some paperwork it
doesn't<00:04:54.480> seem<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.720> be<00:04:54.810> there<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.080> year<00:04:55.290> but

that's<00:04:55.920> okay<00:04:56.190> i<00:04:56.220> guess<00:04:56.550> in<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:56.880> way<00:04:56.910> Apple<00:04:57.360> you

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
that's okay i guess in a way Apple you

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.630 
that's okay i guess in a way Apple you
know<00:04:57.600> they<00:04:57.660> like<00:04:57.840> to<00:04:58.190> look<00:04:59.190> after<00:04:59.400> the

know they like to look after the
environment<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.270> whatnot<00:05:01.110> so<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.770> know<00:05:01.890> less

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
environment and whatnot so you know less
