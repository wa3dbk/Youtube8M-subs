this stage in the tutorial and if you
guys<00:00:16.379> are<00:00:16.560> kind<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.860> wonder<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.370> don't<00:00:17.610> I

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
guys are kind of wonder and I don't I

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.100 
guys are kind of wonder and I don't I
don't<00:00:19.260> videotape<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.010> lot<00:00:20.280> of<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.520> things<00:00:20.760> that

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
don't videotape a lot of the things that

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.700 
don't videotape a lot of the things that
construct<00:00:22.110> only<00:00:23.750> I'm<00:00:24.750> locked<00:00:25.020> up<00:00:25.200> in<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.410> lot<00:00:25.590> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
construct only I'm locked up in a lot of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.380 
construct only I'm locked up in a lot of
patent<00:00:26.039> rights<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.610> now<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:27.000> different

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
patent rights right now with different

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.889 
patent rights right now with different
stuff<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.080> them<00:00:28.199> being<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:31.460> front<00:00:32.899> strut

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
stuff one of them being this front strut

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.860 
stuff one of them being this front strut
I<00:00:37.190> blueprinted<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.729> set<00:00:39.089> it<00:00:39.239> all<00:00:39.359> up<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
I blueprinted this and set it all up and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.430 
I blueprinted this and set it all up and
machined<00:00:40.679> it<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:40.949> myself<00:00:41.159> and<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.170> I<00:00:43.170> can

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
machined it all myself and and I can

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.079 
machined it all myself and and I can
build<00:00:43.649> them<00:00:43.739> cheaper<00:00:44.069> than<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.249> robot<00:00:44.699> struts

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
build them cheaper than the robot struts

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.029 
build them cheaper than the robot struts
and<00:00:45.389> I<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:46.019> they're<00:00:46.170> tougher<00:00:46.499> than<00:00:46.530> robart

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
and I think they're tougher than robart

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.540 
and I think they're tougher than robart
so<00:00:47.870> anyway<00:00:48.870> we'll<00:00:49.499> step<00:00:49.800> by<00:00:49.979> step<00:00:50.309> through

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
so anyway we'll step by step through

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.520 
so anyway we'll step by step through
this<00:00:50.760> rather<00:00:51.059> than<00:00:51.389> actual<00:00:51.870> procedural

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
this rather than actual procedural

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.989 
this rather than actual procedural
builds<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.129> guys<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.489> questions<00:00:53.549> you

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
builds if you guys have questions you

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.270 
builds if you guys have questions you
can<00:00:54.059> post<00:00:54.239> comments<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:57.149> narrative<00:00:57.539> below

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
can post comments to the narrative below

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.250 
can post comments to the narrative below
so<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.519> point<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.920> have<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.249> elevator

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
so at this point we have the elevator

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.109 
so at this point we have the elevator
servos<00:01:04.260> installed<00:01:05.780> only<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.259> one<00:01:08.119> hooked

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
servos installed only I have one hooked

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.789 
servos installed only I have one hooked
up<00:01:09.329> temporarily<00:01:12.289> kind<00:01:13.289> of<00:01:13.350> get<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> good<00:01:13.770> shot

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
up temporarily kind of get a good shot

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380 
up temporarily kind of get a good shot
of<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.219> I<00:01:14.369> had<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> build<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.149> bridge

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
of that I had to build that bridge

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.889 
of that I had to build that bridge
inside<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.609> make<00:01:17.609> room<00:01:17.880> form<00:01:18.890> this<00:01:20.899> thro

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
inside there to make room form this thro

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.310 
inside there to make room form this thro
arm<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.680> will<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.780> changed<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.109> like

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
arm here will get changed to one like

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.249 
arm here will get changed to one like
this<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.920> I'll<00:01:26.039> modify<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:28.109> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
this that I'll modify like that so it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.669 
this that I'll modify like that so it
has<00:01:28.469> the<00:01:28.829> proper<00:01:29.310> forward<00:01:30.090> throw<00:01:30.479> as<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
has the proper forward throw as it

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.359 
has the proper forward throw as it
throws<00:01:31.950> forward<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.759> needed<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.450> high<00:01:33.750> angle

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
throws forward I needed a high angle

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.679 
throws forward I needed a high angle
right<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.429> and<00:01:38.090> give<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.210> an<00:01:39.299> idea<00:01:39.390> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
right here and give you an idea that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.940 
right here and give you an idea that
this<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.380> loosen<00:01:40.859> inside<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.380> 256<00:01:43.380> connector

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
this is loosen inside the 256 connector

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.550 
this is loosen inside the 256 connector
right<00:01:44.130> now<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.789> have<00:01:45.420> some<00:01:45.659> solder<00:01:45.960> above<00:01:46.350> ones

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
right now I have some solder above ones

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.370 
right now I have some solder above ones
coming<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.189> will<00:01:47.429> actually<00:01:47.579> be<00:01:48.179> ones<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.140> use

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
coming that will actually be ones I use

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.560 
coming that will actually be ones I use
but<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:51.090> elevator<00:01:51.509> does<00:01:51.810> work

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.330 

and<00:01:58.570> they<00:01:58.659> get<00:01:58.840> an<00:01:58.960> idea<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.710> throw<00:02:02.340> these

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
and they get an idea of the throw these

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.040 
and they get an idea of the throw these
are<00:02:03.520> digital<00:02:04.060> servos<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:07.090> I'll<00:02:07.330> programming

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
are digital servos so I'll programming

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.720 
are digital servos so I'll programming
for<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:09.069> throw<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.580> everything<00:02:11.490> motors<00:02:12.490> in

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
for the throw and everything motors in

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.900 
for the throw and everything motors in
got<00:02:13.510> quite<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> bit<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.080> work<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.590> got<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.610> do<00:02:15.730> down

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
got quite a bit of work I got to do down

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.590 
got quite a bit of work I got to do down
here<00:02:15.940> for<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.480> rudder<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.910> is<00:02:19.090> going<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.330> be

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
here for the rudder this is going to be

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.699 
here for the rudder this is going to be
a<00:02:19.840> true<00:02:20.350> test<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.950> feet<00:02:21.340> here<00:02:21.959> but<00:02:22.959> my<00:02:23.290> servo<00:02:23.650> is

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
a true test of feet here but my servo is

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.160 
a true test of feet here but my servo is
going<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.950> sit<00:02:24.160> right<00:02:24.190> there<00:02:24.930> I'm<00:02:25.930> going<00:02:26.080> to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
going to sit right there I'm going to

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.580 
going to sit right there I'm going to
give<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.470> an<00:02:26.590> accurate<00:02:27.040> 90-degree<00:02:27.760> throw<00:02:28.590> my

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
give it an accurate 90-degree throw my

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.020 
give it an accurate 90-degree throw my
elevators<00:02:30.160> have<00:02:30.610> an<00:02:31.000> offset<00:02:32.310> 90<00:02:33.310> degree<00:02:33.670> throw

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
elevators have an offset 90 degree throw

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.160 
elevators have an offset 90 degree throw
and<00:02:37.030> they're<00:02:37.180> working<00:02:37.630> pretty<00:02:38.470> good<00:02:38.590> so

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
and they're working pretty good so

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.080 
and they're working pretty good so
that's<00:02:41.170> where<00:02:41.380> we're<00:02:41.560> at<00:02:41.620> in<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.890> back<00:02:45.090> this

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
that's where we're at in the back this

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.640 
that's where we're at in the back this
is<00:02:46.239> what<00:02:46.450> she's<00:02:46.660> starting<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.050> shape<00:02:47.290> up<00:02:47.500> to

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
is what she's starting to shape up to

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.960 
is what she's starting to shape up to
look<00:02:47.830> like<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.340> show<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:48.640> at<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.760> front

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
look like and show you at the front

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.400 
look like and show you at the front
looks<00:02:49.269> like<00:02:49.540> now<00:02:49.750> at<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.110> point<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:52.410> cut

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
looks like now at this point I just cut

that's<00:04:24.210> going<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:24.510> get<00:04:24.720> cut<00:04:25.020> out<00:04:27.290> so<00:04:28.290> all<00:04:28.500> this

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
that's going to get cut out so all this

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.390 
that's going to get cut out so all this
will<00:04:28.950> be<00:04:28.980> removed<00:04:29.520> I'm<00:04:30.030> removing<00:04:30.360> this<00:04:31.400> the

will be removed I'm removing this the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.700 
will be removed I'm removing this the
center<00:04:32.970> brace<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.010> what<00:04:35.220> I'll<00:04:35.340> have<00:04:35.580> is

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
center brace and so what I'll have is

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.530 
center brace and so what I'll have is
would<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.980> wood<00:04:38.280> brace<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:38.850> goes<00:04:39.060> all<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.300> way

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
would a wood brace that goes all the way

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.260 
would a wood brace that goes all the way
around<00:04:40.340> but<00:04:41.340> I'm<00:04:41.460> going<00:04:41.640> to<00:04:41.700> hollow<00:04:41.940> it<00:04:42.150> out

to get kind of excited here it's been

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.090 
to get kind of excited here it's been
kind<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.830> painful<00:05:12.740> putting<00:05:13.740> this<00:05:13.830> whole<00:05:14.040> thing

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
kind of painful putting this whole thing

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.180 
kind of painful putting this whole thing
together<00:05:14.460> but<00:05:15.200> you<00:05:16.200> can<00:05:16.380> take<00:05:16.560> a<00:05:16.590> good<00:05:16.860> shot

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190
