00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.140
 Can the game express an idea through the game mechanics alone? 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.040
 Can they use the most basic elements - play a game to tell a story or ask a question? 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.440
 This is an important issue that we must think about as the game media develops. 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.500
 The answers we give will help us to imitate only traditional media. 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.120
 Sublimation into a unique art style 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.740
 As it happens, James was recently challenged by another game designer at a video game show, asking him to give an example. 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 This is a great opportunity for us. 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.040
 This gives us an excuse to discuss a great topic. 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.340
 Let James talk about an old game he loves. 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.740
 Let us provide you with a good example 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.900
 If you happen to talk about this topic in your chat 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.060
 And also give James the chance to win a bet. 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.440
 Let's talk about this game! 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.900
 Some people may be excited to wait for us to talk about the new life or the moment of victory. 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.840
 But learning from the past is equally important 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.900
 Too many early games have been slowly forgotten. 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.060
 That's a pity, because they are often the best textbooks. 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.240
 They are relatively simple 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.880
 The game mode will not be dazzling 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.840
 Or under the complicated computing mechanism to cover up 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.940
 So what we are going to talk about today is the missile commander. 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.880
 If you haven’t heard of it, the missile commander is a machine game produced in the 1980s. 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.180
 In the game, you will use the trackball to launch rockets from three different anti-nuclear bomb defense platforms. 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.520
 Protecting six cities from raining under the intercontinental ballistic missiles 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.780
 The game was made 25 years ago, and the picture or sound is not amazing. 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 The missile is a 1 pixel bright spot 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.900
 The city is the silhouette of a two-tone skyscraper 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.040
 The explosion is the only explosion that can be produced by the old computer. 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.740
 Even so, he is still one of the most profound representations of the nuclear war. 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.740
 How did he do it? 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.560
 Through interaction 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 This is a well-designed game 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
 No elements without rethinking 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.740
 Let us analyze one by one 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.760
 First of all, the game is non-violent. 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 The player never fires a nuclear bomb 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.520
 Will not fire at the enemy 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.900
 Here, the villain is unknown and not important. 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.800
 The game revolves around saving lives as much as you can. 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.620
 He does not let the radical action affect the story he wants to express. 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.720
 Instead, place the player in a place where the game rarely gets involved. 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 He puts the player into a position that can only respond passively 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.260
 He did this in order to set the boundaries of the situation that he wants players to explore. 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.060
 In this way, the player will not be lost in the power to control the destructive weapons. 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.960
 Or seek pleasure from a disaster causing disaster 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.520
 This is not the game you want to experience. 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.740
 This is a story of a party attacked by a nuclear bomb in a war. 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.280
 Let's take a look at the choice of this story. 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.140
 This is more humane than the game that is generally conquered and destroyed. 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.340
 When he chooses to focus on telling stories from this angle 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.900
 Creator David Theurer 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.920
 Present the player with a character they can understand 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.700
 An experience that can be felt during the game 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.380
 An individual who not only has a protagonist in the game, but also has a protagonist 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.260
 Instead, it is powerless when it comes to the heavy responsibility of the country. 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.660
 So let's take a look at this role 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.660
 And think about how he enhanced his narrative through interaction. 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.120
 When the player walks to the machine 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.680
 They became commanders of three air defense systems in a region 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.400
 This breadth of choice is important 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.940
 He is close to normal life 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.800
 We certainly have concepts for six cities. 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.240
 We can imagine six cities in our hometown. 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.280
 And project ourselves into the game 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.580
 Those small bases and cities are where we can invest in emotions. 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.640
 Not as much as ordinary people understand to save the world 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.840
 Before we talk about the interactive part 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.180
 Think about how the commanders of these three dilapidated and poorly equipped air defense bases are 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.840
 Presumably, you never expected that they would really come in handy someday. 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.540
 You probably think that you are just playing a deterrent role in an impossible war. 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.040
 But now, once you put the coin into the machine 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.120
 The war broke out 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.620
 Let's start watching the game mechanics how to enhance this experience. 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.920
 Missile Commander, a game more than thirty years ago 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.160
 Bringing a number of difficult and wonderful moral choices in the history of video games 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.980
 In the process of the game 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.720
 You will face a choice 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.880
 Who do you want to protect? 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.620
 You gradually get rid of the aid, but the nuclear bomb is still swarming. 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.980
 Do you want to try to protect everyone? 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.360
 Do you want to save the most remote city without paying the price? 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.880
 Or do you want him to scatter in a flash of flame? 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.620
 To make it easier for you to protect other lives you have been carrying? 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.360
 You want to let the soldiers under you 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.640
 Those who know the big responsibility but trust you to ensure their survival 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.000
 Are you making a strong sacrifice when you choose to protect them or save the lives of a whole city? 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.540
 Or you have to let millions of lives suddenly vanish 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.760
 Let you save those precious air defense turrets? 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.680
 Those air defense bases that must stay to defend against the other five million lives? 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.740
 You have to endanger everyone to save a few 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.560
 Still reluctantly sacrifice a few to protect everyone? 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.200
 The game strengthens these thoughts through the mechanism 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.000
 You start with six cities 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.920
 But when the city disappears one by one 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.300
 Protecting the only remaining is relatively easy 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.920
 So you want to destroy five cities to ensure the survival of the sixth seat? 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.580
 After all, the game will end when all six cities are destroyed. 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.800
 In addition, each of your air defense units has its own shells and strategic value. 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.220
 Losing any one at the beginning will seriously hinder your defense ability. 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.420
 So measuring the value between the city and the base becomes a difficult choice 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.560
 Not only that, but these choices must be made in the case of every second. 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.460
 They must be as responsive as real commanders 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.380
 Players can feel the pressure and uncertainty that comes with making choices at such critical moments. 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.680
 And at the end, with the heart of reverence for those who really face such a choice, leave the game. 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.100
 After all, it is very difficult to make quick choices with confidence and courage. 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.300
 What is all this for? 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.440
 What does this game most want to express? 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.720
 You can't win 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.900
 No matter how many rounds you have survived 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.180
 Or how much time to spend 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.880
 You can't win the missile commander. 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.520
 There will be no winners in the nuclear war 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.960
 Everything you do is futile. 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.700
 But you still bravely face the challenge 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.740
 Because such persistence can extend the hope of people for a few minutes. 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.660
 And when the game is over? 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.980
 The game appears as a normal Game Over screen like a normal machine game. 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.480
 But it implies such a dark meaning 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.960
 He presented the fear of the event in two simple words. 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.100
 Far beyond the shock of modern gameplay with long scripts 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.040
 He only said The End 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.760
 Disappeared in the flash of nuclear explosion 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.100
 This is a story about nuclear war 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.640
 And the human struggle 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.560
 And only through the game process 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.580
 Try to survive through difficult choices and balance on the spot 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.540
 Even a lot of books or movies are so desperate and so shocking. 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.320
 But the dawn is not allowed to listen to us. 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.540
 I should let you see how the game left the creator’s feelings. 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.340
 This is an excerpt from the interview with Theurer many years after the release of the game. 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.400
 He says 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.620
 I am often awakened by a nightmare. 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.360
 Seeing a ray of light across the sky 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.020
 I always saw them hitting Sunnyvale on the Santa Cruz Mountains. 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.700
 I know that there is about 45 seconds left in the position where the nuclear explosion hits me. 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.540
 This is my nightmare that entangles me every month after I finish the missile commander. 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.800
 For Theurer, the six cities in the game 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.120
 Is his hometown - six coastal cities in California 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Therefore, the game can not only tell the story 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 And simply express a value through the mechanism 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.560
 They can be so exciting before many of us are born yet. 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.860
 Cool! 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.400
 We will see you next week!
