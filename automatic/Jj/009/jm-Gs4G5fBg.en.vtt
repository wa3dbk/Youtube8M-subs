then<00:01:54.180> dies<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.710> prefer<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.490> concept

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
as driving dynamics go the Volt really

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.890 
as driving dynamics go the Volt really
surprised<00:03:55.170> me<00:03:55.490> it<00:03:56.490> handles<00:03:56.850> great<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.360> the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
surprised me it handles great and the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.200 
surprised me it handles great and the
chassis<00:03:58.350> is<00:03:58.470> obviously<00:03:59.070> rock-solid<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.970> only

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
chassis is obviously rock-solid the only

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.320 
chassis is obviously rock-solid the only
handicap<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.740> tires<00:04:02.040> are<00:04:02.400> just<00:04:02.430> not<00:04:03.120> that

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
handicap is the tires are just not that

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.810 
handicap is the tires are just not that
great<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.990> howl<00:04:04.890> at<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.220> slightest

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
great and howl at the slightest

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.870 
great and howl at the slightest
provocation<00:04:06.290> but<00:04:07.290> that's<00:04:07.530> fun<00:04:07.830> in<00:04:08.010> itself<00:04:08.340> and

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
provocation but that's fun in itself and

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.080 
provocation but that's fun in itself and
honestly<00:04:09.840> this<00:04:10.560> car<00:04:10.800> is<00:04:10.950> really<00:04:11.310> fun<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.940> bomb

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
honestly this car is really fun to bomb

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.210 
honestly this car is really fun to bomb
around<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.540> back<00:04:12.720> roads<00:04:13.020> with<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.590> brakes

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
around the back roads with the brakes

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.610 
around the back roads with the brakes
are<00:04:14.490> grabby<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.270> they<00:04:15.840> use<00:04:15.990> the<00:04:16.170> regenerative

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
are grabby and they use the regenerative

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.970 
are grabby and they use the regenerative
function<00:04:17.400> so<00:04:17.760> it's<00:04:18.330> a<00:04:18.510> little<00:04:18.959> bit<00:04:19.230> tough<00:04:19.799> to

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
function so it's a little bit tough to

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.590 
function so it's a little bit tough to
modulate<00:04:20.430> at<00:04:20.580> first<00:04:20.820> but<00:04:21.090> they<00:04:21.209> are<00:04:21.330> very

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
modulate at first but they are very

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.960 
modulate at first but they are very
powerful<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:23.250> lot<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.460> people<00:04:23.670> complain
