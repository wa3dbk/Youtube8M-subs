00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 I bathe the health of his music lovers 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.240
 who opposes the axÃ© but in wintzenheim 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.240
 czapnik mertian than mike with cerium 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.610
 there are people these women at 96,10 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.600
 I hope you are well then at 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.910
 day we meet for the review 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.410
 exceptional of andres iniesta version 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.390
 team of the year so version tocci 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.490
 blue version as with others 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.380
 players totti I ask you to 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.550
 have fun with the blue thumb bar because 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.990
 that it's all madness review 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.090
 you just see that the Caen 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.740
 in a team liga bbva all he 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.330
 there is something more simple in a 3 5 2 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.309
 I changed his post I the walls words 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.420
 this is where the umpteenth stats are 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.559
 which parade I invite you to put on 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.790
 pause must put back yeah 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.920
 because there it is true that they are parading 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.300
 rather quickly his stats in game 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.670
 it's true that there I never did that in 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.830
 full match is so low I was a 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.180
 little bit pressed by time so 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.120
 see that there is a lot of green 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.830
 so andres iniesta toxic version is 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.870
 what can we say about him so already he 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.280
 is simply exceptional 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.930
 frankly like all the players of 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.390
 the as tutsi he is exceptional 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.589
 after by cons is the only acquired 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.199
 finally for now it's the only one that has 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.960
 resumed 20 so this is the third I 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.330
 test yahya yahya thiago silva 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.619
 there are dani alves is there and dia iniesta 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.299
 so I'm not going to come you'll see to 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.430
 the end the note but still is it that 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.320
 I did not put 20 for a few small 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.009
 reasons especially I started with these 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.960
 negative points 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.340
 so compared to his head game which 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.359
 is really really bad then 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.649
 after it's true that close to sixty 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.609
 ten did not expect either 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.770
 a game is sensational after he has 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.840
 stats stats are really weak and 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.250
 in head accuracy as low and 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.770
 after that are physical then his 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.020
 physical he has a good stat in agility 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.250
 balance but yet I found 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.479
 that he was getting really moved 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.609
 easily it's true he has less 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.619
 seventy years force is necessarily low 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.479
 it pays it pays cash 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.340
 but here it is for me that's it 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.719
 it's three negative points as with 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.189
 the others I'm not talking about the price for the 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.079
 simple and good reason that we talk about a 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.890
 player who is part of who does 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.990
 part of the team 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.090
 the team of the year so it's normal 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.100
 they are expensive I paid them 1500000 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.600
 enormously expensive credit that's true 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.130
 besides I think that at the level of the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.719
 resale i will lose frozen credits 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.619
 not yet sold me I'm talking to you I 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.270
 think I'm going to do a lot of 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.979
 credit but it's not a problem my 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.960
 purpose is to offer you the reviews on 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.130
 as soon as possible so to the point 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.650
 at the level of for positive because it 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.930
 it's not bad it's a killer 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.850
 in front of the cages then from gt I was 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.960
 shocked about that is that in front of the goal he 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.580
 is really very very very very good 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.110
 I put more goals than I did two 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.950
 assists with then at the level 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.510
 assists 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.770
 it's true that I struggled to illustrate 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.570
 there are you going to see that there are certain 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.820
 because they are really very very 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.290
 beautiful unfortunately the attackers who 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.270
 are the attackers striker 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.650
 I am thinking in particular of this here is the 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.930
 standard you can not miss it but diego 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.980
 costa found the way to miss it so 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.110
 at the level of the password quality is 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.300
 just outstanding 197 jobs if all 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.490
 their senses you really feel it because 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.770
 that low and it's simply 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.390
 it's just huge that it's 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.830
 the lobed balls the passes to the ground 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.840
 he makes you just openings 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.030
 monstrous the problem is that 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.320
 benzema and digbeu star before I do not know 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.210
 not what they had but they missed 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.830
 anyway some some pretty stuff 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.000
 abuse 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.050
 after in front of the cages so iniesta 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.880
 as I said in front of the cages he is 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.260
 really very very very very good and 1,87 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.880
 in shot language finish 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.560
 he sends geese missiles they 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.270
 send 88 missiles in chat then 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.560
 that he has that 77 in hitting power 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.820
 but I'm still going in the more 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.400
 because he will do power he will do 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.900
 really loud and low and it's a plus 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.070
 it's really a plus so long shot 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.360
 the set pieces 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.590
 it's true that I have not had and in the 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.330
 world I did not get a free kick any 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.710
 simply I have few free kicks but 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.810
 I did not shoot two free kicks with 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.590
 ghislaine correct stats we will say 77 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.480
 it remains correct 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.800
 the casting corner he stretches well the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.360
 penalties I had two you go 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.540
 see that bah I put them simply 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.490
 I put the penaltys yet he has not 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.390
 a stat no longer huge he has 77 even 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.860
 here I put the kicks stopped 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.480
 in at the level of positioning 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.250
 always very well placed 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.780
 technically technically it's a 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.340
 treat is technically in 4 stars 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.630
 technical gestures and a very very 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.370
 big wait for you hic I remember 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.780
 more how much but still is it that I 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.100
 beat technically that's technically 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.900
 you really have fun he has both feet 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.250
 4 stars bad foot and so that's it 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.410
 so it's a plus he has a contribution 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.050
 strong offensive so that's really the 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.520
 mbc who really got up is 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.260
 just who is going to be 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.760
 really focused on the offensive 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.870
 and not ranked we will finish with the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.150
 last clip of this review 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.350
 a clip that hurts a clip that makes 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.030
 wrong because eyes bass and a long 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.530
 hot just the little long 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.250
 hot iniesta totti that is fun 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.290
 to end so the little celebration 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.910
 and you're going to see the slow motion is so 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.989
 so here's a review of iniesta tucci 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.000
 I hope this review makes you 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.170
 pleasure we will go to the balance sheet so a 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.739
 player that I really really 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.570
 much loved 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.700
 although it's true that it's still 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.530
 very expensive but 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.820
 that's it remains one that remains a very very 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.420
 good player an excellent player so at 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.340
 balance sheet level 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.570
 andres iniesta totti what do I have 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.030
 put in the east anymore so the shots of 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.000
 foot stopped stolen effects vision 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.950
 dribble finish speed his speed is 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.780
 really correct when it speeds up 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.670
 frankly it's really going really fast 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.080
 shot positioning 4 and on the wrong foot 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.170
 its pass quality which is just 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.390
 outstanding 97 years ago pass on 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.950
 the map it's just huge power of 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.270
 strikes 4 stars technical gesture and so 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.770
 in the mountains I put the jumps on the 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.090
 physical and the head game I am 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.520
 sorry for the balance I completely 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.010
 forgot to take the screen and so I 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.050
 not go but his tour a balance sheet 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.400
 positive ie the same number of 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.930
 goals for the same number of matches is 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.430
 same at the assists level if 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.500
 I do not say nonsense so I put 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.970
 the note of 19 surely because of his 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.230
 physical it's not really because of the 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.240
 head game even if the head game I like 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.100
 good for a word is that the word c is 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.210
 a game is really ok but it's 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.200
 more for the physical because I 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.360
 find that he gets really moved 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.640
 so a lot 19 of 20 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.780
 but a big fat 19 surely because 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.430
 it remains a rate of your home could 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.020
 see that bah where he is strong he is 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.220
 really exceptional law that's all 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.380
 for this review I hope this 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.580
