if<00:00:15.289> you<00:00:15.559> are<00:00:15.709> looking<00:00:16.010> for<00:00:16.219> a<00:00:16.250> workflow<00:00:16.640> that

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
if you are looking for a workflow that

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.970 
if you are looking for a workflow that
can<00:00:17.120> produce<00:00:17.240> decals<00:00:17.840> efficiently<00:00:18.410> then<00:00:18.860> you

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
can produce decals efficiently then you

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.680 
can produce decals efficiently then you
