actually get to bike anywhere along this
path<00:05:08.419> that<00:05:09.419> I<00:05:09.450> just<00:05:09.780> whizzed<00:05:10.020> past<00:05:10.700> there's<00:05:11.700> a

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
path that I just whizzed past there's a

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.390

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
little sign saying that and I always

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.090

think it's kind of sad that we have to

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.240 
think it's kind of sad that we have to
create<00:05:17.690> specific<00:05:18.690> sanctuaries<00:05:19.590> for<00:05:19.620> wildlife

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250
