try to do my best as we start the season
and<00:00:59.720> yeah<00:01:00.720> but<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.019> don't<00:01:01.170> try<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.530> think<00:01:01.710> about

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and yeah but I don't try to think about

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.150 
and yeah but I don't try to think about
it<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:04.199> head<00:01:04.350> dislike<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.949> is

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
it then I get the head dislike this is

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:18.100 
it then I get the head dislike this is
not<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.640> easy

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.270 

it's<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.230> penultimate<00:01:19.530> rally<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.220> season

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
it's the penultimate rally of the season

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.320 
it's the penultimate rally of the season
so<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.590> win<00:01:22.590> here<00:01:22.830> couldn't<00:01:23.310> could<00:01:24.120> make

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
so a win here couldn't could make

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.970 
so a win here couldn't could make
everything<00:01:24.510> even<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.260> that<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.800> last

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
everything even for that up for the last

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.340 
everything even for that up for the last
event<00:01:26.160> of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.400> season<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:27.030> then<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:28.050> know<00:01:28.170> if

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
event of the season but then you know if

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.040 
event of the season but then you know if
we<00:01:28.500> don't<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.040> well<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:30.270> could<00:01:30.510> be<00:01:30.540> over

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
we don't do that well it could be over

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.890 
we don't do that well it could be over
and<00:01:31.700> we<00:01:32.700> could<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.120> win<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> juncture<00:01:33.750> this

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and we could not win the juncture this

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:45.649 
and we could not win the juncture this
year<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.590> really<00:01:34.860> important

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.690 

it's<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.710> about<00:01:46.890> confidence<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.579> your

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
it's all about confidence if your

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.639 
it's all about confidence if your
co-driver<00:01:47.939> says<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.630> flat<00:01:48.929> then<00:01:49.499> it's

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
co-driver says it's a flat then it's

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.959 
co-driver says it's a flat then it's
flat<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.159> don't<00:01:50.310> think<00:01:50.460> about<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.880> you

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
flat and you don't think about it you

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.870 
flat and you don't think about it you
know<00:01:50.999> so<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:52.319> what's<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
know so that's what's going to be the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.609 
know so that's what's going to be the
crucial<00:01:54.299> thing<00:01:54.569> for<00:01:54.929> me<00:01:55.020> because<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.350> think

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
crucial thing for me because I think

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.510 
crucial thing for me because I think
that<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.990> know<00:01:58.079> trusting<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> car<00:01:58.859> is<00:01:59.069> quite

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that you know trusting the car is quite

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.370 
that you know trusting the car is quite
easy<00:01:59.549> because<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.479> working<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:00.810> well<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
easy because it's working very well and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.899 
easy because it's working very well and
it's<00:02:01.560> got<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> lot<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.979> grip<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.549> trusting

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
it's got a lot of grip but it's trusting

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.279 
it's got a lot of grip but it's trusting
my<00:02:03.000> pace<00:02:03.179> notes<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.569> making<00:02:03.780> sure<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.109> can
