00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.630
 the party summit mexico as they take it 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.210
 we talk about a strange half week with 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.860
 san lorenzo today also they are approaching their 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.150
 free time is close to the time of 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.150
 world as that party is taken 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.900
 we get to the importance it deserves 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.439
 obviously it is not easy after 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 come from winning a tournament or a final not 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.980
 It is easy 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.060
 to be able to concentrate on that game but 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.420
 well once we get on the court 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.250
 concentrated to go out and win 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.980
 to give more joy to us to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.350
 the people and then yes rest 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.290
 quiet because I think this this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.590
 group beyond the end result of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.350
 week he deserves it because for all the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.750
 effort that we did although it is a 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.340
 friendly is a classic also way 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.540
 search so as not to tarnish the entire campaign 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.699
 in all the good things that they have been doing 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.440
 This classic is also going to look for it like this 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.790
 yes but I think what what 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.420
 we did not know how to bathe good result 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.780
 that's why we're not going to take it with 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.850
 with all the respect he deserves but 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.470
 how I love you if in this a result 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.080
 can not can not tarnish what 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.390
 we did we are very confident we go and 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.700
 with a lot of enthusiasm and well let's hope to take 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.930
 a good control result in the turn 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.729
 of classic a long time ago and not 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.080
 they lose calls in friendlies in 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.110
 summer also did not lose only 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.930
 draw in all the others they won 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.340
 yes the truth that good is nice 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.310
 get used to winning for that as you 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.189
 just you have to say 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.340
 you have to go out to the court to find the 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.619
 triumph is going to be a difficult game but 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.770
 the group knows what they want to know what 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.020
 play then let's try to give everything 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.670
 for to bring a good result since 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.630
 we are not going to go for a walk but we go with 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.149
 an important match for us 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.360
 Beyond being friendly play a 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.180
 classic always 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.220
 it always gives you something then how are we going to 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.300
 the best when you came to river me 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.800
 I also imagine what you take a 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.840
 platform to get closer to the 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.630
 selection as you saw all this process 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.250
 of feeling you are also observed 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.690
 illusion you at some point to be 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.470
 a list 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.480
 yes obviously to play here 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.330
 plus it makes you out and brings you the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.310
 selection but good I was not lucky 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:30.280
 that is my case out there in a moment 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.410
 I was excited but lately not 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.060
 I felt that I do not say I can have the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.250
 chance then I just thought about 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.819
 river but good one always gets excited 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.560
 and he works for that, so as always 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.130
 we must not lose hope and give what 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.160
 maximum here for some day I have the 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.780
 chance to be cited to be 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.520
 prepared as you feel you grew 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.250
 still more here on the river and still 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.540
 can be more one always tries to see 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.300
 plus 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.910
 obviously that as there is I had 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.930
 ripped out in the best way the first 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.150
 semester after 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.799
 personally and in the group I think that 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.680
 the team took some steps backwards and 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.730
 well today we do not meet again in the 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.000
 good then any time that 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.920
 take advantage of it I really feel in what 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.739
 I feel very comfortable and like you 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.939
 I just said I still have to continue 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.709
 working to give more is not worse 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.269
 remarked the after winning the 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.040
 superfinal that they will have many 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.689
 competitions to play the cup 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.489
 Argentina the South American Cup in 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.109
 championship and that is going to be fundamental 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.519
 for the lower base are you as 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.189
 they see the guys who are behind that 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.290
 maybe they do not look as much as you 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.239
 little too those who are in 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.640
 reserve for what will be a role 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.340
 important 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.950
 always good 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.680
 have lower players reverse a 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.910
 quarry very good and really what 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.629
 it shows when they come to soccer 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.540
 with us hopefully they can as he said 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:01.650
 the president who can contribute his 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.860
 and we will give it to you 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.750
 and all the support 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.600
 we are only going for one goal 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.600
 and if they come inferior guys that you 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.170
 It's coming, it's not going to serve while they're shooting 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.359
 forwards all then if they do not 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.700
 they will come up with us to give 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.220
 the maximum I think obviously keep 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.290
 the support of us all for 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.240
 so that we all go well against 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.240
 all in force is much more time with 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.260
 up here I have two more years still 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.600
 so 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.210
 in a long time really I am very 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.760
 comfortable and good only think of 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.090
 continue here and then we will see what is it 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.090
 What's up
