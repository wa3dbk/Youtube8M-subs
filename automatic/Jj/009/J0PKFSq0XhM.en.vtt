00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.759
 hello good morning from superman to san 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.400
 martín maría joseph today I'm here to 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.349
 tell you about the begonias the begonia is 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.260
 a plant native to the zones 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.080
 There are more than 1500 tropical 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.600
 natural varieties over 10,000 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.250
 hybrids and of all of them 150 are the 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.050
 that we commercialize and know in 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.120
 our stores or in our markets 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.860
 we have the ones we can use to 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.100
 outside that can be begonia 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.590
 simple flower and the orange dragon begonia 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.020
 which is called these two hold very well 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.400
 the temperatures moderately high and 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.110
 also in autumn when the temperature 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.240
 begins to lower until the 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.550
 frost once the frost starts 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.890
 we'll have to put them inside is a 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.660
 plant that needs frequent watering that 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.220
 have the soil moist then 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.370
 we have several days in which 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.560
 it rains what we will do will moisten the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.750
 land and every 15 days we will give them fertilizer 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.570
 then we have this other one that is the 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.269
 begonia of the earth is a plant 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.340
 tubercle that is to say comes from bulb has 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.539
 a very pretty flower has 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.700
 and very broad color ages this is a 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.200
 little bit more delicate to have bulb what 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.899
 What we can not do is water it 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.179
 directly because if we wet the 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.159
 leaves or flowers may be able to go 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.350
 then what we will do is put water 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.060
 We have a quarter of a plate 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.860
 when she has cooked the water 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.709
 enough we remove the plate never 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.729
 we will leave the plate because you can 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.380
 You can enter 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.350
 a disease below the plant 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.079
 it is in autumn when it is already beginning to fall 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.429
 the light what we will do will be at the moment 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.200
 in which the flowers fall 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.569
 we want for the next year to be able 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.429
 the bulbs have to leave watering 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.590
 let it water it will dry what is the 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.899
 plant and when the entire 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.569
 we are going to prune we are going to cut 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.159
 the bulbs of the earth enfold 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.439
 in sheets of newspaper and we leave them in 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.270
 a dark room towards february 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.000
 March we will take those bulbs 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.979
 we will be putting the potted the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.929
 we will continue to maintain two or three days to 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.610
 the shadow and then little by little we will go 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.830
 taking out to give them the light of the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.140
 so we will have new worlds and new 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.790
 new begonias every year and then 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.830
 we also have some begonias of the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.570
 which we will talk about another day that 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.330
 difference of these are completely 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.790
 different are the begonias reds these 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.560
 they only have leaf are very flowers 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.140
 nice but they will never give us what 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.510
 that in if we call flower rennes are leaves 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.490
 that can also be from outside or from 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.950
