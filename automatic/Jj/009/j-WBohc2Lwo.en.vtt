this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.350> really<00:00:52.739> weird<00:00:52.980> right<00:00:53.309> now<00:00:53.570> because

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
this is really weird right now because

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.990 
this is really weird right now because
we've<00:00:55.050> got<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.739> um<00:00:55.890> we're<00:00:56.280> experimenting<00:00:56.520> with

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
we've got we um we're experimenting with

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.020 
we've got we um we're experimenting with
angling<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> cameras<00:00:58.079> upwards<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.030> right

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
angling the cameras upwards and right

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.460 
angling the cameras upwards and right
now<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:01.079> part<00:01:02.010> wasn't<00:01:02.579> me<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> best

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
now this part wasn't me I'm not the best

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.350 
now this part wasn't me I'm not the best
spot<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.159> can't<00:01:05.640> reflect<00:01:05.939> fast

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
spot because you can't reflect fast

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.570 
spot because you can't reflect fast
especially<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.500> an<00:01:07.650> early<00:01:07.890> battery<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.369> this

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
especially on an early battery like this

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.670 
especially on an early battery like this
one<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.450> Thomas's<00:01:10.080> part<00:01:10.350> big<00:01:10.530> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
one and this is Thomas's part big I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.649 
one and this is Thomas's part big I
passed

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.630 

he'll<00:01:14.619> naughty<00:01:14.890> still<00:01:15.070> slightly<00:01:15.369> get<00:01:15.610> a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
he'll naughty still slightly get a

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.550 
he'll naughty still slightly get a
little<00:01:15.850> bit<00:01:15.939> quicker<00:01:16.119> as<00:01:16.390> he<00:01:16.570> gets<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.869> feel<00:01:17.140> for

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
little bit quicker as he gets a feel for

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.770 
little bit quicker as he gets a feel for
the<00:01:17.799> park<00:01:18.070> itself<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:19.210> it's<00:01:19.329> a<00:01:19.390> matter<00:01:19.509> of<00:01:19.600> just

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
the park itself so it's a matter of just

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
the park itself so it's a matter of just
getting<00:01:19.899> a<00:01:20.079> feel<00:01:20.289> for<00:01:20.320> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
getting a feel for it

really<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.659> bullet<00:03:15.330> from<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.690> poss<00:03:16.989> that<00:03:17.230> you're

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
really a bullet from a poss that you're

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.520 
really a bullet from a poss that you're
about<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.530> do<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.599> did<00:03:19.659> dead<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:19.989> was<00:03:20.260> really

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
about to do like I did dead I was really

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.380 
about to do like I did dead I was really
scary<00:03:21.129> okay<00:03:21.489> um<00:03:21.849> but<00:03:22.299> yeah<00:03:23.110> like<00:03:24.120> it's<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.239> lot

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
scary okay um but yeah like it's a lot

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.699 
scary okay um but yeah like it's a lot
more<00:03:25.510> total<00:03:25.780> control<00:03:26.019> which<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.290> kind<00:03:26.620> of

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
more total control which is kind of

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.770 
more total control which is kind of
annoying<00:03:27.640> but<00:03:28.000> it's<00:03:28.150> also<00:03:28.299> really<00:03:28.659> cool

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
annoying but it's also really cool

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.410 
annoying but it's also really cool
because<00:03:29.019> it's<00:03:29.440> more<00:03:29.620> rewarding<00:03:30.150> way<00:03:31.150> more

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
because it's more rewarding way more

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.940 
because it's more rewarding way more
rewarding<00:03:31.810> this<00:03:32.409> is<00:03:32.590> what<00:03:32.769> he's<00:03:32.860> talking

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
rewarding this is what he's talking

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.580 
rewarding this is what he's talking
about<00:03:33.370> for<00:03:33.610> control<00:03:36.900> lots<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.170> lots<00:03:38.470> of

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
about for control lots and lots of

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.410 
about for control lots and lots of
little<00:03:38.799> precise<00:03:39.220> inputs<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.870> whole<00:03:41.079> time<00:03:41.349> so

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.759 

you're<00:03:46.420> flying<00:03:46.540> in<00:03:46.840> air<00:03:46.989> crow<00:03:47.170> mode<00:03:47.379> and

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
you're flying in air crow mode and

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.259 
you're flying in air crow mode and
that's<00:03:48.129> why<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.370> see<00:03:48.640> lots<00:03:48.849> of<00:03:48.910> inputs<00:03:49.209> you

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
that's why you see lots of inputs you

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.490 
that's why you see lots of inputs you
saw<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.569> put<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> whole<00:03:49.930> upper<00:03:50.170> throttle<00:03:50.440> on

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
saw and put a whole upper throttle on

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.490 
saw and put a whole upper throttle on
them<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:52.420> that's<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:52.780> throttle<00:03:52.959> there<00:03:53.230> I

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
them so that's the throttle there I

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.630 
them so that's the throttle there I
think<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:53.920> don't<00:03:54.069> actually<00:03:54.190> even<00:03:54.370> know<00:03:54.489> what
