Doug
and<00:03:22.660> let<00:03:22.780> me<00:03:22.870> think<00:03:23.049> about<00:03:23.170> this<00:03:23.350> for<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.709> second

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.959 

all<00:03:33.349> right<00:03:33.590> two<00:03:33.890> scenarios<00:03:34.400> come<00:03:34.609> to<00:03:34.760> mind

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:34.969 
all right two scenarios come to mind

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.869 
all right two scenarios come to mind
either<00:03:35.689> a<00:03:36.079> they<00:03:36.739> have<00:03:36.950> sensor<00:03:37.400> scrambling

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
either a they have sensor scrambling

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.729 
either a they have sensor scrambling
technology<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.599> they<00:03:38.689> drop<00:03:38.930> off<00:03:39.140> forces<00:03:39.590> here

technology and they drop off forces here
regularly<00:03:40.299> wouldn't<00:03:41.299> just<00:03:41.480> make<00:03:41.780> more<00:03:41.989> sense

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
regularly wouldn't just make more sense

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
to bomb us from orbit then yeah that's

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.670 
to bomb us from orbit then yeah that's
too<00:03:46.879> much<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.269> stretch<00:03:47.569> or<00:03:47.870> they<00:03:48.379> have<00:03:48.530> an

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
too much of a stretch or they have an

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.740 
too much of a stretch or they have an

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.360 
outpost on this planet and it's hidden
by<00:03:50.989> some<00:03:51.019> kind<00:03:51.469> of<00:03:51.560> sensor<00:03:51.920> scrambling

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370

never<00:03:55.579> left<00:03:55.760> this<00:03:55.879> Canyon<00:03:56.389> so<00:03:56.829> actually

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
never left this Canyon so actually

never left this Canyon so actually
that's<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.280> pretty<00:03:58.549> good<00:03:58.730> guess<00:03:58.909> you<00:03:59.840> guys<00:04:00.079> have

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
that's a pretty good guess you guys have

that's a pretty good guess you guys have
been<00:04:00.500> here<00:04:00.859> for<00:04:01.040> three<00:04:01.849> more<00:04:02.150> years<00:04:02.389> than<00:04:02.659> me

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
been here for three more years than me

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.009
