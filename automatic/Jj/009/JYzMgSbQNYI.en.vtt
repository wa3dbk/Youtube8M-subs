00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
again it's been two weeks since our last

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.860 
again it's been two weeks since our last
video<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:08.220> let<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:08.849> guys<00:00:09.000> know<00:00:09.210> about<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
video we let you guys know about the

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.310 
video we let you guys know about the
LEDs<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:10.650> install<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:12.170> we're<00:00:13.170> not

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
LEDs that we install and we're not

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.320 
LEDs that we install and we're not
completely<00:00:13.710> finished<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.280> our<00:00:14.309> girl<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:15.000> we

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
completely finished with our girl but we

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.570 
completely finished with our girl but we
wanted<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> let<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.650> guys<00:00:16.710> know<00:00:17.039> how<00:00:17.310> things

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
wanted to let you guys know how things

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.609 
wanted to let you guys know how things
have<00:00:17.910> been<00:00:17.970> progressing<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.199> last<00:00:19.410> couple

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
have been progressing in the last couple

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.650 
have been progressing in the last couple
of<00:00:19.770> weeks<00:00:20.150> as<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.869> can<00:00:22.020> see<00:00:22.260> our<00:00:22.880> our<00:00:23.880> LED<00:00:24.390> tyr

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
of weeks as you can see our our LED tyr

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.720 
of weeks as you can see our our LED tyr
is<00:00:24.960> doing<00:00:25.609> surprisingly<00:00:26.660> much<00:00:27.660> better<00:00:27.930> than

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
is doing surprisingly much better than

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.939 
is doing surprisingly much better than
then<00:00:29.730> what<00:00:30.119> are<00:00:30.150> our<00:00:30.570> fluorescent<00:00:31.349> ears<00:00:31.590> doing

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
then what are our fluorescent ears doing

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.590 
then what are our fluorescent ears doing
we're<00:00:32.759> getting<00:00:32.940> much<00:00:33.809> fuller<00:00:34.440> heads<00:00:34.829> and

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
we're getting much fuller heads and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.100 
we're getting much fuller heads and
they're<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.780> much<00:00:37.200> more<00:00:37.440> tight<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:39.110> can

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
they're just much more tight as you can

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.830 
they're just much more tight as you can
see<00:00:40.290> compared<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.040> what<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.059> they're<00:00:42.660> not

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
see compared to what we have they're not

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.479 
see compared to what we have they're not
they're<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.440> nearly<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:43.920> tall<00:00:44.250> or<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.820> full

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
they're not nearly as tall or as full

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.970 
they're not nearly as tall or as full
from<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.879> see<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.270> far<00:00:51.770> they<00:00:52.770> both

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
from what we can see so far they both

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
from what we can see so far they both
look<00:00:53.329> good<00:00:54.329> regardless<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:55.320> as<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.789> see

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
look good regardless but as you can see

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.810 
look good regardless but as you can see
it<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.360> seems<00:00:57.629> from<00:00:58.620> from<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> past

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
it just seems from from just the past

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.260 
it just seems from from just the past
two<00:01:00.090> weeks

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.460 

these<00:01:02.450> are<00:01:02.600> just

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
these are just

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.610 
these are just
you<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:05.130> come<00:01:05.280> out

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.950 

much<00:01:08.220> fuller<00:01:08.550> sheep

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.980 

you<00:01:11.320> can't<00:01:11.590> really<00:01:11.830> tell<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:13.450> color<00:01:13.690> of<00:01:13.780> the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
you can't really tell the color of the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.719 
you can't really tell the color of the
roots<00:01:14.200> underneath<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.830> LEDs<00:01:15.220> but<00:01:15.520> they're

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
roots underneath the LEDs but they're

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.910 
roots underneath the LEDs but they're
pretty<00:01:16.180> much<00:01:16.500> completely<00:01:17.500> white<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.920> they're

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
pretty much completely white and they're

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.830 
pretty much completely white and they're
just<00:01:21.130> nice<00:01:21.310> tight<00:01:21.670> heads<00:01:24.570> another<00:01:25.570> one<00:01:25.750> of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
just nice tight heads another one of

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.950 
just nice tight heads another one of
these<00:01:25.930> on<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:27.210> underneath<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.420> fluorescent

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
these on the underneath of fluorescent

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.640 
these on the underneath of fluorescent
ear

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
ear

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.200 
ear
they're<00:01:31.220> still<00:01:31.460> pretty<00:01:31.580> tight<00:01:31.910> but<00:01:31.940> they're

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
they're still pretty tight but they're

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.410 
they're still pretty tight but they're
just<00:01:32.420> not<00:01:32.570> as<00:01:32.720> not<00:01:33.260> nearly<00:01:33.530> as<00:01:33.650> full<00:01:34.420> in

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
just not as not nearly as full in

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.970 
just not as not nearly as full in
comparison

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.700 

so<00:01:40.610> we've<00:01:40.790> been<00:01:41.020> pretty<00:01:42.020> impressed<00:01:42.410> with<00:01:42.590> the

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
so we've been pretty impressed with the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.800 
so we've been pretty impressed with the
outcome<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.250> far<00:01:44.980> as<00:01:45.980> far<00:01:46.280> as<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.700> LEDs<00:01:47.210> are

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
outcome so far as far as the LEDs are

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.680 
outcome so far as far as the LEDs are
compared<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.560> fluorescence<00:01:49.480> we're<00:01:50.480> very

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
compared to the fluorescence we're very

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.810 
compared to the fluorescence we're very
happy<00:01:50.840> with<00:01:51.140> everything<00:01:51.590> that's<00:01:51.800> been<00:01:52.070> going

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
happy with everything that's been going

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.940 
happy with everything that's been going
on<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.390> hopefully<00:01:54.290> we'll<00:01:54.620> have<00:01:54.740> another

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
on and hopefully we'll have another

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.530 
on and hopefully we'll have another
update<00:01:55.370> here<00:01:55.760> for<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.060> guys<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.450> next
