 [Music] 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:09.070
 i 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.410
 Welcome to this tutorial I am going to 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.809
 teach how to install applications 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.050
 free on your iphone from the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.759
 version of ios 4.0 up to the most version 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.740
 recent that is the ios 7.0 ok we have 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.500
 to connect to page 25 pp 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.240
 dotcom once we have connected 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.240
 the following will appear 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.570
 we will have to go to the tab that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.570
 It puts hot 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.900
 another tab will be loaded and 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.420
 we will have to give this here 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:49.600
 little button where we download a file 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.600
 of 547 megabytes that we will have to install 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.600
 we save it once we execute the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.000
 file will show us this screen where 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.010
 you will have to follow the following steps 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.089
 this would be next 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.210
 to which the area is not in asserting 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:09.970
 next the next one is not 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.200
 installing voucher of we select the two 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.550
 things and finish and we would have it 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.080
 installed 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.780
 once we are inside the program 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.870
 the first thing we have to do 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.050
 we find this screen is worth and 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.320
 to be able to download the applications and 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.810
 can install them we have to give here 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.689
 where an apple comes out with one hand 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.520
 those of us inside we can here 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.429
 up search what we want 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.460
 for example in this case we are going to look 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.670
 an application that everyone knows 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.360
 what is the whatsapp application 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.110
 we have 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.110
 Whatsapp 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.030
 we look for it and we will have it in this case 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.189
 once we get on top we get 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.520
 two options are worth we have to 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.799
 give you the blue option 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.220
 Once you arrive you will see how it has been 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.640
 put in one which means that it is 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.640
 downloading 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.500
 here we will get the progression bar and 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.820
 will download it 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.480
 normally round about 200 more horses 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.180
 or less the downloads go pretty fast 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.890
 and even sometimes if the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.739
 servers are very heavy can that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.260
 I get to raise it worth once what 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.900
 we have downloaded it will go to the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.470
 our application folder that is 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.110
 is 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.650
 as you will see we have it 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.860
 In my case, I have installed the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.050
 program but if you want to install it 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.200
 I should give the button that appears 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.200
 here 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.360
 and I'll install it 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.060
 What's up 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.280
 that will try to open it and will not let you 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.920
 then to be able to solve it is so 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.040
 easy as we come again to the 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.660
 manzanita and up here we get a 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.510
 blue icon we press 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.540
 it is not will not read the iphone 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.370
 and once it's over we'll see how 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.370
 all the applications that we have 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.579
 installed will let us open them without having 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.069
 to put any idea of ​​apple or anything 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.999
 and we will have our applications 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.999
 100% free 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.870
 that everything works perfectly as 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.110
 you'll see it's over, that means 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.470
 we already have our iphone as signed and 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.210
 now the applications that we install now 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.330
 they will not ask us for confirmation 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.070
 this is usually done once in each 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.360
 computer if you always use the 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.040
 same computer will not have any 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.349
 problem 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.909
 the age if it is already if you see again that 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.849
 the programs do not work for you, you go back to 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.439
 give it again click here and it will go back to 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.549
 everything works perfectly so that 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.280
 see how an installation is made 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:15.069
 clean we're going to lower the voice tweet 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.049
 for twitter it's good we do the same 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.690
 we press the button on the left blue 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.160
 remember it is valid and if it will be 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.570
 downloading in this part 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.570
 as said previously 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.490
 As you can see there are 200 caps as I said 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.070
 before once we have it downloaded 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.840
 we go to our applications 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.840
 here we get the install icon 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.029
 we would install 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.959
 if we want to see the progress of the 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.959
 installation 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.530
 we have to go here that are all 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.530
 our applications and here we would leave 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:00.620
 the progress in this case is 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.169
 saying that it is already installed 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.300
 what do I have to do as I do not have 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.300
 signed we have to give it here 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.249
 the mobile would already be signed and here 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.899
 as you will see 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:17.899
 I already have it 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.610
 deploy 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:25.609
 come
