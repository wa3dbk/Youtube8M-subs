00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.080
 three and a half hours it seemed like a lot but 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.809
 Well maybe it's true because it 's a 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.909

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.809
 this will be an enemy 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.119

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.710

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.159

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.159
 in the future 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.850

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.450

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.850
 be nice 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.310
 there is a part of the movie also not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.550
 not according to many who move and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.440
 they die what they prescribe 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.900
 what are greeley 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.810
 well, that supposes what I investigate 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.130
 that dies in the movie would not be 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.920
 news that with a feeling but is 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.730
 good but as we know in city they are 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.260
 alive so it can serve or review 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.620
 then good 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.909
 As I told you, it can not be that 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.909
 be here was the battle 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.600
 let's see what eta says 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.250
 you will not have that damn voice I had 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.330
 that nectar will have the original voice of 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.780
 rené garcía 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.060
 This is the same as the cube cube that the 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.060
 voice of mario castañeda 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.560

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.860
 Carlos second we are not yet 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.510

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.819
 what to see 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.260

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.730
 said 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.210
 Well, I'm not sure, but I think that 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.490
 will have censures like in the cai and 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.260
 and it is but I do not think that it rings in the 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.660
 movie no and hopefully it's a 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.720
