00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.009
 good to all and welcome to the special 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.740
 200 subscribers where I'm going to start a 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:15.250
 new series since you choose series of 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:18.640
 fifa 13 you are going to have a new series 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:23.439
 first of all thank you all for 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.710
 for giving me this support and for it would be 200 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.630
 you are very large is possible and we are going to 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.539
 begin to apply what would be the series 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.440
 a series would be in catching a player 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.449
 and make a team around him 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.879
 in which the other players have to 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.800
 be the team or the teams in the 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.690
 that he has played for example robben 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.159
 who has played on the psv in the real 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.150
 madrid in science and in the bayern 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.460
 I should have 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.200
 the player is the team players 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.790
 of those equipment does not have to be 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.290
 mandatory that all the 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.720
 teams that have played but yes where more 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.460
 has highlighted robben has stood out more in 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.970
 the bayern in the chelsea that in the real 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.390
 madrid and that's why I've chosen these three 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.970
 teams we're going with the team we have 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.620
 in goal to iker casillas a goalkeeper 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.960
 that has disappointed me enough does not deserve 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.550
 for nothing worth it I think it's even 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.470
 worse still diego alves as 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.540
 diagonals I do not like anything either 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.550
 well there we have, I almost do that, yes very 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.320
 well very very very quick to join goals 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.540
 for the exits but also I do not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.660
 did not like anything central first we have 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.790
 we advise we are going also pretty good 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.340
 but I do not think it's worth it 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.710
 67,000 since it has many failures and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.900
 you go up too has their websites 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.880
 high that offensive that is pretty bad 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.580
 for a right lateral defense we have 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.590
 ninth again in focus that is alive 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.880
 on the side but I treat it like a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.690
 central because it stays there back 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.610
 It defends very well, it complies with what 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.100
 that is put to be a central that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.270
 close very well and defend 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.399
 and I like it in this fixed 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.759
 and then by the team the chelsea 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.000
 we have inside saying the life of the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.000
 world 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.940
 we have patrick banana the recent 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.510
 returned to chelsea was on loan at 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.110
 vitesse I think and to walter the chelsea a 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.549
 good side pretty fast and pretty 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.750
 Well, I liked it a lot 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.660
 banana patrick with those three of 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.099
 watermarks then first midfielder 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.530
 ramires also known throughout the 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.170
 world with those 88 of very good rhythm 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.819
 ramirez fringe been also then 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.319
 first midfielder in the middle we have 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.750
 soul of the machete I did not see michael me 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.370
 He liked it well with the strip 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.079
 pretty good despite having 58 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.819
 arrested 72 of the 83 defense rhythm 79 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.910
 of head and also 79 passing ones 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.200
 you are quite global and quite 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.000
 good i am michael i liked 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.190
 pretty where my left is not me 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.510
 he liked nothing in the matches he has 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.950
 been watching in hunting we have actually 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.200
 played more because I've played too 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.329
 against some subscriber 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.040
 but neither did you leave me no me 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.049
 like for nothing to have to try to see 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.250
 see if I like it and then already by the 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.409
 bayern here in the middle of the field 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.700
 we have javi martínez, this one 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.469
 I really like javi martínez very 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.780
 corpulent not very fast but meets 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.549
 I also quite like the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.680
 shot of javi martínez 265 is a 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.739
 totally a joke has a very good shot 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.409
 javi martínez then already from forward 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.639
 we have mario marín djukic and it was a 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.859
 forward that I liked a lot 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.139
 three goals in three games because 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.139
