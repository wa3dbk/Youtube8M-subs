00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
do a step-by-step removal and

do a step-by-step removal and
installation<00:00:24.789> of<00:00:25.360> a<00:00:25.450> jeep<00:00:25.660> fender<00:00:26.020> on<00:00:26.050> a<00:00:26.169> YJ

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
installation of a jeep fender on a YJ

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.510 
installation of a jeep fender on a YJ
however<00:00:28.199> my<00:00:29.199> thought<00:00:29.439> process<00:00:29.860> is<00:00:30.039> this<00:00:30.250> if

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
however my thought process is this if

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.220 
however my thought process is this if
you<00:00:30.550> can't<00:00:30.910> take<00:00:31.330> the<00:00:31.480> fender<00:00:31.750> off<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.080> put<00:00:32.199> it

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
you can't take the fender off and put it

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.900 
you can't take the fender off and put it
back<00:00:32.320> on<00:00:32.619> without<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:33.040> lot<00:00:33.250> of<00:00:33.370> instruction

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
back on without a lot of instruction

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.650 
back on without a lot of instruction
onto<00:00:34.180> YJ<00:00:34.600> after<00:00:35.500> I<00:00:35.530> did<00:00:35.769> it<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:37.360> probably

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
onto YJ after I did it you probably

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.090 
onto YJ after I did it you probably
shouldn't<00:00:37.900> be<00:00:37.960> working<00:00:38.260> on<00:00:38.350> cars<00:00:38.559> because<00:00:38.920> it

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
shouldn't be working on cars because it

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.020 
shouldn't be working on cars because it
was<00:00:39.250> really<00:00:39.580> easy<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:41.739> couple<00:00:42.489> things<00:00:42.640> that<00:00:42.850> I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
was really easy a couple things that I

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.729 
was really easy a couple things that I
noticed<00:00:43.420> is<00:00:43.629> that<00:00:43.960> if<00:00:44.230> you<00:00:44.350> were<00:00:44.440> from<00:00:44.620> up

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
noticed is that if you were from up

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.290 
noticed is that if you were from up
north<00:00:44.800> you<00:00:45.129> may<00:00:45.250> have<00:00:45.400> more<00:00:45.579> probable<00:00:46.030> getting

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
north you may have more probable getting

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.509 
north you may have more probable getting
the<00:00:46.480> bolts<00:00:46.809> out<00:00:46.930> because<00:00:47.379> of<00:00:47.589> rust<00:00:47.890> you<00:00:48.369> may

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
the bolts out because of rust you may

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.460 
the bolts out because of rust you may
have<00:00:48.640> to<00:00:48.729> use<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:48.879> little<00:00:49.059> bit<00:00:49.119> of<00:00:49.180> heat<00:00:49.420> or<00:00:49.690> some

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
have to use a little bit of heat or some

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.280 
have to use a little bit of heat or some
rust<00:00:50.710> Buster<00:00:51.100> on<00:00:51.220> it<00:00:51.400> as<00:00:51.850> far<00:00:52.449> as<00:00:52.659> mine<00:00:53.019> they

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
rust Buster on it as far as mine they

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.340 
rust Buster on it as far as mine they
came<00:00:53.470> right<00:00:53.680> out<00:00:53.760> first<00:00:54.760> thing<00:00:55.000> is<00:00:55.299> use<00:00:55.780> an<00:00:56.080> air

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
came right out first thing is use an air

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.829 
came right out first thing is use an air
ratchet<00:00:56.650> it<00:00:57.250> cut<00:00:57.489> my<00:00:57.640> time<00:00:57.879> and<00:00:58.030> about<00:00:58.299> quarter

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
ratchet it cut my time and about quarter

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.119 
ratchet it cut my time and about quarter
probably<00:00:59.170> what<00:00:59.290> it<00:00:59.409> would<00:00:59.500> be<00:00:59.650> if<00:00:59.799> I<00:00:59.979> was

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
probably what it would be if I was

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.670 
probably what it would be if I was
turning<00:01:00.339> an<00:01:00.699> actual<00:01:01.119> wrench<00:01:01.470> just<00:01:02.470> because

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
turning an actual wrench just because

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.130 
turning an actual wrench just because
it's<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.040> much<00:01:03.189> faster<00:01:03.519> second<00:01:04.420> always<00:01:04.600> paint

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
it's so much faster second always paint

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.570 
it's so much faster second always paint
the<00:01:05.260> inside<00:01:05.590> of<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.830> fender<00:01:05.979> don't<00:01:06.340> just

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
the inside of the fender don't just

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.910 
the inside of the fender don't just
stick<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:06.939> Fender<00:01:07.270> on<00:01:07.299> there<00:01:07.630> with<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:08.020> primer

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
stick a Fender on there with the primer

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.399 
stick a Fender on there with the primer
on<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.250> inside<00:01:09.610> first<00:01:10.600> of<00:01:10.750> all<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:10.990> looks<00:01:11.200> bad

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
on the inside first of all it looks bad

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.480 
on the inside first of all it looks bad
and<00:01:11.950> then<00:01:12.100> second<00:01:13.049> really<00:01:14.049> it's<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.500> won't<00:01:15.250> give

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
and then second really it's a won't give

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.350 
and then second really it's a won't give
you<00:01:15.580> much<00:01:15.729> rust<00:01:16.000> protection<00:01:16.509> with<00:01:16.659> that<00:01:17.280> so

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you much rust protection with that so

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.640 
you much rust protection with that so
that's<00:01:19.360> about<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:19.720> here's<00:01:20.110> some<00:01:20.230> videos<00:01:20.680> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
that's about it here's some videos I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.039 
that's about it here's some videos I
started<00:01:23.650> looking<00:01:23.860> at<00:01:23.950> this<00:01:24.100> fender

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
started looking at this fender

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.609 
started looking at this fender
right<00:01:26.710> in<00:01:26.859> here<00:01:27.130> it's<00:01:27.399> all<00:01:27.579> bent<00:01:27.880> back<00:01:28.619> it's

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
right in here it's all bent back it's

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.149 
right in here it's all bent back it's
been<00:01:29.829> across<00:01:30.219> the<00:01:30.369> top

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
been across the top

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.950 
been across the top
it's<00:01:33.159> buckled<00:01:33.670> up<00:01:33.820> right<00:01:34.299> here<00:01:34.450> on<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.689> end

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
it's buckled up right here on the end

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.370 
it's buckled up right here on the end
and<00:01:35.289> this<00:01:36.039> end<00:01:36.100> smashed<00:01:36.700> down<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:40.140> let's<00:01:41.140> start

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
and this end smashed down so let's start

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.580 
and this end smashed down so let's start
the<00:01:41.530> initial<00:01:41.679> bodywork<00:01:42.369> on<00:01:42.579> it<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:44.079> we'll<00:01:44.409> see

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
the initial bodywork on it and we'll see

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.010 
the initial bodywork on it and we'll see
where<00:01:44.740> we<00:01:44.890> end<00:01:44.920> up<00:01:45.569> usually<00:01:46.569> you<00:01:46.840> need<00:01:46.990> a

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
where we end up usually you need a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:02:08.370 
where we end up usually you need a
hammer<00:02:02.340> okay<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.579> lied<00:02:04.090> when<00:02:06.959> you<00:02:07.959> get<00:02:08.170> one<00:02:08.349> of

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
solvent so drying out of it

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.900 
solvent so drying out of it
so<00:05:31.930> it<00:05:31.990> created<00:05:32.440> just<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.800> little<00:05:33.100> bit<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:33.370> it's
