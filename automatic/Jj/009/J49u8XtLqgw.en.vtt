00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.350
 sports page well found perugia calcio i'm at foreground and ballet 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.790
 figures shake the fans who organized a Friday afternoon 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.350
 press conference the renato stadium cares about perugia in which they ask to return 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.110
 public the financial statements of the company and also ask the other prospective 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.000
 creditors to present themselves to the eventual bankruptcy of the next 4 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.480
 May in the meantime 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.789
 2 important news from trapella company sources 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.130
 that covarelli could reach a settlement agreement in the next few hours 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.370
 kornati lo sun who filed for bankruptcy of 14 million 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.230
 euros against covarelli from fonts close to the college of experts 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.850
 accounting professionals of the municipality responsible for viewing the books 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.180
 accounting beautiful perugia to carry out the expertise would emerge a debt 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.180
 total of the company that would correspond to the figures reported by 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.220
 covarelli in recent days and that is about 4 million euro figure 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.700
 far away from the one initially feared by sources 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.310
 therefore close to the experts in charge of pyrone life, how to understand a reality 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.510
 completely different from that of a few hours ago for this that i 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.680
 supporters ask to make public to make public the budgets are being 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.150
 activating because their first interest is said in the conference 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.390
 print is the absolute maintenance of the category 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.370
 the Perugia fans are not putting us in the middle of reversibility of the budgets 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.829
 go on the counterattack 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.729
 asking that they be published and even better inviting 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.280
 all those who have claims against Perugia football a 

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:46.520
 to appear in court on May 4th when the judge is 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.649
 will discuss the instance of bankruptcy advanced by the brothers the sun the reason 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.460
 is very clear the fans now have a belief in their heads that alone 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:57.829
 through the so-called bankruptcy failure that perugia can save 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:58.840
 the category 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.240
 the risk, however, is that on 4 May next covarelli can present itself with 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.679
 a settlement agreement with the sun itself 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.439
 or with a defensive memorial 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.999
 which fully contest the instance of the Roman group 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:13.279
 the fact that the players have not put the company in default for reasons not 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:17.579
 better specified it is said that having signed the disclaimers they would risk 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.880
 a disqualification the judicial story could dwell on they are cleverly 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.589
 if there are no other pending bankruptcy petitions 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:26.879
 if that happened 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.010
 it would arrive June 30 with a still safe but still perugia 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.030
 indebted 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.569
 icons any cordate that would not be willing to take on the 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.469
 covarelli debt if this was more than 5 6 million euro 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:40.919
 with this perspective 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:45.139
 the scenarios would be dramatic perugia canceled from professional football 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:50.010
 it is forced to leave amateurs again, but the concern of the fans is that 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:52.150
 behind it there is also an unclear turn 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.169
 that favors other entrepreneurs 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.049
 ready to take the opportunity to buy perugia 0 euro and put 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.309
 hands on projects that no one from gaucci to covarelli passing through 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:02.260
 silvestrini 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.949
 emma managed to get 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:07.520
 this is why pride becomes an essential ram with the fans 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.760
 who ask to make public budgets already directly at the hearing before the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.579
 judge 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.540
 with the invitation from other creditors to present the roll counters 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.540
 in the May 4th hearing to put the judge in the same conditions 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.460
 to have all the papers in order to speed up the times they would lead to 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.610
 appointment of a bankruptcy trustee who subsequently 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.079
 interested parties may sell the sporting title 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.880
 also because in the stories of football failures 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.410
 only a part of the credits will be honored while with the so-called 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.869
 piloted bankruptcy 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:42.309
 sports debts would pass the new owners icon the settled players 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.299
 the other debtors would become privileged creditors 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.059
 whereas these creditors could also recover something 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.329
 from the sale of the sports title the battle is fought on several fronts by 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.619
 a part covarelli that is trying in every way to avoid the instance 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:59.730
 on the other, local institutions 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.190
 that according to the fans 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.429
 could have some role in the times of justice 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:06.249
 the fans, however, go further 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:08.939
 they say they are ready to challenge the new property 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.560
 which will detect me as amateurs if all these steps were not 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:13.589
 guaranteed 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:15.039
 the impression 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.859
 eeeeh clear price to all that is what makes pastime 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.169
 ok it gets to the point that both institutions will come to say 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.970
 that all of us have tried, however, has gone outside this is not there 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.180
 nothing to do will come 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.889
 E-commerce layoffs fucked so much we all know he tramples the 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:37.690
 word 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.310
 a tangled situation will pass from you as savior of the country 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.020
 but in short 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.670
 apprentice of various kinds 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.349
 alleged interests and external consortiums that are pressing to know what will happen 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.759
 next 4 May will be a key date in this incredible story yes 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.529
 with each passing day it becomes more and more strange to you 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.910
 and now we talk about the commitments of the weekend Perugia in the field of pagans 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.290
 against the paganese we see the paganese graphic that to avoid the relegation 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.669
 direct the referee will be the sguizzato lady of verona of verona
