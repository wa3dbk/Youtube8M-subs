up a little too nicely but it's a

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.030 
up a little too nicely but it's a
message<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.300> hope<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.870> like<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.470> even

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
message of hope and I like that even

and better time and especially this
period<00:02:57.820> but<00:02:58.330> then<00:02:58.480> there's<00:02:58.660> war<00:02:58.960> and
