just finds a way to put that ball in the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.449 
just finds a way to put that ball in the
back<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.079> net<00:02:59.290> he<00:02:59.620> makes<00:02:59.859> really<00:03:00.190> good

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
back of the net he makes really good

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.400 
back of the net he makes really good
runs<00:03:00.790> although<00:03:01.150> his<00:03:01.299> speed<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.720> 79<00:03:02.230> he

a<00:03:48.130> little<00:03:48.250> bit<00:03:48.459> surprising<00:03:48.819> I<00:03:49.030> thought<00:03:49.180> he<00:03:49.239> was

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
a little bit surprising I thought he was

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.000 
a little bit surprising I thought he was
going<00:03:49.419> to<00:03:49.510> be<00:03:49.630> not<00:03:50.079> very<00:03:50.319> good<00:03:50.590> when<00:03:50.739> I<00:03:50.769> first

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010

them because I just something about his
is<00:06:38.460> super<00:06:38.820> inaccurate<00:06:39.330> for<00:06:39.510> me<00:06:39.600> but<00:06:39.810> his

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
is super inaccurate for me but his

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.320 
is super inaccurate for me but his
defense<00:06:40.590> was<00:06:40.650> fantastic<00:06:41.400> that<00:06:41.550> speed<00:06:42.000> again

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330

really<00:06:42.840> helps<00:06:43.080> out<00:06:43.200> especially<00:06:43.410> in<00:06:43.770> the

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
really helps out especially in the

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.440 
really helps out especially in the
center<00:06:44.130> back<00:06:44.280> position<00:06:44.700> where<00:06:45.150> there<00:06:45.300> is

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
center back position where there is

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.240 
center back position where there is
normally<00:06:45.750> a<00:06:45.990> lack<00:06:46.230> of<00:06:46.260> speed<00:06:46.590> but<00:06:46.860> like<00:06:47.040> I<00:06:47.190> said

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
normally a lack of speed but like I said

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.280 
normally a lack of speed but like I said
his<00:06:47.760> headers<00:06:48.120> are<00:06:48.330> a<00:06:48.360> little<00:06:48.540> bit<00:06:48.750> weak<00:06:48.960> for<00:06:49.170> me

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
his headers are a little bit weak for me

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.960 
his headers are a little bit weak for me
and<00:06:49.500> he<00:06:49.680> got<00:06:49.800> a<00:06:49.830> nice<00:06:50.070> little<00:06:50.340> average<00:06:50.550> match

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
and he got a nice little average match

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.180 
and he got a nice little average match
rating<00:06:51.240> there<00:06:51.450> the<00:06:51.990> left-back<00:06:52.410> Alvaro<00:06:52.860> per

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
losing out on a lot but he doesn't

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.040 
losing out on a lot but he doesn't
