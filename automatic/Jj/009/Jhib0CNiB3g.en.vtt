little plastic ones out catalog nice but

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.280 
little plastic ones out catalog nice but
they're<00:00:08.490> kind<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.639> short<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.960> can't<00:00:10.200> get

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
they're kind of short and you can't get

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.169 
they're kind of short and you can't get
them<00:00:10.410> very<00:00:10.590> close<00:00:10.889> together<00:00:11.070> plus<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:12.000> cost

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
them very close together plus it cost

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.169 
them very close together plus it cost
money<00:00:12.360> but<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.440> these<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.799> made<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> -<00:00:14.280> crap<00:00:14.519> and

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
money but with these I made a - crap and

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.910 
money but with these I made a - crap and
I<00:00:15.299> used<00:00:15.480> an<00:00:15.599> air<00:00:15.750> nailer<00:00:16.109> hook<00:00:16.619> them<00:00:16.770> through

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
I used an air nailer hook them through

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.529 
I used an air nailer hook them through
the<00:00:17.039> backside<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:19.910> Plus<00:00:20.910> these<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.270> taller

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the backside and Plus these are taller

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.970 
the backside and Plus these are taller
so<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.199> get<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> good<00:00:22.500> angle<00:00:22.650> where<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
so I can get a good angle where the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.950 
so I can get a good angle where the
spray<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.580> or<00:00:23.609> spray<00:00:24.060> gun<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.330> get<00:00:24.750> down

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
spray can or spray gun and get down

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.099 
spray can or spray gun and get down
lower<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:26.099> probably<00:00:26.430> better<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.630> 1<00:00:27.960> 1

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
lower it's probably better be about 1 1

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.470 
lower it's probably better be about 1 1
inch<00:00:28.380> taller<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.460> I've<00:00:29.939> already<00:00:30.240> met<00:00:30.359> up

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
inch taller but I've already met up

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.979 
inch taller but I've already met up
these<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.960> used<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.380> pride<00:00:31.560> 75<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.369> 100<00:00:32.730> times

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
these I used to pride 75 to 100 times

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.880 
these I used to pride 75 to 100 times
they<00:00:33.989> worked<00:00:34.200> perfect

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
they worked perfect

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.040
