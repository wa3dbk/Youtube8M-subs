00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
where you don't need a pilot and I think

where you don't need a pilot and I think
that's<00:03:04.690> why<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.260> future<00:03:05.950> with<00:03:06.130> programs<00:03:06.550> like

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
that's why in future with programs like

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.580 
that's why in future with programs like
