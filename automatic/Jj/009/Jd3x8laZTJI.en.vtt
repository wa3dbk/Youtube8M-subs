00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
most from it but it's pretty good for

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
most from it but it's pretty good for

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
the price that was today

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.779 
the price that was today
so<00:00:18.570> let's<00:00:18.810> get<00:00:18.900> started<00:00:19.080> visual<00:00:19.859> things<00:00:20.130> so

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789

comes<00:00:22.740> with<00:00:22.920> MADD<00:00:23.760> gear<00:00:23.789> like<00:00:24.359> think<00:00:24.869> they're

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
comes with MADD gear like think they're

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.670 
comes with MADD gear like think they're
called<00:00:25.140> squid<00:00:25.560> grips<00:00:25.830> or<00:00:26.010> something<00:00:26.539> but<00:00:27.680> they

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
called squid grips or something but they

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.580 
called squid grips or something but they
feel<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> little<00:00:29.250> good<00:00:29.460> at<00:00:29.580> first<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.590> they

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
feel a little good at first but they

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.470 
feel a little good at first but they
start<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> peel<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:33.000> really<00:00:33.270> weird

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
start to peel like it's really weird

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.630 
start to peel like it's really weird
that<00:00:33.840> they<00:00:34.410> start<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> peel<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.160> rip<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> little

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that they start to peel and rip a little

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.790 
that they start to peel and rip a little
bit<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.630> kind<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.079> replace<00:00:37.410> them<00:00:37.649> but

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
bit so you kind of replace them but

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.369 
bit so you kind of replace them but
they're<00:00:37.980> pretty<00:00:38.340> good<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.879> first<00:00:39.379> maybe

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
they're pretty good for the first maybe

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.229 
they're pretty good for the first maybe
you<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.770> last<00:00:40.950> them<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> month<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.090> then

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you can last them about a month and then

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.690 
you can last them about a month and then
you<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.200> scripts<00:00:43.920> are<00:00:44.070> cheap<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.550> not<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you know scripts are cheap so it's not a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.740 
you know scripts are cheap so it's not a
big<00:00:44.789> deal<00:00:45.200> and<00:00:46.200> let's<00:00:46.680> go<00:00:46.800> down<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> bars

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
big deal and let's go down to the bars

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.020 
big deal and let's go down to the bars
third<00:00:48.750> they're<00:00:49.649> not<00:00:49.800> bad<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> mean<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.910> right

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
third they're not bad I mean all right

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.510 
third they're not bad I mean all right
they're<00:00:51.210> eighteen<00:00:51.629> point<00:00:51.870> five<00:00:52.020> wide

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
they're eighteen point five wide

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.010 
they're eighteen point five wide
twenty-one<00:00:53.520> tall<00:00:53.730> no<00:00:54.210> twenty-two<00:00:54.780> thought

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
twenty-one tall no twenty-two thought

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.610 
twenty-one tall no twenty-two thought
but<00:00:55.680> notice<00:00:56.190> how<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> deck<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.410> shorter<00:00:58.410> than

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
but notice how the deck is shorter than

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.569 
but notice how the deck is shorter than
most<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.370> part<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.500> feels<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:01.980> 21

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
most like this part so it feels like 21

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.830 
most like this part so it feels like 21
and<00:01:04.580> yeah<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.150> mean<00:01:06.570> they're<00:01:06.810> just

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and yeah they're I mean they're just

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.630 
and yeah they're I mean they're just
bars<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.740> think<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.040> look<00:01:08.280> cool<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
bars if you think they look cool and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640 
bars if you think they look cool and
that's<00:01:08.790> good<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.200> thing<00:01:10.439> though

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that's good for you the one thing though

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.910 
that's good for you the one thing though
it's<00:01:10.890> kind<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.159> ghetto<00:01:11.400> look<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.920> but

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it's kind of ghetto look at that but

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.270 
it's kind of ghetto look at that but
it's<00:01:14.070> honestly<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> big<00:01:14.820> deal<00:01:15.830> um<00:01:16.830> they'll

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it's honestly not a big deal um they'll

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.160 
it's honestly not a big deal um they'll
clamp<00:01:17.610> no<00:01:18.090> problems<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
clamp no problems with that it's just a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.179 
clamp no problems with that it's just a
regular<00:01:19.530> triple<00:01:19.740> clamp<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:21.390> headset<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
regular triple clamp the headset it is a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.840 
regular triple clamp the headset it is a
threaded<00:01:23.580> headset<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:25.340> can't<00:01:26.340> expect<00:01:26.670> much

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
threaded headset so can't expect much

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.910 
threaded headset so can't expect much
from<00:01:26.880> now<00:01:30.200> but<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.350> might<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.619> better<00:01:31.799> than

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
from now but it might be better than

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.469 
from now but it might be better than
like<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.400> average<00:01:32.610> razor<00:01:34.340> um<00:01:35.400> go<00:01:36.090> down<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
like the average razor um go down to the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.710 
like the average razor um go down to the
fork<00:01:36.810> along<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.829> fork<00:01:38.299> my<00:01:39.299> pretty<00:01:39.600> sure

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
fork along with the fork my pretty sure

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.270 
fork along with the fork my pretty sure
it's<00:01:39.840> stronger<00:01:40.229> than<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.680> writer<00:01:40.920> ultra

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
it's stronger than like a writer ultra

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.350 
it's stronger than like a writer ultra
pro<00:01:41.400> fork<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:42.000> pretty<00:01:42.150> sure<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
pro fork because I'm pretty sure I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.300 
pro fork because I'm pretty sure I
looked<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.780> before<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:44.009> kind<00:01:44.070> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
looked at it before and it's kind of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.149 
looked at it before and it's kind of
thick<00:01:44.549> ish<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.079> steel<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:47.009> not

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
thick ish and it is steel so it's not

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.499 
thick ish and it is steel so it's not
bad<00:01:48.320> yeah<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> wheels<00:01:50.090> they're<00:01:51.090> pretty<00:01:51.299> good

doesn't break wheels pretty good Gladish

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.630 
doesn't break wheels pretty good Gladish
and<00:02:02.719> they're<00:02:03.719> lasting<00:02:04.049> good<00:02:07.340> now<00:02:08.340> let's<00:02:08.550> go

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and they're lasting good now let's go

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.690 
and they're lasting good now let's go
down<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.090> deck

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
down to this deck

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.309 
down to this deck
so<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.650> mean<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:12.760> really<00:02:12.940> light<00:02:13.270> like<00:02:14.080> it's

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
so I mean it's really light like it's

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.910 
so I mean it's really light like it's
almost<00:02:14.590> like<00:02:15.150> not<00:02:16.150> ultra<00:02:16.540> pro<00:02:16.810> but<00:02:17.110> it's<00:02:17.709> a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
almost like not ultra pro but it's a

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.210 
almost like not ultra pro but it's a
little<00:02:18.190> bit<00:02:18.280> more<00:02:18.489> than<00:02:18.670> ultra<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:20.220> almost

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
little bit more than ultra it almost

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.890 
little bit more than ultra it almost
kind<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.640> feels<00:02:21.819> like<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.030> soda<00:02:22.360> can<00:02:22.450> like<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
kind of feels like a soda can like the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.040 
kind of feels like a soda can like the
old<00:02:23.020> photos<00:02:23.380> but<00:02:23.650> not<00:02:23.800> not<00:02:24.130> quite<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.670> bad

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
old photos but not not quite that bad

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.550 
old photos but not not quite that bad
and<00:02:26.310> yeah<00:02:27.310> it's<00:02:27.489> because<00:02:27.700> they<00:02:28.560> fluted

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
and yeah it's because they fluted

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.260 
and yeah it's because they fluted
wherever<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:30.670> I'm<00:02:30.910> pretty<00:02:30.940> sure

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
wherever that is but I'm pretty sure

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.729 
wherever that is but I'm pretty sure
it's<00:02:31.420> when<00:02:31.540> they<00:02:31.630> scrape<00:02:32.200> away<00:02:32.350> see<00:02:32.470> how

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
it's when they scrape away see how

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.300 
it's when they scrape away see how
there's<00:02:32.980> little<00:02:33.850> lines<00:02:34.180> there<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:38.380> yeah<00:02:39.040> it

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
there's little lines there and yeah it

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.160 
there's little lines there and yeah it
does<00:02:39.489> make<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.730> it's<00:02:40.120> pretty<00:02:40.360> like<00:02:40.599> a<00:02:40.750> saying

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
does make it it's pretty like a saying

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.729 
does make it it's pretty like a saying
and<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:42.130> is<00:02:42.370> like<00:02:43.239> as<00:02:43.510> they<00:02:43.840> call<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.080> scalped

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
and this is like as they call it scalped

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.520 
and this is like as they call it scalped
which<00:02:45.640> just<00:02:46.000> basically<00:02:46.180> it's<00:02:46.510> like<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.870> and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
which just basically it's like that and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.009 
which just basically it's like that and
if<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.709> actually<00:02:47.830> look<00:02:48.130> at<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:49.019> it's

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
if you actually look at it it's

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.830 
if you actually look at it it's
extremely<00:02:50.410> thin<00:02:51.130> like<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.819> can<00:02:52.000> fit<00:02:52.180> my<00:02:52.299> toes<00:02:52.630> in

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
extremely thin like I can fit my toes in

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.990 
extremely thin like I can fit my toes in
there<00:02:53.019> like<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:54.160> toes<00:02:54.580> like<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:57.000> yeah

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
there like I to toes like that and yeah

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.890 
there like I to toes like that and yeah
it's<00:02:58.269> 4.0<00:02:59.200> wide<00:02:59.410> which<00:03:00.030> isn't<00:03:01.030> like

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
it's 4.0 wide which isn't like

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.640 
it's 4.0 wide which isn't like
preferable<00:03:02.590> that's<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:03.360> 4.25<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.480> like

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
preferable that's like 4.25 is like

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.710 
preferable that's like 4.25 is like
preferable<00:03:05.650> but<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:08.519> there's<00:03:09.519> 19.5<00:03:10.360> long

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
preferable but and there's 19.5 long

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.009 
preferable but and there's 19.5 long
which<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.590> pretty<00:03:12.370> standard<00:03:12.720> it's<00:03:13.720> actually

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
which is pretty standard it's actually

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.080 
which is pretty standard it's actually
not<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.230> bad<00:03:14.410> size<00:03:14.620> but<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.640> width<00:03:15.850> would<00:03:16.060> be

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
not a bad size but the width would be

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.140 
not a bad size but the width would be
you<00:03:16.810> mean<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.019> suppose<00:03:17.350> maybe<00:03:17.620> like<00:03:17.859> 4.3<00:03:19.079> and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
you mean I suppose maybe like 4.3 and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.630 
you mean I suppose maybe like 4.3 and
yeah<00:03:22.150> one<00:03:22.690> thing<00:03:23.070> if<00:03:24.070> you're<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.280> big<00:03:24.430> fan<00:03:24.459> of

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
yeah one thing if you're a big fan of

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.420 
yeah one thing if you're a big fan of
grinding<00:03:25.500> then<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:26.739> might<00:03:26.950> not<00:03:26.980> be<00:03:27.130> good<00:03:27.250> for

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
grinding then this might not be good for

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.340 
grinding then this might not be good for
you<00:03:27.670> because<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:28.239> mean<00:03:28.510> first<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:28.959> all<00:03:29.049> you<00:03:29.109> got

this<00:03:29.470> huge<00:03:30.250> random<00:03:30.579> knob<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:30.970> poking<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.630> out

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
this huge random knob is poking it out

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.319 
this huge random knob is poking it out
like<00:03:33.209> out<00:03:34.209> of<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.420> surface<00:03:34.690> like<00:03:35.109> that<00:03:35.440> much

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
like out of the surface like that much

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.640 
like out of the surface like that much
which<00:03:37.329> I<00:03:37.540> don't<00:03:37.780> know<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:37.900> feel<00:03:38.440> like<00:03:38.560> they

would jack up your grinds a little bit
and<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:41.380> mean<00:03:41.709> Feebles<00:03:42.190> probably<00:03:43.090> fine<00:03:43.329> with<00:03:43.510> it

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220

is a box because like look at that it
curves<00:04:08.799> like<00:04:09.010> that<00:04:09.660> which<00:04:10.660> because<00:04:11.380> of<00:04:11.500> the

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
curves like that which because of the

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.770 
curves like that which because of the
curve<00:04:11.920> also<00:04:12.519> would<00:04:13.000> not<00:04:13.120> be<00:04:13.239> good<00:04:13.359> for<00:04:13.420> finger

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780
