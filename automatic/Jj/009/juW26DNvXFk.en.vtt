00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.130
 Welcome to her 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.170
 and here I bring you another video guys and 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.360
 this time I bring you new news about 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.000
 the t1 14 the next update of 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.730
 our xbox 360 minecraft and also 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.160
 as not for playstation3 it turns out that 4 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.840
 j studies during these last days has 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.910
 said some little things on twitter 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.220
 interesting and that's what we're going to see in 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.560
 this video also to tell you that during 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.539
 today he has left some images 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.100
 also pretty cool that confirm a 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.379
 couple of little things that were not very clear 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.449
 I 'm going to leave you some background images of 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.850
 underground survival that I 've given a 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.199
 Small walk through this ancient map east 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.909
 his rival that we made a long time ago 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.890
 it was nostalgic and of good plan 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.239
 let's take a little spin 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.860
 I missed I visited wilson 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.180
 all those things what has most 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.650
 called the attention that said four 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.479
 jota studies in recent weeks 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.100
 it really has been a tweet in which he said 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.080
 explicitly that they were working on 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.659
 the errors of the update and that 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.699
 every time it was closer they do not give many 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.019
 details as always but good yo 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.729
 I have slight hopes that 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.379
 there really is little time left for the 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.090
 next update apart from that 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.409
 message of hope what has most 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.479
 called attention are obviously the 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.810
 new images that have put yes that is 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.970
 true that makes some 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.640
 and they put some images but for me 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.920
 a little bit confused about some things and 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.240
 with this new image that they have put in 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.250
 today, yes, they have already 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.560
 clarified a couple of things I wanted 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.270
 know and I did not know until this 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.159
 had not confirmed them because 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.679
 many times those images you already know that 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.229
 they have double senses hidden things and 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.329
 many times it is clear to us I do not know why 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.799
 what do they do to increase the hype 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.049
 so that we are more and more awake every day 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.340
 but I think it works because every time 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.049
 I'm looking forward to the next 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.899
 update in the first of the 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.280
 screens of this new image yes that 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.340
 you see some things that we have already 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.130
 talked about and we're going to ignore for example 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.789
 potted plants and emerald villagers 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.009
 you see carrots pumpkin pies are 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.479
 see an interest that this too I think 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.340
 that we saw in previous images if 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.530
 I'm not wrong and the only thing that has 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.659
 called more attention to this image 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.069
 it is a message that can be seen next 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.880
 of the plants where you put this 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:13.069
 test number 8 a good gamertag seattle 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.410
 is transported to the position of 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.880
 another player this is a new function 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.680
 which is going to be included in the next 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.840
 update on both playstation 3 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.609
 box that will allow us if we are 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.109
 multiplayer playing several people 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.810
 be able to teleport to position 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:29.420
 of others in minecraft pc it is the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.189
 typical very used very classic command 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.930
 that is called atp will serve us for 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.579
 move a little easier on the maps 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.650
 and we play multiplayer and it's something that I 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.120
 I think it will be appreciated a lot if 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.799
 there is a detail of the villagers that 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.209
 could comment and is that they are different 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.489
 each other you know that the villagers 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.109
 normally in minecraft the boss 360 are 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.879
 quite similar and now it is 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:50.030
 true that it seems that they change some 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.709
 details of the image so little more 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.810
 guys and tell you that obviously leander 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.939
 who looks something different or something changed 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.409
 because a texture pack is being used in 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.359
 the second screen can be seen 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.180
 minecraft of playstation3 and the only thing 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.560
 I would highlight that image because of the 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.989
 new update does not look much in 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.939
 that image is that you see what the 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.379
 texture so that the skin packs that I create 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.359
 that at the moment in minecraft of 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.760
 playstation3 are not available and for 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.769
 what I've seen 4j studies with this 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.639
 image and with some other tweet what 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.409
 wants 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.209
 good to reflect is that in playstation 3 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.340
 with the new update yes that 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.989
 will come these new functions I do not know if 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.889
 they will have all skin packs and texture 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.520
 so we already have 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.770
 3 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.450
 but it is clear that some are going to 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.980
 add this would be the image that they have 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.380
 published today more 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.790
 information or more specific information 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.920
 they have not given themselves that they have dropped 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.210
 some little things out there but you know 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.160
 that until it is confirmed to me not 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.860
 I like talking about that kind of stuff 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.240
 moment this is let 's say the last 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.460
 information that they have given what has 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.200
 seemed to me more interesting not you 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.490
 worry because they take out new 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.960
 information the list of changes already 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.180
 official update that you have 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.830
