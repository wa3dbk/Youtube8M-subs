00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:09.370
 what is going on is like this super expression 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:14.889
 well I am already law here and we are playing 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.390
 an operations simulator game that 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.630
 it made me pretty interesting I was 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.910
 looking for a game that was like 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.619
 operations like this I found this because 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.810
 well, nothing else is like the same thing 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.029
 the same thing do you know I'm talking type by 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.560
 example south agens enplater that also 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.390
 I like many at stake I have not 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.829
 tried even but good habit of 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.020
 companies and that is pretty successful 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.690
 father but good actually this 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.560
 liked it is also not as much as that in 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:46.240
 first person but rather it's like a 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.010
 this click click I do not know how good you 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.350
 you have to explain to the mother chair 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.540
 so they pull then there are several 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.940
 operations there operation of heart of 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.770
 heard from a tooth a guy who 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.430
 a tooth fell because I know why 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.290
 they throw them with a baseball 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.300
 then imagine, imagine how you 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.670
 the teeth were left then this 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.650
 occasion we're going to do the eye so 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.150
 If you want to see the other operations, 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.220
 forget to leave your super lay and that 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.290
 let's go to it and it says operation says 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.510
 instants of this fits says your 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.490
 today's patient is maribel are for 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.770
 coming back from school after a few 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.050
 summer vacation when you realize 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.250
 that his vision is getting a bit 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:34.479
 blurred he or the eye doctor or the doctor of 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.240
 his eyes diagnosed him as having 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.580
 clouds in the eye and that that does not 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.850
 have a good view that actually happened 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.500
 an uncle of mine and it's pretty ugly because this 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.150
 if it hurts or is not like the sight 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.280
 tired is osama us islands 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.170
 of the tired sight and that is going 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.690
 causing like that in place in the eyes 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.570
 then in fact it's visible is not a 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.530
 green person and you can see here that is 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.480
 that they look like I do not know how 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.090
 I do not know how a myth and that and those are the 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.550
 clouds just as you see it he sees through 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.190
 of the eye then it's pretty pretty 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:17.450
 annoying and you are going to have to replace 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:20.530
 in the reticle of mary ok because for a 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.530
 by an artificial lens 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.680
 and he says and that will make his vision 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.840
 better says although there are doctors I think that 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.409
 operating rooms would choose good 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.420
 Well clearly this one says obviously 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.110
 Well, this game is against time sometimes 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.110
 okay 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.580
 If we are wrong in something, we are left with 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.110
 logical point to try not to 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.330
 wrong and says moment 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.260
 and we're going to have to administer a 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.140
 local anesthesia so that I myself do not 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.950
 be not in pain and for your child 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.500
 be prepared so let's start 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.420
 put the drops or my god too 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.780
 I mean, it happened quite real 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.580
 in periods I also suffer and good 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.220
 I say because I already did the operation of 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.670
 grind and I swear that I feel that I am 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.500
 I the one they are attending says better 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.400
 ensure more that the area is clean 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.230
 to prevent any infection ok no 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.470
 I know that maybe Miss Wilson 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.180
 bring nights with whatever it is from pillarno 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.760
 although we were going wrong and says 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.160
 we're going to need the spur to 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.490
 hold to keep the eye open 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.120
 okay 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.120
 you have to swim 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:47.400
 says now let's start the operation 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.970
 with a small opening opening in the 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.970
 cornea 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.159
 okay 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.260
 and a little gray 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.860
 Now let's inject a gel to 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.290
 prevent them from losing because they can hold 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.459
 views this please do it 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.670
 we have to hurry because if we do not 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.470
 we hurry this ugly evil 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.870

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.770
 it was take to create an opera one 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.770
 longer opening in the front of the eye 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.770
 okay 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.200
 ah 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.320
 says now let's separate the lens from the 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:42.760
 eye 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.760
 because there is a nest where sandoval 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.520
 ok now we're going to have to salt that for 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.570
 please eat sweets I really do not know how 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.000
 all these tools are said 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.310
 we had the doctor in real life the 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.240
 I was very concerned to know how to say 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.380
 oh my god ok a saline solution 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.140

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.140
 ok when doing the quick operation 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.360
 we have to hurry friends 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.310
 so in five minutes this is 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.100
 done because now we're going to have to 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.630
 wait for it to take effect or that we're going to 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.630
 take the previous 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.200
 two 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.660
 ok now I'm already separated from the crazy 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.840
 come on we have to cut the lens in four 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.840
 pieces to remove it from there 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.029
 ok now we are going to have to look 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.820
 let's see if we no longer have time 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.230
 oh my god 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.020
 ok now we can remove it from them to 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.500

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.430
 artificial lens 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.430
 lens 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.390
 Now you can remove the light spectrum from 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:44.490
 patient 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.380
 so that to prevent 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.259
 and any damage in the crazy we're going to 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.110
 need to hydrate it to maintain 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.860
 tissue of this health
