00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.509 
live especially in an area of Phi soil
like<00:00:09.150> we<00:00:09.300> do<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.750> central<00:00:10.620> Kentucky<00:00:10.650> you

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
like we do here in central Kentucky you

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.549 
like we do here in central Kentucky you
really<00:00:11.910> need<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.240> put<00:00:12.420> lime<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:12.840> at<00:00:13.049> least<00:00:13.290> once

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559

really need to put lime on at least once
a<00:00:13.679> year<00:00:13.710> unless<00:00:14.160> you're<00:00:14.969> going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.440> super

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
a year unless you're going to just super

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.830 
a year unless you're going to just super
soak<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.190> clay<00:00:17.699> soil<00:00:18.060> needs<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.480> lot<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
soak it but clay soil needs a lot of

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.859 
soak it but clay soil needs a lot of
lime<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.020> keep<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.529> pH<00:00:20.010> up<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.939> pH<00:00:21.300> level<00:00:21.750> is

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
lime to keep that pH up the pH level is

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.929 
lime to keep that pH up the pH level is
really<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.410> acid<00:00:22.830> level<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.820> not

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
really the acid level and if it's not

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.849 
really the acid level and if it's not
between<00:00:24.359> six<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.750> seven<00:00:24.869> most<00:00:25.380> things<00:00:25.650> aren't

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
going to even assimilate all that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.330 
going to even assimilate all that
fertilizer<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.080> put<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.470> whether<00:00:29.099> it's

chemical or organic fertilizers it's
going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> hard<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> plant<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
going to have a hard for the plant to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.630 
going to have a hard for the plant to
take<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> pH<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.920> too<00:00:35.130> low<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
take it up when the pH is too low and

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.540 
take it up when the pH is too low and
the<00:00:36.360> pH<00:00:36.690> will<00:00:37.020> be<00:00:37.050> too<00:00:37.440> low<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.980> don't<00:00:38.190> lime

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the pH will be too low if you don't lime

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.450 
the pH will be too low if you don't lime
your<00:00:38.820> soil<00:00:39.149> regularly<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.469> need<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> use<00:00:41.040> at

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
your soil regularly you need to use at

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.790 
your soil regularly you need to use at
least<00:00:41.879> 40<00:00:42.420> pounds<00:00:42.809> per<00:00:42.960> thousand<00:00:43.379> square<00:00:43.590> feet

and<00:00:43.860> probably<00:00:44.489> more<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.910> 80<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.570> 100<00:00:45.870> pounds

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and probably more like 80 to 100 pounds

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.690 
and probably more like 80 to 100 pounds
a<00:00:46.260> thousand<00:00:46.649> square<00:00:46.829> feet<00:00:46.980> here<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.250> central
