it comes
just<00:02:14.260> about<00:02:14.410> above<00:02:14.650> my<00:02:14.770> ear<00:02:14.800> so<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:16.120> actually

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
just about above my ear so it's actually

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.760 
just about above my ear so it's actually
pretty<00:02:16.480> comfortable<00:02:16.959> after<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.410> couple<00:02:17.650> hours

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
pretty comfortable after a couple hours

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.070 
pretty comfortable after a couple hours
wearing<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.850> do<00:02:18.970> kind<00:02:19.240> of<00:02:19.330> get<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.930> little

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
wearing it you do kind of get a little

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.809 
wearing it you do kind of get a little
soreness<00:02:20.350> on<00:02:20.590> your<00:02:20.709> ear<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.520> from<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
soreness on your ear just from the

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.370 
soreness on your ear just from the
pressure<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.600> then<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.840> think<00:02:23.050> that's<00:02:23.260> going

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
pressure and then I think that's going

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.870 
pressure and then I think that's going
to<00:02:23.440> be<00:02:23.530> from<00:02:23.680> anything<00:02:24.010> even<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.340> regular<00:02:24.640> set

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
to be from anything even a regular set

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.490 
to be from anything even a regular set
of<00:02:24.970> headphones<00:02:25.090> no<00:02:25.810> matter<00:02:25.959> how<00:02:26.110> nice<00:02:26.319> they

of headphones no matter how nice they

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.030 
of headphones no matter how nice they
are

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040
