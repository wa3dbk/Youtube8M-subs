00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
stronger than me because it kind of just

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.599

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
bit harder or subconsciously i guess

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.380 
bit harder or subconsciously i guess
because<00:00:42.069> i<00:00:42.280> really<00:00:42.519> only<00:00:42.640> focus<00:00:43.059> on<00:00:43.179> myself

our<00:02:04.390> shoulders<00:02:04.869> pretty<00:02:05.560> hard<00:02:05.859> because<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:07.119> all

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
our shoulders pretty hard because of all

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.840 
our shoulders pretty hard because of all
these<00:02:07.630> pressing<00:02:08.410> exercises<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:09.100> we<00:02:09.220> did<00:02:09.399> my

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
these pressing exercises that we did my

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.670 
these pressing exercises that we did my
shoulders<00:02:10.270> are<00:02:10.300> pretty<00:02:10.840> sore<00:02:11.110> right<00:02:11.260> here<00:02:11.500> and

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
shoulders are pretty sore right here and

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.640 
shoulders are pretty sore right here and
this<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.700> different<00:02:13.360> variation<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:14.170> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
this is a different variation of the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.110 
this is a different variation of the
dumbbell<00:02:15.250> incline<00:02:15.490> fly

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
dumbbell incline fly

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.820 
dumbbell incline fly
I<00:02:16.180> actually<00:02:16.540> showed<00:02:16.930> me<00:02:17.049> this<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.409> don't<00:02:17.769> know

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
I actually showed me this I don't know

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.770 
I actually showed me this I don't know
if<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.980> guys<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.099> tell<00:02:18.400> but<00:02:18.430> my<00:02:18.670> back<00:02:18.909> is<00:02:19.180> kind

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
if you guys can tell but my back is kind

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.589 
if you guys can tell but my back is kind
of<00:02:19.900> off<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.590> edge<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.819> bench<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.330> little

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
of off the edge of the bench a little

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.050 
of off the edge of the bench a little
bit<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:23.260> allowed<00:02:23.560> me<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.069> get<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.549> greater

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
bit this allowed me to get a greater

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.720 
bit this allowed me to get a greater
range<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.080> motion<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.650> sometimes<00:02:27.489> when<00:02:27.640> you

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
range of motion and sometimes when you

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.250 
range of motion and sometimes when you
do<00:02:27.849> these<00:02:28.000> this<00:02:28.569> happen<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.900> anyone<00:02:29.080> else

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
do these this happen to anyone else

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.960 
do these this happen to anyone else
where<00:02:29.560> you'll<00:02:30.099> be<00:02:30.129> doing<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.760> your

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
where you'll be doing it in your

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.089 
where you'll be doing it in your
shoulders<00:02:31.569> or<00:02:31.810> your<00:02:31.840> scapula<00:02:32.739> will<00:02:32.890> kind<00:02:33.040> of

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
shoulders or your scapula will kind of

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.280 
shoulders or your scapula will kind of
get<00:02:33.220> pinched<00:02:33.670> up<00:02:33.879> against<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.720> bench<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.200> you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
get pinched up against the bench and you

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.600 
get pinched up against the bench and you
can't<00:02:35.500> really<00:02:35.560> get<00:02:35.799> that<00:02:35.920> great<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.430> range

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
can't really get that great of a range

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.190 
can't really get that great of a range
of<00:02:36.730> motion<00:02:37.090> but<00:02:37.360> doing<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.870> way<00:02:37.930> of

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
of motion but doing it this way of

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.690 
of motion but doing it this way of
putting<00:02:38.440> your<00:02:38.590> back<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.799> little<00:02:39.129> bit<00:02:39.310> off<00:02:39.519> the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
putting your back a little bit off the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.399 
putting your back a little bit off the
bench<00:02:39.909> gives<00:02:40.659> you<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.810> little<00:02:40.989> bit<00:02:41.200> better

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
bench gives you a little bit better

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.960 
bench gives you a little bit better
stretch<00:02:41.829> so<00:02:42.069> that's<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.340> something<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.790> try

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
stretch so that's just something to try

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.270 
stretch so that's just something to try
out<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.390> then<00:02:43.720> for<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.170> triceps<00:02:44.409> what<00:02:44.860> we<00:02:45.010> did

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
out and then for the triceps what we did

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.449 
out and then for the triceps what we did
was<00:02:45.909> three<00:02:46.780> sets<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.530> three<00:02:48.280> different

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
was three sets of three different

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.479 
was three sets of three different
exercises<00:02:49.090> we<00:02:49.420> started<00:02:49.870> with<00:02:50.620> some<00:02:51.129> skull

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
exercises we started with some skull

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.789 
exercises we started with some skull

on<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.489> heaviest<00:02:55.150> easy<00:02:55.599> bar<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:56.440> my<00:02:56.709> gym<00:02:56.920> has

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
on the heaviest easy bar that my gym has

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.440 
on the heaviest easy bar that my gym has
which<00:02:57.310> i<00:02:57.430> think<00:02:57.489> is<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.819> hundred<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.329> ten

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.690 
which i think is a hundred and ten
pounds<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.049> he's<00:02:59.739> wrapping<00:03:00.069> that<00:03:00.160> out<00:03:00.340> pretty

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
pounds and he's wrapping that out pretty

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.970 
pounds and he's wrapping that out pretty
easily<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.390> then<00:03:01.900> after<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.319> what<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:02.799> did

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
easily and then after that what we did

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.140 
easily and then after that what we did
was<00:03:03.940> another<00:03:04.629> extension<00:03:05.620> exercise<00:03:06.400> for

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
was another extension exercise for

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.300 
was another extension exercise for
triceps<00:03:07.390> with<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.079> dumbbell<00:03:08.440> one<00:03:08.709> at<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:08.980> time

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
triceps with the dumbbell one at a time

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.309 
triceps with the dumbbell one at a time
this<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.150> an<00:03:10.359> exercise<00:03:10.659> where<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:10.989> have<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.290> go

and just one arm at a time i did about
fifteen<00:03:19.510> reps<00:03:20.079> for<00:03:20.560> each<00:03:21.160> set<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:21.760> pyramid
