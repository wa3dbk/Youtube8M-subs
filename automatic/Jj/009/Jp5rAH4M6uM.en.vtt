00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.549
 and we are here with another smartphone 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.990
 top of the line but how many top gadgets 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.599
 line we have on the market the 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.220
 device of the time is the nokia lumia 920 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.950
 as well as the other members of the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.320
 lumia holo 1920 family comes with windows 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.210
 phone 8 and to justify the title of 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.280
 top of the line it comes with processor 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.440
 dual core 1.5 ghz gpu adreno 225 e 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.390
 1gb ram as windows phone 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.220
 to better manage ram memory 1gb 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.830
 ensures good performance for 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.960
 storage it has 32 gb 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.750
 and can not expand 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.839
 it still has 4g network support in addition 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.650
 of traditional wifi bluetooth nfc and 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.549
 gps 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.570
 the lcd screen is one of the highlights with 4.5 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:59.379
 inches and resolution of 1280 by 768 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.330
 points 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.400
 it has a technology called 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.950
 clearblack display that through 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.740
 films reduce glare and improve 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.010
 visualization and other technology to 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.719
 motion hd complements the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.060
 further improving the visualization 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.070
 even to use the screen with a very 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.539
 useful on cold days try to do it there 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.509
 on your smartphone to see if it works 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:25.119
 with this hardware and this screen is easy 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.299
 access apps to watch movies and play 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.700
 everything turned out well the only application that 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.009
 has its caveats is the internet explorer 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.630
 some sites do not open the mobile version 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.969
 which makes it difficult to navigate 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.280
 applications ran without 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.229
 problems speaking in an application 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.700
 windows phone problem is just the 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.590
 number of applications 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.630
 although windows phone already appears in 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.310
 some handsets the app number 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.499
 available is still small when 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.020
 compared to android eos 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:56.740
 the main ones are there applications for 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.630
 social networks and mails maps some games 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.299
 are also present but we feel 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.229
 lack of more applications mainly 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.439
 the free ones 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.960
 already on the maps the auction of the nokia is 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.000
 very efficient because you can download it 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.910
 on the device and no longer depend on 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.100
 internet connection for gps to work 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.080
 office is already installed and is 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.239
 save the documents directly in the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.069
 skydrive the device follows the line of 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.550
 other family members also in the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.100
 design 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.280
 Made of durable plastic 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.600
 unit is a single block with no divisions 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.760
 no back cover 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.290
 the slot for the microsim is up here 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.300
 together with the headphone jack 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.850
 heard on the right side the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.730
 volume turns off and a physical button 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.850
 for the camera below the speaker to 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.410
 micro usb input and just the nothing else 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.570
 back is conversation 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.790
 there is a curve out that the appliance 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.620
 is not the smallest or the lightest is 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.550
 even heavy when compared to 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.710
 competitors 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.470
 now the great highlight is the camera 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.050
 he takes 8 megapixel photos with 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.300
 carl zeiss lens and led flash 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.550
 until then everything normal the great differential 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.230
 is the pay per view system that does the 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.090
 photos got even more ready 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.580
 besides it also has a good stabilizer 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.260
 allows you to capture more light 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.360
 and make better photos 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.700
 videos in full HD resolution with 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.550
 excellent quality the front camera does 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.840
 photos with 1.3 megapixels and videos 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.430
 720p 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.560
 his battery is not there much 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.580
 competitors not with 2 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.350
 million perez 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.020
 it has passed our pattern 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.660
 leaving the outlet at 8 in the morning with 100% 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.620
 and at seven-thirty in the evening he had 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.750
 30% of energy or even you can use the 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.350
 whole day but it's always good to have 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.660
 the charger is close by 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.510
 in 1920 and has a robust body and 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.090
 Tough image little heavy it 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.670
 presented great high performance the screen 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.860
 and excellent camera one of the phone is a 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.959
 agile system but does not yet have 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.310
 many applications available on the 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.830
 internet explorer 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.380
 Okay, I do not need to say anything, no more
