00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
attack and among attackman there's

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.070 
attack and among attackman there's
plenty<00:00:21.240> different<00:00:21.480> playing<00:00:21.630> styles<00:00:21.720> which

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
plenty different playing styles which

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.040 
plenty different playing styles which
require<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.850> lend<00:00:23.850> themselves<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.480> plenty<00:00:25.019> of

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
require and lend themselves to plenty of

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.800 
require and lend themselves to plenty of
different<00:00:25.230> pockets<00:00:25.849> but<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.330> what<00:00:27.480> I'll<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.779> is

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
different pockets but so what I'll do is

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.750 
different pockets but so what I'll do is
just<00:00:28.410> give<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> couple<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.160> options<00:00:29.429> or

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
just give you a couple of options or

just give you a couple of options or
what<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.240> best<00:00:30.420> options<00:00:30.840> for

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
what I think of the best options for

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.630 
what I think of the best options for
each<00:00:31.140> position<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.189> try<00:00:32.369> stuff<00:00:32.579> out

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
each position and you can try stuff out

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.850 
each position and you can try stuff out
for<00:00:32.759> yourself<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.329> decide<00:00:33.710> you<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.829> what

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
for yourself and decide you know what

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.370 
for yourself and decide you know what
kind<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> player<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.430> are<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.050> what<00:00:37.050> kind<00:00:37.290> of

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
kind of player you are and what kind of

power cradle and leaning back and lead
to<00:01:25.259> him<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> little<00:01:25.799> bit<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.540> was<00:01:28.380> less<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.829> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
to him a little bit so a I was less of a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.770 
to him a little bit so a I was less of a
vertical<00:01:29.189> carrying<00:01:29.790> player<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.329> more<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.659> a

vertical carrying player and more of a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.539 
vertical carrying player and more of a
horizontal<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> midfielder<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.369> be

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
horizontal like a midfielder would be

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.130 
horizontal like a midfielder would be
when<00:01:33.329> i<00:01:33.390> played<00:01:33.600> attack<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.960> i'm<00:01:34.020> sure

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
when i played attack and i'm sure

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.170 
when i played attack and i'm sure

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
there's plenty of you that fall into

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
there's plenty of you that fall into
either<00:01:36.360> category<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.140> some<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.710> fall

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
either category and some you that I fall

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.330 
either category and some you that I fall
into<00:01:38.310> both<00:01:38.549> kind<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.150> mixed<00:01:39.390> around<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.340> first

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
into both kind of mixed around so first

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.249 
into both kind of mixed around so first
I'll<00:01:41.520> start<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:41.939> what<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.869> use<00:01:43.229> for

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
I'll start out with what I use for

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.219 
I'll start out with what I use for
attack<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.119> how<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.180> works<00:01:45.630> first<00:01:45.899> Burton

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
attack and how that works first Burton

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.420 
attack and how that works first Burton
playing<00:01:46.439> styles<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:47.130> I'll<00:01:47.220> talk<00:01:47.369> about

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
playing styles and then I'll talk about

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
a really quick release which is

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.360 
a really quick release which is
important<00:03:45.720> when<00:03:46.319> you<00:03:46.410> go<00:03:46.590> straight<00:03:47.069> from<00:03:47.220> the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
important when you go straight from the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.890 
important when you go straight from the
dodge<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:47.970> find<00:03:48.180> someone<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.480> open<00:03:48.600> you

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
dodge and you find someone to open you

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.300 
dodge and you find someone to open you
want<00:03:49.109> to<00:03:49.170> just<00:03:49.350> go<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.859> get<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.100> out<00:03:50.160> your

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
stick really quickly and make a feed so

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.009 
stick really quickly and make a feed so
those<00:03:54.120> are<00:03:54.150> some<00:03:54.329> of<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.569> advantages<00:03:54.630> of

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
those are some of the advantages of

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.699 
those are some of the advantages of
working<00:03:55.230> with<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.739> more<00:03:56.160> mid<00:03:56.370> high<00:03:56.579> pocket<00:03:57.090> I

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
working with a more mid high pocket I

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.620 
working with a more mid high pocket I
recommend<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.769> use<00:03:58.849> to<00:03:59.849> give<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.450> ball<00:04:00.599> a

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
recommend the use to give the ball a

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.410 
recommend the use to give the ball a
little<00:04:00.780> bit<00:04:00.900> hold<00:04:01.170> in<00:04:01.290> there<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.709> keep<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:02.849> you

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
little bit hold in there and keep it you

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.970 
little bit hold in there and keep it you
know<00:04:03.450> just<00:04:03.750> for<00:04:03.870> adjustment<00:04:04.349> sake<00:04:04.560> keep<00:04:04.829> it

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
know just for adjustment sake keep it

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.099 
know just for adjustment sake keep it
going<00:04:05.220> straight<00:04:05.489> out<00:04:05.639> consistent<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.510> the

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
going straight out consistent and the

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.470 
going straight out consistent and the
channel<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.530> really<00:04:07.739> important<00:04:08.160> as<00:04:08.310> well<00:04:09.209> to

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
channel is really important as well to

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.550 
channel is really important as well to
make<00:04:09.660> sure<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.930> ball<00:04:10.079> comes<00:04:10.290> out<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.530> same

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
make sure the ball comes out the same

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.979 
make sure the ball comes out the same
every<00:04:10.950> time<00:04:11.209> so<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.359> is<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.540> pocket<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:12.930> i

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
every time so this is the pocket that i

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.539 
every time so this is the pocket that i
use<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.500> that's<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:14.010> type<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.190> player<00:04:14.459> i

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
use and that's the type of player i

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.629 
use and that's the type of player i
suggest<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.269> for<00:04:15.540> it's<00:04:16.440> not<00:04:16.620> perfect<00:04:17.280> for

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
suggest it for it's not perfect for

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.310 
suggest it for it's not perfect for
cradling<00:04:18.329> up<00:04:18.450> and<00:04:18.599> down<00:04:18.720> but<00:04:18.840> i<00:04:18.930> can<00:04:19.079> get<00:04:19.200> it

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
cradling up and down but i can get it

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.640 
cradling up and down but i can get it
done<00:04:19.440> but<00:04:20.220> I'm<00:04:20.400> not<00:04:20.700> all<00:04:20.910> that<00:04:20.940> well<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:22.530> now

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
done but I'm not all that well so now

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.160 
done but I'm not all that well so now

more<00:05:37.060> like<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:37.390> would<00:05:37.540> have<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.870> if<00:05:38.410> it<00:05:38.710> had

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
more like you would have to if it had

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.150 
more like you would have to if it had
more<00:05:39.100> whip<00:05:39.400> and<00:05:39.730> it's<00:05:40.720> going<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.930> be<00:05:41.050> a<00:05:41.160> really

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
more whip and it's going to be a really

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.310 
more whip and it's going to be a really
accurate<00:05:42.370> and<00:05:42.820> really<00:05:43.030> consistent<00:05:43.600> so<00:05:44.080> this

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
accurate and really consistent so this

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.450 
accurate and really consistent so this
is<00:05:44.350> when<00:05:44.590> I<00:05:44.620> recommend<00:05:45.100> for<00:05:45.250> pretty<00:05:45.430> much

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
is when I recommend for pretty much

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.400 
is when I recommend for pretty much
every<00:05:45.880> attackman<00:05:46.360> because<00:05:46.570> most<00:05:46.780> do<00:05:47.020> create<00:05:47.380> a

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
every attackman because most do create a

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.150 
every attackman because most do create a
one-handed<00:05:47.950> a<00:05:48.700> really<00:05:49.660> nice<00:05:49.860> mid<00:05:50.860> little

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
one-handed a really nice mid little

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.790 
one-handed a really nice mid little
pocket<00:05:51.550> with<00:05:51.730> a<00:05:51.760> tight<00:05:52.120> channel<00:05:52.540> and<00:05:52.750> I've<00:05:53.650> got

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
pocket with a tight channel and I've got

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.290 
pocket with a tight channel and I've got
a<00:05:53.830> bunch<00:05:53.980> of<00:05:54.130> videos<00:05:54.430> out<00:05:54.610> their<00:05:54.790> foreheads

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
a bunch of videos out their foreheads

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.000 
a bunch of videos out their foreheads
with<00:05:55.450> midler<00:05:55.930> pockets<00:05:56.380> you<00:05:56.470> can<00:05:56.560> check<00:05:56.860> those

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
with midler pockets you can check those

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.440 
with midler pockets you can check those
out<00:05:57.660> but<00:05:58.660> overall<00:05:59.170> this<00:05:59.380> would<00:05:59.620> recommend<00:06:00.450> so

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450
