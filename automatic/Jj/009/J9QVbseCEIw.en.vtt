as to pick up the key off the air as you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.320 
as to pick up the key off the air as you
release<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.340> key<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.730> can<00:02:25.760> change<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
release the key and I can change the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.910 
release the key and I can change the
amount<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:27.080> by<00:02:27.170> dialing<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.680> he<00:02:27.770> not

we've also done a lot of work on the
club<00:02:32.990> sounds<00:02:34.750> we<00:02:35.750> can<00:02:35.810> even<00:02:36.050> do<00:02:36.290> here<00:02:36.530> with<00:02:36.680> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
club sounds we can even do here with the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.470 
club sounds we can even do here with the
wire<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.340> have<00:02:37.550> that<00:02:37.670> assigned<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.210> just<00:02:38.390> an

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
wire is have that assigned to just an

00:02:38.480 --> 00:03:05.990 
wire is have that assigned to just an
ordinary<00:02:38.720> sustain<00:02:39.320> pedal

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.660 

they're<00:03:07.260> also<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.380> lot<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.560> work<00:03:08.710> in<00:03:08.920> merely<00:03:09.100> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
they're also a lot of work in merely the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.190 
they're also a lot of work in merely the
orchestral<00:03:10.330> tones<00:03:12.750> which<00:03:13.750> we<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.050> actually

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
orchestral tones which we can actually

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.590 
orchestral tones which we can actually
do<00:03:14.560> velocity<00:03:15.160> switching<00:03:15.580> between<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.390> four

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
do velocity switching between the four

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.860 
do velocity switching between the four
different<00:03:16.990> zones<00:03:17.550> or<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.790> six<00:03:19.000> loads<00:03:19.240> sorry

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
different zones or the six loads sorry

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
from the XW since has been introduced

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.190 
from the XW since has been introduced
into<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.460> px<00:03:24.760> 5<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.540> between<00:03:25.840> all<00:03:26.080> those

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
into the px 5 and between all those

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.890 
into the px 5 and between all those
layers<00:03:26.650> we<00:03:26.770> can<00:03:26.800> do<00:03:27.040> velocity<00:03:27.520> switching<00:03:27.940> so

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
layers we can do velocity switching so

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.470 
layers we can do velocity switching so
as<00:03:29.050> I<00:03:29.200> increase<00:03:30.040> how<00:03:30.820> hard<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.180> play<00:03:31.240> the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
as I increase how hard I play the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.780 
as I increase how hard I play the
keyboard<00:03:31.950> we<00:03:32.950> get<00:03:33.100> different<00:03:33.430> layers<00:03:33.640> of

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
keyboard we get different layers of

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:54.270 
keyboard we get different layers of
sounds<00:03:34.270> coming<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.840> out<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:53.980> guess<00:03:54.130> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
sounds coming in and out so I guess the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:03.580 
sounds coming in and out so I guess the
theme<00:03:54.490> here<00:03:54.760> is<00:03:54.880> lots<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.209> real-time<00:03:55.660> control

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
with the hex layer sound engine lots of

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.890 
with the hex layer sound engine lots of

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
sounds of the sins that have been
