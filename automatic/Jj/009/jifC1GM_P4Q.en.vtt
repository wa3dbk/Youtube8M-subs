like these ones stuff like that but the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.170 
like these ones stuff like that but the
real<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.129> probably<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.059> be

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
real one is probably just going to be

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.600 
real one is probably just going to be
this<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.660> because<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:41.579> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
this one because that's like there was a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.369 
this one because that's like there was a
video<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:41.969> youtube<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.989> being<00:00:43.200> on

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
video on youtube of this one being on

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.299 
video on youtube of this one being on
youtube<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> first<00:00:46.469> thing<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> screen<00:00:47.160> is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
youtube and so first thing the screen is

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.330 
youtube and so first thing the screen is
going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.670> bigger<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.660> black<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.340> well

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
going to be bigger is the black one well

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.310 
going to be bigger is the black one well
I<00:00:50.370> thought<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.640> black<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.930> part

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
I thought the black is like this part

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.529 
I thought the black is like this part
around<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.340> black<00:00:53.579> tues<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.149> makes<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.420> look

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
around is black tues that makes it look

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.900 
around is black tues that makes it look
really<00:00:54.660> cool<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:56.100> buttons<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.670> black

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
really cool and the buttons are black

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.270 
really cool and the buttons are black
that's<00:00:57.180> pretty<00:00:57.420> cool<00:00:57.629> okay<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.739> let's<00:00:59.010> go<00:00:59.100> back

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that's pretty cool okay so let's go back

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.979 
that's pretty cool okay so let's go back
you<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.550> bigger<00:01:00.289> okay<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:02.840> camera<00:01:03.840> has

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you it's bigger okay so the camera has

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.960 
you it's bigger okay so the camera has
been<00:01:04.049> moved<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> center<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.880> not

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
been moved to the center so this is not

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.020 
been moved to the center so this is not
official<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:08.030> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
official but like this is like the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120 
official but like this is like the
closest<00:01:09.659> we're<00:01:09.869> getting<00:01:10.380> basically

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
closest we're getting basically

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.399 
closest we're getting basically
everyone's<00:01:11.909> talking<00:01:12.330> about<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.260> is

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
everyone's talking about this so this is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.260 
everyone's talking about this so this is
probably<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.400> there<00:01:15.060> is

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
probably going to be it and there is

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.870 
probably going to be it and there is
easy<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> bottom<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:17.310> change<00:01:17.670> the

just like a 19 pin one and then here

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.649 
just like a 19 pin one and then here
it's<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> speaker<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.880> bigger<00:01:39.180> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.740 
it's like the speaker is bigger and
stuff<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.460> poor<00:01:41.909> has<00:01:42.119> been<00:01:42.360> switched

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
stuff and now the poor has been switched

stuff and now the poor has been switched
to<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> right<00:01:43.350> side<00:01:45.680> yeah<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:47.549> back<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to the right side yeah it's back to the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.960 
to the right side yeah it's back to the
right<00:01:48.299> side<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.689> think<00:01:49.399> but<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> don't<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.909> that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
right side I think but I don't like that

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
right side I think but I don't like that
for<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> top<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:53.689> it's<00:01:54.689> like

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
for I like it at the top and it's like

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.910 
for I like it at the top and it's like
the<00:01:55.770> phone<00:01:56.040> looks<00:01:56.340> good<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.530> looks

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the phone looks good so it just looks

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.350

good<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.219> with<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.610> bigger<00:01:59.790> screen<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
good because with the bigger screen and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.950 
good because with the bigger screen and
everything<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.460> but<00:02:02.460> i'm<00:02:03.299> just<00:02:03.360> still

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
everything and but i'm just still

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.200 
everything and but i'm just still
wondering<00:02:04.469> about<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.829> back<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.490> because

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
wondering about the back here because

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.699 
wondering about the back here because
the<00:02:06.690> back<00:02:06.900> is<00:02:07.110> all<00:02:07.380> right<00:02:09.140> like<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.410> black

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
the back is all right like on the black

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.740 
the back is all right like on the black
one<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.069> looks<00:02:11.280> pretty<00:02:11.550> good<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.630> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
one that looks pretty good but on the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.330 
one that looks pretty good but on the
white<00:02:12.959> one<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> don't<00:02:13.530> think<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.800> does<00:02:14.010> that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
white one I don't think it does that

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.360 
white one I don't think it does that
much<00:02:15.020> because<00:02:16.020> it's<00:02:16.319> like<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> nice<00:02:16.740> white<00:02:17.100> and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
much because it's like a nice white and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.370 
much because it's like a nice white and
then<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.580> get<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.030> silver<00:02:18.600> finish

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
then you get like this silver finish

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.610 
then you get like this silver finish
here<00:02:20.240> so<00:02:21.240> maybe<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:21.959> going<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.350> looking

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
here so maybe it's going to be looking

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.010 
here so maybe it's going to be looking
nice<00:02:22.860> maybe<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.510> believe<00:02:24.569> it's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
nice maybe it's not and I believe it's

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.680 
nice maybe it's not and I believe it's
going<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.230> be<00:02:25.380> an<00:02:25.500> a6<00:02:26.069> processor<00:02:26.600> camera<00:02:27.600> is

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
going to be an a6 processor camera is

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.470 
going to be an a6 processor camera is
going<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:29.069> same<00:02:29.400> problem<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:30.450> they
