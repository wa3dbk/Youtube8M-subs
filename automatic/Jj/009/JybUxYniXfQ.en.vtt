00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.320
 I will teach how to put a weather widget 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.720
 in toulon screen this is very easy 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.150
 only in first of all we 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.070
 we must go to Cydia and wait 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.080
 finish loading once you have 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.349
 finished loading cydia let's search 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.720
 as it appears here forecast and if not 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.710
 I also leave the name of the trick in 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.930
 the description of the video and how we see 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.579
 for this I do not know if it will be necessary 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.780
 add no repo since it comes that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.219
 comes with a cost of 99 cents sorry 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.770
 in the repo 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.050
 Mayan and if they want to buy it and if 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.559
 they want to try come 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.070
 in the description of the video a link to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.649
 they add the repo and that's where they come from 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.739
 completely free but I will 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.010
 I recommend that you buy it is a tweet 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.740
 pretty good 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.290
 and if you do not know how to add a repone there 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.670
 same I leave you a video of how to add 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.890
 a good repo after it is installed 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.770
 we will create a spring king and we will 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.570
 create a settings menu within jose 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.330
 is this is this one here that says 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.530
 forecast they open it and it's a very menu 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.560
 simple only 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.790
 good in the options to enable 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.970
 disable if we want standard or 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.570
 manual and every time we want it to be 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.480
 update our widget so that we 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.960
 bring 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.570
 this weather updates 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.680
 good 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.840
 and what 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.020
 we find it installed as we have 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.570
 configured that we're going to go here 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.180
 let's lower the notification center and 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.790
 here where our weather appears 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.840
 We are gonna give 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:05.290
 and here below in the and we will adapt and 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.760
 so they have here they already have the city 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.369
 in which you live so that 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.040
 have the exact municipality where you 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.710
 live they put you in skills to that that 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.300
 local time 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.970
 and they will appear in a municipality 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.520
 for the seremi we are trapped in zaragoza and 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.280
 because this has been all for today here is 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.500
 the widget see it looks beautiful if they have 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.280
 some doubt you already know in the comments 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.880
 and I recommend we do not see each other until the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.880
 next
