of the week they take a look at the job
and<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:50.929> think<00:00:51.140> by<00:00:51.260> turning<00:00:51.589> grades<00:00:51.829> in<00:00:52.039> every

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
and I think by turning grades in every

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.889 
and I think by turning grades in every
week<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:52.699> posting<00:00:53.149> them<00:00:53.269> in<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.480> house<00:00:53.660> the

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
week and posting them in the house the

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.110 
week and posting them in the house the
kids<00:00:54.079> can<00:00:54.350> see<00:00:54.620> their<00:00:54.920> upward<00:00:55.100> progress<00:00:55.519> and

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
kids can see their upward progress and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.599 
kids can see their upward progress and
then<00:00:56.210> that's<00:00:56.390> even<00:00:56.719> more<00:00:57.109> incentive<00:00:57.499> for<00:00:58.489> them

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
then that's even more incentive for them

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.759 
then that's even more incentive for them
to<00:00:58.879> continue<00:00:59.179> to<00:00:59.329> do<00:00:59.539> well<00:00:59.749> the<00:01:00.320> school<00:01:00.589> in<00:01:00.710> the
