00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.409
 you may like to have a look 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.509
 Alone outstanding in the combination 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.250
 with these carbohydrates of course 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.290
 It could be great before training 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.299
 or just after the training after the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.890
 Of course, they drink great as well 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.090
 your power store stop again 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.790

 this strength in addition to you 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.420
 specifies exactly not days of training 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.479
 it is recommended that the maximum itself 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.970
 best to take corn early in the morning 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.890
 Half an hour before breakfast 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.040
 Training days as crisis already said 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.170
 has before or after training particularly 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.869
 here it is natural if you 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.060
 about 20 minutes before your protein 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.950
 shake before yours no matter whether 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.250
 now before or after training it 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.049
 squeezes the nutrients through the creative 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.920
 by the glutamine in combination with 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.970
 The carbohydrates downright in euros 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.530
 Muscle cells so it's a very good one 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.420
 nutrient for evaluation 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.410
 with this product we are given here 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.780
 will be here shortly 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.810
 Nutritional information per serving 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.760
 You have one at a portion 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.940
 size now has to be short for 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.569
 you can do that from 40 grams exactly 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:32.280
 you have 135 calories 3.9 grams of protein 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.550
 27 grams of carbs 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.200
 you have crea neck of 3,000 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.300
 milligram so three grams 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.720
 you have added again as well 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.690
 granted sl term of 1,600 mini came 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.260
 So 16 came and you have again l 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.709
 arginine added at 500 milligrams 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.230
 so crisis i would say is on everyone 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.140
 case and product what you try 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.150
 which i definitely worth and can 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.860
 which is also in a maximalkraft 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.920
 or mass building phase 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.290
 in addition to your weight gainer 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.209
 your protein can be very interesting 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.550
 This product can be for one 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.530
 reinforced point before training 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.260
 during training after training 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.630
 and also for a very good regeneration 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.640
 Worry and a case 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.220
 the only alternative to me now 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.230
 would still start as a comparison 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.410
 said it the bms carey meeting i believe 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.090
 exactly as such are quite rare 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.280
 and Karl with the clinic needs 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.170
 less creative with the plaintive neck 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.310
 as mono as wire are three grams 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.140
 actually a good value 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.480
 perfect selection exactly because just stop 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.299
 even better to be recycled 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.010
 bh stable double buffered that is it 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.560
 is not like the normal creative 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.359
 Monometer is always a piece of it 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.970
 that is if you three grams 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.980
 Creative Flat then stepped down 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.829
 always hold this waste matter 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.109
 creatinine then 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.690
 this is not the case with the crea neck 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.519
 is completely recycled is on each 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.010
 a very strong innovation, too 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.510
 on the supplement market as I said 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.430
 I can see my channel 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.920
 even the maxime and rehabilitation clinic encapsulate 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.230
 presented now again in powder form 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.209
 in combination with glutamine and 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.579
 complex carbohydrates 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.239
 we will do that again both at 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.910
 lime giant as well as mine 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.370

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.250
