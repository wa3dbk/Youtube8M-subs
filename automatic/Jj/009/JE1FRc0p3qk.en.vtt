00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
to only connect with 4G 4G and 3G 4G 3G

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
to only connect with 4G 4G and 3G 4G 3G
or<00:00:59.370> 2g<00:00:59.460> only<00:01:00.420> 3G<00:01:00.899> etc<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.699> trying<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
or 2g only 3G etc so if you trying to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.969 
or 2g only 3G etc so if you trying to
conserve<00:01:03.329> power<00:01:03.409> what<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.589> should<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.920> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
conserve power what you should do is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.060 
conserve power what you should do is
actually<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.519> changing<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.830> 3G<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
actually be changing it down to 3G and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.880 
actually be changing it down to 3G and
2g<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.720> your<00:01:10.049> phone<00:01:10.290> doesn't<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.680> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
2g so that your phone doesn't have to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.560 
2g so that your phone doesn't have to
work<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.250> hard<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.820> get<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.180> LTE

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
work so hard to get you that LTE

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.679 
work so hard to get you that LTE
connection<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.729> if<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> last<00:01:15.299> good

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
connection and if you have a last good

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.700 
connection and if you have a last good
fast<00:01:15.960> vironment<00:01:16.460> kick<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.030> 4G<00:01:18.900> 3G<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.680> 2g

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
fast vironment kick it to 4G 3G and 2g

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.950 
fast vironment kick it to 4G 3G and 2g
and<00:01:20.549> that's<00:01:20.700> kind<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.909> defined<00:01:21.270> decide<00:01:21.630> what's

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
and that's kind of defined decide what's

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.390 
and that's kind of defined decide what's
the<00:01:22.170> base<00:01:22.290> signal<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.369> it

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the base signal that you can get for it

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700 
the base signal that you can get for it
this<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.090> where<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.020> best<00:01:25.140> results

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
this is where you get the best results

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.999 
this is where you get the best results
so<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.369> one<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> first<00:01:26.909> thing<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.360> do

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
so that's one of the first thing I do

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.679 
so that's one of the first thing I do
also<00:01:29.009> quite<00:01:29.189> important<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.850> under<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> top

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
also quite important is under the top

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.149 
also quite important is under the top
you've<00:01:30.930> got<00:01:30.960> your<00:01:31.170> mobile<00:01:31.350> network<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.950> your

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
you've got your mobile network and your

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.999 
you've got your mobile network and your
data<00:01:32.400> services<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.439> actually<00:01:34.799> switch

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
data services so you can actually switch

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.980 
data services so you can actually switch
data<00:01:35.310> off<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.090> wanna<00:01:36.509> make<00:01:36.570> calls

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
data off if you just wanna make calls

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.350 
data off if you just wanna make calls
then<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.979> data<00:01:38.159> circle<00:01:38.640> obviously<00:01:38.970> gives<00:01:39.180> you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
then the data circle obviously gives you

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.859 
then the data circle obviously gives you
the<00:01:39.900> ability<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.890> receive<00:01:41.340> data<00:01:41.939> then

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the ability to receive data then

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.770 
the ability to receive data then
importantly<00:01:43.619> data<00:01:44.130> services<00:01:44.729> whilst<00:01:45.030> roaming

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
importantly data services whilst roaming

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.990 
importantly data services whilst roaming
this<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.500> set<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.920> prompt<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.520> other<00:01:47.700> words<00:01:47.880> if

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
this is set to prompt in other words if

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.370 
this is set to prompt in other words if
you're<00:01:48.119> traveling<00:01:48.509> overseas<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.170> you're

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
going to be using those expensive data

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.660 
going to be using those expensive data
packages<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.840> might<00:01:52.079> want<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.439> M<00:01:52.710> not<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.549> able
