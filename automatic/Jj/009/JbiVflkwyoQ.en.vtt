become very important to understand if

plates correctly the two things that we
need<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.289> know<00:00:28.530> before<00:00:28.860> we<00:00:29.070> proceed<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.760> the

need to know before we proceed with the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880 
need to know before we proceed with the
rest<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> approaches<00:00:30.690> are<00:00:30.869> flying<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.650> hold

holding<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> maneuver<00:00:39.720> designed<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.440> delay

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.170 
safe area until an airspace gap can be
formed<00:00:46.470> so<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.649> airplane<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.550> now<00:00:47.760> proceed

it<00:01:11.909> into<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> holding<00:01:12.659> area<00:01:12.840> until<00:01:13.680> there's

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it into a holding area until there's

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.680 
it into a holding area until there's
enough<00:01:14.159> space<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.700> bring<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.030> back<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.450> try

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
enough space to bring it back and try

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.710 
enough space to bring it back and try
the<00:01:15.750> landing<00:01:16.170> again<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.310> IFR<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.150> aviation

the landing again so in IFR and aviation
knowing<00:01:19.500> holding<00:01:19.890> patterns<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.580> very

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
knowing holding patterns is very

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.539 
knowing holding patterns is very
important<00:01:21.360> unlike<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> standard<00:01:22.500> VFR<00:01:23.369> traffic

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
important unlike a standard VFR traffic

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
that the holding pattern is to be flown

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.030 
that the holding pattern is to be flown
to<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.060> left<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.930> holding<00:01:40.290> pattern<00:01:40.500> is

to the left the holding pattern is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
to the left the holding pattern is

now<00:01:43.439> what<00:01:43.650> is<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.799> standard<00:01:44.250> holding<00:01:44.670> pattern

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
now what is the standard holding pattern

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.300 
now what is the standard holding pattern
as<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.810> mentioned<00:01:46.110> before<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.439> standard<00:01:46.950> holding

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
as I mentioned before a standard holding

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.310 
as I mentioned before a standard holding
pattern<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.850> always<00:01:48.180> flown<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> right<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
pattern is always flown to the right the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.130 
pattern is always flown to the right the
holding<00:01:49.710> pattern<00:01:49.920> always<00:01:50.579> has<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> fix<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.450> face

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
holding pattern always has a fix a face

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.909 
rate turn is a turn that has a rate of
turn<00:05:31.800> of<00:05:32.089> 1.5<00:05:33.089> degrees<00:05:33.300> a<00:05:33.539> second<00:05:34.110> meaning

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
turn of 1.5 degrees a second meaning

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.730 
turn of 1.5 degrees a second meaning
that<00:05:35.310> a<00:05:35.430> full<00:05:35.669> 360<00:05:36.569> degrees<00:05:36.870> circle<00:05:37.409> is

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
that a full 360 degrees circle is

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.920 
that a full 360 degrees circle is
completed<00:05:38.400> in<00:05:38.520> 4<00:05:38.849> minutes<00:05:39.089> instead<00:05:39.509> of<00:05:39.719> two

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
completed in 4 minutes instead of two

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.579 
completed in 4 minutes instead of two
and<00:05:40.169> a<00:05:40.699> 180<00:05:41.699> degree<00:05:42.060> turn<00:05:42.089> is<00:05:42.659> completed<00:05:43.440> in

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:43.589 
and a 180 degree turn is completed in

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.469 
and a 180 degree turn is completed in
two<00:05:44.039> minutes<00:05:44.279> instead<00:05:44.789> of<00:05:44.940> one

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
two minutes instead of one

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.320 
two minutes instead of one
so<00:05:46.080> for<00:05:46.289> airliners<00:05:46.919> we're<00:05:47.520> going<00:05:47.699> to<00:05:47.759> use<00:05:47.940> half

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
so for airliners we're going to use half

00:05:48.330 --> 00:06:09.490 
so for airliners we're going to use half
standard<00:05:48.930> rate<00:05:49.139> turns<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:49.860> double<00:05:50.279> r<00:05:50.430> times

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.560
