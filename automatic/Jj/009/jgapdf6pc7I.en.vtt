00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
game that wasn't too popular but I

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.950 
game that wasn't too popular but I
actually<00:02:46.320> enjoy<00:02:46.770> it's<00:02:47.040> called<00:02:47.310> bladestorm<00:02:47.960> it

actually enjoy it's called bladestorm it

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.890 
actually enjoy it's called bladestorm it
is<00:02:49.140> by<00:02:49.350> co<00:02:49.620> e<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.820> hack<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.240> slash<00:02:51.300> and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
is by co e so it is a hack and slash and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.650 
is by co e so it is a hack and slash and
it<00:02:51.990> is<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.220> strategy<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.880> if<00:02:54.120> you're<00:02:54.300> not<00:02:54.390> into
