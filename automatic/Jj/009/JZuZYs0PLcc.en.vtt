00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:16.150 

I<00:00:11.539> started<00:00:13.309> right<00:00:14.309> before<00:00:14.339> the<00:00:14.849> merger<00:00:15.210> in

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
I started right before the merger in

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.730 
I started right before the merger in
1968<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.520> we've<00:00:18.480> had<00:00:18.720> various<00:00:19.200> operating

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
1968 and we've had various operating

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.130 
1968 and we've had various operating
session<00:00:20.189> schemes<00:00:20.640> since<00:00:21.239> then<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.689> think<00:00:21.869> we

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
session schemes since then I think we

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.549 
session schemes since then I think we
had<00:00:22.290> one<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.619> 68<00:00:23.099> and<00:00:23.340> then<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.550> moved<00:00:23.759> up<00:00:23.910> to

00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:24.559 
had one in 68 and then we moved up to

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:28.190 
had one in 68 and then we moved up to
1974<00:00:25.559> and<00:00:26.520> then<00:00:26.669> we<00:00:26.759> were<00:00:26.880> about<00:00:27.059> 1980<00:00:27.750> right

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
1974 and then we were about 1980 right

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.609 
1974 and then we were about 1980 right
now<00:00:28.410> we're<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.739> 86<00:00:29.700> or<00:00:29.790> 87<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.619> eventually

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
now we're in 86 or 87 and eventually

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.720 
now we're in 86 or 87 and eventually
we're<00:00:31.829> going<00:00:31.919> to<00:00:31.980> go<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.660> 1994<00:00:33.660> 1995<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:35.579> it's

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
we're going to go to 1994 1995 so it's

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.410 
we're going to go to 1994 1995 so it's
that<00:00:36.059> way

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
that way

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.639 
that way
that's<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> Burlington<00:00:37.620> Northern

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
that's when the Burlington Northern

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.860 
that's when the Burlington Northern
ceased<00:00:38.190> existence<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.120> then<00:00:39.570> we'll<00:00:39.690> start

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
ceased existence so then we'll start

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.959 
ceased existence so then we'll start
over<00:00:40.079> again<00:00:40.190> yeah<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.339> have<00:00:41.489> operating

typical operating session we run 4550
trains<00:01:00.569> I<00:01:00.890> built<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.010> lot<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.339> engines<00:01:02.699> paint<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
trains I built a lot of engines paint a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.200 
trains I built a lot of engines paint a
lot<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.479> stuff<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.440> go<00:01:04.589> around<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> layout

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
lot of stuff as you go around the layout

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.820 
lot of stuff as you go around the layout
probably<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.450> third<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> cars<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:07.800> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
probably a third of the cars on here I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.040 
probably a third of the cars on here I
painted<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.030> most<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.480> the<00:01:09.540> engines<00:01:09.930> I

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
painted the most of the engines I

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.870 
painted the most of the engines I
painted<00:01:10.410> over<00:01:10.620> the<00:01:11.100> years

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.020 

the<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.330> control<00:01:16.690> system<00:01:17.080> we<00:01:17.230> have<00:01:17.470> is

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the the control system we have is

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.930 
the the control system we have is
something<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:21.100> time<00:01:21.340> in<00:01:21.550> Model

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
something that one time in Model

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.130 
something that one time in Model
Railroader<00:01:22.300> they<00:01:22.900> had<00:01:23.200> an<00:01:23.410> article<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:25.140> we

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
Railroader they had an article and we

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.550 
Railroader they had an article and we
built<00:01:26.410> four<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.830> those<00:01:26.980> about<00:01:28.290> 20<00:01:29.290> years<00:01:29.410> ago

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
built four of those about 20 years ago

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.190 
built four of those about 20 years ago
already<00:01:30.040> and<00:01:30.280> I<00:01:31.120> built<00:01:31.390> four<00:01:31.600> more<00:01:31.840> here<00:01:32.110> in

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
already and I built four more here in

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.500 
already and I built four more here in
the<00:01:32.230> last<00:01:32.470> couple<00:01:32.710> years<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.970> they<00:01:34.330> work

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
the last couple years so and they work

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.680 
the last couple years so and they work
nice<00:01:35.490> geographic<00:01:36.490> part<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.150> layout<00:01:37.360> right

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
nice geographic part of the layout right

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.080 
nice geographic part of the layout right
now<00:01:37.870> is<00:01:38.110> really<00:01:38.290> from<00:01:38.740> Lincoln<00:01:39.160> to<00:01:39.310> to

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
now is really from Lincoln to to

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.150 
now is really from Lincoln to to
Billings<00:01:40.660> with<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.140> old<00:01:41.260> CB<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:41.740> cue<00:01:41.950> and

then<00:01:42.760> from<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.060> Billings<00:01:43.420> on<00:01:43.690> down<00:01:43.990> to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
then from the Billings on down to

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.800 
then from the Billings on down to
Seattle<00:01:44.920> was<00:01:45.220> old<00:01:45.580> Northern<00:01:46.030> Pacific<00:01:46.300> and

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
Seattle was old Northern Pacific and

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.060 
Seattle was old Northern Pacific and
Great<00:01:46.870> Northern<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:49.030> we<00:01:49.270> were<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.600> our

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
Great Northern and when we were in our

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.160 
Great Northern and when we were in our
1968<00:01:51.070> mode<00:01:51.340> that's<00:01:51.760> how<00:01:52.000> we<00:01:52.060> operated<00:01:52.540> those

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
1968 mode that's how we operated those

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.770 
1968 mode that's how we operated those
units<00:01:53.890> would<00:01:54.040> with<00:01:54.550> interchange<00:01:55.030> up<00:01:55.330> there

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
units would with interchange up there

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.380 
units would with interchange up there
and<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.410> Billings<00:01:56.770> yard<00:01:57.070> up<00:01:57.310> here<00:01:57.550> and<00:01:58.090> go

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
and the Billings yard up here and go

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.570 
and the Billings yard up here and go
back<00:01:58.500> toward<00:01:59.500> Lincoln<00:01:59.800> where<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.460> other

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
back toward Lincoln where the other

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.940 
back toward Lincoln where the other
stuff<00:02:00.820> would<00:02:00.910> run<00:02:01.090> back<00:02:01.300> and<00:02:01.360> forth<00:02:01.720> between

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
stuff would run back and forth between

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.440 
stuff would run back and forth between
one<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.040> my<00:02:03.190> hidden<00:02:03.550> yard<00:02:03.850> switch<00:02:04.240> with

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
that was set the height of it because

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.990 
that was set the height of it because

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
to keep over there I didn't get too low

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.160 
to keep over there I didn't get too low
on<00:02:56.290> these<00:02:56.470> because<00:02:57.480> it's<00:02:58.480> hard<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.780> see<00:02:58.900> them
