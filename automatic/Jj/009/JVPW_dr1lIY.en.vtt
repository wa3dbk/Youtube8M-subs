 my mother disconnected me on the internet ok 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.290
 let's continue with forming here I would send 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.180
 the map page where we find a 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.880
 number of maps uploaded by users 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.010
 here we have first found a 3 worth the 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.809
 last film are multiple ivory not good 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.820
 let's find many types of map and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.500
 here they bring you a label where it says 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.010
 what it is for example bar and fidel 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.420
 of good to kill so that pepe puzzle 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.670
 that is a southern parkour 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.050
 survival this map I will make a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.490
 review that probably when you 're 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.630
 sending followed is already uploaded so 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.910
 at this moment they will be 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.580
 a 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.060
 annotation where you click the click 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.060
 aviv and send them to the super button video 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.700
 this seed of this map that the truth 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.649
 is that it is very good, there is a 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.100
 simulator as you can see here there is a 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.750
 amount of incredible things 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.450
 so the only thing we have to do 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.119
 to download it is to click on the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.670
 map we want and the title we hope 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.880
 to load 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.520
 and now we simply go down here 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.680
 an image appears we are going to load 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.689
 an initial image of what the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.220
 map there for example this one yes and then 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.710
 they simply lower this visit to one side 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.520
 you can pretending +3 download is 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.220
 download so they give and wait for the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.600
 would send to dropbox or in some cases to 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.890
 mediafire but usually always 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.030
 will go bots 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.410
 for example I want to say if when 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.090
 it went up three hours ago so 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.580
 just lanata a you will download 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.230
 you download that the truth that is very 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.170
 fast because your maps can not be 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.720
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.530
 very well once it has been downloaded then 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.800

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.050
 the folder and how to install this map 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.110
 Well now it must be showing up 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.270

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.550
