00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940 

I<00:00:03.950> guess<00:00:04.950> just<00:00:05.310> strung<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> nike<00:00:06.330> dunk<00:00:06.950> I've

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
I guess just strung a nike dunk I've

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.589 
I guess just strung a nike dunk I've
been<00:00:08.189> calm<00:00:08.429> playing<00:00:08.760> with<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.210> I've<00:00:09.450> been

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
been calm playing with it I've been

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.930 
been calm playing with it I've been
strung<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.929> really<00:00:10.410> skinny<00:00:11.010> head<00:00:11.250> like<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.670> in

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
strung a really skinny head like this in

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.180 
strung a really skinny head like this in
a<00:00:12.000> while<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.599> had<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.410> lot<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.590> trouble<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.009> like

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
a while I had a lot of trouble with like

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.039 
a while I had a lot of trouble with like
the<00:00:14.370> revo<00:00:14.730> pro<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.299> everything<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:15.690> with

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
the revo pro and everything just with

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.230 
the revo pro and everything just with
the<00:00:16.170> ball<00:00:16.379> getting<00:00:16.650> stuck<00:00:17.070> right<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the ball getting stuck right in the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.380 
the ball getting stuck right in the
throat<00:00:19.699> um<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:22.490> think<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.820> main<00:00:24.060> thing<00:00:24.090> that

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
throat um I think the main thing that

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.750 
throat um I think the main thing that
you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.019> avoid<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.769> sticking<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.580> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
you can do to avoid that sticking is to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.439 
you can do to avoid that sticking is to
string<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.510> sidewalls<00:00:28.109> kind<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.300> towards<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
string the sidewalls kind of towards the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.540 
string the sidewalls kind of towards the
outside<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:31.230> by<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.529> through<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.890> side

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
outside just by going through the side

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.549 
outside just by going through the side
wall<00:00:32.759> first<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.770> then<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.800> mesh<00:00:35.130> or<00:00:36.170> in<00:00:37.170> this

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
wall first and then the mesh or in this

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.920 
wall first and then the mesh or in this
case<00:00:37.620> go<00:00:38.370> through<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> mesh<00:00:38.940> put<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
case go through the mesh put it on the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.950 
case go through the mesh put it on the
rail<00:00:40.230> go<00:00:40.800> through<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> side<00:00:41.370> wall<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.809> go

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
rail go through the side wall so just go

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.420 
rail go through the side wall so just go
from<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> outside<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.160> when<00:00:44.340> you're

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
from the outside going in when you're

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.270 
from the outside going in when you're
stringing<00:00:44.870> with<00:00:45.870> skinny<00:00:46.289> heads<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.980> that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
stringing with skinny heads and that

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.690 
stringing with skinny heads and that
just<00:00:47.489> keeps<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> ball<00:00:48.059> from<00:00:49.250> sticking<00:00:50.250> like

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
just keeps the ball from sticking like

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.330 
just keeps the ball from sticking like
that<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.350> guess<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> can't<00:00:52.680> really<00:00:52.739> avoid<00:00:52.980> it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
that I guess you can't really avoid it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.010 
that I guess you can't really avoid it
all<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> time<00:00:54.320> but<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.829> game<00:00:56.840> nobody<00:00:57.840> would

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
all the time but in a game nobody would

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.279 
all the time but in a game nobody would
notice<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.920> because<00:00:59.809> comes<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:00.989> really

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
notice just because comes out really

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.539 
notice just because comes out really
smoothly<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.489> has<00:01:02.699> very<00:01:03.000> low<00:01:03.300> whip<00:01:04.549> but

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
smoothly this one has very low whip but

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.760 
smoothly this one has very low whip but
just<00:01:05.880> enough<00:01:06.180> hole<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.750> get<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> good<00:01:07.110> crankshaw

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
just enough hole to get a good crankshaw

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.539 
just enough hole to get a good crankshaw
off<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.990> it's<00:01:12.990> pretty<00:01:13.290> cool<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:14.280> thought<00:01:14.430> I'd

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
off so it's pretty cool just thought I'd

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.969 
off so it's pretty cool just thought I'd
string<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.270> some<00:01:15.600> wax<00:01:16.290> mesh<00:01:16.680> that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
string it up this is some wax mesh that

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.390 
string it up this is some wax mesh that
somebody<00:01:17.640> sent<00:01:17.939> me<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.420> review<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.280> forget<00:01:20.280> if

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
somebody sent me to review I forget if

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.820
