00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
this is three inch schedule 20 tube here

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.570 
this is three inch schedule 20 tube here
for<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.200> ball<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.560> go<00:02:29.710> through<00:02:30.010> when<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.370> drop

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
started this piece of wood see as you

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.760 
started this piece of wood see as you
can<00:03:07.480> see<00:03:07.630> this<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.930> late<00:03:08.110> but<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.470> piece<00:03:08.739> of

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
can see this is late but this piece of

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.009 
can see this is late but this piece of

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
wood up here under the last step of the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.229 
wood up here under the last step of the
ladder<00:03:14.860> because<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.580> didn't<00:03:15.760> want<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:15.970> drill

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
ladder because I didn't want to drill

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.990 
ladder because I didn't want to drill
into<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.980> into<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.070> steps<00:03:18.400> because<00:03:18.880> these

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
into the into the steps because these

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.370 
into the into the steps because these
are<00:03:19.180> really<00:03:19.510> cheap<00:03:19.540> steps

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
are really cheap steps

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.890 
are really cheap steps
I<00:03:20.500> mean<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.910> drill<00:03:22.180> into<00:03:22.390> them<00:03:22.660> they'll

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
I mean you drill into them they'll

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.020 
I mean you drill into them they'll
probably<00:03:23.110> break<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:23.920> actually<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:24.610> just<00:03:24.700> got<00:03:25.000> a

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
probably break so actually I just got a

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.740 
probably break so actually I just got a
mast<00:03:25.420> in<00:03:25.720> between<00:03:26.140> with<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.030> long<00:03:28.030> bolt<00:03:28.480> and

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
hair tie holding the balls in so they

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.880 
hair tie holding the balls in so they
don't<00:03:46.390> fall<00:03:46.570> out<00:03:46.600> whenever<00:03:47.080> it<00:03:47.230> vibrates<00:03:47.680> this
