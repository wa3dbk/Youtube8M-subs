00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
second split as far as improvements of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.940 
second split as far as improvements of
changes<00:01:29.250> well<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.240> think<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:31.049> last<00:01:31.470> split<00:01:31.740> we

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
changes well I think for last split we

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
changes well I think for last split we
played<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.400> reactionary<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.240> didn't<00:01:33.420> try

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
played really reactionary we didn't try

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.740 
played really reactionary we didn't try
to<00:01:33.630> force<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.960> lot<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.200> plays<00:01:34.409> which<00:01:35.329> it's<00:01:36.329> okay

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
to force a lot of plays which it's okay

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.899 
to force a lot of plays which it's okay
but<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.650> think<00:01:37.920> playing<00:01:38.220> more<00:01:38.400> aggressively<00:01:38.759> in

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
but I think playing more aggressively in

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.460 
but I think playing more aggressively in
China<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.180> stuff<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.960> gives<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.380> an

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
China for stuff actually gives you an

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.319 
China for stuff actually gives you an
upper<00:01:40.650> hand<00:01:40.680> when<00:01:40.979> executed<00:01:41.579> well<00:01:41.729> yeah<00:01:42.150> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
upper hand when executed well yeah and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.940 
upper hand when executed well yeah and
so<00:01:42.479> we're<00:01:42.810> having<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.140> little<00:01:43.259> growing<00:01:43.770> pain

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
so we're having a little growing pain

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.469 
so we're having a little growing pain
switching<00:01:44.340> our<00:01:44.460> style<00:01:44.700> over<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.180> so

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
switching our style over to that so

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.030 
switching our style over to that so
we're<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:45.780> playing<00:01:46.079> maybe<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.619> well<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:46.920> we

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
we're not playing maybe as well as we

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.710 
we're not playing maybe as well as we
did<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.210> still<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.420> step<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
did but I think it's still a step in the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.600 
did but I think it's still a step in the
right<00:01:48.840> direction<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.409> as<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.979> practice<00:01:50.399> more

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
right direction and as we practice more

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.609 
right direction and as we practice more
and<00:01:50.840> play<00:01:51.840> more<00:01:51.990> hopefully<00:01:52.290> we'll<00:01:52.439> keep

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
and play more hopefully we'll keep

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.499 
and play more hopefully we'll keep
improving<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.820> speaking<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.180> forcing

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
improving and so speaking of forcing

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.179 
improving and so speaking of forcing
things<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.810> spend<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.110> lot<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> time<00:01:55.500> top<00:01:55.979> lane

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
things you spend a lot of time top lane

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.740 
things you spend a lot of time top lane
actually<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.759> couple<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.240> different<00:01:57.450> inks<00:01:57.600> fine

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
actually a couple of different inks fine

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.260 
actually a couple of different inks fine
you<00:01:57.899> got<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> work<00:01:58.350> against<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.890> zions<00:01:59.880> mundo

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
you got it to work against a zions mundo

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.370 
you got it to work against a zions mundo
why'd<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.570> spend<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:00.840> much<00:02:00.899> time<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.229> there

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
why'd you spend so much time up there

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.499 
why'd you spend so much time up there
well<00:02:02.159> moon<00:02:02.369> does<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> champion<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.240> it's

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
well moon does a champion that it's

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.270 
well moon does a champion that it's
really<00:02:03.750> vulnerable<00:02:04.049> early<00:02:04.770> game<00:02:04.920> especially

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
really vulnerable early game especially

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.010 
really vulnerable early game especially
to<00:02:05.610> dive<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:05.939> because<00:02:06.180> he's<00:02:06.360> generally<00:02:06.840> low

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
to dive it's because he's generally low

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020 
to dive it's because he's generally low
health<00:02:07.259> under<00:02:07.530> his<00:02:07.649> turret<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.099> if<00:02:08.940> you're

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
health under his turret and if you're

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.760 
health under his turret and if you're
able<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.270> dive<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.479> Janelle<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.379> snowball

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
able to dive on Janelle you can snowball

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.500 
able to dive on Janelle you can snowball
on<00:02:10.860> him<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.129> he<00:02:11.190> won't<00:02:11.400> get<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.090> useful

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
on him and he won't get that useful

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.970 
on him and he won't get that useful
he'll<00:02:12.690> either<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.140> teleport<00:02:13.410> back<00:02:13.650> into

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
he'll either have to teleport back into

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.680 
he'll either have to teleport back into
not<00:02:14.280> miss<00:02:14.430> bunch<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.730> creeps<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.209> then<00:02:15.540> his

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
not miss bunch of creeps and then his

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.110 
not miss bunch of creeps and then his
teleport<00:02:16.140> pressures<00:02:16.440> gone<00:02:16.590> or<00:02:16.830> he<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.790> dies

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
teleport pressures gone or he just dies

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.479 
teleport pressures gone or he just dies
and<00:02:18.150> mrs.<00:02:18.599> all<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> creeps<00:02:19.049> and<00:02:19.379> you<00:02:20.340> get<00:02:20.430> a

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
and mrs. all the creeps and you get a

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.490 
and mrs. all the creeps and you get a
big<00:02:20.640> advantage<00:02:20.879> on<00:02:21.030> him<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:22.260> good<00:02:22.470> to

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
big advantage on him so it's good to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.130 
big advantage on him so it's good to
can't<00:02:22.709> we<00:02:22.799> know<00:02:22.860> when<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.159> can<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.549> we<00:02:24.360> know

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
can't we know when we can and we know

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.539 
can't we know when we can and we know
neither<00:02:25.379> generally<00:02:25.709> wasn't<00:02:25.950> around<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:26.280> we

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
neither generally wasn't around so we

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.160 
neither generally wasn't around so we
just<00:02:26.700> kept<00:02:27.090> trying<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.299> pressure<00:02:27.480> on<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.019> guys

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
just kept trying to pressure on you guys

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.690 
just kept trying to pressure on you guys
definitely<00:02:28.379> seem<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.769> do<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:28.890> better<00:02:29.459> than

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
definitely seem to do that better than

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.830 
definitely seem to do that better than
all<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.909> other<00:02:30.030> teams<00:02:30.269> in<00:02:30.390> North<00:02:30.540> America

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
all the other teams in North America

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.690 
all the other teams in North America
right<00:02:30.930> now<00:02:30.959> but<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.680> was<00:02:31.830> still<00:02:32.129> a<00:02:32.160> fairly<00:02:32.430> slow

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
right now but it was still a fairly slow

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.699 
right now but it was still a fairly slow

this<00:02:44.640> clip<00:02:44.909> this<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.209> right<00:02:45.390> after<00:02:45.420> any<00:02:45.989> flash

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
this clip this is right after any flash

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.900 
this clip this is right after any flash
ulted<00:02:46.799> high<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.160> high<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.519> Annie<00:02:47.640> are<00:02:47.730> both

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
ulted high so high and Annie are both

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.039 
ulted high so high and Annie are both
very<00:02:48.090> low<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:48.569> we<00:02:48.660> knew<00:02:48.750> they<00:02:48.840> didn't<00:02:48.989> have

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
very low but we knew they didn't have

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.020 
very low but we knew they didn't have
their<00:02:49.230> main<00:02:49.349> initiation<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:50.730> we<00:02:50.819> pretty<00:02:50.940> much

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
their main initiation so we pretty much

make<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.549> mistake<00:03:35.609> we<00:03:36.060> don't<00:03:36.209> have<00:03:36.480> as<00:03:36.780> many

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
make a mistake we don't have as many

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.870 
make a mistake we don't have as many
hard<00:03:37.200> initiations<00:03:37.739> as<00:03:37.919> we<00:03:38.280> did<00:03:38.430> last<00:03:38.459> split

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
hard initiations as we did last split

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.610 
hard initiations as we did last split
with<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:39.329> ashes<00:03:39.690> acts<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.079> it's<00:03:40.230> kind<00:03:40.590> of

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
with like ashes acts so it's kind of

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.309 
with like ashes acts so it's kind of
harder<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.919> dive<00:03:41.069> towers<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:41.970> we<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:43.079> play

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
harder to dive towers but we just play

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.620 
harder to dive towers but we just play
it<00:03:43.349> out<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.880> make<00:03:44.880> safe<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:45.450> aggressive

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630
