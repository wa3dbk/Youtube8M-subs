enabled<00:00:33.390> through<00:00:33.960> clean<00:00:34.260> flight<00:00:34.590> reacts<00:00:35.399> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
enabled through clean flight reacts this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.270 
enabled through clean flight reacts this
thing<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.450> total<00:00:36.930> insanity

thing is just like total insanity

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
thing is just like total insanity
I'm<00:00:38.700> gonna<00:00:38.879> spin<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.690> we'll<00:00:39.840> grab

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
I'm gonna spin it up here and we'll grab

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.819 
I'm gonna spin it up here and we'll grab
a<00:00:40.110> quad<00:00:40.440> moving<00:00:40.860> around<00:00:41.149> watch<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.480> graphs

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
a quad moving around watch the graphs

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.010 
a quad moving around watch the graphs
here<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.100> these<00:00:44.219> four<00:00:44.550> motors<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.420> watch<00:00:45.750> how

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
here for these four motors and watch how

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.119 
here for these four motors and watch how
fast<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.590> reacts<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.190> my<00:00:47.700> changes<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:49.129> also

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
fast it reacts to my changes and also

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
fast it reacts to my changes and also
I'll<00:00:50.399> spin<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.820> real<00:00:51.000> quick<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.360> show<00:00:51.750> you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
I'll spin it up real quick and show you

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:05.719 
I'll spin it up real quick and show you
how<00:00:52.020> fast<00:00:52.289> the<00:01:04.040> spin<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> little<00:01:05.430> bit<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
how fast the spin it up a little bit I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.060 
how fast the spin it up a little bit I
just<00:01:05.790> say<00:01:06.000> throttle<00:01:06.600> response<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.290> braking

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
just say throttle response and braking

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.350 
just say throttle response and braking
I've<00:01:08.189> got<00:01:08.340> active<00:01:08.580> braking<00:01:08.760> turned<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.210> as

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
I've got active braking turned on as

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:35.340 
I've got active braking turned on as
well

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:43.160 

insanely<00:01:36.350> fast<00:01:37.330> that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.420 

and<00:01:44.170> then<00:01:44.350> tolling<00:01:44.619> with<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:44.829> loop<00:01:45.070> time<00:01:45.310> of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
and then tolling with a loop time of

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.310 
and then tolling with a loop time of
2500<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.329> haven't<00:01:46.539> even<00:01:46.600> tried<00:01:46.840> turning<00:01:47.049> it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
2500 I haven't even tried turning it

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.080 
2500 I haven't even tried turning it
down<00:01:47.350> any<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:47.950> wanted<00:01:48.579> to<00:01:48.640> get<00:01:48.729> a<00:01:48.759> little<00:01:48.820> bit<00:01:49.030> of

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
down any I wanted to get a little bit of

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.580 
down any I wanted to get a little bit of
flight<00:01:49.270> time<00:01:49.479> on<00:01:49.659> it<00:01:49.780> before<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:50.079> went<00:01:50.320> in<00:01:50.439> there

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
flight time on it before I went in there

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.380 
flight time on it before I went in there
and<00:01:50.649> we<00:01:51.220> started<00:01:51.579> hammering<00:01:51.759> on<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.090> tweet

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
and we started hammering on the tweet

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.740 
and we started hammering on the tweet
but<00:01:53.039> so<00:01:54.039> far<00:01:54.310> I'm<00:01:54.789> like<00:01:55.179> thoroughly<00:01:55.600> impressed

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
but so far I'm like thoroughly impressed

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.200 
but so far I'm like thoroughly impressed
it's<00:01:56.229> very<00:01:56.590> very<00:01:56.860> fast<00:01:59.490> you<00:02:00.490> know<00:02:00.579> give<00:02:01.000> up

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
it's very very fast you know give up

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.559 
it's very very fast you know give up

that's<00:02:54.370> that's<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.299> act<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.660> breaking<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:57.340> if

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
that's that's the act of breaking so if

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.640 
that's that's the act of breaking so if
you've<00:02:57.850> got<00:02:58.030> damped<00:02:58.870> light<00:02:59.049> enabled<00:03:00.120> es<00:03:01.120> es

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
you've got damped light enabled es es

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.440 
you've got damped light enabled es es
then<00:03:02.650> when<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:02.920> flash<00:03:03.549> on<00:03:03.730> with<00:03:03.880> BL<00:03:04.150> helling

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
then when you flash on with BL helling

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.620 
then when you flash on with BL helling
going<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.959> be<00:03:05.079> oh<00:03:05.109> hello<00:03:05.440> sweet<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.010> then

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
going to be oh hello sweet and then

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.129 
going to be oh hello sweet and then
slide<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:08.130> PWM<00:03:09.389> slider<00:03:10.389> to<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.660> right<00:03:10.750> until

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
slide the PWM slider to the right until

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.490 
slide the PWM slider to the right until
it<00:03:11.350> gets<00:03:11.530> too<00:03:11.650> damp<00:03:11.889> the<00:03:12.010> light<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.670> then<00:03:13.500> hit

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
it gets too damp the light and then hit

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.800 
it gets too damp the light and then hit
the<00:03:14.620> button<00:03:14.739> down<00:03:14.950> on<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.069> bottom<00:03:15.510> -<00:03:16.510> right<00:03:16.660> -

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
the button down on the bottom - right -

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.599 
the button down on the bottom - right -
changes<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.410> once<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.650> do<00:03:17.769> that<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:18.459> you'll

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
changes and once you do that and you'll

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.190 
changes and once you do that and you'll
have<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.850> active<00:03:19.120> braking<00:03:19.329> enabled<00:03:19.930> as<00:03:20.019> well

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
have the active braking enabled as well

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.090 
have the active braking enabled as well
so<00:03:20.910> anyway<00:03:22.079> that's<00:03:23.079> my<00:03:23.200> quick<00:03:23.680> video<00:03:23.950> for

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
so anyway that's my quick video for

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.539 
so anyway that's my quick video for
today<00:03:24.250> just<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.730> show<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:24.940> what<00:03:25.950> what<00:03:26.950> Bo<00:03:27.190> heli

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
today just to show you what what Bo heli

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.000 
today just to show you what what Bo heli
in<00:03:27.910> claim<00:03:28.420> flight<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:28.930> active<00:03:29.440> braking<00:03:29.650> and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
in claim flight and active braking and

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.770 
in claim flight and active braking and
one<00:03:30.220> shot<00:03:30.430> 125<00:03:31.620> looks<00:03:32.620> like<00:03:33.150> on<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.209> quad<00:03:34.480> so

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
one shot 125 looks like on a quad so

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.729 
one shot 125 looks like on a quad so
take<00:03:35.470> care<00:03:35.709> this<00:03:35.920> Jeremy<00:03:36.310> build<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:37.239> fly<00:03:37.540> it

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
take care this Jeremy build it fly it

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.519 
take care this Jeremy build it fly it
