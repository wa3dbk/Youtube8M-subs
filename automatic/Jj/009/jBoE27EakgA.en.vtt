some<00:01:51.210> more<00:01:51.420> speed<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:51.900> plan<00:01:52.080> is<00:01:52.229> set<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.740> it

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
some more speed your plan is set for it

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.710

if it's above five Meg's then you want

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.000 
if it's above five Meg's then you want
to<00:01:54.780> know<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.710> give<00:01:55.860> you

to know what they can do to give you
more<00:01:56.160> speed<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> end<00:01:58.800> you<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.190> might

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
more speed so in the end you just might

finally if you're not sure if your Wi-Fi

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.600 
finally if you're not sure if your Wi-Fi
signal<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.989> strong<00:03:15.290> enough<00:03:15.470> try<00:03:16.040> connecting

better<00:03:21.830> then<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.310> might<00:03:22.459> want<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.700> consider

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
better then you might want to consider

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.270 
better then you might want to consider
moving<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.510> router<00:03:23.780> next<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:24.409> device<00:03:24.680> so

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
moving the router next to the device so

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.360 
moving the router next to the device so
you<00:03:25.340> don't<00:03:25.610> have<00:03:25.760> wires<00:03:26.030> running<00:03:26.180> everywhere

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
you don't have wires running everywhere

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.320 
you don't have wires running everywhere
so<00:03:28.370> now<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:28.760> have<00:03:28.790> approved<00:03:29.239> your
