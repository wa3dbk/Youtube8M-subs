00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.350 

so<00:00:00.539> here's<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.900> second<00:00:01.350> turn<00:00:01.530> 11th<00:00:01.920> hour

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:07.360 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.340 

that's<00:00:07.960> the<00:00:08.140> switch<00:00:08.350> in<00:00:08.530> the<00:00:08.559> back<00:00:10.050> as<00:00:11.050> soon<00:00:11.260> as

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
that's the switch in the back as soon as

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.930 
that's the switch in the back as soon as
that's<00:00:11.530> turned<00:00:11.830> on<00:00:11.980> we're<00:00:12.309> able<00:00:12.400> to<00:00:12.610> turn<00:00:12.820> on

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
that's turned on we're able to turn on

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:25.520 
that's turned on we're able to turn on
the<00:00:13.059> CNC<00:00:13.360> power

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.290 

nykeya<00:00:26.530> machine

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.950 

has<00:00:29.900> no<00:00:30.140> preference<00:00:31.090> to<00:00:32.090> when<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.390> emergency

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
has no preference to when the emergency

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:48.500 
has no preference to when the emergency
stop<00:00:33.200> those<00:00:33.440> released

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.740 

once<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> CNC<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.829> fully<00:00:50.160> started

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.480 

puts<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.140> standby<00:00:53.500> finally<00:00:54.070> start<00:00:54.370> to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
puts the standby finally start to

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.330 
puts the standby finally start to
hydraulics<00:00:55.440> now<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.500> machine<00:00:56.950> is<00:00:56.980> fully

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
hydraulics now the machine is fully

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.729 
hydraulics now the machine is fully
started<00:00:57.850> we<00:00:58.840> need<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:59.050> check<00:00:59.260> inside<00:00:59.590> the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
started we need to check inside the

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.200 
started we need to check inside the
cavity<00:01:00.220> by<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.239> work<00:01:01.510> area

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.530 

so<00:01:04.660> make<00:01:04.809> sure<00:01:04.840> there's<00:01:05.230> no<00:01:05.379> interference<00:01:05.890> of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
so make sure there's no interference of

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.890 
so make sure there's no interference of
spindle<00:01:08.850> once<00:01:09.850> that's<00:01:10.060> done<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.600> check<00:01:10.870> to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
spindle once that's done that check to

it'll<00:01:17.640> move<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.480> the<00:01:18.510> home

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
it'll move it if it's at the home

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.230 
it'll move it if it's at the home
position<00:01:19.010> it'll<00:01:20.010> move<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> off<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.700> return<00:01:21.030> if

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
position it'll move it off and return if

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.480 
position it'll move it off and return if
it's<00:01:21.390> somewhere<00:01:21.720> else<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.230> was<00:01:22.890> returned<00:01:23.400> to

it's somewhere else that was returned to
the<00:01:23.610> home<00:01:23.820> position

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
the home position

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.740 
the home position
you<00:01:26.290> can<00:01:26.470> tell

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
you can tell

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.100 
you can tell
your<00:01:28.290> x<00:01:28.620> and<00:01:29.340> z

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110

John<00:01:31.800> buttons<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.370> have<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.670> little<00:01:32.880> home

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
John buttons that have the little home

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.800 
John buttons that have the little home
data<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.690> them<00:01:33.870> I<00:01:34.050> lit<00:01:34.410> up<00:01:34.440> when<00:01:34.740> we're<00:01:34.890> home

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
data on them I lit up when we're home

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.130 
data on them I lit up when we're home
so<00:01:36.380> now<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.890> machine<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.460> started<00:01:37.790> if<00:01:38.750> we<00:01:38.930> want

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
so now the machine is started if we want

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.399 
so now the machine is started if we want
to<00:01:39.260> do<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.409> little<00:01:39.619> warm-up<00:01:40.070> cycle<00:01:40.520> for<00:01:41.260> get<00:01:42.260> the

spindle running will go to Mei once we

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.310 
spindle running will go to Mei once we

in<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.660> jog<00:02:59.900> love<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.410> work<00:03:00.590> there<00:03:01.220> is

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
in the jog love the work there is

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.980 
in the jog love the work there is
because<00:03:01.850> we<00:03:02.000> programmed<00:03:02.450> one<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.840> already

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
because we programmed one and already

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.690 
because we programmed one and already
this<00:03:03.320> morning<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:03.920> now<00:03:04.100> we'll<00:03:04.310> just<00:03:04.340> a

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
this morning so now we'll just a

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.810 
this morning so now we'll just a
selected<00:03:05.330> lower<00:03:05.600> that<00:03:06.350> turns<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:06.860> stop<00:03:07.460> turns

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
selected lower that turns on stop turns

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.500 
selected lower that turns on stop turns
it<00:03:08.030> off<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:09.320> select<00:03:09.620> button<00:03:09.820> miss<00:03:10.820> be<00:03:11.180> pushed

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
it off the select button miss be pushed

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.800 
it off the select button miss be pushed
in<00:03:12.050> conjunction<00:03:12.940> with<00:03:13.940> any<00:03:14.090> feature<00:03:14.480> that

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
in conjunction with any feature that

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.830 
in conjunction with any feature that
it's<00:03:15.200> going<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.440> move<00:03:15.650> apart<00:03:16.010> in<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.220> machine

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
it's going to move apart in the machine

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.680 
it's going to move apart in the machine
so<00:03:18.670> another<00:03:19.670> thing<00:03:19.970> we<00:03:20.090> can<00:03:20.240> do<00:03:20.450> is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
so another thing we can do is

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.949 
so another thing we can do is
turned<00:03:22.350> around<00:03:22.500> manually<00:03:23.340> by<00:03:23.520> chemical
