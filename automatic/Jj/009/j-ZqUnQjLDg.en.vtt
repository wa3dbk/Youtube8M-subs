00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 this product initially however 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:10.530
 in the microsoft model they were used 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.300
 cameras for projection so in 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.429
 instead of having this space that we see in 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.260
 the bottom part now the table was 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.150
 really a cabinet that went up to the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.680
 same and then if they approached with 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.449
 samsung I want to review super is a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.670
 technology that can do this that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.680
 can detect objects when you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 put that have more than 50 points 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.359
 contact at once and so on then the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.070
 answer yes yes and between samsung and 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.649
 microsoft develop a technology that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.149
 it's called pixelsense each of the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.910
 pixels on this panel be a camera 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.200
 it really is an infrared sensor that 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.480
 It acts as a camera then 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.309
 we have as many cameras as numbers 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.350
 pixels in this panel to react to 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.110
 any object that I put that I 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.239
 put in minor if an object does not react 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.820
 cools a specific hot object 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.530
 no and obviously as we can see here 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.690
 that this is like the protector of 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.030
 screen that is called attraction this 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.979
 who also recognizes that this 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.869
 is going towards the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.460
 different sides a simpler way 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.530
 to understand the part of the technology 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.049
 pixelsense is through this 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.930
 application this that generates me every time 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.229
 that I put an object using software 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.540
 obviously sur40 can not detect and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.830
 can launch some application can 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.119
 do something about it is to say you 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.930
 we are talking here about reality 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.850
 increased 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.690
 every time I am an external object 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.750
 I can do that in the south 40 reaction 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.170
 this object is called a tag and is no longer 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.360
 that a geometric arrangement of points 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.179
 whites with black background that are equivalent 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.750
 to a number for example I put this 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.310
 this guy and here tells me this he remembered 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.800
 who knew a tag and in this case by 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
 example is number 38 2 I can not 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.530
 be a program when they both present 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.540
 number 38 in your application 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.790
 this link application is the only one that 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.130
 comes preloaded with your maps and 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.760
 images for example if I put it in 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.470
 images 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.560
 I put samsung 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.979
 in 40 I will bring samsung images 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.220
 sur40 or if I put it on maps and search by 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.800
 example the socket I do not know any 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.200
 location will bring me the map with the 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.600
 civilization I passed it in two ways not 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.060
 I can type or through a tag I can 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.900
 look for that information and it starts to 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.870
 show the user different photos this 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.930
 etcetera and I show you 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.819
 on a real map where the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.670
 dependency angel when this reform 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.560
 of hotels there are nearby that restaurants 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.299
 there are close then already the interaction 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.879
 it's simpler this is an application 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.440
 generic however is an example of 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.720
 how can we use one of these 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.239
 generic applications for a 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.239
 real-life application the price of 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.010
 150000 is the public price includes the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.659
 paws the legs really is a 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.250
 accessory sold separately but 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.299
 the price of bread customers around 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.150
 150 thousand this is a product 100% bits 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.730
 100% corporate but really this 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.530
 product is found in through 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.810
 the authorized distributors of 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.609
 samsung the value dealers this 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.909
 It's a tailored suit like almost all 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.379
 the corporate products then this 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.879
 is a generic application you can 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.859
 to serve someone like you I did not talk 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.799
 Now there will be whoever wants 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.799
 have a custom application myself 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.930
 client I want to acquire and use their 40 me 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.819
 acerco a sansÃ³n stands represents the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.760
 product told me yes yes I like I want 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.040
 do a test I want to know 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.439
 let's make an application for me in 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.500
 that moment we involve the people of 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.569
 microsoft microsoft reviews the proposal 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.099
 check what it is about and say good ah 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.650
 you want an application with these 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.209
 features and it brings its expert and 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.450
 that expert develops the application 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.940
 if there is not a size of 40 inches is the 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.030
 resolution that handles is full hd of the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.870
 technology that uses is slow is this 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.849
 has a brightness of 300 nits has a 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.560
 contrast only from the panel in a 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.329
 Professional product not week is not so 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.280
 important the dynamic contrast perhaps 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.670
 what we find in the three teles 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.650
 thousand to one has four usb ports has 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.109
 slot for ssd memory 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.850
 has wifi n bluetooth has port 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.979
 ethernet comes with windows 7 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.600
 recharged professional has a 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:28.160
 processor 2.9 gigabyte to double md 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.410
 core has a nation processor 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.570
 independent of a giga this also of 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.770
 baby then if we see it really is a 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.970
 complete product now something fine 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.949
 important the panel is coated with 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.570
 the gorilla glass protection panel he 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.850
 in fact it is the gorilla panel more 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.770
 big furniture this thing that assures us 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.780
 that a design product is produced is 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.060
 say no longer have a shopping center what 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.490
 that is the agent I can put objects what 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.960
 who wants on top of this without any 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.570
 concern that it will harm the 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.370
 team or something like that even supports eye 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.350
 supports of branches in the trainer by 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.660
 have this with rain does not like this 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.970
 spills and frame that intentionally 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.290
 wide the comparison of other products 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.740
 because if I'm sitting 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.740
 in the frame
