00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.849
 well, here we go we'll do a little 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.010
 affluent group of ecs and 6 mx had 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.550
 a few targets buried as I did 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.519
 for other detector then here on this 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.880
 pebble here it is there is a double 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:32.850
 Tournament do not delay an alms and feudal 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:38.969
 buried at 14 cm here there is a double 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:45.620
 tournament buried at 18 cm yes I'm moving 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:51.510
 a little bit so we see the other target is 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:01:06.060
 here and here we have a louse lÃ©on 3 10 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:10.200
 cents buried 1.24 in saint-yvi game 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.570
 but the device has no volume at 0 on 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.930
 hanotal group sensitivity to maxi 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.280
 discrimination at the mini and digou 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.979
 fight to the smallest 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.250
 in other words the device is at maximum 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.729
 of his power 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.979
 we'll wait a few seconds 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.490
 who are busy 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.100
 so here we begin since we 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:46.979
 are there or by the currency 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:52.220
 Napoleon III said to stick to the state 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:56.700
 24 cm the end at 27 28 and hardly more 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.820
 then we'll go I caliber 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.479
 everything here we are going to double 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.479
 tournament that is him is at 18 cm 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:19.660
 aulas example a link but could 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:23.620
 feel like a feeling is actually 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:35.320
 we are going to make the feudal currency that 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:37.300
 she is buried at 14 cm this is the 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.510
 first we see that it is a device 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.050
 which is a jewel kg he finds very well 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:49.390
 to be a small world and it's an obole of 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:54.910
 melgueil here is how I do it 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:58.420
 every time I do a sketch but 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.800
 we try on the selectivity of 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.230
 the device to know always a currency 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.260
 feudal between two ferrous the two actually 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.290
 re it's 5mm cast iron these are 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.220
 always the same I move so 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.430
 the camera there the video so that you 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.800
 can see it I was approaching excuse 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.620
 me for the waves 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:30.700
 here and there we should be on it 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:35.320
 that's where I put this to see if 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:40.390
 I'm disappointed here it is yeah and here I am 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:45.910
 am on it so here you have a 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:49.090
 money it's henry slabs and me 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.769
 it's a small feudal currency see there 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.860
 I pose here and here you have both 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.510
 concrete bars that I usually put 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.540
 so I did a test just now 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.320
 preliminary it's okay but if I 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:11.730
 closer samassa will not go so we 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.730
 always starts thoroughly and started 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.710
 here it is, it is certainly the target of course 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.180
 lose a liar 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.520
 but he takes it well in the middle 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.960
 ferrous two by the way if I remove 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.710
 in fashion and you will see that it does not take 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.710
 ferrous or without the help of money 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:49.890
 see he does not take ferrous I 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:53.550
 give the change he's doing very well 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.940
 very well the currency can be considered 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:02.100
 that it is a device that finds very 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:04.890
 small it's a 18 kg and actually it 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.900
 find it very small I go up a bit for 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:13.260
 that I see it so it is very small 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.140
 according to the frequency that he has by 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.170
 against it is not very fast but he 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.390
 has a quality is that despite its 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.960
 average speed let's say it is very 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.720
 selective 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.350
 ie that there's no need too 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.990
 slow down 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.730
 it separates the currency well from both 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.560
 ferrous as you could see 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.830
 for me it's a good little device 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.380
 to take pleasure in detecting 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.430
 especially on slightly polluted areas 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.430
 There it is, thanks
