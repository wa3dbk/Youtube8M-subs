00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
them they're going to last a lot longer

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.439 
them they're going to last a lot longer
as<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.469> start<00:00:49.710> progressing<00:00:49.829> into<00:00:50.449> more

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
as you start progressing into more

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.750 
as you start progressing into more
difficult<00:00:51.870> routes<00:00:52.129> add<00:00:53.129> more<00:00:53.430> difficult

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
difficult routes add more difficult

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.729 
difficult routes add more difficult
bouldering<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:55.020> wanna<00:00:55.170> move<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> something<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
bouldering you wanna move to something a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.430 
bouldering you wanna move to something a
little<00:00:56.100> more<00:00:56.309> aggressive<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:58.199> bit<00:00:58.289> more

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
little more aggressive a little bit more

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.709 
little more aggressive a little bit more
asymmetrical<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> toe<00:00:59.430> shape<00:00:59.699> if<00:01:00.660> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
asymmetrical in the toe shape if you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.799 
asymmetrical in the toe shape if you
notice<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> difference<00:01:01.379> between<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> two

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
notice the difference between the two

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.780 
notice the difference between the two
the<00:01:03.809> yellow<00:01:03.989> ones<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.439> Left<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> much

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the yellow ones on the Left have a much

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.090 
the yellow ones on the Left have a much
more<00:01:06.000> asymmetrical<00:01:06.600> toe<00:01:06.750> shape<00:01:07.020> which<00:01:07.890> allows

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
more asymmetrical toe shape which allows

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.890 
more asymmetrical toe shape which allows
you<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.580> place<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.060> lot<00:01:09.330> more<00:01:09.479> weight<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.780> your

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you to place a lot more weight on your

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.300 
you to place a lot more weight on your
big<00:01:10.110> toe<00:01:11.840> again<00:01:12.840> they're<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> little<00:01:13.920> bit<00:01:14.130> down

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
big toe again they're a little bit down

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.670 
big toe again they're a little bit down
turned<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> they're<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> little<00:01:16.590> bit

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
turned so they're a little bit

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.780 
turned so they're a little bit
aggressive<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.100> they<00:01:17.159> work<00:01:17.310> very<00:01:17.549> well<00:01:17.610> on

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
aggressive so they work very well on

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.539 
aggressive so they work very well on
overhangs<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.100> these<00:01:20.100> ones<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.369> velcro

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
overhangs and these ones are velcro

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.700 
overhangs and these ones are velcro
which<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.420> much<00:01:21.540> better<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.780> bouldering<00:01:22.290> as

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
which are much better for bouldering as

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.130 
which are much better for bouldering as
opposed<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> lace-ups

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
opposed to lace-ups

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.760 
opposed to lace-ups
just<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> ease<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.070> putting<00:01:26.220> them<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.670> off

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
just the ease of putting them on and off

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.600 
just the ease of putting them on and off
so<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.979> start<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.250> getting<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> more

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
so as you start to getting the more

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.420 
so as you start to getting the more
advanced<00:01:29.850> shoes<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.799> aggressiveness<00:01:32.250> of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
advanced shoes the aggressiveness of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.460 
advanced shoes the aggressiveness of
them<00:01:32.640> very<00:01:33.150> much<00:01:33.360> increases

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.520 

so<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.270> harsh<00:01:39.270> downturn<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.020> both<00:01:40.230> of<00:01:40.440> these

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
so this harsh downturn on both of these

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.050 
so this harsh downturn on both of these
shoes<00:01:41.150> works<00:01:42.150> very<00:01:42.600> well<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.620> overhanging

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
shoes works very well for on overhanging

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.510 
shoes works very well for on overhanging
terrain<00:01:45.260> digging<00:01:46.260> your<00:01:46.380> toe<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.800> and<00:01:47.100> actually

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
terrain digging your toe in and actually

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.830 
terrain digging your toe in and actually
getting<00:01:47.910> leverage<00:01:48.090> from<00:01:48.360> your<00:01:48.480> foot<00:01:48.660> even

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
getting leverage from your foot even

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.710 
getting leverage from your foot even
though<00:01:49.400> you're<00:01:50.400> say<00:01:50.610> climbing<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.120> a<00:01:51.150> roof<00:01:51.390> or

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
though you're say climbing on a roof or

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.550 
though you're say climbing on a roof or
a<00:01:51.960> cave<00:01:53.480> they<00:01:54.480> also<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.870> a<00:01:54.900> great<00:01:55.110> deal<00:01:55.290> more

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
a cave they also put a great deal more

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.250 
a cave they also put a great deal more
tightly<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.640> conform<00:01:57.150> to<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.330> foot<00:01:57.390> making

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
tightly and conform to your foot making

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.810 
tightly and conform to your foot making
them<00:01:58.350> more<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:58.620> a<00:01:58.710> rubber<00:01:58.920> sock<00:01:59.340> than<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
them more of a rubber sock than the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.110 
them more of a rubber sock than the
stiff<00:02:00.090> platform<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:02.550> beginners<00:02:02.880> shoes

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
stiff platform of the beginners shoes

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.200 
stiff platform of the beginners shoes
they<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.750> lot<00:02:03.870> more<00:02:03.930> flex<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.590> them<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
they have a lot more flex to them and

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.460 
they have a lot more flex to them and
because<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.330> rubbers<00:02:06.600> thinner<00:02:06.810> they<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.080> wear

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
because the rubbers thinner they do wear

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.980 
because the rubbers thinner they do wear
out<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.680> great<00:02:08.070> deal<00:02:08.220> faster<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.630> also<00:02:12.780> have

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
out a great deal faster so you also have

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.640 
out a great deal faster so you also have
the<00:02:13.080> option<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.470> slippers<00:02:14.150> which<00:02:15.150> again

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
the option of slippers which again

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.380 
the option of slippers which again
