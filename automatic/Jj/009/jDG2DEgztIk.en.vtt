system<00:00:21.779> just<00:00:22.170> how<00:00:22.320> easy<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.550> capture<00:00:23.970> an

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
system just how easy it is to capture an

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.109 
system just how easy it is to capture an
image<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.990> balloon<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.650> mid<00:00:26.099> burst<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.970> we're

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
image of a balloon in mid burst so we're

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.820 
image of a balloon in mid burst so we're
going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.330> create<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.630> high-speed<00:00:28.380> flash

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
going to create a high-speed flash

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.939 
going to create a high-speed flash
illuminated<00:00:29.699> image<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.660> balloon<00:00:30.990> right<00:00:31.710> in

illuminated image of a balloon right in

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.120 
illuminated image of a balloon right in
mid<00:00:32.309> burst<00:00:32.610> very<00:00:33.420> very<00:00:33.719> simple<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
mid burst very very simple to do and the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.130 
mid burst very very simple to do and the
heart<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.489> how<00:00:35.850> we're<00:00:36.059> going<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
heart of how we're going to do it is the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.360 
heart of how we're going to do it is the
cognos<00:00:37.559> stop<00:00:38.219> shot<00:00:38.489> controller<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.370> you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
cognos stop shot controller here and you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.100 
cognos stop shot controller here and you
saw<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> other<00:00:41.910> video<00:00:42.120> how<00:00:42.510> easy<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
saw in the other video how easy and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.930 
saw in the other video how easy and
quick<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.710> set<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.190> use<00:00:44.340> flash<00:00:44.700> for

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
quick it is to set up to use flash for

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.090 
quick it is to set up to use flash for
illumination<00:00:45.450> using<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> microphone<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
illumination using a microphone as a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.790 
illumination using a microphone as a
triggering<00:00:47.640> device<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.899> we're<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
triggering device and so we're going to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.220 
triggering device and so we're going to
do<00:00:49.950> exactly<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.579> same<00:00:50.640> thing<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:51.449> we're

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
do exactly the same thing here we're

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
do exactly the same thing here we're
going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> hook<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.039> microphone<00:00:53.789> into<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
going to hook a microphone into the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.590 
going to hook a microphone into the
microphone<00:00:54.989> input<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:56.030> then<00:00:57.030> take<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> very

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
microphone input and then take a very

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.869 
microphone input and then take a very
standard<00:00:58.170> flash<00:00:58.440> unit<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.100> hook<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
standard flash unit and hook it up the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.760 
standard flash unit and hook it up the
way<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.059> did<00:01:00.329> before<00:01:00.480> into<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> trigger<00:01:01.559> one

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
way we did before into the trigger one

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.570 
way we did before into the trigger one
output<00:01:02.149> such<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.510> when<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.320> clap<00:01:04.739> my<00:01:04.769> hands<00:01:05.250> or

make<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> noise<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.020> flash<00:01:07.260> goes<00:01:07.560> off

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
make a noise you see the flash goes off

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.770 
make a noise you see the flash goes off
you<00:01:07.950> probably<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.490> illuminating<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.270> face

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
you probably see it illuminating my face

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.130 
you probably see it illuminating my face
essentially<00:01:10.770> instantaneously<00:01:11.659> once<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.840> clap

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
essentially instantaneously once I clap

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.390 
essentially instantaneously once I clap
my<00:01:13.170> hands<00:01:14.000> now<00:01:15.140> if<00:01:16.140> I'm<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> use<00:01:16.770> this

technique to capture a balloon in mid

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.600 
technique to capture a balloon in mid
burst<00:01:21.560> there's<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.680> few<00:01:22.860> things<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.220> need<00:01:23.490> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
burst there's a few things we need to

burst there's a few things we need to
understand<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:25.049> know<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> fact<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.700> a

second to completely burst if we prick

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.719 
second to completely burst if we prick
it<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> front<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.900> 500th<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:35.340> second

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
I managed to fire the flash one

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.580 
I managed to fire the flash one
millisecond<00:01:53.820> after<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> sound<00:01:54.750> occurs<00:01:55.200> I'm

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
millisecond after the sound occurs I'm

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.639 
millisecond after the sound occurs I'm
going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.399> balloon<00:01:56.670> halfway

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
going to get the balloon halfway

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.749 
going to get the balloon halfway
exploded<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.829> that's<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.399> we're<00:01:59.549> aiming

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
exploded and that's what we're aiming

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.810 
exploded and that's what we're aiming
for<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:01.530> how<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.860> earth<00:02:01.890> did<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.520> calculate

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
for so how on earth did we calculate

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.219 
for so how on earth did we calculate
that<00:02:03.420> well<00:02:04.439> another<00:02:05.310> really<00:02:05.850> nice<00:02:06.210> aspect<00:02:07.049> of

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
that well another really nice aspect of

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.990 
that well another really nice aspect of
physics<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.640> sound<00:02:09.060> travels<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.959> air<00:02:10.259> at

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
physics is that sound travels in air at

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.610 
physics is that sound travels in air at
approximately<00:02:12.000> 1,000<00:02:12.900> feet

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
approximately 1,000 feet

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.759 
approximately 1,000 feet
second<00:02:13.890> at<00:02:14.310> sea-level<00:02:15.110> approximately<00:02:16.110> so

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
second at sea-level approximately so

technique<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.859> we're<00:02:46.980> going<00:02:47.129> to<00:02:47.220> be<00:02:47.340> using

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
technique that we're going to be using

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.910 
technique that we're going to be using
is<00:02:47.849> called<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.269> open<00:02:48.510> flash<00:02:49.049> technique<00:02:49.680> and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
is called the open flash technique and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.110 
is called the open flash technique and
what<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.609> requires<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.799> no<00:02:52.799> ambient<00:02:53.489> light<00:02:53.849> and

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
what it requires is no ambient light and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.390 
what it requires is no ambient light and
the<00:02:54.299> only<00:02:54.650> illumination<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.950> exposure

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the only illumination for the exposure

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.699 
the only illumination for the exposure
comes<00:02:56.970> from<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.359> flash<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:58.079> reason<00:02:58.470> we<00:02:58.560> need

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
comes from the flash the reason we need

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.369 
comes from the flash the reason we need
to<00:02:58.769> do<00:02:59.159> that<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.670> because<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.659> constraint<00:03:01.200> we

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
to do that is because of a constraint we

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.979 
to do that is because of a constraint we
have<00:03:01.620> called<00:03:01.980> shutter<00:03:02.310> lag<00:03:02.579> we<00:03:03.180> can't<00:03:03.480> be

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
have called shutter lag we can't be

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.349 
have called shutter lag we can't be
quick<00:03:04.319> enough<00:03:04.620> with<00:03:04.950> our<00:03:04.980> camera<00:03:05.579> shutter<00:03:05.819> to

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
quick enough with our camera shutter to

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.809 
quick enough with our camera shutter to
fire<00:03:06.659> the<00:03:06.900> camera<00:03:07.109> open<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.890> shutter<00:03:08.159> watch

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
fire the camera open the shutter watch

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.520 
fire the camera open the shutter watch
the<00:03:09.030> balloon<00:03:09.269> bursts<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:09.810> then<00:03:10.019> close<00:03:10.319> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the balloon bursts and then close the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.130 
the balloon bursts and then close the
shutter<00:03:10.799> simply<00:03:11.700> because<00:03:12.120> remember<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.810> said

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
shutter simply because remember I said

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.880 
shutter simply because remember I said
the<00:03:13.319> balloon<00:03:13.530> bursts<00:03:14.069> in<00:03:14.250> two<00:03:14.609> milliseconds

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
the balloon bursts in two milliseconds

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.229 
the balloon bursts in two milliseconds
when<00:03:16.890> we<00:03:17.069> hit<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.400> shutter<00:03:17.669> button<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:18.120> our

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
when we hit the shutter button of our

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.069 
when we hit the shutter button of our
camera<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:19.049> takes<00:03:19.440> something<00:03:20.099> like<00:03:20.489> 40<00:03:21.180> or<00:03:21.389> 50

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
camera it takes something like 40 or 50

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.680 
camera it takes something like 40 or 50
milliseconds<00:03:22.950> between<00:03:23.579> us<00:03:24.030> pressing<00:03:24.569> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
milliseconds between us pressing the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.050 
milliseconds between us pressing the
camera<00:03:25.049> button<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.680> shutter<00:03:26.190> button<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.669> the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
camera button the shutter button and the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.659 
camera button the shutter button and the
shutter<00:03:27.329> actually<00:03:27.900> opening<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.190> could<00:03:29.549> have

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
shutter actually opening so I could have

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.670 
shutter actually opening so I could have
you<00:03:29.970> know<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.329> balloon<00:03:30.510> has<00:03:30.900> burst<00:03:31.139> and<00:03:31.470> long

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
you know the balloon has burst and long

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.500 
you know the balloon has burst and long
since<00:03:31.980> disappeared<00:03:32.400> by<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.030> time<00:03:33.359> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
since disappeared by the time the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.599 
since disappeared by the time the
shutter<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.930> camera<00:03:34.019> opens<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:35.310> what<00:03:35.489> we

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
shutter of the camera opens so what we

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.430 
shutter of the camera opens so what we
do<00:03:35.760> instead<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.299> we<00:03:36.450> use<00:03:36.690> open<00:03:36.930> flash

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
do instead is we use open flash

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.039 
do instead is we use open flash
technique<00:03:37.980> we<00:03:38.489> have<00:03:38.730> zero<00:03:39.180> or<00:03:39.450> very<00:03:39.540> little

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
technique we have zero or very little

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.800 
technique we have zero or very little
ambient<00:03:40.769> light<00:03:41.040> we<00:03:41.579> open<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> camera<00:03:42.389> shutter

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
ambient light we open the camera shutter

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.780 
ambient light we open the camera shutter
because<00:03:43.470> there's<00:03:43.680> no<00:03:43.859> ambient<00:03:44.310> light<00:03:44.489> there's

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
because there's no ambient light there's

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.059 
because there's no ambient light there's
no<00:03:44.849> exposure<00:03:45.299> being<00:03:45.660> made<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.500> flash<00:03:46.799> goes

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
no exposure being made the flash goes

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.099 
no exposure being made the flash goes
off<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.519> instant<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.180> balloon<00:03:48.449> bursts<00:03:48.959> and

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
off the instant the balloon bursts and

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.559 
off the instant the balloon bursts and
we<00:03:49.379> release<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.980> shutter<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.849> we<00:03:51.239> get<00:03:51.419> our

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
we release the shutter and we get our

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.390 
we release the shutter and we get our
exposure<00:03:52.049> so<00:03:52.590> we're<00:03:52.709> going<00:03:52.859> to<00:03:52.919> put<00:03:53.069> that<00:03:53.190> into

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
exposure so we're going to put that into

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.830 
exposure so we're going to put that into
practice<00:03:53.639> but<00:03:54.150> first<00:03:54.389> I'm<00:03:54.599> going<00:03:54.750> to

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
practice but first I'm going to

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.650 
practice but first I'm going to
demonstrate<00:03:55.019> roughly<00:03:55.919> what<00:03:56.129> we'll<00:03:56.280> see<00:03:56.660> and

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
demonstrate roughly what we'll see and

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.170 
demonstrate roughly what we'll see and
I'm<00:03:58.349> going<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.650> very<00:03:58.919> bravely<00:03:59.370> hold<00:03:59.970> this

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
I'm going to very bravely hold this

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.869 
I'm going to very bravely hold this
balloon<00:04:00.569> right<00:04:01.079> by<00:04:01.319> my<00:04:01.560> head<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.069> I'm<00:04:02.669> going

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
balloon right by my head and I'm going

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.349 
balloon right by my head and I'm going
to<00:04:02.940> prick<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.389> balloon<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.790> guys<00:04:05.970> here

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
to prick the balloon and the guys here

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.089 
to prick the balloon and the guys here
are<00:04:06.540> going<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.750> be<00:04:06.840> operating<00:04:07.379> the<00:04:07.500> camera<00:04:07.919> and

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
are going to be operating the camera and

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.280 
are going to be operating the camera and
the<00:04:08.220> lights<00:04:08.459> forest<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.329> background<00:04:09.840> but

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
the lights forest in the background but

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.839 
the lights forest in the background but
essentially<00:04:10.859> what's<00:04:11.040> going<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.340> happen<00:04:11.699> is

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
essentially what's going to happen is

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.879 
essentially what's going to happen is
this<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.569> can<00:04:12.720> see<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.049> microphone<00:04:13.230> I'm

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
this you can see the microphone I'm

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.589 
this you can see the microphone I'm
placing<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.519> on<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.639> table<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.480> is

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
placing it on the table and it is

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.420 
placing it on the table and it is
approximately<00:04:15.900> one<00:04:16.620> foot<00:04:16.919> away<00:04:17.039> from<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
approximately one foot away from the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.729 
approximately one foot away from the
balloon<00:04:17.789> such<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.630> when<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.930> goes<00:04:19.169> bang

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
balloon such that when it goes bang

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.920 
balloon such that when it goes bang
you'll<00:04:20.280> see<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.639> flash<00:04:20.880> go<00:04:21.150> off<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.570> that's

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
you'll see the flash go off and that's

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.990 
you'll see the flash go off and that's
what's<00:04:22.140> going<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.469> create<00:04:22.680> our<00:04:22.800> exposure<00:04:23.370> so

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
what's going to create our exposure so

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.530 
what's going to create our exposure so
let's<00:04:24.270> try<00:04:24.539> that<00:04:24.750> with<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:24.960> lights<00:04:25.289> off

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
let's try that with the lights off

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.390 
let's try that with the lights off
and<00:04:26.630> as<00:04:27.080> we<00:04:27.290> turn<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.650> lights<00:04:27.860> down<00:04:27.980> you'll

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
and as we turn the lights down you'll

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.100 
and as we turn the lights down you'll
see<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.760> camera<00:04:28.940> is<00:04:29.240> going<00:04:29.450> to<00:04:29.570> there's<00:04:29.930> not

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
see the camera is going to there's not

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.900 
see the camera is going to there's not
much<00:04:30.290> ambient<00:04:30.740> light<00:04:30.920> if<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.310> can<00:04:31.460> see<00:04:31.670> me<00:04:31.820> at

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
much ambient light if you can see me at

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.560 
much ambient light if you can see me at
all<00:04:32.030> but<00:04:32.450> I'm<00:04:32.570> gonna<00:04:32.660> go<00:04:32.840> bang<00:04:33.260> bang<00:04:33.760> bang<00:04:34.760> bang

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
all but I'm gonna go bang bang bang bang

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.690 
all but I'm gonna go bang bang bang bang
you<00:04:36.110> can<00:04:36.260> see<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.950> I'm<00:04:37.070> actually<00:04:37.310> being

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
you can see that I'm actually being

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.280 
you can see that I'm actually being
exposed<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:38.960> now<00:04:39.230> this<00:04:40.100> is<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.310> timing<00:04:40.670> thing

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
exposed so now this is a timing thing

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.140 
exposed so now this is a timing thing
we're<00:04:42.290> going<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.590> very<00:04:43.130> quickly<00:04:43.370> open<00:04:44.120> the

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
we're going to very quickly open the

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.030 
we're going to very quickly open the
shutter<00:04:44.480> in<00:04:44.690> bold<00:04:44.990> mode<00:04:45.290> as<00:04:45.590> soon<00:04:45.830> as<00:04:45.950> that

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
shutter in bold mode as soon as that

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.890 
shutter in bold mode as soon as that
shutters<00:04:46.430> open<00:04:46.880> I'm<00:04:47.030> going<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.330> burst<00:04:47.630> the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
shutters open I'm going to burst the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.720 
shutters open I'm going to burst the
balloon<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.440> then<00:04:48.890> the<00:04:49.070> shutter<00:04:49.280> will<00:04:49.460> close

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
balloon and then the shutter will close

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.360 
balloon and then the shutter will close
and<00:04:50.000> we'll<00:04:50.180> create<00:04:50.330> an<00:04:50.630> exposure<00:04:51.080> one<00:04:51.890> two

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
and we'll create an exposure one two

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.100 
and we'll create an exposure one two
three<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:54.730> you<00:04:55.730> can<00:04:56.210> probably<00:04:56.450> see<00:04:56.870> the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
three and you can probably see the

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.840 
three and you can probably see the
expression<00:04:57.620> on<00:04:57.710> my<00:04:57.770> face<00:04:57.920> of<00:04:58.370> balloon<00:04:58.610> going

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
expression on my face of balloon going

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.290 
expression on my face of balloon going
off<00:04:59.120> in<00:04:59.270> my<00:04:59.300> left<00:04:59.630> ear<00:05:00.050> but<00:05:00.470> hopefully<00:05:01.180> you<00:05:02.180> can

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
off in my left ear but hopefully you can

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.010 
off in my left ear but hopefully you can
see<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.750> balloon<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.230> about<00:05:03.350> half<00:05:03.740> way<00:05:05.020> undone

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
see the balloon is about half way undone

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.100 
see the balloon is about half way undone
blown<00:05:06.830> as<00:05:07.040> it<00:05:07.190> were<00:05:07.340> and<00:05:07.700> if<00:05:08.660> we<00:05:08.810> think<00:05:08.960> about

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
blown as it were and if we think about

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.640 
blown as it were and if we think about
it

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
it

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.650 
it
we<00:05:09.950> can<00:05:10.160> use<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.670> position<00:05:11.270> of<00:05:11.390> the

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
we can use the position of the

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.600 
we can use the position of the
microphone<00:05:12.350> there's<00:05:12.980> a<00:05:13.100> very<00:05:13.310> accurate

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
microphone there's a very accurate

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.930 
microphone there's a very accurate
timing<00:05:14.390> mechanism<00:05:15.260> to<00:05:15.710> figure<00:05:16.010> out<00:05:16.220> wow<00:05:16.580> what

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
timing mechanism to figure out wow what

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.610 
timing mechanism to figure out wow what
if<00:05:17.060> I<00:05:17.180> want<00:05:17.420> to<00:05:17.540> capture<00:05:17.780> an<00:05:18.080> image<00:05:18.320> of<00:05:18.500> the

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
if I want to capture an image of the

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.130 
if I want to capture an image of the
balloon<00:05:18.920> only<00:05:19.730> just<00:05:20.210> as<00:05:20.360> it's<00:05:20.540> beginning<00:05:20.990> to

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
balloon only just as it's beginning to

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.380 
balloon only just as it's beginning to
burst<00:05:21.500> so<00:05:22.040> let's<00:05:22.310> try<00:05:22.610> that<00:05:22.640> we'll<00:05:23.120> do<00:05:23.270> it

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
burst so let's try that we'll do it

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.750 
burst so let's try that we'll do it
again<00:05:23.480> and<00:05:23.870> this<00:05:24.380> time<00:05:24.440> I'm<00:05:25.070> going<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:25.460> hold

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
again and this time I'm going to hold

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.290 
again and this time I'm going to hold
the<00:05:26.000> microphone<00:05:26.350> in<00:05:27.350> my<00:05:27.410> fingers<00:05:28.280> very<00:05:28.970> very

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
the microphone in my fingers very very

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.450 
the microphone in my fingers very very
close<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:29.990> balloon<00:05:30.290> so<00:05:30.740> this<00:05:30.950> time<00:05:31.220> when<00:05:31.430> I

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
close to the balloon so this time when I

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.460 
close to the balloon so this time when I
prick<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:31.910> balloon<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.660> exposure<00:05:33.080> will<00:05:33.350> be

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
prick the balloon the exposure will be

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.330 
prick the balloon the exposure will be
made<00:05:33.680> probably<00:05:34.460> only<00:05:35.410> you<00:05:36.410> know<00:05:36.470> far<00:05:37.100> less

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
made probably only you know far less

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.580 
made probably only you know far less
than<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.610> millisecond<00:05:38.360> so<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:39.080> balloon<00:05:39.350> will

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
than a millisecond so the balloon will

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.550 
than a millisecond so the balloon will
be<00:05:39.710> only<00:05:40.550> just<00:05:41.090> opening<00:05:41.570> up<00:05:41.690> as<00:05:41.840> I<00:05:42.020> prick<00:05:42.290> it<00:05:42.440> so

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
be only just opening up as I prick it so

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.440 
be only just opening up as I prick it so
if<00:05:42.680> we<00:05:42.770> turn<00:05:42.950> the<00:05:43.130> lights<00:05:43.340> off<00:05:43.490> again<00:05:43.850> we'll<00:05:44.330> do

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
if we turn the lights off again we'll do

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.650 
if we turn the lights off again we'll do
a<00:05:44.480> test<00:05:44.720> exposure<00:05:45.260> bang<00:05:45.800> it's<00:05:46.400> still<00:05:46.700> going<00:05:47.090> so

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
a test exposure bang it's still going so

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.080 
a test exposure bang it's still going so
now<00:05:47.900> this<00:05:48.110> time<00:05:48.170> I'm<00:05:48.620> going<00:05:48.920> to<00:05:49.040> try<00:05:49.310> and<00:05:49.640> prick

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
now this time I'm going to try and prick

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.910 
now this time I'm going to try and prick
the<00:05:50.210> balloon<00:05:50.300> just<00:05:50.750> above<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.140> microphone<00:05:51.620> so

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
the balloon just above the microphone so

00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:02.530 
the balloon just above the microphone so
we<00:05:52.010> can<00:05:52.190> see<00:05:52.490> one<00:05:53.060> two<00:05:53.660> three

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.380 

if<00:06:02.840> we<00:06:02.930> turn<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:03.230> lights<00:06:03.410> on<00:06:03.590> once<00:06:03.860> more

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
if we turn the lights on once more

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.050 
if we turn the lights on once more
because<00:06:05.390> I<00:06:05.510> need<00:06:05.720> to<00:06:05.960> find<00:06:06.590> my<00:06:06.800> stuff<00:06:07.160> one<00:06:07.820> more

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
because I need to find my stuff one more

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.810 
because I need to find my stuff one more
balloon<00:06:08.270> I'm<00:06:09.080> going<00:06:10.040> to<00:06:10.160> put<00:06:10.310> the<00:06:10.430> microphone

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
balloon I'm going to put the microphone

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.780 
balloon I'm going to put the microphone
further<00:06:11.750> away<00:06:12.170> now<00:06:12.470> so<00:06:13.190> that<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.520> balloon

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
further away now so that the balloon

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.590 
further away now so that the balloon
will<00:06:14.030> almost<00:06:14.300> be<00:06:14.720> entirely<00:06:15.610> unraveled<00:06:16.610> by<00:06:17.540> the

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
will almost be entirely unraveled by the

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.480 
will almost be entirely unraveled by the
time<00:06:17.960> that<00:06:18.140> sound<00:06:18.410> gets<00:06:18.680> to<00:06:18.860> it<00:06:18.950> so<00:06:19.130> it's<00:06:19.280> going

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
time that sound gets to it so it's going

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.790 
time that sound gets to it so it's going
to<00:06:19.610> be<00:06:19.760> approximately<00:06:20.180> 2<00:06:20.900> feet<00:06:20.930> away<00:06:21.320> from<00:06:21.500> the

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
to be approximately 2 feet away from the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.980 
to be approximately 2 feet away from the
balloon<00:06:22.100> now<00:06:22.130> and<00:06:22.820> we'll<00:06:23.060> try<00:06:23.270> one<00:06:23.510> more<00:06:23.660> time

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
balloon now and we'll try one more time

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.020 
balloon now and we'll try one more time
for<00:06:24.260> our<00:06:24.350> third<00:06:24.590> exposure<00:06:25.100> and<00:06:25.430> hopefully

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
for our third exposure and hopefully

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.670 
for our third exposure and hopefully
this<00:06:26.240> time<00:06:26.480> we'll<00:06:26.540> see<00:06:27.260> the<00:06:27.410> balloon

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
this time we'll see the balloon

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.950 
this time we'll see the balloon
completely<00:06:28.430> unraveled<00:06:29.300> so<00:06:30.050> one<00:06:30.830> two<00:06:31.310> three

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
completely unraveled so one two three

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.340 
completely unraveled so one two three
and<00:06:34.150> with<00:06:35.150> a<00:06:35.180> bit<00:06:35.360> of<00:06:35.390> luck<00:06:35.690> you'll<00:06:35.930> see<00:06:36.170> that

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
and with a bit of luck you'll see that

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.190 
and with a bit of luck you'll see that
that<00:06:36.530> image<00:06:36.740> is<00:06:37.040> is<00:06:37.270> what<00:06:38.270> we<00:06:38.390> expected<00:06:39.080> and

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
that image is is what we expected and

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.490 
that image is is what we expected and
it's<00:06:40.070> that<00:06:40.340> simple<00:06:40.640> and<00:06:41.060> this<00:06:41.900> is<00:06:42.050> a<00:06:42.080> really

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
it's that simple and this is a really

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.730 
it's that simple and this is a really
great<00:06:42.680> fun<00:06:43.270> fundraising<00:06:44.270> thing<00:06:44.510> if<00:06:44.840> you<00:06:45.560> want

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
great fun fundraising thing if you want

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.620 
great fun fundraising thing if you want
to<00:06:45.830> shoot<00:06:46.010> photographs<00:06:46.610> of<00:06:46.820> people<00:06:46.880> bursting

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
to shoot photographs of people bursting

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.150 
to shoot photographs of people bursting
balloons<00:06:47.990> right<00:06:48.290> by<00:06:48.440> their<00:06:48.650> face<00:06:48.860> for<00:06:49.070> a

balloons right by their face for a

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.340 
balloons right by their face for a
dollar<00:06:49.370> at<00:06:49.550> a<00:06:49.640> time<00:06:49.670> it's<00:06:50.360> really<00:06:50.690> fun<00:06:50.930> kids

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
dollar at a time it's really fun kids

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.240 
dollar at a time it's really fun kids
love<00:06:51.680> doing<00:06:51.860> it<00:06:52.840> that's<00:06:53.840> the<00:06:54.050> last<00:06:54.260> example<00:06:55.070> we

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
love doing it that's the last example we

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.850 
love doing it that's the last example we
know<00:06:56.210> that<00:06:56.240> physics<00:06:56.870> is<00:06:57.050> a<00:06:57.080> beautiful<00:06:57.590> thing

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
know that physics is a beautiful thing

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.760 
know that physics is a beautiful thing
well<00:06:58.400> so<00:06:59.300> is<00:06:59.480> the<00:06:59.630> stop<00:06:59.900> shot<00:07:00.170> and<00:07:00.380> the<00:07:00.530> stop

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
well so is the stop shot and the stop

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.450 
well so is the stop shot and the stop
shot<00:07:01.040> gives<00:07:01.340> you<00:07:01.490> absolute<00:07:02.360> precision<00:07:02.900> timing

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
shot gives you absolute precision timing

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.440 
shot gives you absolute precision timing
capability<00:07:04.460> in<00:07:04.580> terms<00:07:04.850> of<00:07:05.030> programming

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
capability in terms of programming

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.540 
capability in terms of programming
delays<00:07:05.960> so<00:07:06.620> you're<00:07:06.800> not<00:07:06.890> adjusting

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
delays so you're not adjusting

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.640 
delays so you're not adjusting
microphones<00:07:08.300> by<00:07:08.600> inches<00:07:08.960> or<00:07:09.140> feet<00:07:09.350> or

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
microphones by inches or feet or

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.340 
microphones by inches or feet or
whatever<00:07:10.490> but<00:07:10.970> here<00:07:11.180> we<00:07:11.330> have<00:07:11.540> a<00:07:11.780> controller

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.350 
whatever but here we have a controller

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.560 
whatever but here we have a controller
where<00:07:12.650> we<00:07:12.770> can<00:07:12.950> dial<00:07:13.280> precision<00:07:14.180> down<00:07:14.390> to

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
where we can dial precision down to

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.140 
where we can dial precision down to
literally<00:07:15.110> tens<00:07:15.500> of<00:07:15.710> microseconds<00:07:16.100> so<00:07:16.670> what

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
literally tens of microseconds so what

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.610 
literally tens of microseconds so what
what<00:07:17.630> I'm<00:07:17.720> going<00:07:17.900> to<00:07:17.960> do<00:07:18.110> for<00:07:18.290> this<00:07:18.380> last

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 
what I'm going to do for this last

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.590 
what I'm going to do for this last
demonstration<00:07:18.980> is<00:07:19.700> have<00:07:19.970> the<00:07:20.090> microphone

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600 
demonstration is have the microphone

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.020 
demonstration is have the microphone
right<00:07:20.930> next<00:07:21.260> to<00:07:21.380> the<00:07:21.530> balloon<00:07:21.860> which<00:07:22.640> is<00:07:22.670> going

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.030 
right next to the balloon which is going

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.780 
right next to the balloon which is going
to<00:07:23.240> hear<00:07:23.870> the<00:07:24.080> explosion<00:07:24.800> instantaneously

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:25.790 
to hear the explosion instantaneously

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.430 
to hear the explosion instantaneously
but<00:07:26.150> we're<00:07:26.300> going<00:07:26.480> to<00:07:26.600> dial<00:07:26.900> a<00:07:27.110> two

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 
but we're going to dial a two

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.070 
but we're going to dial a two
millisecond<00:07:28.190> delay<00:07:28.310> into<00:07:29.090> the<00:07:29.210> stop<00:07:29.450> shot<00:07:29.720> so

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 
millisecond delay into the stop shot so

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.260 
millisecond delay into the stop shot so
rather<00:07:30.320> than<00:07:30.650> time<00:07:31.400> traveling<00:07:32.030> to<00:07:32.180> the

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
rather than time traveling to the

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.760 
rather than time traveling to the
microphone<00:07:32.720> the<00:07:32.900> delay<00:07:33.170> is<00:07:33.350> actually<00:07:33.650> going

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:33.770 
microphone the delay is actually going

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.920 
microphone the delay is actually going
to<00:07:33.890> be<00:07:33.950> incorporated<00:07:34.610> by<00:07:34.730> the<00:07:34.760> stop<00:07:35.150> shot<00:07:35.420> to

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
to be incorporated by the stop shot to

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.750 
to be incorporated by the stop shot to
millisecond<00:07:36.560> delay<00:07:36.680> so<00:07:37.160> let's<00:07:37.370> see<00:07:37.550> what<00:07:37.670> we

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:37.760 
millisecond delay so let's see what we

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:50.629 
millisecond delay so let's see what we
get<00:07:37.910> this<00:07:38.090> time<00:07:43.180> one<00:07:44.180> two<00:07:44.750> three

00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:55.700 

so<00:07:51.569> you<00:07:51.629> can<00:07:51.960> use<00:07:53.569> microphone<00:07:54.710> positioning

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:55.710 
so you can use microphone positioning

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.640 
so you can use microphone positioning
for<00:07:55.949> timing<00:07:56.330> or<00:07:57.330> more<00:07:57.750> precisely<00:07:57.990> you<00:07:58.469> can

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:58.650 
for timing or more precisely you can

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.999 
for timing or more precisely you can
dial<00:07:59.129> in<00:07:59.370> delays<00:07:59.819> into<00:08:00.270> the<00:08:00.689> stop<00:08:01.020> shot<00:08:01.319> very

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:02.009 
dial in delays into the stop shot very

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:03.950 
dial in delays into the stop shot very
very<00:08:02.280> conveniently<00:08:02.939> via<00:08:03.270> these<00:08:03.479> up/down

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960 
very conveniently via these up/down

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.230 
very conveniently via these up/down
buttons<00:08:04.669> incrementing<00:08:05.669> the<00:08:05.819> delay<00:08:06.090> or

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 
buttons incrementing the delay or

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.240 
buttons incrementing the delay or
decrementing<00:08:06.780> the<00:08:06.930> delay<00:08:07.199> etc<00:08:07.379> it's<00:08:07.860> a<00:08:07.919> very

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.250 
decrementing the delay etc it's a very

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.100 
decrementing the delay etc it's a very
very<00:08:08.550> configurable<00:08:09.210> and<00:08:09.389> easy-to-use<00:08:09.750> system
