 Let's see the butter and let's keep this 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.640
 butter with the sugar until the 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.050

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.180
 have such a consistent mixture 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.479
 You're seeing us, we're going to start 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.820

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.240
 of wheat we will lose the wheat flour 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.759
 and put our mix and began to have 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.040
 the chocolate has to be stopped then 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.800
 it can melt in the water bath or you 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.590
 can melt in the microwave by 10 out of 10 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.509
