the back of it and this gives a lovely

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.670 
the back of it and this gives a lovely
stand-up<00:00:17.580> structure<00:00:18.180> but<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.750> great<00:00:19.320> crush

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
stand-up structure but a great crush

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.710 
stand-up structure but a great crush
ability<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.400> resilience<00:00:20.970> it'll<00:00:21.240> bounce<00:00:21.359> back

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
ability and resilience it'll bounce back

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.650 
ability and resilience it'll bounce back
it's<00:00:22.439> quite<00:00:22.980> amazing<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:24.150> squidge<00:00:24.480> it

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it's quite amazing so you can squidge it

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.480 
it's quite amazing so you can squidge it
through<00:00:25.019> when<00:00:25.650> you're<00:00:25.769> turning<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.310> bag

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
through when you're turning a bag

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.160 
through when you're turning a bag
through<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> right<00:00:27.150> side<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.810> turn

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
through to the right side you can turn

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.050 
through to the right side you can turn
it<00:00:28.349> through<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> very<00:00:29.220> small<00:00:29.550> gap<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.820> your

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it through a very small gap in your

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.220 
it through a very small gap in your
lining<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:31.500> will<00:00:31.679> spring<00:00:32.009> back<00:00:32.570> with<00:00:33.570> very

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
lining and it will spring back with very

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.049 
lining and it will spring back with very
minor<00:00:34.559> creasing<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.100> don't<00:00:35.280> even<00:00:35.460> know<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
minor creasing I don't even know if the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.350 
minor creasing I don't even know if the
camera<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.510> picking<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:37.050> up<00:00:37.520> but<00:00:38.520> once

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
camera is picking that up but once

you don't want to be sowing a cardboard

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.250 
you don't want to be sowing a cardboard
box<00:01:11.189> which<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.420> happens<00:01:12.750> when<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.080> use

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
box which is what happens when you use

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.960 
box which is what happens when you use
very<00:01:13.680> rigid<00:01:14.810> interfacing<00:01:16.520> which<00:01:17.520> case<00:01:17.790> they

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
very rigid interfacing which case they

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.580 
very rigid interfacing which case they
look<00:01:18.119> great<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> lot<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.320> hard

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
look great but there are a lot of hard

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.520 
look great but there are a lot of hard
work<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.970> by<00:01:21.619> just<00:01:22.619> fusing<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:24.780> two<00:01:25.049> layers<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
work so by just fusing the two layers of

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.440 
work so by just fusing the two layers of
this<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.070> you're<00:01:26.549> getting<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.880> flatness<00:01:27.420> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
this on you're getting the flatness of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.960 
this on you're getting the flatness of
the<00:01:27.689> s<00:01:28.380> 320<00:01:29.450> with<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> bounce<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:32.729> wadding

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the s 320 with the bounce of the wadding

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.539 
the s 320 with the bounce of the wadding
or<00:01:33.720> fusible<00:01:34.500> fleece<00:01:34.680> depending<00:01:35.460> which

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
or fusible fleece depending which

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.550 
or fusible fleece depending which
country<00:01:36.000> you're<00:01:36.150> in

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
country you're in

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.370 
country you're in
so<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.009> pressing<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.570> top<00:01:40.049> gear<00:01:40.320> I

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
so I'm just pressing that top gear I

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.630 
so I'm just pressing that top gear I
won't<00:01:40.560> bother<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> bottom<00:01:41.400> I'll<00:01:41.490> get

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
won't bother with the bottom I'll get

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.780 
won't bother with the bottom I'll get
back<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.119> later

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
back to that later

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.420 
back to that later
but<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:45.990> gone<00:01:46.409> back<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
but you can see it's now gone back to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
but you can see it's now gone back to
being<00:01:47.670> quite<00:01:48.509> quite<00:01:48.780> flat<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.450> stop

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
being quite quite flat and if I stop

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.359 
being quite quite flat and if I stop
that<00:01:51.630> from<00:01:51.840> rolling<00:01:52.229> around<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> table<00:01:53.009> or

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
that from rolling around on the table or

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.539 
that from rolling around on the table or
popping<00:01:53.700> something<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.450> will<00:01:54.600> stand<00:01:54.930> up

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
popping something in it it will stand up

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.569 
popping something in it it will stand up
so<00:01:56.549> there<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:56.820> go<00:01:57.290> that's<00:01:58.290> violin<00:01:59.100> s<00:02:00.049> 320<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
so there we go that's violin s 320 and

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.880 
so there we go that's violin s 320 and
the<00:02:02.579> medium<00:02:03.090> wadding<00:02:03.680> that's<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.040> show<00:02:05.250> by
