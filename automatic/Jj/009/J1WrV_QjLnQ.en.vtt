big<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> market<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.470> bigger<00:00:34.680> than<00:00:34.830> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
big a market if not bigger than the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.540 
big a market if not bigger than the
United<00:00:35.370> States<00:00:35.900> given<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.620> environmental

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
United States given the environmental

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.950 
United States given the environmental
consciousness<00:00:39.290> in<00:00:40.370> Europe<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.780> higher

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
consciousness in Europe and the higher

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.740 
consciousness in Europe and the higher
cost<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.440> petroleum<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.670> shorter<00:00:45.300> distances

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
cost of petroleum the shorter distances

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.650 
cost of petroleum the shorter distances
for<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> most<00:00:46.200> part<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:48.240> we're<00:00:48.540> really

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660

excited to receive their cause now

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
excited to receive their cause now
what's<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.490> Tesla<00:01:00.120> proposition<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.080> are

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
what's the Tesla proposition what are

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.320 
what's the Tesla proposition what are
you<00:01:01.200> trying<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.530> say<00:01:01.650> with<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.070> car<00:01:02.370> well<00:01:03.150> the

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
you trying to say with this car well the

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.939 
you trying to say with this car well the
thing<00:01:03.870> that's<00:01:04.019> really<00:01:04.110> different<00:01:04.650> about

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
thing that's really different about

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.020 
thing that's really different about
Tesla<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.369> Testarossa<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.850> that

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
Tesla is that it's a Testarossa is that

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.280 
Tesla is that it's a Testarossa is that
its<00:01:09.180> performance<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> clean<00:01:10.020> conscience

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
its performance with a clean conscience

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.890 
its performance with a clean conscience
so<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.940> is<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.210> only<00:01:12.300> situation<00:01:12.600> where

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
so this is the only situation where

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.150 
so this is the only situation where
you've<00:01:13.050> got<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> high-performance<00:01:13.680> sports<00:01:13.860> car

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
you've got a high-performance sports car

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.490 
you've got a high-performance sports car
but<00:01:14.940> it's<00:01:15.060> also<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.750> most<00:01:15.810> environmentally

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
but it's also the most environmentally

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.930 
but it's also the most environmentally
friendly<00:01:16.830> car<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> road<00:01:17.370> it's<00:01:17.580> actually

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
friendly car in the road it's actually

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.800 
friendly car in the road it's actually
twice<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.110> efficiency<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.670> Prius<00:01:21.090> half<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
twice the efficiency of a Prius half the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.320 
twice the efficiency of a Prius half the
carbon<00:01:22.020> per<00:01:22.380> mile<00:01:22.909> despite<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> fact<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
carbon per mile despite the fact that

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.149 
carbon per mile despite the fact that
it's<00:01:24.540> high<00:01:24.659> form<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.020> sports<00:01:25.260> car<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
it's high form of sports car really I

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.590 
it's high form of sports car really I
can't<00:01:26.580> imagine<00:01:26.670> why<00:01:26.909> you'd<00:01:27.150> want<00:01:27.330> any<00:01:27.450> other

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
can't imagine why you'd want any other

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.230 
can't imagine why you'd want any other
sports<00:01:27.870> car<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.790> why<00:01:30.090> would

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
sports car because you know why would

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.990 
sports car because you know why would
you<00:01:30.360> want<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> lose<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> race<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.040> hurt<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
you want to lose a race and hurt the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.730 
you want to lose a race and hurt the
environment<00:01:33.110> which<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.230> essentially<00:01:34.650> were

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
environment which is essentially were

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.890 
environment which is essentially were
you<00:01:34.800> doing<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.010> other<00:01:35.159> car<00:01:35.720> now<00:01:36.720> you've

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
you doing with other car now you've

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.010 
you doing with other car now you've
launched<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.229> special<00:01:38.220> model<00:01:38.310> tonight<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:38.850> well

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
which is actually even higher

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.649 
which is actually even higher
performance<00:01:44.490> than<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.880> standard<00:01:45.210> rotors<00:01:45.510> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
performance than the standard rotors and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.020 
performance than the standard rotors and
this<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.870> actually<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> worldwide<00:01:47.030> unbaling

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
