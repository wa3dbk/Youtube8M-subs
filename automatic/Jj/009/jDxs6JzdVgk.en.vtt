00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:11.900
 only the epic moments of the 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.419
 videogames or very characteristic or 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.740
 singular among the most striking is this 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.810
 It was like some of the larger 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.820
 video game franchises are 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.650
 they turned in what they are outstanding 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.840
 one of the many scenes with lividities 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.960
 that exist there could be the possibility 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.300
 of spoilers are very well warned 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.550
 but still it does not get to the point of doing 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.849
 video and enjoyable and I hope that you 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.849
 like 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.490
 the last battle of racing is epic 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.410
 although it's very long but it's worth it 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.870
 this last second dance teaches us that 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.020
 he's fine bastard he 's actually in 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.090
 Japanese or be ridiculous this voice faith 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.520
 if you like animes like dragon ball 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.800
 you will love it and the enemy's speech 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.260
 it's awesome if we made a top 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.890
 discourses of villains this would win by 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.890
 much 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.950
 in more software effects the altruist 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.960
 space teaches us a very good intro 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.930
 and very interesting that it gives a turn 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.729
 of 360 degrees to the whole series in addition to 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.330
 give a point and separate to a great game that 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.780
 would be more effects the reapers do not know 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.409
 who gets in and at the end of this 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.909
 incredible sequence let's see how 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.970
 unfortunately our heroes 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.600
 carbonized by the atmosphere of this 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.159
 planet and that's why it stays with our 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.159
 position number 4 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.930
 04 in the final part of the master game 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.900
 chief fights against an alien 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.119
 of those over 100,000 years old 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.890
 everything is summarized in quicktime events but 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.140
 everything is worth it hard the master 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.300
 chief observing the earth for the last time 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.860
 in one of the most emotional scenes and 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.090
 incredible of all the saga of high low 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.880
 that's why they win the proposed 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.880
 number 3 and very well deserved 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.110
 8 2 and 3 in fact as you saw is a 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.959
 tie because in charter is a very good 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.780
 game but the most appreciable thing about this are 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.390
 your cardiac moments of action without 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.760
 doubt God likes to suffer the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.129
 poor trade the moments of action are 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.829
 as ridiculous as shocking seriously 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.620
 nobody except in this amount at 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.420
 I would survive so much hate in the world and 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.959
 That's why he keeps our position 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.959
 robert 2 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.430
 the pichi with an albino shows that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.340
 is fine and above all well pissed 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.960
 for wordpress we learn the intro more 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.830
 spectacular that I've seen the games 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.030
 It would be like at the beginning of the game 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.300
 It really is remarkable until the last 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.550
 cell of this scene the ambience the 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.820
 music makes you feel in a real 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:10.920
 war between the gods and the titans 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:12.990
 calm down today is just a video of searching 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.260
 of meteorite after click but the 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.700
 mediation is mother 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.700
 and that's why it's worth
