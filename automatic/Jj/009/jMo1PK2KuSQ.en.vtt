00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.120
 when you need minimum 2000 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.430
 to be able to train surely does not have for vitamins the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.080
 equal man qualified to the Beijing Olympics but to have a 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.849
 enormous distance with respect to his preparation engineer guzmán by 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.269
 politicians in my hand 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.150
 consist of gold 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
 the problem is that we are very behind 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:24.009
 the reality in Peru is hard and the sport does not escape from it 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.329
 constantino león is a clear example of the lack of support for sport 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.630
 we saw the countries that have qualified for the Olympics 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.989
 in fact they are not training and unknown country if they do not cooperate united states in 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.320
 some training camps 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.110
 of high performance not jun athletes who are going to go says that 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.040
 try it but you have no budget not to stipulate 1 bonus is prepared or 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.180
 not for sale of AIDS are bad fortis and classic 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.790
 the contrast of his home in huancayo where there were and so awards with 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.579
 the precariousness that is not proper of an athlete 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.210
 does not say much about how sports policy in Peru does not exist 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 we have all these 'green' efforts 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.430
 we have many many many resources 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.430
 if I do not miss fiction, it's a mistake to handle mti 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.470
 shape 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.820
 balanced moment 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.840
 Detroit and that is strange because of lack of 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.810
 Ministry of sport is not there and we are supported by different institutions 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.700
 and there is not a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 I trust a program that is other athletes in English and case 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.540
 we are quite because Ecuador brings us to ask 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.360
 imagine annual 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.590
 for it they surpass the 50 million dollars 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.460
 certainly the sport that is a country that for Peru will be a department 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.990
 i variety 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.250
 if they have navigation 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.670
 I hope that we in your last 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.570
 suddenly it's a couple of months in a month and a half ago 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.390
 it was heard 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.970
 but I can perform them olimpia that goes through your head with listens desc 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.170
 well look just was back from state there is the conference mark 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.300
 Press in Lima 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.780
 sadly and the president stable andoain that moment 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.990
 and it's time for menfis taro 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.209
 and I said look and variety was on the athletic track 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.379
 of this one in Aznar which is the first stage and everything is very confusing 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:15.519
 go figure 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.309
 nik we do not even have athletes we do not have scenarios 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:22.639
 we have not even organized a Pan-American 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.339
 no guide to 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:28.359
 we are the first steps to make in an organizer the Olympics in two 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:29.949
 unique is the most 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.699
 pons I think it's an absurd idea not 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.750
 Constantino's hunger for glory seems like the Lord 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.539
 let's hope that Medellin is enough and not 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.249
 you can already imagine more or less the day that is happening with the delegation 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.629
 represents more than 6000 lin 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.219
 so imagined and 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.219
 for me to make a discomfort murmur because a dream is fulfilled 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.549
 colque de portishead will tell you they were interested maximum not and I think that it is not 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:56.549
 trust not 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.069
 but my dream is fulfilled would go better 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.529
 bringing a medal to the country, but I would like to go 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:06.529
 in good shape but as you own conditions missing from the sme 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.429
 no you can not you can not you did not see adaptive of everything 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:16.079
 not even times more well and it also has to be two friends all or friends 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.069
 that have supported me until now, not then in mind 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.609
 efe to be here Catania the Kenyan who is supporting me 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.549
 the motto and concrete that the trainings 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.549
 they have very good experience of yes 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.989
 and to the whole country 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.989
 to the whole country to be in the Olympics 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.310
 I asked was going to transmit acquire in vivo more indirect than carolyn quedes 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:42.870
 transmits daily or make it more important because 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.019
 everyone will see 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.219
 I'm going to give 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:49.180
 percent of imitating power is like entering your first positions
