00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:22.880
 my time 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
 we will give you some little secrets of stone 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.199
 then percent 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.189
 but circuit it was not very pretty and may not be very 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.320
 simplified 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.420
 but that's the way to act against caen 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.740
 we try to make sure that you understand correctly when 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.750
 even 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.750
 and percent dead and assigned directly will attack by line 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.100
 It's done 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.840
 that is to say that when you press a button a door open and this 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.250
 wear them off 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.510
 as always more open 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.760
 there are plenty of applications on this secular system the door systems for the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.700
 games 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.400
 we can replace the torch starters for an illuminated winner 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.700
 and that's with this weapon 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.300
 a lot of possibilities 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.300
 in which case we can not wait to see below 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.370
 so that if dassault systems 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.650
 simple sum 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.800
 a bishop of tea-restaurant only accent of form 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.050
 ernesto morlacchi these are doors 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.460
 which memorizes an action 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.900
 especially as 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.900
 In fact I am happy that the spa has settled in 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.590
 I pray for them what they do not miss anything 20h05 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.340
 so that's what it's as simple as that it's a fortress shoot 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.430
 I think you've already seen a few flames about the restoration backhand of 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.260
 following to disappear yes now three years that I said in the first round 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.400
 by a victory this page turns 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400
 this book what he already masters world storytelling 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 these are some explanations to simplify your life 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.460
 so this door finally this obama memory has redit directly 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.460
 m at the door to open it 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.399
 and we'll do the same on the other side 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.419
 ok so the killing in memory in celebration 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.609
 the strong contraction 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.629
 in fact 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.889
 what will happen when you press the button 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.369
 the action is memorized because the button usually 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.159
 the purpose of the button is that the signal stops 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.540
 it's a signal of kiala that I have to do even an attack like with a 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.819
 policeman would have been a permanent signal 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.010
 what evidence 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.120
 finally what could I have put to it is simply that except 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.589
 factory 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:45.849
 may not have been specified automatically 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.939
 while the door remains a match 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.109
 Alas 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.670
 the Europeans relax to take the measure of the stake 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.670
 mechanic 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.929
 so here's that more and more control 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.719
 at this level when you press the button the door opens 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.899
 and she will stay open 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.179
 rs both open so it's because we want us what we want 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.019
 is concerned that an opening that can not afford 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.939
 so we're just going 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.179
 ferques 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.569
 one of the two doors is activated 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.329
 it is the disable the other automatically ie 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.409
 we will make a face automatically 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.409
 okay though 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.899
 so close to 0 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.699
 so the scion line-up 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.949
 Fortin Nar 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.189
 so we're actually assuming there 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:48.969
 the first door 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.969
 it is directly connected 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:55.859
 to the bizerte button 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.229
 when we are friends 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.229
 but directly you are from the second door 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.109
 so if I say can be useful when pressing a button no no 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.980
 not only to find an agreement 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.110
 which corresponds more or less but here too he closed the door 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.179
 that's exactly it 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:16.180
 but the series is not over because all that is not finished since 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.499
 when you press the other 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:21.009
 savard still open to go door 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.650
 so what are we going to do in his counters added 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.009
 another face 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.009
 we connected austria 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.520
 ok why you really need a little creak innovation 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.749
 it's not my case 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:39.599
 I feel a little 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.819
 and that's it 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.659
 the circuit is finished 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.659
 with all the subsidiaries 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.129
 the first portion of the track 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.819
 and the second can you shopping noting that you want it can not 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:53.520
 to walk on 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.979
 kyle striker 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.520
 but when we make a year of the coup 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.050
 for what other sport 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.620
 it's a game where I made it fast and easy 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.900
 if you've watched that you're astonishing wise paul ii 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.650
 and so you'll be able to make sure to make a piece of broken bones general 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:15.879
 that is, you will make a third button b this third button 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.479
 will zero the circuit automatically 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.830
 I will not deny because it would make more lends itself more fluid 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.669
 the corruption here 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.669
 the limit for what we can do 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.460
 it takes every their fortune on the background of suspicion or easy for me to hide 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.710
 then on another proposed nothing 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.710
 middle ages ayotte round to explain it a little 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.069
 several billion 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.599
 that would explain viewing the year once but has it for now the 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.599
 cause happened pretty clear 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.900
 well, listen, this is a turning point for me for change 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.870
 photo thing i will do everything for today 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.090
 and percent of our francs another coffin contract episode a little bit more 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.869
 complex 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:00.749
 these circulars will show how to do 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:04.199
 a door on two green bridges press a button a door opens 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.240
 antonetti on the button 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.509
 the door opens 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.169
 and finishes second 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.080
 it is clearly expected that if he surrendered 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.449
 more complex 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.499
 more searched than girls 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.069
 here are the fruits 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.340
 but we will make sure that it is clear good ok 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.070
 but a thunderclap signed for France if she says she is surprised by this 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.849
 article 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.849
 and then we end up with three projectors 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.650
 see you later 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:39.279
 and at this center just qualified with the ceases 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:46.139
 face to Croatia as soon as his only thing I see is that I let myself do 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.949
 according to m 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:52.360
 it's sad that linked to the virus to look for every taste it's not 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.449
 the only cause 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.409
 as at home it makes all the difference between East and West but 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:57.580
 two will circulate 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.479
 however this loss
