00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.109
 the test game of the year 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.269
 You do not question me because I 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.400
 liked to play the game is very fucking 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.030
 Good, it's very very good. I liked it a lot. 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.380
 also 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:21.990
 now I confess that I but I confess 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.150
 I had a strange feeling game 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.119
 I'm really enjoying the game, I like 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.640
 play it easy it's accessible it's beautiful 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.560
 but I have no ancient history 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.020
 I never went I just went through this 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.579
 since it was however playtime and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.890
 I also never liked the other one. 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.760
 play also found it easy was a shutter 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.570
 that made me like to play again 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.719
 multiplayer to be in this community 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.260
 online and down and took it for a 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.700
 promoted greater 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.680
 my motivation to play 10 in the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.690
 gameplay is not history 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.850
 know the story looks like a classic 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.559
 tale of good against evil but what she 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.449
 It seems to me more is that it is only a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.219
 the bottom, so it does not 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.250
 bring the planets to bring the scenery 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.930
 to count a little cloth 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 background what happened to yourself 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.330
 What story are you doing the missions? 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.100
 with your friends this is the great to great 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.750
 grace of the game is the story yourself 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.850
 build with who you 're playing with you, huh? 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 then I think it's genius of the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.210
 business because nobody here said more 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:28.020
 bad game without history the last 14 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.479
 years but I already like this descends and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.869
 for the first time in my life I 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.750
 I started to want to follow a 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.369
 face there that's not my friend 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.680
 the merger of Schutter with this thing that is 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.630
 crazy they were able to create from the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.110
 nothing so that matters when the band 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.950
 lost lost in the franchise revealed when 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:57.840
 went to 243 induction secrecy country 46 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.210
 48 July 6 the beginning were orphans them 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 created a masterpiece called river that is 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.490
 the ass and the guys now suddenly 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.229
 without that door we do not have 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.239
 To do nothing now we do not have to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.709
 to follow the mythology of income we do not have 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.080
 we create a new business we do not have to 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.240
 we will make 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.020
 and neither have the guys give this deal that 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.880
 is a perfect mix between campaign and 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.610
 multiplayer because if you want to play 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.190
 alone you play sheet if and there if you 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.810
 want to play with friends is cooler and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.850
 He's very made for it because you 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.220
 feel some missions on some maps 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.290
 that everything is organized to be 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.140
 a cooperative mission knows it's all a lot 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.490
 large is well spaced and the balance 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.410
 between the enemies you can see that she 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.180
 It will be more fun if you go with others. 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.700
 players I played cooperative missions 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.230
 and it gets much better his son is a 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.180
 A little like balls is a game 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.430
 that has a story a story up 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.230
 interestingly obtained such mixture 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.400
 elements of two genera in the case of 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.890
 shot with rpg 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.420
 but it's a game that has a lot more grace 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.040
 if you play against people like that 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.140
 appears until another game something else 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.530
 also think that it is a game with a 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.570
 budget of US $ 500 million is a 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.180
 again it's just a game that will leave and also 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.450
 you have options for you to create books 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.980
 you create series you create movies you 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.600
 has a whole universe to explore 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.519
 literally the whole universe to 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.920
 explore beyond the point here he is 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.860
 seeing the start of the business is the start is 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.500
 a proposal that the band brought has a lot 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.570
 of hayley inside than in games and saw the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.030
 character movement the style of the 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.280
 gun the balance between useful the game of 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.320
 shooting from a distance is the short distance 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.810
 with the mille you use a lot when 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.700
 use magic or not this is all very well 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.830
 balanced the bosses are very cool 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.140
 of reaching the end of missions and has 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.450
 Fucking giant boss there for you to kill 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.739
 alone with your friends have the campaign 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.030
 You have the missions for you to improve. 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.489
 your reputation 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.980
 There are a lot of nice things to stay. 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.010
 doing to not want to make the campaign 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.989
 now I'm going to keep making those 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.330
 missions that are emerging 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.239
 waiting for the public event that is the 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.310
 big deal the public event 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.130
 never in my life did i run 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.340
 behind public events the canela santa 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.200
 arriving at gap install it main item 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.239
 what makes people like this who 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.640
 usually do not like is simplicity 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.810
 the game is very simple you 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.310
 learn to play 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.350
 it is not because only the mechanics of shooting 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.780
 normal is not because it's easy for you 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.610
 know how it works and the menu is not 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.550
 things like you have to me 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.439
 already your character is a simplistic rpg 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.610
 You know how you can evolve your 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.949
 character with a very ease 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.500
 large you can move from the 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.319
 very easy way too so yes I 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.210
 I think it defines is giant to actvision 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.189
 with the band shows you a deal 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.719
 very great know very great 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.759
 a lot of people thought it was going to be the best 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:50.039
 Everyone's game because it has a history 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.199
 super deep science fiction like 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.659
 effect and is not it 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.580
 know is one is a proposal of super game 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.810
 that they will explore in the 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.520
 years, at least this is the 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.110
 feeling that you gave me and now 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.340
 trying to make the flash synonymous nÃ© 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.139
 is that it has more or less this cloth 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.449
 background for you to place present the 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.669
 mechanical in the system but it's cool that 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.830
 question you asked at the beginning of the public is 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.599
 the game of the year question we 're in 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.789
 September then two games comes to me 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.610
 goes as badly as I already said that I 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.639
 I found it very fun, very cool and odom. 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.500
 that kong country tropical frise that is 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.400
 that river game but there are other games 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.979
 coming here 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.689
 until I think that this union is the 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.090
 His best got a take back to 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.879
 reach the end of the year but the games that 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.779
 to come, I do not know if they will bring 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:36.509
 something like that 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:38.490
 different from innovative of interesting 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.229
 at a level that the deficit is bringing 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.629
 I think the game can be the game of 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.539
 year and by the end of the year things 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:47.400
 What's new is Murder's Creed. 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:51.779
 amazing country ball all in full size 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.789
 with a beautiful helmet to die such a 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.580
 technological revolution is the assassin's 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.270
 believe egg is the same is you already know 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.039
 what to expect 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.379
 You already know what to expect, I do not know if 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.199
 will have a mechanic there so innovative 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.370
 or multiplayer is that thing that in 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.719
 half a dozen plays 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.759
 It'll be good but it's not going to be this thing. 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:10.789
 What the fuck, look at the face? 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.349
 No, look what you can do to make a video game. 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.849
 different for me it's a lot of surprise 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.939
 because man was never a kick is the 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:20.219
 best match of the year exact ogx a trick 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:23.490
 It is changing the mind of those who do not 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:25.889
 likes and does not like multiplayer speaks for 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.680
 shutter card has schutter good stretch 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:35.550
 quiet that the request of friendship there I 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:39.469

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.469
