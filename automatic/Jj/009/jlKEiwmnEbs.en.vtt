00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:01.819
 good day 

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.630
 surely you have at home if sbu Terek 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.010
 and surely in this watch there is no eternal 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.790
 calendar 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.700
 no this linen 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.680
 the same ones in general of all those complication 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.440
 which we love so much on display 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.219
 expensive wrist watches 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.370
 and really 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.450
 why do we need to know that we live a leap year 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.080
 or what now is the full moon if we 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.940
 already slept for two hours at work 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.569
 Yuriev report 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:26.639
 the hours we use at home and 

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.649
 who do not seek to demonstrate 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:29.460
 around 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.390
 focused really the most 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.419
 important to most people 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:33.570
 functions 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.080
 the clock itself and the alarm clock 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.540
 why apatin tens and even hundreds of thousands 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.380
 dollars for features that we often 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.640
 do not need this topic of separate conversation 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.130
 and today to your attention 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.180
 presented immediately three models of wrist 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.840
 hours alarm clocks 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.570
 this is trouble 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.880
 bfa bank 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.850
 imars not yet settled 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.240
 single russia title sorry i 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.570
 I keep scheselj or as recommended 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.310
 official representatives budget 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.110
 victims and cults 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.810
 we will not compare this watch to 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.250
 Overall it will be subjective we 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.750
 comparable in terms of exactly 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.930
 alarm clocks 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.050
 Taranenko such simple criteria as 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.530
 the convenience of use 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.910
 call volume its duration 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.300
 Let's start with the fact that take care of implants 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.480
 use the same firm mechanism 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.360
 Attention 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.970
 respectively control method 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.800
 this clock is also the same 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.350
 It is interesting to note that in Moscow boutiques 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.350
 riga cost 7 thousand dollars more expensive bomb 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.880
 and if in the region today releases 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.700
 only two versions of this watch 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.650
 in white and yellow gold 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.680
 then it's time for you to be prolific 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.830
 at least 15 models of various designs 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.460
 for almost every taste 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.520
 so we are trying to set the alarm 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.210
 at 7 30 on all three models we start with 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.290
 perigee 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.290
 response time 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.700
 no one will be installed 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.420
 bottom right 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.710
 heads 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.200
 including u can 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.009
 and rotate counterclockwise until 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.329
 no faster time we need on the dial in 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.329
 around three o'clock 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.679
 after that activating the mechanism 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.789
 alarms by clicking on 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.599
 button on the left 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.760
 at this competition of readers salary 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.239
 indicators appear reason 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.389
 single window alarm clock 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.449
 level plants spring alarm clock we 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.529
 can control remains the mainland 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.279
 blood clot which is at the level 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.459
 ten twelve o'clock 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.239
 in this case, you need to make an alarm clock 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.419
 with heads 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:37.779
 which simultaneously starts the clock itself 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.639
 also will not start by 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.639
 winding systems on time wearing 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.989
 we will now be to this maximum 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.299
 hijacking screw up hundreds 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.109
 thousands contains 10 atmospheres 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.390
 but in this case itâ€™s rather a minus 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.830
 swim in the watch on crocodile strap we 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.789
 we will not 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:05.749
 but additional inconvenience 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.409
 setting the alarm is provided to us 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.419
 although you can buy a day for this model 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.729
 kuchukov strap 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.979
 In general, the installation is absolutely logical 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.679
 money 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:18.589
 only the alarm indicator 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.309
 here is an arrow 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.159
 when the alarm clock is on 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.479
 points to a bell 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.099
 You can summarize that the idea would be a couple 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.379
 it becomes easy enough 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.700
 not as much as you can enjoy 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.969
 water protection 10 atmospheres 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:37.859
 but this watch comes with 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.429
 rubber bag 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:41.489
 with a very simple replacement system not 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.749
 requiring instrument 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:45.749
 iphone standard locking system 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:49.199
 buttons is called compression key 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.759
 it is required to turn a head 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.559
 this key is half a turn 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:55.199
 with a white arrow on the key 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.389
 indicate that the opening control 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.869
 laughing at two red arrows camping 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:01.309
 indicating the direction of closure 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:02.769
 keys 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.569
 will set the top right 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.979
 head 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.429
 for convenience on different sides 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:09.710
 public key of this head 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.290
 David's inscriptions are visible 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.359
 me to you 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.760
 date and alarm clock 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.540
 so that the owner could navigate to 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.540
 what case where the head spin 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.539
 pulling the head 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.879
 and twisted counterclockwise in 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.110
 direction of the Alan inscription 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.250
 the alarm is set in the window 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.419
 occupying about a quarter the figure was 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.689
 there 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.049
 when installed in this window rotates immediately 

00:04:34.049 --> 00:04:36.770
 two hours and minutes 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.360
 in this case, nand needs to be combined 7 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.059
 hours 30 minutes 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:42.979
 speed lines by which is determined 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.979
 alarm time 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.969
 nominees 10 division very small 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:50.729
 restore alarm more or less 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.279
 you can only interestingly fifteen 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.279
 minutes at mark 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.559
 There is one more inconvenience 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.629
 the arrow overlaps both drives every hour 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.710
 for a few minutes 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.020
 and the hour hand overlaps the minutes 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.009
 disk twice a day 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.430
 approximately from 8 41 7 to 10 15 in the morning and in the evening 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.229
 setting an alarm clock howl at intervals 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.229
 only happen so to say on vegetables 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.199
 alarm off indicator on 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.319
 the dial is not here 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:25.369
 alarm activation is determined by 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:26.919
 the position of the button rocker 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.159
 located on the left 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.509
 alarm on button position 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.930
 you can see red 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.740
 in fact, it is clearly visible when 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.339
 the clock is on hand 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:40.129
 also there are no level indicators 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:42.499
 alarm factory and it will not be forgotten 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:43.919
 automatic winding system 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.499
 time to wear 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:47.609
 therefore, the zenith must be turned on separately 

00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:49.379
 upper right head until it stops 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:52.139
 about 40 rotations 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.210
 head diameter decent myself 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.139
 wide head convenient for coverage 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.189
 so decide big is created 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:59.769
 and we must be careful not to 

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:02.969
 cut off the children and not break honest 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:04.879
 now listen to calls 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.169
 so grigyan 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:13.529
 Yushchenko holding back tears the law 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:16.529
 prohibiting 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:21.219
 also Yanukovych knowledgeable uniform 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:29.710
 still 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.710
 the man 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.330
 we will call you every region 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.219
 what to expect 

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:55.219
 and finally culture 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.030
 higher culture is more pure and 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.080
 voiced 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.139
 and this is due to the fact that 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.479
 diameter of the mechanism is 10 36 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:19.689
 millimeters 

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:23.199
 and the outer diameter of the case is 46 millimeters 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.120
 inside of course smaller but still 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.080
 between the body mechanism 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.490
 there is enough space which 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.490
 used to amplify the sound 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:34.749
 I wonder what is the duration 

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:36.449
 call in all three hours approximately 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:38.159
 matches and is about 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:40.389
 eighteen seconds 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:42.099
 I hope you now have some 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:43.719
 idea of â€‹â€‹what is 

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:45.409
 the violation will be like that 

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:46.860
 function 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.509
 and you can draw conclusions about 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:50.699
 the expediency of their acquisition in their 

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:51.929
 collection 

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:54.029
 With you was Dmitri Kruglov company 

00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:55.360
 watchmakers good luck
