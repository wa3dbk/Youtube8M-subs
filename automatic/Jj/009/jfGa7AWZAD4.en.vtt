00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.290
 strange movements it distracted me and 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:31.730

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.700
 dance seemed superficial and very 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.370
 a lot of extra gestures 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.370
 excessive mimicry did not replace the technique 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.330
 show yourself on choreography as an adult 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.330

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.109
 exhale a little and interrupt but what 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.640

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.160
