00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.240 

so<00:02:41.600> after<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.050> files<00:02:42.290> are<00:02:42.500> copied<00:02:42.860> over<00:02:43.100> to

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
so after the files are copied over to

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.790 
so after the files are copied over to
your<00:02:43.370> adb<00:02:43.850> tools<00:02:44.240> folder<00:02:44.480> we<00:02:44.960> need<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.260> open<00:02:45.710> a

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
your adb tools folder we need to open a

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.460 
your adb tools folder we need to open a
command<00:02:45.950> prompt<00:02:46.400> window<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.780> go<00:02:48.050> ahead<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.380> do

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
command prompt window so go ahead and do

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.230 
command prompt window so go ahead and do
that<00:02:51.280> then<00:02:52.280> once<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.610> command<00:02:52.940> prompt<00:02:53.180> window

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
that then once the command prompt window

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.750 
that then once the command prompt window
is<00:02:53.540> open<00:02:53.900> we<00:02:54.020> need<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.350> navigate<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.340> adb

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
is open we need to navigate to the adb

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:05.440 
is open we need to navigate to the adb
tools<00:02:56.090> folder<00:03:03.520> so<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.700> first<00:03:04.940> command<00:03:05.300> you're

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
tools folder so the first command you're

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.150 
tools folder so the first command you're
going<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.780> do<00:03:05.900> once<00:03:06.140> you've<00:03:06.290> accessed<00:03:06.890> your

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
going to do once you've accessed your

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.330 
going to do once you've accessed your
adb<00:03:08.030> tools<00:03:08.330> folder<00:03:08.570> is<00:03:08.930> we're<00:03:09.680> going<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:09.950> flash

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
adb tools folder is we're going to flash

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.449 
adb tools folder is we're going to flash
the<00:03:11.060> stock<00:03:11.450> boot<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.830> you<00:03:12.890> follow<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
should say ok so for the next line of

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.610 
should say ok so for the next line of
command<00:03:19.940> we're<00:03:20.239> going<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.660> flash<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.260> stock

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
system image and we basically do the

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.420 
system image and we basically do the
same<00:03:24.830> thing<00:03:25.250> as<00:03:25.400> as<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:26.180> boot<00:03:26.810> image<00:03:27.280> once<00:03:28.280> it

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
same thing as as the boot image once it

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.140 
same thing as as the boot image once it
says<00:03:28.610> ok<00:03:29.060> your<00:03:29.570> get<00:03:30.050> flash<00:03:30.350> successfully<00:03:31.160> we

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
says ok your get flash successfully we

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.030 
says ok your get flash successfully we
need<00:03:32.300> to<00:03:32.450> repeat<00:03:32.870> these<00:03:33.050> steps<00:03:33.110> for<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.770> next

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
need to repeat these steps for the next

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.650 
need to repeat these steps for the next
two<00:03:34.190> images<00:03:34.520> which<00:03:35.060> are<00:03:35.239> going<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.570> be

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
two images which are going to be

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.380 
two images which are going to be
recovery<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.410> user<00:03:36.620> data<00:03:37.060> ok<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:38.120> after

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
recovery and user data ok so after

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.900 
recovery and user data ok so after
you've<00:03:38.720> entered<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.530> last<00:03:40.370> line<00:03:40.700> which<00:03:40.880> is

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
you've entered the last line which is

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.759 
you've entered the last line which is
the<00:03:41.180> user<00:03:41.420> data<00:03:41.750> image<00:03:42.620> file<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.910> should<00:03:44.150> see

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
the user data image file you should see

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.050 
the user data image file you should see
everything<00:03:45.769> says<00:03:45.980> ok<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.640> it<00:03:46.850> should

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
everything says ok and it should

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.210 
everything says ok and it should
basically<00:03:47.360> look<00:03:47.840> exactly<00:03:48.410> like<00:03:48.440> my<00:03:48.860> command

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
basically look exactly like my command

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.300 
basically look exactly like my command
window<00:03:49.489> does<00:03:49.670> here<00:03:50.380> so<00:03:51.380> if<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.650> does<00:03:51.830> we<00:03:52.010> can<00:03:52.160> go

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
window does here so if it does we can go

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.680 
window does here so if it does we can go
on<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.730> do<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.600> erase<00:03:54.410> cash-poor<00:03:55.250> portion<00:03:55.790> ok

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690
