00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.310 

do<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.570> think<00:04:51.810> it's<00:04:51.930> actually<00:04:52.200> the

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
do you think it's actually the

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.710 
do you think it's actually the
pesticides<00:04:52.830> because<00:04:53.090> there's<00:04:54.090> no<00:04:54.210> not<00:04:54.570> really

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
pesticides because there's no not really

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.600 
pesticides because there's no not really
major<00:04:55.260> research<00:04:55.590> here<00:04:55.860> it's<00:04:56.100> something<00:04:56.400> you

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
major research here it's something you

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.070 
major research here it's something you
found<00:04:56.850> after<00:04:57.210> they<00:04:57.330> sprayed<00:04:57.600> with<00:04:57.750> ice<00:04:57.870> which

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
found after they sprayed with ice which

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.490 
found after they sprayed with ice which
is<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.200> possibility<00:04:58.620> I<00:04:59.040> think<00:04:59.730> so<00:04:59.910> because

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
is a possibility I think so because

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.270 
is a possibility I think so because
there<00:05:01.500> doesn't<00:05:01.770> seem<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:01.920> be<00:05:01.980> any<00:05:02.160> other

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
there doesn't seem to be any other

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.920 
there doesn't seem to be any other
explanation<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:03.060> me<00:05:03.180> from<00:05:03.300> what<00:05:03.360> I<00:05:03.510> saw<00:05:03.810> and
