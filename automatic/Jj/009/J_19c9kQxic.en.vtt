00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.519 

I<00:00:01.190> am<00:00:02.190> Java<00:00:02.490> scope<00:00:02.959> encounter<00:00:03.959> it's<00:00:04.080> finished

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
I am Java scope encounter it's finished

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.049 
I am Java scope encounter it's finished
so<00:00:06.230> today<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.259> want<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.649> do<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.830> demonstration<00:00:08.130> to

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
so today I want to do a demonstration to

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.519 
so today I want to do a demonstration to
show<00:00:09.090> how<00:00:10.019> our<00:00:10.050> energy<00:00:11.240> extends<00:00:12.240> beyond<00:00:15.529> so

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
show how our energy extends beyond so

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.500 
show how our energy extends beyond so
you<00:00:16.619> can<00:00:16.920> picture<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.789> energy<00:00:18.300> field

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
you can picture that this energy field

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.230 
you can picture that this energy field
is<00:00:18.779> much<00:00:19.020> larger<00:00:19.650> then

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
is much larger then

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.320 
is much larger then
we<00:00:22.200> don't<00:00:22.470> end<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:22.950> our<00:00:23.160> body<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.030> are<00:00:24.120> not

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
we don't end at our body that we are not

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.230 
we don't end at our body that we are not
bound<00:00:24.630> by<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.110> knowledge<00:00:25.590> skip<00:00:26.120> through<00:00:27.120> this

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
bound by a knowledge skip through this

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.990 
bound by a knowledge skip through this
energy<00:00:27.870> field<00:00:28.080> which<00:00:28.440> changes<00:00:29.100> according<00:00:29.790> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
energy field which changes according to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.440 
energy field which changes according to
our<00:00:30.029> feelings<00:00:30.600> and<00:00:31.050> our<00:00:31.350> thoughts<00:00:32.120> to<00:00:33.120> become

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
our feelings and our thoughts to become

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.380 
our feelings and our thoughts to become
larger<00:00:33.690> or<00:00:34.170> smaller<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.370> sense<00:00:35.970> and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
larger or smaller we can sense and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.950 
larger or smaller we can sense and
Intuit<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.309> affect<00:00:38.309> things<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.720> much

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
Intuit and affect things that are much

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.160 
Intuit and affect things that are much
beyond<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.860> region<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.360> I'll<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
beyond that region so I'll do a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.560 
beyond that region so I'll do a
demonstration<00:00:43.440> today<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.460> show<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.300> far

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
demonstration today to show you how far

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.030 
demonstration today to show you how far
out<00:00:45.870> beyond<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.739> skin<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.760> energy<00:00:48.360> field

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
out beyond the skin this energy field

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.070 
out beyond the skin this energy field
extends<00:00:50.040> so<00:00:50.580> I'm<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> walk<00:00:51.239> over<00:00:51.540> across

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
extends so I'm going to walk over across

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.660 
extends so I'm going to walk over across
the<00:00:52.379> yard<00:00:52.680> take<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.910> starting<00:00:54.300> position

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
the yard take the starting position

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.270 
the yard take the starting position
slowly<00:00:55.940> towards<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.660> camera<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:58.100> you

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
slowly towards the camera so that you

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.540 
slowly towards the camera so that you
can<00:00:58.519> see

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
can see

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:54.539 
can see
this<00:00:59.910> demonstration

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.999 

so<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.270> was<00:01:55.479> an<00:01:55.630> ordinary<00:01:56.229> coat<00:01:56.619> hanger<00:01:56.979> I

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
so this was an ordinary coat hanger I

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.919 
so this was an ordinary coat hanger I
was<00:01:57.280> working<00:01:57.700> with<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:58.060> can<00:01:58.240> practice<00:01:58.780> this

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
was working with you can practice this

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.719 
was working with you can practice this
at<00:01:59.170> home<00:01:59.350> work<00:01:59.710> with<00:01:59.950> your<00:02:00.130> friends<00:02:00.549> and

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
at home work with your friends and

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.270 
at home work with your friends and
experiment<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.659> hold<00:02:01.899> it<00:02:02.079> very<00:02:02.469> loosely<00:02:03.039> in

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
experiment you hold it very loosely in

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.700 
experiment you hold it very loosely in
the<00:02:03.429> hand<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.149> that<00:02:04.179> coat<00:02:04.840> hanger<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.469> move

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
the hand so that coat hanger can move

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.990 
the hand so that coat hanger can move
freely<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:07.000> you'll<00:02:07.210> be<00:02:07.390> amazed<00:02:11.400> I'm<00:02:12.400> showing

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
freely and you'll be amazed I'm showing

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.789 
freely and you'll be amazed I'm showing
you<00:02:13.030> where<00:02:13.720> there's<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.739> bound<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.220> be<00:02:16.799> an

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
you where there's a bound to be an

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.460 
you where there's a bound to be an
experiment<00:02:18.549> especially<00:02:18.640> with<00:02:19.180> children

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
experiment especially with children

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.600 
experiment especially with children
children<00:02:20.470> tend<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.830> have<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.010> very<00:02:21.340> large

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
children tend to have a very large

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.869 
children tend to have a very large
energy<00:02:22.450> field<00:02:22.750> or<00:02:22.989> at<00:02:23.500> times<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:24.099> joy<00:02:24.430> and

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
energy field or at times of joy and

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.050 
energy field or at times of joy and
laughter<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:26.260> energy<00:02:26.769> field<00:02:27.069> gets<00:02:27.760> much

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
laughter the energy field gets much

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.890 
laughter the energy field gets much
larger<00:02:28.690> after<00:02:29.560> meditation<00:02:30.220> or<00:02:31.120> practices

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
larger after meditation or practices

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.559 
larger after meditation or practices
like<00:02:32.110> yoga<00:02:32.170> or<00:02:32.829> Tai<00:02:33.130> Chi<00:02:33.519> you<00:02:33.880> will<00:02:34.390> also

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
like yoga or Tai Chi you will also

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.410 
like yoga or Tai Chi you will also
notice<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.290> your<00:02:35.739> energy<00:02:36.280> field

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
notice that your energy field

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.680 
notice that your energy field
and<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:38.800> encourage<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.819> try<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.270> home

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
and so I encourage you to try to home

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.630 
and so I encourage you to try to home
see<00:02:41.050> for<00:02:41.260> yourself<00:02:41.650> whether<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.040> works<00:02:42.340> or<00:02:42.580> not

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
see for yourself whether it works or not

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.809 
see for yourself whether it works or not
and<00:02:43.330> learn<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.810> think<00:02:44.020> of<00:02:44.230> yourself<00:02:44.709> as<00:02:45.040> much

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
and learn to think of yourself as much

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.320 
and learn to think of yourself as much
larger<00:02:46.420> than<00:02:46.690> your<00:02:47.020> body<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.880> Janice

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
larger than your body this is Janice

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.420
