00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.930
 international solidarity that 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.110
 You can search on YouTube, it's already a 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.840
 Month is a classic of our beloved 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.940
 generation comes good in the ex 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.460
 familiarity that is the ige raven and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.469
 barracks of love to moderatto fernando

 rivera calderón julieta venegas quique 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.410
 camilo lara rangel with worm fields 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.850
 this and good come many many successes 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.420
 plus 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.370
 is a chichi the album that has as 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.000
 those venues that turn around is 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.000
 like a little girl 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.530
 of good bottle apart from droplet and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.590
 gels is also the imex ball and there 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.680
 is my 13 and is with a series of 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.270
 mentions of other singers the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.560
 why we put the little bottle 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.560
 until the end is because it is a new 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.720
 version of the song already known from 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.690
 saints against teatre mendoza and it was like 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.150
 a gift at the end of that it was that 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.310
 out is like what people would have 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.080
 waited for this song to be and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.090
 what we wanted then we not only give them 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 the song they expected but a new 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.410
 unpublished version of this song and by 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.960
 we leave that in credits so that 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.770
 could live the song and the whole 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.770
 I'm sorry to hear from the beginning 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.990
 and that we started thinking about doing the 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.990
 dubbing 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.000
 we were not working with grandpa 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.000
 ripstein and the idea was 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.170
 I'm counting 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.050
 so if we are going to do the dubbing of 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.540
 the new movie which included new 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.830
 dialogues and new music and I from that 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.500
 then he had spoken with title of 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.230
 motorcycle is 10 years ago 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.690
 we do not do it 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.550
 I would like 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.340
 time passed and the truth is that the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.780
 commitment to tito followed and when you 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 we take the money to do the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.370
 movie was already all we talked to 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.410
 removed and one of the musicians that for me 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.030
 is the musician who is not capable of what 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.100
 this moment in Mexico in the cinema that is 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.750
 camilo froideval with whom I work 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.750
 a lot and that works with him 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.470
 limit was set the team to do the 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.020
 music and the truth is that it flowed like 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.490
 butter because anyone better than me 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.440
 he invited him to make the music of this 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.540
 movie they understood perfect 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.990
 I think that creating a masterpiece with its 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.990
 ability 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.659
 the consciousness of Mexicans 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.030
 and also it was accommodating as with 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.940
 all the movies at work with 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.610
 legs the songs we were going 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.740
 choosing as with faults and what 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.000
 we tried was to present that it's a bit 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.310
 what I do my job is always 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.510
 new bands in tussam this case of 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.210
 bands again we have this 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.100
 whopper who has a jewel case is 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.620
 loves wolf dri the one that appears one of the 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.000
 of bulls is also raul and I'm already 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.310
 that are the children of the tigers of the 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.010
 north with a song chulada that goes 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.190
 to be a hit that is called well we did 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.930
 the new version this track with the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.069
 jérez bottle 2 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.069
 what else do we have 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.190
 a jewel of the soldier 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.190
 is that we support 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.960
 of judith to the romantics of zacatecas 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.910
 that is a group that is playing around 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.170
 that is very good produced is cortito 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.480
 and they made me this cover of elvis 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.930
 presley and the truth is that the soundtrack 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.280
 it's a chulada I think it's also 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.900
 armed and we leave the saints against those of 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.630
 tola mendoza to the end ignores 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.520
 reiter I ask him on purpose how is 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.100
 in the movie to do the rest 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.140
 our chronological music 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.540
 but if a tracklist is made to 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:23.540
 awareness 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.540
 nice the highway
