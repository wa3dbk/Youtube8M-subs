00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.460 
learn how to put binding on it's very
simple<00:00:28.490> this<00:00:29.090> is<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.450> binding<00:00:29.900> a<00:00:30.080> webbing

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
simple this is the binding a webbing

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.540 
simple this is the binding a webbing
binding<00:00:31.240> this<00:00:32.240> is<00:00:32.419> like<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.080> poly<00:00:33.530> cotton<00:00:33.950> or

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
binding this is like a poly cotton or

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.320 
binding this is like a poly cotton or
some<00:00:35.480> sort<00:00:35.720> of<00:00:35.810> blend<00:00:36.140> I<00:00:36.500> don't<00:00:37.280> typically<00:00:38.180> use

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
some sort of blend I don't typically use

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.430 
some sort of blend I don't typically use
a<00:00:39.140> hundred<00:00:39.950> percent<00:00:40.489> cotton<00:00:40.930> because<00:00:41.930> I

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
a hundred percent cotton because I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.740 
a hundred percent cotton because I
sometimes<00:00:43.220> paint<00:00:43.670> my<00:00:43.879> bindings<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:44.600> I<00:00:44.690> don't

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
sometimes paint my bindings and I don't

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.799 
sometimes paint my bindings and I don't
want<00:00:45.200> it<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.410> shrink<00:00:45.650> once<00:00:45.980> it's<00:00:46.160> on<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.330> this

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
want it to shrink once it's on so this

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.060 
want it to shrink once it's on so this
is<00:00:47.870> what<00:00:48.140> we're<00:00:48.260> going<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.410> do<00:00:48.559> we're<00:00:48.830> going<00:00:48.860> to

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.740 
is what we're going to do we're going to
bind<00:00:49.450> this<00:00:50.450> piece<00:00:50.840> of<00:00:51.110> fabric<00:00:51.790> and<00:00:55.540> I'm<00:00:56.540> gonna

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.410 
bind this piece of fabric and I'm gonna
show<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:56.989> just<00:00:57.080> how<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:57.440> do<00:00:57.620> that<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.070> over

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.910 

place<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:01.600> right<00:01:01.750> here<00:01:02.079> on<00:01:02.260> center

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.399 

really<00:01:06.610> when<00:01:06.790> you're<00:01:06.970> binding<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.810> also<00:01:08.050> want

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
really when you're binding you also want

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.230 
really when you're binding you also want
to<00:01:08.470> put<00:01:08.680> it<00:01:08.830> make<00:01:09.370> sure<00:01:09.400> that<00:01:09.729> you<00:01:09.850> put<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.180> in

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
to put it make sure that you put it in

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.600 
to put it make sure that you put it in
an<00:01:10.330> obscure<00:01:10.840> position<00:01:11.409> you<00:01:12.159> don't<00:01:12.340> want

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
an obscure position you don't want

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.090 
an obscure position you don't want
people<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.090> see<00:01:13.300> where<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:13.810> joined<00:01:14.500> your<00:01:14.740> bank

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
people to see where you joined your bank

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.370 
people to see where you joined your bank
you're<00:01:15.460> buying<00:01:15.970> it<00:01:16.150> join<00:01:16.540> where<00:01:16.930> you<00:01:17.050> join

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
you're buying it join where you join

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:31.730 
you're buying it join where you join
your<00:01:17.560> binding

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.649 

I'm<00:01:32.740> pulling<00:01:33.280> this<00:01:33.400> in

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
I'm pulling this in

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.370 
I'm pulling this in
because<00:01:36.049> I<00:01:36.200> really<00:01:37.719> don't<00:01:38.719> want<00:01:39.079> it<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.259> be

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
because I really don't want it to be

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.970 
because I really don't want it to be
puckered<00:01:39.829> I<00:01:40.070> want<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.789> be<00:01:40.909> tight<00:01:41.180> on

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.390 

okay<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.480> I

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
okay so I

00:01:49.400 --> 00:02:16.460 
okay so I
folding<00:01:50.300> this<00:01:50.480> around<00:01:53.650> and<00:01:55.990> turning<00:01:56.990> as<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.470> go

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.650 

back<00:02:16.770> down<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.550> corner

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.600 

if<00:02:22.660> you're<00:02:22.960> sewing<00:02:23.170> over<00:02:23.410> paint<00:02:23.830> sometimes

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
if you're sewing over paint sometimes

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.630 
if you're sewing over paint sometimes
you<00:02:25.030> will<00:02:25.150> find<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.020> painter<00:02:26.890> builds<00:02:27.400> up

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
you will find that the painter builds up

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.020 
you will find that the painter builds up
on<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.870> needle<00:02:29.080> all<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.220> have<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.520> do<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.820> take

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
on the needle all you have to do is take

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.240 
on the needle all you have to do is take
your<00:02:31.150> fingernail<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.930> rub<00:02:32.710> it<00:02:32.800> off<00:02:32.980> it's

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
your fingernail and rub it off it's

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.040 
your fingernail and rub it off it's
because<00:02:33.700> it's<00:02:34.060> not<00:02:34.270> always<00:02:34.450> because<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
because it's not always because the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.470 
because it's not always because the
paint<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.440> wet<00:02:35.680> but<00:02:36.460> it's<00:02:36.640> because<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.240> heat

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
paint is wet but it's because the heat

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.740 
paint is wet but it's because the heat
of<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.750> needle<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.260> friction<00:02:38.770> causes<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:40.030> to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
of the needle the friction causes it to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.090 
of the needle the friction causes it to
gum<00:02:41.410> up<00:02:41.940> from<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.060> inside

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
gum up from the inside

00:02:45.100 --> 00:03:26.410 
gum up from the inside
but<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.760> just<00:02:45.910> wipe<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.540> off<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:47.110> go

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.839 

okay

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
okay

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.080 
okay
so<00:03:28.390> now<00:03:28.540> I'm<00:03:28.749> at<00:03:28.930> almost<00:03:29.739> at<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.069> end<00:03:30.249> so<00:03:30.909> what

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
so now I'm at almost at the end so what

so now I'm at almost at the end so what
I<00:03:31.120> do<00:03:31.239> is<00:03:31.749> I<00:03:31.980> cut<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:34.510> now<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:34.900> have<00:03:35.170> to

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
I do is I cut it and now I have to

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.690 
I do is I cut it and now I have to
turn<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.739> over

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
turn it over

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.760 
turn it over
and<00:03:40.090> I'm<00:03:40.330> cutting<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:40.900> have<00:03:41.140> an<00:03:41.290> excess<00:03:41.740> amount

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
and I'm cutting I have an excess amount

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.910 
and I'm cutting I have an excess amount
I'm<00:03:42.220> aware<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.760> but<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:43.599> am<00:03:43.840> folding<00:03:44.349> it<00:03:44.770> to

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
I'm aware of that but I am folding it to

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.839 
I'm aware of that but I am folding it to
see<00:03:45.160> exactly<00:03:45.700> where<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.120> needed<00:03:46.569> to<00:03:46.810> go<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.849> as

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
see exactly where I needed to go and as

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.610 
see exactly where I needed to go and as
long<00:03:49.120> as<00:03:49.270> I<00:03:49.390> have<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.660> crease<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.560> know

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
long as I have that crease and I know

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.890 
long as I have that crease and I know
where<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:50.980> has<00:03:51.069> to<00:03:51.220> go<00:03:51.400> I'm<00:03:52.209> just<00:03:52.270> going<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:52.660> cut

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
where it has to go I'm just going to cut

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:02.059 
where it has to go I'm just going to cut
that<00:03:52.930> in<00:03:53.170> half

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.149 

I'm<00:04:02.249> gonna<00:04:02.370> hold<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.819> down<00:04:04.159> continue

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
I'm gonna hold that down continue

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:16.530 
I'm gonna hold that down continue

and<00:04:17.540> I'm<00:04:17.690> just<00:04:17.870> gonna<00:04:18.019> continue<00:04:18.440> just<00:04:18.799> for<00:04:19.010> a

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
and I'm just gonna continue just for a

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.200 
and I'm just gonna continue just for a
few<00:04:19.310> more<00:04:19.519> stitches<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.390> I<00:04:21.049> can<00:04:21.260> backtrack

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
few more stitches and I can backtrack

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.640
