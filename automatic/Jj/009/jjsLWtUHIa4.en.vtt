year nineteen sixty seven this is the
newest<00:00:24.500> half-dollar<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.539> some<00:00:27.539> of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
newest half-dollar that I have some of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.380 
newest half-dollar that I have some of
them<00:00:27.810> are<00:00:28.199> even<00:00:28.590> sterling<00:00:29.310> silver<00:00:29.880> coin<00:00:30.179> like

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
them are even sterling silver coin like

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.860 
them are even sterling silver coin like
this<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.929> has<00:00:31.019> ninety<00:00:31.650> two<00:00:32.030> and<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.570> half

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
this it has ninety two and a half

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.150 
this it has ninety two and a half
percent<00:00:34.489> silver<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> rest<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.940> them<00:00:36.120> contain

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
percent silver the rest of them contain

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.250 
percent silver the rest of them contain
eighty<00:00:38.160> percent<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.300> there's<00:00:39.480> 20<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.840> them<00:00:40.050> so

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
eighty percent and there's 20 of them so

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.680 
eighty percent and there's 20 of them so
if<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:40.469> some<00:00:40.770> basic<00:00:40.980> math<00:00:41.489> i<00:00:42.030> could<00:00:42.329> take

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
if I do some basic math i could take

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.069 
if I do some basic math i could take
twenty<00:00:43.730> multiplies<00:00:44.730> arrow<00:00:45.120> point<00:00:45.480> five<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.020> i

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
twenty multiplies arrow point five and i

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.150 
twenty multiplies arrow point five and i
would<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.500> 10<00:00:47.660> which<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> equivalency<00:00:49.890> of

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
would get 10 which is the equivalency of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.420 
would get 10 which is the equivalency of
