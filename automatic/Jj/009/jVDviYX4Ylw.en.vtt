00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.170
 the life project of the soul 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.100
 was born 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.450
 from a lot of years ago it happens that if 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.180
 I knew that it had to be done 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.180
 reality in a more mature moment of my 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.390
 race to face songs so 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.730
 emblematic but of course they are songs 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.430
 that I've heard from very small in 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.310
 my parents' house and the initial idea was 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:32.070
 collect all these songs and give them 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.070
 my character my my personality 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.860
 with which the complicated thing was being of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.970
 several interpreters and several authors 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.810
 well then 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.370
 it was good to live with them and in the end 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.100
 as a tribute to that Italian music and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.940
 that generation that we the monster 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.680
 They can also reach an audience 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.600
 younger is not always that is the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.670
 goal of the musician who will reach 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.860
 the more public the better and that great 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.800
 luck that has given us via dalma has been 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.270
 after passing from one generation to another 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.250
 you can always 55 the bridge of the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.159
 question the interpretative commitment of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.679
 these songs 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.229
 and the funny thing is that many associate this 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:13.689
 type of composition to light music and 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.990
 as a contradictory thing and you talk 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.000
 of commitment is something that usually associate 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.260
 something complex but for the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.900
 interpretation of songs 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.800
 and the easy ones if there has always been that 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.150
 term as very pejorative music 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.020
 light when in reality we are 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.820
 talking about great melodies that is what 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.400
 that perhaps he is also missing 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.070
 there is now a tendency to recover 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.790
 the oldies in general maybe so 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.260
 better a melody crisis in the end what 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.470
 what account is this that we are 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.440
 consuming these melodies that have 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.110
 survived over time I imagined 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.189
 the arrival 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.479
 world version 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.759
 every time you prepare a new 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.200
 work you have that and lucid say 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.630
 good as the Italians say 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.670
 pottery by labor or masterpiece 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.200
 I will reach the public that I want to be 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.200
 the expectations of what the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.030
 people 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.950
 without this becoming a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.640
 obsession otherwise I would not let you work at 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.489
 taste but inside when we 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.010
 we finished the album if we knew that the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.390
 world was one of the songs of weight to 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.459
 also the most complicated have been 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.530
 made many versions of the world but 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.269
 we thought it was a no longer better version 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.940
 or worse but very dalma that was what 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.730
 We were looking for but good the great fortune of 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.280
 that slipped through the Argentine homes and 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.220
 in the end it is consolidating itself as a 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.940
 classic 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.800
 maybe it's not ideal 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.500
 hit more muscle that meant 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.240
 altered the specific events and are 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.910
 live dialogue equal your version of the 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.760
 world with dancing stuck or not yet 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.550
 I still can not talk face to face in 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.400
 the world to dance together because dancing 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.830
 stuck past 20 21 years 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.440
 of his birth and it's still there very 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.380
 present and I always tell anecdotes from 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.670
 very young people that I love 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.770
 dance glued and maybe there was not even 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.709
 born what has passed from generation to 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.200
 generation a bit like the case of these 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.930
 you will be so emblematic Italians 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.060
 but my version of the world still has 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.450
 to spend a good time and hopefully will 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.400
 consider 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.670
 over the years 'dance together' 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.670
 most people of your success 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.120
 I never deny the principle of my 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.769
 career we talked about now I should give more 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.140
 thanks to him 'dancing glued' since 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.050
 that girl is mine and galilea and during 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.700
 these 25 years of career I have never left 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.700
 of singing those songs I'm capable 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.490
 of being on a stage do not sing them 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.770
 obviously now I feel it from another 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.540
 way I do not do that 'dance glued' with 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.090
 the friend the same arrangement with the same 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.860
 sure version that every day I sing it 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.260
 different because it 's the good thing that it has 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.170
 the live show does not depend on your status 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.960
 public mood where you are x factors 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.010
 every day is different but I can not 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.750
 stop singing the 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.690
 a couple of months ago we talked about 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.750
 animations 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.310
 within the theme of the crisis 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.930
 and they had a point of view that very 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.870
 probably have continued to day of 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.720
 today because that moment interpreted in 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.830
 terms of psychosis today 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.830
 maintain that vision 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.509
 in general there is evidently pessimism 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.060
 there is pessimism and that insecurity that 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:45.110
 therefore, this uncertainty of 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.150
 see what will happen but no doubt that 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.550
 you have to wake up every morning and throw 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.530
 forward and good at the end like that 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.949
 unfortunately you get used to living 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.509
 with this situation but as much as 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.330
 we complain is the one that is touching us 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.629
 live 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.849
 and in my case that I am a musician that I am 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.230
 singer so when I'm at the shows 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.680
 I say it 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:11.260
 let's try to ignore what lasts 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.020
 concert of what we are going through and 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.440
 try to enjoy a moment but good 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.060
 the reality is there an interested in 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.400
 the filters of lambs 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.280
 regionalisms in Spain are very strong 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.950
 and the whole world exalts its uniqueness 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.580
 to the detriment of the Spanish state as 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.330
 Catalan has 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.120
 and I'm a Catalan who obviously 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.400
 always tried the tree to make that 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.360
 flag 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.820
 of that culture I try to protect not so 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.270
 only the Catalan culture but any 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:50.710
 type of culture and cultural expression 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:52.720
 when you travel like I have been 21 years 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.729
 outside of madrid, you realize that what 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.039
 important is that respect of culture 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.710
 of each one but that does not hurt and 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.070
 subtract 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.270
 or other kind of situations I think it's 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.230
 good 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.150
 do not distance yourself do not separate yourself from what 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:12.890
 is a whole nucleus that in the end is what 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.890
 Makes a country rich
