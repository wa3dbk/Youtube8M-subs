slowly develop it and then once I get
the<00:03:39.660> real<00:03:40.020> good<00:03:40.800> idea<00:03:41.130> what<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.760> do<00:03:41.820> is<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.209> find<00:03:42.240> a

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
the real good idea what I do is I find a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.910 
the real good idea what I do is I find a
model<00:03:44.240> that's<00:03:45.350> perfect<00:03:46.350> for<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.650> the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
model that's perfect for the the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.340 
model that's perfect for the the
painting<00:03:47.310> or<00:03:47.550> Yanis<00:03:48.150> perfect<00:03:48.810> yeah<00:03:49.080> that's

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
painting or Yanis perfect yeah that's

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.040 
painting or Yanis perfect yeah that's
good<00:03:49.650> for<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.890> painting<00:03:50.600> photograph<00:03:51.600> err<00:03:51.810> and

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
good for the painting photograph err and

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.009 
good for the painting photograph err and
then<00:03:52.320> I'll<00:03:52.500> draw<00:03:52.800> on<00:03:52.830> top<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.459> photos<00:03:54.360> till

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
then I'll draw on top of the photos till

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.330 
then I'll draw on top of the photos till
I<00:03:55.110> get<00:03:55.170> what<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.440> want<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.890> then<00:03:56.160> I'll

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
I get what I want and then I'll

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.080 
I get what I want and then I'll
eventually<00:03:56.970> paint<00:03:57.390> them<00:03:58.640> just<00:03:59.640> painting<00:03:59.970> back

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
eventually paint them just painting back

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.820

here<00:04:00.330> behind<00:04:00.660> me<00:04:00.930> actually<00:04:01.260> started<00:04:01.590> as<00:04:01.680> like

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
here behind me actually started as like

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.790 
here behind me actually started as like
a<00:04:01.980> little<00:04:02.280> squiggle<00:04:02.820> of<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.090> drawing<00:04:03.360> maybe

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
a little squiggle of a drawing maybe

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.520 
a little squiggle of a drawing maybe
maybe<00:04:04.800> four<00:04:05.100> years<00:04:05.310> ago

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
really I think I think for a young

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.670 
really I think I think for a young
artist<00:05:59.490> traveling<00:06:00.449> is<00:06:01.050> probably<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.470> best

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
artist traveling is probably the best

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.740 
artist traveling is probably the best
and<00:06:01.919> to<00:06:02.160> get<00:06:02.310> out<00:06:02.400> of<00:06:02.520> your<00:06:02.580> shop<00:06:02.850> to<00:06:03.419> see<00:06:03.630> how

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
and to get out of your shop to see how

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.330 
and to get out of your shop to see how
people<00:06:04.080> are<00:06:04.169> doing<00:06:04.320> things<00:06:04.680> somewhere<00:06:05.160> else

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
people are doing things somewhere else

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.980 
people are doing things somewhere else
you<00:06:05.550> know<00:06:05.610> I<00:06:05.880> think<00:06:06.150> the<00:06:06.300> most<00:06:06.449> learning<00:06:06.870> I've

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
you know I think the most learning I've

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.430 
you know I think the most learning I've
done<00:06:07.199> it<00:06:07.470> has<00:06:07.800> been<00:06:08.720> been<00:06:09.720> on<00:06:09.750> the<00:06:09.990> road<00:06:10.169> you

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
done it has been been on the road you
