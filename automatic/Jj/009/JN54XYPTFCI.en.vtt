something called a pore on which is on
top<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.610> slow-release<00:01:12.060> memory<00:01:12.630> foam<00:01:12.869> as

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
top it's a slow-release memory foam as

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.570 
top it's a slow-release memory foam as
you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.830> when<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> pressure<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.490> on

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you can see when the pressure is on

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.160 
you can see when the pressure is on
there<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.420> releases<00:01:15.780> slowly<00:01:18.110> absorbs<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
there it releases slowly absorbs the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
there it releases slowly absorbs the
shock<00:01:19.200> straightaway<00:01:19.979> when<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.729> in

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
shock straightaway when I was out in

shock straightaway when I was out in
Germany<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.299> said<00:01:21.540> sir<00:01:21.689> Martin<00:01:22.020> Trent<00:01:22.290> when<00:01:22.380> the

insole that everyone can afford for

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.130 
insole that everyone can afford for
maybe<00:01:25.890> 40<00:01:26.250> 50<00:01:26.579> 60<00:01:27.240> pounds<00:01:27.420> how<00:01:27.630> do<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:27.960> that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
maybe 40 50 60 pounds how do we do that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
maybe 40 50 60 pounds how do we do that
a<00:01:28.350> typical<00:01:28.650> German<00:01:29.040> he<00:01:29.280> said<00:01:29.490> yep<00:01:29.670> I've<00:01:30.030> got
