00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
fine little feathers and they would be

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.620 
fine little feathers and they would be
suitable<00:01:53.319> for<00:01:53.970> some<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.030> your<00:01:55.149> larger<00:01:55.450> dry

flies<00:01:55.929> but<00:01:56.530> like<00:01:56.649> I<00:01:56.800> said<00:01:56.860> they're<00:01:57.220> they're

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
flies but like I said they're they're

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.900 
flies but like I said they're they're
fairly<00:01:57.849> short<00:01:58.440> little<00:01:59.440> feathers<00:01:59.950> these<00:02:00.700> also

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
fairly short little feathers these also

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.080 
fairly short little feathers these also
do<00:02:01.179> have<00:02:01.390> somewhat<00:02:01.869> rounded<00:02:02.619> tips<00:02:02.890> as<00:02:03.099> well<00:02:03.130> so

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
do have somewhat rounded tips as well so

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.120 
do have somewhat rounded tips as well so
they<00:02:04.209> would<00:02:04.390> make<00:02:04.569> great<00:02:04.780> wings<00:02:05.319> for<00:02:05.890> your

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
they would make great wings for your

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.540 
they would make great wings for your
atoms<00:02:06.640> your<00:02:07.569> variance<00:02:07.959> any<00:02:08.200> of<00:02:08.349> your<00:02:08.550> classic
