00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 human I have to be smooth on mine 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.009
 i like to watch the teaching that has 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.109
 a whole while lasted until 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.110
 next movie trivia but now it is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.480
 there again and it should be a future 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.009
 catch a little bit more regularly 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.820
 Let's go to those ten now 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.470
 facts 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.470
 even I had to be surprised 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.509
 Bernard and Bianca is certainly one 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.340
 the biggest movie classic by walt 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.050
 disney and actually a first 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.000
 movies I've ever seen 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.860
 although I probably do not 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.620
 could have actually contained 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.809
 bernard and bianca namely an offensive 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.449
 material one of the animators has 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.850
 namely in this scene a test image 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.129
 forget if you are very accurate 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.930
 you can see in the windows one 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.059
 naked woman recognize 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.100
 and because there disney that too very much 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:02.589
 found out late in 1997 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.210
 34 million vhs cassettes out again 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.220
 taken the trade and now I know 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.570
 also from where the legendary scene 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.070
 fightclub comes again and again 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.710
 Scenes where to be after the third 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.049
 fourth fifth or sixth note 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.729
 that he really sees more contains than 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.070
 you noticed at the first time 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.790
 Did you know, for example, that in this 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.880
 scene 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:31.990
 one of the sons of doc brown quite wholly 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.970
 you have to go to the toilet 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.980
 be careful but if you are 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.510
 it's all the funnier and where we are 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.710
 soon make sure it is indeed 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.930
 also the scenes of the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.090
 leave filmmakers extra there as well 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.190
 For example, in the case of Tron, a film 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.980
 about computer games and that became 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.229
 apparently made by nerds for nerds 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.270
 because there are so many easter eggs 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.460
 like this one, if you like 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.050
 exactly on the scoreboard then looks 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.820
 you become a legendary one 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.400
 find classic games again 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.960
 and here's a fun too 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.960
 little easter egg mixed in 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.289
 at kino trailer so incredibly long 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.910
 before the actual cinema start 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.709
 it happens and happens 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.209
 again that the scenes in the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.500
 not all were in the trailer 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.360
 movie are included 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.940
 sometimes takes on the grotesque too 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.200
 trains to if the whole trailer at all 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.180
 nothing to do with the film has to do with how 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.670
 example in the case of mozilla 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.230
 where to get this scene from the museum 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.150
 finished film could never see or 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.580
 this scene from the first spiderman 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.319
 teaser because of one level from the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.390
 finished film was later deleted 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.250
 that can if you are unlucky, but also 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.250
 really have consequences because in the case 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.220
 by jack reacher this karate car 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.200
 superherdenfilm tom cruise has one 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.810
 man just because of this one 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.480
 scene he dared to visit the cinema 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.120
 absolutely wanted the explosion of 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.980
 see huge stone wall and just that 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.450
 missing in the finished movie paramount has the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.370
 in the last second of the film 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.500
 cut and then the man has 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.239
 After the visit to the cinema felt a threat 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.280
 has joined the advertising commission of 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.739
 New Zealand complains in turn 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.060
 person called and they had to 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.470
 then apologize to the types 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.470
 and give him the ticket 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.470
 would you have thought that some of the 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.299
 biggest movie classics ever 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.889
 the really unthinkable hardest 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.690
 conditions have come about 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.069
 you may know this from two aliens 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.139
 the movie by James Cameron 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.940
 where someday with the whole crew 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.010
 Did not want to talk anymore or in case 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.730
 from sybase we are talking about now 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.730
 scott pace 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:44.280
 a letter with brian de palma the 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.960
 director has become so blatant with the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.160
 script writer disputed that the 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.960
 writer at some point no longer for 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.250
 set was allowed to have passed and later 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.360
 then suddenly the director and the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.230
 cameraman no longer with each other 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.180
 spoken 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.250
 that means the crew had to 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.230
 messages between the two and 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.510
 This is what the set does 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.400
 today scarface is considered as 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.170
 absolute masterpiece because of the film 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.060
 then actually the cinemas came 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.890
 or completely torn by the criticism 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.000
 and was also a financial flop 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.320
 if in a few days the oscars 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.390
 then there are the two 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.350
 great contender is slavery slave and 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.540
 heated rattle 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.370
 but no matter how many oscars the two 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.740
 movies and the actors in it ever 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.260
 they would never clear one 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.270
 absolute record holder zoom in walt 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.870
 disney has resume its entire 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.510
 time 63 nominations for the oscar 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.830
 cleared and he has 26 of them 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.140
 actually won 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.340
 this is unattainable record and will 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.880
 probably never caught up again 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.680
 become 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.840
 because the man was at some years 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.710
 nominated four times and was able to 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.240
 win four times if we already over 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.680
 the movies speak among the 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.510
 difficult conditions 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.550
 We also have to come via e3 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.010
 Talk because he holds three where the record 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.840
 for the most absurd shooting of all 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.000
 It was time before it started 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.640
 script rewritten 30 times 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.350
 First, Ripley should play a minor role 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.360
 and hicks then be the main character 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.490
 it should be about a war on earth 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.500
 be where the people cloned the aliens 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.060
 have to create alien warriors in the 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.040
 next script drafts at the tails 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.860
 and bishop the main characters and it 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.290
 gave a wild alien virus all 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.060
 people are transformed into alien mutants 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.860
 I would have liked that if he did 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.169
 thought that's wild then you have 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.879
 not yet from the last one 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.610
 and most famous script phase belongs 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:31.219
 Wind are board wanted namely a movie 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.110
 make a planets on the wood 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:38.199
 Munich in her huge library 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.199
 ground and then comes the alien sounds 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.229
 came with more than two meters 2 991 in the 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.689
 cinemas came 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.889
 Above all he has against that 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:53.779
 special effects for furore worried there were 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.639
 probably not a single scene not worth it 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.680
 somewhere to see a computer effect 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.999
 but was not everything in the movie too 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.710
 it was also possible to see at the same time 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:02.749
 trick because it gives the movie the same 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.060
 several uses of one whole 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:07.279
 amazing trick of nature for this 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.810
 both here and in these two 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:11.419
 actually twin brothers and 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:15.469
 twin sister so no clones off 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:17.210
 The computer can be very short 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:20.599
 back to the Future 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.729
 in part two reichsmark ii in 2015 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:26.360
 and looks there at one of the billboards 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:28.759
 a commercial for the white shark part 19 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.879
 but there are only with us 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:32.419
 four parts three normal and one 3d 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.099
 Movie 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.319
 so if not someone else now 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:38.089
 very quickly 15 more movies from the 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.159
 sleeve shakes then I think 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:42.969
 anyone with back to the future 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.969
 lied 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:47.210
 I think there is not a single scene 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.279
 not hardy in work with 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.740
 but computer effects is crammed 

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:53.689
 There are also effects that one believes 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.099
 sometimes not so gorny viva to 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:57.020
 example is self-confessed 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:07:00.229
 non-smokers why you give them this 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:04.029
 Digital cigarette stopped in hand 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:04.029
 why does she smoke then ? 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.120
 maybe that is also a question 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.170
 for one of the upcoming properties like 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.640
 said now again have frequently 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.250
 I'll come for the next episode 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.470
 a special made up there are countless 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.210
 unfortunately never films him in the cinema 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.770
 because they have never come 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.840
 were waved through or because they 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.830
 might be too expensive such as 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.800
 the halo movie 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.760
 I've sometimes ten 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.470
 the most interesting film projects never 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.340
 that were picked out so that 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.150
 next time 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.150
 bye bye
