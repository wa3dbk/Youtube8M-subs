00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 then sales for 21 years 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 followed is not for anyone not 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.170
 But there comes a time when we need to change. 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.389
 to face competition 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.059
 so imagine worrying about 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.130
 fashion stylist gives few make the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.080
 who have to make a new goal but 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.189
 maintaining the curriculum of this passion 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.710
 national 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.099
 by the way they did a good job 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.900
 the new goal has been beautifully modern and has 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.420
 everything to keep this title of leader 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.660
 for the few are worth worrying about 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.870
 competing with the most attention-grabbing 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.480
 of course, it is the body that claims to be 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.969
 is about a totally new project 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.390
 until the engine finally shifted position 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.760
 is now transverse the solution much more 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.770
 modern 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.559
 on account of this in relation to the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.000
 former New goal fell out and 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.239
 increased inside 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.120
 it was not another world thing but four 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.120
 adults and one child now accommodates 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.700
 better the more space in the back 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.229
 It is unfortunate that in this 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.780
 was taken so seriously 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.479
 You already know what it is not missing. 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.920
 head support and three- point belt 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.600
 for who sits in the middle of the bench 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.130
 rear could have solved this. 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.689
 internally the changes were also 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:29.490
 radicals change a panel frame of 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:33.049
 instruments sidebars 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.040
 anyway everything despite not daring 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.829
 stylistic with good materials 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.409
 employees and workmanship well done 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.720
 the environment is different and please a 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.100
 very good thing is that the new goal does not 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 I have the defect of the old 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.110
 the steering wheel for now driving position 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.900
 is correct 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.010
 we did the test with version 1.0 that is the 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.680
 most sold 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.840
 it also uses the new engine that besides 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.840
 some more horses than the one used in the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.000
 goal 4 is currently what has the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.690
 higher torque the so-called segment 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.270
 popular cars, especially in 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.210
 and this can be felt in the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.950
 acceleration and speed recovery 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.959
 making us forget a little 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.080
 that lightness typical of cars with 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.210
 engine, especially when it is 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.120
 stocked with albums 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.480
 also contributes to the good exchange rate 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.790
 soft and precise couplings equal to the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.500
 used on the lap and goal and that is 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.000
 reference in the auto industry 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.100
 Brazilian 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.710
 this change all consumption of 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.690
 also benefited 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.490
 our terry circuit that half 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.640
 road and half city 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.700
 he made good 8.1 names that the glass of 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.510
 alcohol and 10.9 new per liter of 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.330
 gasoline and a suspension architecture 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.860
 traditional in small hits 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.310
 the new google has a good compromise 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.320
 between comfort and stability when turning the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.300
 What bothers you is the engine noise in the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.990
 inside when you stretch a little more 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.060
 and rear visibility 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.940
 cause of the large columns and with little 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.920
 hampered maneuvers 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.930
 another good thing is that there was also a 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.920
 modernization of accessories and 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.340
 equipment 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.240
 now whoever wants and can buy 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.080
 a new goal 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.820
 the system must on the air bag brakes 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.000
 board computer up to type switch 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.000
 switchblade 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:40.519
 he found it positive in the new goal 1.0 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.920
 style suspension and the exchange rate is 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.470
 negative the safety the visibility 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.019
 rear and noisy mostou 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.950
 it costs from 29 thousand two hundred and 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.560
 forty reais 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.560
