just<00:04:51.150> watch<00:04:51.300> bin<00:04:51.570> throw<00:04:51.900> these<00:04:52.080> two<00:04:52.320> deep

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
just watch bin throw these two deep

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.600 
just watch bin throw these two deep
freezes<00:04:53.040> down<00:04:53.639> Lane<00:04:54.230> motion<00:04:55.230> I<00:04:55.440> mean<00:04:55.889> not<00:04:56.370> what

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
freezes down Lane motion I mean not what

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.330 
freezes down Lane motion I mean not what
you'd<00:04:56.760> expect<00:04:56.880> out<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.270> a<00:04:57.360> freeze<00:04:57.570> no<00:04:58.290> on<00:04:58.889> this

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
you'd expect out of a freeze no on this

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.050 
you'd expect out of a freeze no on this
wall<00:04:59.550> on<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.240> fresh<00:05:00.480> is<00:05:00.780> really<00:05:01.350> great<00:05:01.560> it
