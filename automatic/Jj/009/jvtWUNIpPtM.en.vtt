00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.780
 Hi, I'm Professor Hugo Landolfi 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.570
 director of the school of technology 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.480
 pianística de buenos aires today we are going to 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.939
 talk about the first piano in the sense of 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.369
 the first piano that appeared on the 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 history is to say the first instrument 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:33.040
 of keyboard that had the possibility of 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:38.120
 vary the intensity of your sound 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.550
 achieving just loud sounds or 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:46.490
 soft there the word piano 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.410
 when we analyze or study 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.020
 any history of music or 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.890
 history of the piano we find ourselves with 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.170
 that simply says that the 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.140
 first piano was invented by a 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.770
 Italian born in Padua who worked 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.900
 in the medicine court 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.590
 called part of lomé or christopher and 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.640
 around the year one thousand 695 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.910
 approximately the date of the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.630
 he talks like the first piano is that he gives it 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.090
 as the first piano on piano 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.390
 Christoforo the name that carries in the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.210
 name of its inventor and simply the 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.330
 piano story keeps moving forward from 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.530
 there as if there had not been 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.720
 previously other instruments 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.060
 that could meet the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.770
 characteristics of a piano that is to say with 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.530
 the possibility d 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.299
 and generate soft and strong sounds to 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.439
 through the intensity with which 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.439
 press go the keys 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.790
 many researchers have done 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.840
 investigations on this issue and they have 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.720
 found at least three instruments 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.140
 prior to Cristófori's piano that 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.679
 they meet the characteristics of being 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.170
 a piano that is to say to strike strings 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.450
 with a similar element of 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.510
 characteristics similar to a hammer 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.810
 and that percussion allowed to achieve sounds 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:25.980
 strong and soft the oldest of all 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:28.410
 them is one thousand 440 that is to say almost 250 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.950
 years before christopher and piano 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.690
 we refer to the candy - an instrument 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.330
 cited in a 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.040
 in an article of sun kilns that 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.100
 indicates and gives instructions to build 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.170
 an instrument called sweet - that has 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.940
 all the characteristics of being a 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.830
 Unfortunately piano has not survived 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.870
 none of these instruments and no 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.330
 only at the time of cristófori that 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.670
 maybe he did not meet him but at the time 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.260
 modern no candy has 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.150
 survived and only remain 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.870
 references through the writings of 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.549
 ovens 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:14.239
 in 1576 in some letters of hipólito 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.659
 cricket there is a piano instrument 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.040
 It is strong and features 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:23.150
 descriptive of this instrument also 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.030
 make us think that could could be a 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.430
 piano in the sense of strings 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.950
 Percussion with hammers that allow 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.890
 vary the sound intensity and in 1875 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.209
 we have the spin tino of bonafini is 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.349
 also an instrument of 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:45.129
 similar characteristics is to say 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:48.049
 instruments the three separated with 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:51.560
 enough time between them except these 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.810
 two that are very close they had 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.000
 characteristics of pianos and that 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.540
 maybe it was the first pianos 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.750
 the sweet me without a doubt is the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.170
 that was the first piano of course not 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.200
 we know and bartolomeo cristófori took 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.970
 contact not with these instruments but 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.530
 with the writings that described them 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.340
 you know and that's why all this was 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.000
 lost in history 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.300
 Cristoforo's piano was named as the 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 first official piano and also cristófori 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.630
 account and had a special advantage 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.690
 pianos are still preserved 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.880
 cristófori at least three of these 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.120
 instruments we do not have news that 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.830
 none have been preserved then in 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.169
 function of this and depending on the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.050
 history of the piano and the first piano what 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.000
 What I want to indicate to you is that the 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.010
 first piano is not necessarily the 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.840
 cristófori piano as indicated by the 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.910
 most of the music stories or 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.710
 of the history of the piano there is a set 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.870
 of at least three instruments that 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.540
 we call pre cristòfor pianos 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.810
 We already met all the 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.419
 characteristics of being a piano but that 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.950
 unfortunately these have been lost 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.080
 instruments have not arrived until 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.020
 we and only records remain 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.270
 writings of the same 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.750
 the cristoforo piano and as the first 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.659
 official piano if you want piano of the 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.580
 that there are still three and the 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.440
 later pianos that derived from the 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.379
 christopher's piano and the group of 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.830
 pianos the Christ Sorianos that arrive 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:36.280
 up to today's piano so 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.010
 good i wanted 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.530
 make this clarification regarding the 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.120
 piano story because all this 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.210
 part of the history of the piano 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.780
 normally it is not present 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.330
 when one 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.880
 study just the history of the 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.700
 Instrument instruments 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.340
 musicals in general and 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.669
 instruments like the piano in particular 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.440
 so is the creator of Cristofori 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.860
 first official piano but there is at least 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.320
 three previous instruments with 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.470
 characteristics that can lead us to 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.050
 think that pianos were also well 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.210
 How good I say goodbye I'm the teacher 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.070
 hugo landolfi director of the school of 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.790
 pianistic technology of buenos aires 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.790
 see you soon
