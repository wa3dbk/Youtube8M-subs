00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.420 
day so if you need a graphing calculator
be<00:04:03.520> sure<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:03.880> bring<00:04:03.970> one<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:08.590> states<00:04:09.160> where

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
be sure and bring one this states where

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.840 
be sure and bring one this states where
our<00:04:09.610> tutoring<00:04:09.910> sessions<00:04:10.360> will<00:04:10.510> take<00:04:10.540> place<00:04:11.850> we

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
our tutoring sessions will take place we

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.300 
our tutoring sessions will take place we
have<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.090> tutoring<00:04:13.870> center<00:04:14.260> provided<00:04:14.890> here<00:04:15.100> so

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
have a tutoring center provided here so

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.830 
have a tutoring center provided here so
all<00:04:15.430> our<00:04:15.730> coding<00:04:16.060> will<00:04:16.209> be<00:04:16.330> at<00:04:16.420> the<00:04:16.540> tutoring

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
all our coding will be at the tutoring

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.130 
all our coding will be at the tutoring
center<00:04:17.080> here<00:04:17.650> on<00:04:17.680> campus<00:04:18.270> okay<00:04:19.270> so<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:19.989> other

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
center here on campus okay so in other

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.020 
center here on campus okay so in other
words<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:20.830> and<00:04:20.950> I<00:04:21.070> don't<00:04:21.370> get<00:04:21.549> together<00:04:21.670> and

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
words you and I don't get together and

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.090 
words you and I don't get together and
say<00:04:22.210> hey<00:04:22.240> let's<00:04:22.750> go<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.200> nearest<00:04:23.380> bar<00:04:23.530> and

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
say hey let's go to the nearest bar and

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.150 
say hey let's go to the nearest bar and
study<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:25.330> is<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.720> study<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:26.170> differential

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
study this is the study of differential

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.920 
study this is the study of differential
equations<00:04:29.160> okay<00:04:30.160> as<00:04:30.910> last<00:04:31.300> is<00:04:31.570> just<00:04:31.810> a

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
equations okay as last is just a

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.740 
equations okay as last is just a
statement<00:04:32.230> that<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:32.980> understand<00:04:33.520> your

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
statement that you understand your

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.900 
statement that you understand your
responsibilities<00:04:34.750> as<00:04:35.020> a<00:04:35.050> student<00:04:35.230> or<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.460> TD

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
responsibilities as a student or to TD

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.030 
responsibilities as a student or to TD
as<00:04:37.000> their<00:04:37.270> call<00:04:37.600> to<00:04:37.630> induct<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.320> this

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
as their call to induct and this

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.800 
as their call to induct and this
signature<00:04:39.490> just<00:04:39.820> says<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:40.270> understand

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
signature just says that you understand

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.980 
signature just says that you understand
all<00:04:41.170> that<00:04:41.770> you've<00:04:42.070> read<00:04:42.280> previously<00:04:43.060> okay<00:04:43.930> you

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
all that you've read previously okay you

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.890 
all that you've read previously okay you
agree<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.530> those<00:04:44.710> things<00:04:47.610> great<00:04:48.610> and<00:04:48.940> with<00:04:49.780> all

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
agree to those things great and with all

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.510 
agree to those things great and with all
the<00:04:49.990> paperwork<00:04:50.620> out<00:04:50.830> of<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.040> way<00:04:51.130> we<00:04:51.370> can

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
the paperwork out of the way we can

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.330 
the paperwork out of the way we can
actually

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
actually

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.910 
actually
and<00:04:52.430> some<00:04:52.790> serious<00:04:53.240> theory<00:04:53.540> what<00:04:54.530> do<00:04:54.710> you<00:04:54.800> need

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
and some serious theory what do you need

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.490 
and some serious theory what do you need
help<00:04:55.190> with<00:04:55.430> endemic<00:04:56.150> what<00:04:56.510> do<00:04:56.600> you<00:04:56.690> spell<00:04:57.020> well

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
help with endemic what do you spell well

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.710 
help with endemic what do you spell well
today<00:04:57.920> of<00:04:58.160> I've<00:04:58.550> had<00:04:58.730> one<00:04:58.910> class<00:04:59.090> without<00:04:59.540> the

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
today of I've had one class without the

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.770 
today of I've had one class without the
syllabus<00:05:00.170> and<00:05:00.560> we've<00:05:01.370> got<00:05:01.580> a<00:05:01.610> certain<00:05:02.570> chapter

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
syllabus and we've got a certain chapter

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.050 
syllabus and we've got a certain chapter
velocity<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.710> know<00:05:03.860> when<00:05:04.250> your<00:05:04.400> differential

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
velocity to know when your differential

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.000 
velocity to know when your differential
equations<00:05:05.570> would<00:05:05.750> be<00:05:05.930> for<00:05:06.440> starting<00:05:06.800> on<00:05:06.890> the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
equations would be for starting on the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.450 
equations would be for starting on the
day

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
day

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.410 
day
okay<00:05:07.970> great<00:05:08.210> now<00:05:08.990> those<00:05:09.530> are<00:05:09.920> too<00:05:10.220> bad<00:05:10.490> let's

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
okay great now those are too bad let's

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.570 
okay great now those are too bad let's
kind<00:05:11.750> of<00:05:11.810> talk<00:05:11.990> about<00:05:12.050> it<00:05:12.380> in<00:05:12.500> general<00:05:12.770> and

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
kind of talk about it in general and

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.710 
kind of talk about it in general and
then<00:05:13.730> we'll<00:05:13.880> see<00:05:14.060> where<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.330> are<00:05:14.360> actually

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
then we'll see where you are actually

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.080 
then we'll see where you are actually
kind<00:05:15.260> of<00:05:15.320> getting<00:05:15.620> stuck<00:05:15.950> what<00:05:16.550> happened

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
kind of getting stuck what happened

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.620 
kind of getting stuck what happened
so<00:05:18.080> today<00:05:18.410> we<00:05:18.530> will<00:05:18.590> talk<00:05:18.650> about<00:05:19.100> linear<00:05:19.640> we

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
so today we will talk about linear we

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.350 
so today we will talk about linear we
have<00:05:20.810> about<00:05:21.110> a<00:05:21.640> little<00:05:22.640> over<00:05:22.880> half<00:05:23.090> an<00:05:23.240> hour

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
have about a little over half an hour

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.440 
have about a little over half an hour
left<00:05:23.600> and<00:05:23.930> we<00:05:23.990> kind<00:05:24.230> of<00:05:24.290> asked
