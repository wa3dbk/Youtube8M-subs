00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.810
 we were on the xbox today 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.580
 press briefing the day before the fair 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.380
 in cologne really starts we have already 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.830
 some games have been seen by marco and me 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.630
 were there and I believe our highlight 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.510
 is the same and that would be 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.680
 dark souls 3 so the trailer was not 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.560
 great but it is 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.480
 Of course not a microsoft game 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.029
 but it comes from bandai namco 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.560
 so if we do not continue 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.519
 stop now but talk a bit 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.790
 about the other things for example 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.899
 could break what do you say to that 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.239
 I found quantum break personally 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.160
 of course , graphically is a bit bleak 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.440
 nice but playful again 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 Such a typical body shooter thus 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.760
 little time mechanics but police 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.829
 means so have I not like that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.020
 I still find it done 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.820
 weird how that work 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.920
 should with the series and with the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.510
 different action strands in the game 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.899
 but you have to wait and see 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.640
 I believe if the story really like that 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.980
 exciting and great and groundbreaking 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.510
 is again touted but I found 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.880
 also that it at least looked good and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.860
 I liked the red barrels so much 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.950
 certain constant in video games 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.030
 should be kept simple 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.700
 What I do not look like that right now 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.950
 impressive was homefront 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.200
 revolution not so much because of 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.360
 this technical break so that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.909
 edge flickering and jerking but before 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.400
 all because of this brand without that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.810
 I was left as is not so 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.610
 great that your account break that's right 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.650
 but already it is far dissolution browner 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.030
 Cover shoulder and there I need 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.409
 I do not necessarily need it now 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.220
 simple so there was just cause 3 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.500
 much preferring exclusive so just 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.630
 cause is just how you know it 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.070
 whether the whole is waiting for you 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.930
 the scenes shown were actually only 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.009
 explosions are more and more 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.200
 have increased 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.610
 So we also did the fun 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.729
 predecessor of course that is not now 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.890
 the super deep entertainment though 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.409
 that was it with this enterhaken 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.360
 always funny that takes itself too 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.860
 not so serious and that's it's up to you 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.829
 apparently around the shooter but it does 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.140
 fun that 's okay from what you finally 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.770
 what has seen what gameplay concerns 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.360
 it was not a tree 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.870
 skate next to three times a second 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.819
 highlight 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.140
 Although it had a bit of problems 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.989
 framerate you have to say that very clearly 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.950
 but so his own kite 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.019
 control and then also for 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.150
 four players corp that was very 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.250
 So I 'm looking forward to everything 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.959
 you can also configure the kites 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.630
 as I understood it was 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.670
 yes to see different and from 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.290
 fighting system if you ever have one 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.810
 then platinum games has played 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.269
 you can expect the fight system as well 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.280
 then you know that we are both now 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.200
 not so the expert for football and 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.239
 for racing games but there was of course 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.660
 also what to see so at fifa it went 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.519
 especially around these legend cards there 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.180
 There's also a bundle of two bundles 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.370
 is not that exciting right now 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.989
 Well, their series of games from then on 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.910
 legato in this team and so on 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.220
 this is pretty cool for the fans 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.099
 So that makes sense for the and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.569
 forza looked fantastic and they have 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.370
 There was a lot of trouble again 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.060
 Realize this really realistic 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.530
 with the different flooring the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.370
 react accordingly on wet so 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.750
 they all have different ones 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.970
 behave way over it drives so 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.829
 it's cool with how much love to 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.460
 detail is also worked that one 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.200
 this forza 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.530
 watch mode what's that again 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.540
 I think you will catch it shortly 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.320
 the lights can turn on and off and 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.510
 the whole in the cockpit so that's me 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.520
 I 'm gonna play a car though 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.860
 I can already do autofans service office 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.050
 you just say so, it also gave 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.600
 a few in the things to see so there 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:50.550
 For example , there was the new one from mojo 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.320
 indie game of the kobold very nice 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.940
 but that it's such a game that you believe 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.130
 I have to try it myself 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.590
 leaning so much out of the window and 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.710
 says yes looks like already zig side 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.170
 scroll shooter before so the typical 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.050
 sidescroller somehow pretty mechanic 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.330
 patience so you have a bit longer 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.700
 yes I think so on the 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.740
 actually do the fair 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.110
 So it will be the state we have 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.239
 otherwise seen a few infos 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.640
 get to the together 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.800
 interaction between windows 10 and 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.480
 between the xbox want so cross play 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.990
 and frost at what a cool thing 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.130
 there was more information to 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.140
 backward compatibility which of course, too 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.040
 very many owners of an xbox one 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.310
 will be happy 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.570
 There are a lot of party publisher's 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.970
 support that too 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.270
 and I say it was already 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.160
 a good a good briefing is relative 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.650
 Satisfied and my highlight was dark 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.010
 Souls is so I agree with that so 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.310
 fair can come good entry and that 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.310
 was it
