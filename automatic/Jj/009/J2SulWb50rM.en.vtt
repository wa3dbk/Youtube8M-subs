with products that are called ink wash

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.510 
with products that are called ink wash
this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.990> called<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.380> press<00:01:13.680> wash<00:01:13.979> meaning<00:01:14.430> that

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
this is called a press wash meaning that

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.190 
this is called a press wash meaning that
you're<00:01:14.640> gonna<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> while<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.750> press

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
you're gonna do this while it's on press

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
so I got as much ink out of here as

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.749 
so I got as much ink out of here as
possible<00:01:18.799> scrape<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.920> little<00:01:20.070> bit<00:01:20.280> more<00:01:20.430> here

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
possible scrape a little bit more here

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.070 
possible scrape a little bit more here
and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.420> we're<00:01:21.509> gonna<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.930> we're

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and then what we're gonna do is we're

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
literally destroy the tape so we got a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.260 
literally destroy the tape so we got a
good<00:02:07.680> amount<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.009> ink<00:02:08.190> being<00:02:08.399> cleaned<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.910> here

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
good amount of ink being cleaned up here

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
inside out to get a little bit

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.680 
inside out to get a little bit
more<00:02:13.450> absorption<00:02:14.200> power<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:15.490> then<00:02:16.480> what

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
more absorption power and then what

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.630 
more absorption power and then what
we'll<00:02:16.810> do<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.020> we'll<00:02:17.110> do<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.260> dry<00:02:17.560> cleaner<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.550> we

we'll do is we'll do a dry cleaner so we

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.250 
we'll do is we'll do a dry cleaner so we
got<00:02:18.760> most<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.300> major<00:02:19.540> part<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.110> ink

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
got most of the major part of the ink

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.210 
got most of the major part of the ink
out<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.840> doesn't<00:02:23.290> smell<00:02:23.530> bad<00:02:23.740> at<00:02:24.040> all

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
out and this doesn't smell bad at all

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.040 
out and this doesn't smell bad at all
which<00:02:24.460> is<00:02:24.490> great<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.910> lot<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.450> solvents

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
which is great a lot of the solvents

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.650 
which is great a lot of the solvents
cleaners<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.770> industry<00:02:27.670> smell<00:02:28.060> really

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
cleaners in the industry smell really

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.500 
cleaners in the industry smell really
really<00:02:28.870> bad<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.220> doesn't<00:02:30.730> smell<00:02:31.030> bad<00:02:31.090> and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
really bad so this doesn't smell bad and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.770 
really bad so this doesn't smell bad and
it<00:02:31.960> works<00:02:32.140> really<00:02:32.320> good<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:34.090> what<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.330> do<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.660> I

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
it works really good so what I do is I

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.900 
it works really good so what I do is I
typically<00:02:35.080> have<00:02:35.260> like<00:02:35.470> an<00:02:35.590> old<00:02:35.800> rag<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.370> is

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
typically have like an old rag that is

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.240 
typically have like an old rag that is
will<00:02:37.150> go<00:02:37.300> down<00:02:37.480> first<00:02:37.900> now<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.560> use<00:02:38.770> two<00:02:39.070> new

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
will go down first now I use two new

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.280 
will go down first now I use two new
ranks<00:02:39.640> for<00:02:40.120> this<00:02:40.240> process<00:02:40.690> but<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.960> old<00:02:41.080> rag

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
ranks for this process but the old rag

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.140 
ranks for this process but the old rag
is<00:02:41.440> good<00:02:41.620> because<00:02:41.950> we<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.580> just<00:02:42.610> throw<00:02:42.970> that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
is good because we can just throw that

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.520 
is good because we can just throw that
right<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.750> doesn't<00:02:43.900> have<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.350> super

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
right in it doesn't have to be super

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.680 
right in it doesn't have to be super
clean<00:02:44.920> now<00:02:45.550> we'll<00:02:45.730> take<00:02:45.850> just<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.240> little<00:02:46.600> bit

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
clean now we'll take just a little bit

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.870 
clean now we'll take just a little bit
more<00:02:46.840> screen<00:02:47.140> wash<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.430> lot<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.610> people

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
more screen wash and a lot of people

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.220 
more screen wash and a lot of people
will<00:02:48.970> use<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:49.240> in<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.480> spray<00:02:49.750> bottle<00:02:50.110> which

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
will use this in a spray bottle which

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.290 
will use this in a spray bottle which
actually<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.620> prefer<00:02:50.830> take<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.060> use<00:02:52.180> that

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
actually I prefer take that and use that

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.390 
actually I prefer take that and use that
in<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.450> spray<00:02:52.660> bottle<00:02:52.690> but<00:02:53.650> we<00:02:54.130> don't<00:02:54.280> have<00:02:54.370> a

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
in a spray bottle but we don't have a

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.470 
in a spray bottle but we don't have a
spray<00:02:54.610> bottle<00:02:54.820> right<00:02:55.060> now<00:02:55.210> so<00:02:55.360> we're<00:02:55.450> just

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
spray bottle right now so we're just

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.570 
spray bottle right now so we're just
using<00:02:55.690> in<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.960> gallon<00:02:56.200> container<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.980> now

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
using in the gallon container and now

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.140 
using in the gallon container and now
