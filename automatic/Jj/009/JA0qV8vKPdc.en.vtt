00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
next shot I'm double row spreadable now

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.070 
next shot I'm double row spreadable now
our<00:04:45.280> struggles<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:45.910> short<00:04:46.240> shot<00:04:46.540> so<00:04:46.810> what<00:04:46.990> I've

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
our struggles a short shot so what I've

our struggles a short shot so what I've
done<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.530> set<00:04:48.340> this<00:04:48.490> way<00:04:48.730> it<00:04:48.940> will<00:04:49.120> finer

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
done to set this way it will finer

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.200 
done to set this way it will finer
setting<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.890> I'm<00:04:51.010> going<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.220> dose<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.520> pump<00:04:52.000> a

which is five grams so sorry four grams

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.010 
which is five grams so sorry four grams
more<00:05:07.940> than<00:05:08.629> the<00:05:10.360> espresso<00:05:11.360> than<00:05:11.599> the<00:05:11.720> double

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
more than the espresso than the double

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:19.050 
more than the espresso than the double
espresso

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.030 

there<00:05:20.060> ya<00:05:20.480> is<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.870> get<00:05:21.020> them<00:05:21.140> a<00:05:21.170> 40<00:05:21.680> milliliters

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
there ya is to get them a 40 milliliters

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.780 
there ya is to get them a 40 milliliters
of<00:05:22.690> coffee<00:05:23.690> in<00:05:24.080> about<00:05:24.290> 25<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:25.070> 30<00:05:25.250> seconds

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
of coffee in about 25 to 30 seconds

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.790 
of coffee in about 25 to 30 seconds
sometimes<00:05:26.570> we're<00:05:26.750> struggles<00:05:27.140> one<00:05:27.350> actually<00:05:27.740> a

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
sometimes we're struggles one actually a

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.250 
sometimes we're struggles one actually a
little<00:05:27.950> bit<00:05:28.220> longer<00:05:28.400> so<00:05:29.120> both<00:05:29.360> 30<00:05:29.660> seconds<00:05:30.170> of

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
little bit longer so both 30 seconds of

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.550 
little bit longer so both 30 seconds of
specific<00:05:30.650> is<00:05:30.710> what<00:05:30.920> I'll<00:05:31.040> be<00:05:31.190> aiming<00:05:31.490> for<00:05:32.560> now

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
specific is what I'll be aiming for now

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.560 
specific is what I'll be aiming for now
this<00:05:33.710> is<00:05:33.770> a<00:05:33.890> blank<00:05:34.250> filter<00:05:34.790> mask<00:05:35.030> itself<00:05:37.570> we

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
this is a blank filter mask itself we

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:45.430 
this is a blank filter mask itself we
can<00:05:38.720> see<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.170> extraction<00:05:43.240> is<00:05:44.240> wonderful<00:05:45.230> look

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
can see the extraction is wonderful look

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.200 
can see the extraction is wonderful look
at<00:05:45.560> that<00:05:45.710> striking<00:05:46.160> not<00:05:46.520> striking<00:05:47.090> is

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
at that striking not striking is

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.390 
at that striking not striking is
definitely<00:05:47.960> a<00:05:47.990> sign<00:05:48.350> of<00:05:48.560> a<00:05:48.650> good<00:05:48.740> instruction

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
definitely a sign of a good instruction

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.520 
definitely a sign of a good instruction
the<00:05:49.970> extraction<00:05:50.540> is<00:05:50.630> almost<00:05:50.930> entirely

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
the extraction is almost entirely

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.610 
the extraction is almost entirely
credible

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:29.730 

stop<00:05:56.620> it<00:05:56.860> right

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.150 

so<00:06:30.280> as<00:06:30.400> you<00:06:30.580> can<00:06:30.699> see<00:06:30.910> the<00:06:31.060> madea<00:06:31.419> is<00:06:31.690> a<00:06:32.470> very

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
so as you can see the madea is a very

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.790 
so as you can see the madea is a very
nice<00:06:35.190> prosumer<00:06:36.190> great<00:06:36.550> machine<00:06:37.050> the<00:06:38.050> price<00:06:38.560> is

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
nice prosumer great machine the price is

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.740 
nice prosumer great machine the price is
what<00:06:38.979> makes<00:06:39.130> a<00:06:39.250> truly<00:06:39.639> attractive<00:06:40.180> is<00:06:40.330> get<00:06:40.539> all
