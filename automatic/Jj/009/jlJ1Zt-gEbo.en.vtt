that<00:06:23.810> something<00:06:24.259> good<00:06:24.409> idea<00:06:25.210> I'm<00:06:26.210> just

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
that something good idea I'm just

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.659 
that something good idea I'm just
wondering<00:06:26.599> it<00:06:26.870> for<00:06:27.080> some<00:06:27.289> reason<00:06:27.460> you<00:06:28.460> can

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
wondering it for some reason you can

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.929 
wondering it for some reason you can
make<00:06:28.849> me<00:06:29.090> a<00:06:29.120> sheath<00:06:29.479> for<00:06:29.750> this<00:06:29.930> thing<00:06:30.229> I<00:06:30.939> think

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:31.939 
make me a sheath for this thing I think

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:34.450 
make me a sheath for this thing I think
so<00:06:32.439> because<00:06:33.439> if<00:06:33.650> you<00:06:33.770> don't<00:06:33.889> get<00:06:34.099> a<00:06:34.159> sheet<00:06:34.400> for

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
so because if you don't get a sheet for

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.640 
so because if you don't get a sheet for
it<00:06:35.919> and<00:06:36.919> I<00:06:37.370> just<00:06:37.759> don't<00:06:37.939> know<00:06:38.090> buddy<00:06:38.650> he

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
it and I just don't know buddy he

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.159 
it and I just don't know buddy he
probably<00:06:39.949> won't<00:06:40.189> last<00:06:40.400> long<00:06:40.759> so<00:06:41.180> whatever<00:06:41.960> you

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
probably won't last long so whatever you
