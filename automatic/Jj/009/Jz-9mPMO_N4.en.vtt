know<00:00:15.110> I<00:00:16.040> think<00:00:17.000> I<00:00:17.330> couldn't<00:00:17.720> really<00:00:18.230> say<00:00:18.710> it<00:00:18.890> it

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
know I think I couldn't really say it it

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.240 
know I think I couldn't really say it it
will<00:00:19.610> be<00:00:19.730> a<00:00:19.760> problem<00:00:20.060> or<00:00:20.510> I<00:00:20.900> don't<00:00:21.590> say<00:00:22.010> there

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
will be a problem or I don't say there

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.880 
will be a problem or I don't say there
will<00:00:22.340> be<00:00:22.490> a<00:00:22.520> fight<00:00:23.090> or<00:00:23.300> something<00:00:23.330> but<00:00:23.930> I<00:00:24.230> i

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
will be a fight or something but I i

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.370 
will be a fight or something but I i
think<00:00:25.400> it's<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:25.820> way<00:00:26.090> of<00:00:26.119> style<00:00:26.660> so<00:00:26.990> I<00:00:27.020> don't

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
think it's the way of style so I don't

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.159 
think it's the way of style so I don't
think<00:00:27.560> it's<00:00:27.910> really<00:00:28.910> a<00:00:28.939> big<00:00:29.180> problem<00:00:29.720> to<00:00:29.990> find

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
think it's really a big problem to find

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.069 
think it's really a big problem to find
somebody<00:00:30.439> who<00:00:30.710> has<00:00:30.860> a<00:00:30.890> thai-style<00:00:31.900> you<00:00:32.900> have

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
somebody who has a thai-style you have

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.260 
somebody who has a thai-style you have
in<00:00:33.230> every<00:00:33.380> way<00:00:33.650> of<00:00:33.800> kind<00:00:34.190> of<00:00:34.370> style<00:00:34.640> a<00:00:34.880> good

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
in every way of kind of style a good

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.900 
in every way of kind of style a good
fighter<00:00:35.540> so<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.170> this<00:00:36.290> is<00:00:36.500> one<00:00:36.950> in<00:00:37.160> Thai<00:00:37.610> style

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
fighter so and this is one in Thai style

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.720 
fighter so and this is one in Thai style
so<00:00:38.470> we<00:00:39.470> have<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:39.739> see<00:00:39.920> in<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.100> fight<00:00:40.310> what<00:00:40.550> will

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
so we have to see in the fight what will

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.960 
so we have to see in the fight what will
happen<00:00:41.770> yeah<00:00:42.770> of<00:00:42.920> course<00:00:43.220> in<00:00:43.400> time<00:00:43.610> and<00:00:43.820> day

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
happen yeah of course in time and day

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.900 
happen yeah of course in time and day
they<00:00:44.240> kick<00:00:44.510> a<00:00:44.540> lot<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:45.410> lot<00:00:45.770> more<00:00:46.010> than<00:00:46.220> Europe<00:00:46.700> I

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
they kick a lot a lot more than Europe I

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.010 
they kick a lot a lot more than Europe I
think<00:00:47.740> so<00:00:48.740> that's<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.190> way<00:00:49.340> of<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.360> of<00:00:50.780> the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
think so that's the way of the of the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.850 
think so that's the way of the of the
style<00:00:51.490> yeah<00:00:52.570> they<00:00:53.570> always<00:00:53.780> say<00:00:54.200> it<00:00:54.260> but<00:00:54.380> I

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
style yeah they always say it but I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.490 
style yeah they always say it but I
think<00:00:55.490> if<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:56.180> really<00:00:56.540> take<00:00:56.900> it<00:00:57.050> one<00:00:57.290> on<00:00:57.470> one

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
think if you really take it one on one

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.320 
think if you really take it one on one
that<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.880> Dutch<00:00:59.120> kickboxing<00:01:00.940> maybe<00:01:01.940> from<00:01:02.180> the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
that the Dutch kickboxing maybe from the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.859 
that the Dutch kickboxing maybe from the
10<00:01:02.540> 5<00:01:02.810> day<00:01:03.080> winning<00:01:03.350> seven<00:01:03.860> or<00:01:03.980> eight<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:04.869> but

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
10 5 day winning seven or eight so but

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.370 
10 5 day winning seven or eight so but
that's<00:01:06.700> just<00:01:07.700> not

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
that's just not

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.690 
that's just not
not<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:11.180> grants<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:12.200> currency<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:13.130> do<00:01:13.549> in

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
not the grants the currency to to do in

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.719 
not the grants the currency to to do in
a<00:01:13.729> fight<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:15.860> have<00:01:17.950> many<00:01:18.950> many<00:01:19.189> kinds<00:01:19.700> of

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
a fight you have many many kinds of

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.929 
a fight you have many many kinds of
different<00:01:20.119> fighters<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.720> this<00:01:20.990> one<00:01:21.200> can<00:01:21.939> can

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
different fighters and this one can can

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.359 
different fighters and this one can can
fight<00:01:23.149> easy<00:01:23.450> with<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.899> thai<00:01:24.079> thai<00:01:24.560> seven<00:01:25.009> but

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
fight easy with the thai thai seven but

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.600 
fight easy with the thai thai seven but
this<00:01:25.549> one<00:01:25.729> is<00:01:25.880> difficult<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:26.659> I<00:01:27.049> think<00:01:28.039> you

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
this one is difficult so I think you

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.649 
this one is difficult so I think you
cannot<00:01:28.939> really<00:01:30.640> say<00:01:31.640> this<00:01:31.909> or<00:01:32.210> death<00:01:32.450> is

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
cannot really say this or death is

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.260 
cannot really say this or death is
better<00:01:33.159> yeah<00:01:34.159> I<00:01:34.399> really<00:01:34.670> don't<00:01:34.970> know<00:01:35.060> what

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
better yeah I really don't know what

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.859 
better yeah I really don't know what
went<00:01:35.450> wrong<00:01:35.689> but<00:01:35.899> I<00:01:36.590> think<00:01:37.399> it's<00:01:37.869> mybatis

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869
