like it and last stand and it's perk

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.860 
like it and last stand and it's perk
cousin<00:00:31.679> because<00:00:32.279> there's<00:00:32.460> two<00:00:32.669> obviously<00:00:33.600> we

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
cousin because there's two obviously we

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.540 
cousin because there's two obviously we
I<00:00:33.899> guess<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.590> define<00:00:35.010> terms<00:00:35.370> here

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
I guess I have to define terms here

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.150 
I guess I have to define terms here
there<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:35.790> two<00:00:36.000> different<00:00:36.770> perks<00:00:37.770> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
there are two different perks that

maybe you're shooting at a different
area<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.360> know<00:03:54.570> say<00:03:54.840> okay<00:03:55.049> it's<00:03:55.230> going<00:03:55.350> to

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
area and you know say okay it's going to

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.870

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
take more bullets to kill this guy than

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.819 
take more bullets to kill this guy than
normal<00:03:57.209> but<00:03:57.630> for<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.870> most<00:03:58.049> part<00:03:58.170> your<00:03:58.500> brain

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
normal but for the most part your brain

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.520 
normal but for the most part your brain
and<00:03:59.670> your<00:03:59.820> subconscious<00:04:00.570> are<00:04:00.720> really<00:04:01.290> taking

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
and your subconscious are really taking

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.500 
and your subconscious are really taking
over<00:04:02.010> when<00:04:02.190> you're<00:04:02.310> shooting<00:04:02.489> somebody<00:04:02.880> we're

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
over when you're shooting somebody we're

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.060 
over when you're shooting somebody we're
at<00:04:03.630> least<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.930> day<00:04:04.170> there's<00:04:04.470> there<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.890> that

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
at least a day there's there is that

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.300 
at least a day there's there is that
little<00:04:05.220> counter<00:04:05.880> that's<00:04:06.090> going<00:04:06.480> on

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
little counter that's going on

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.280 
little counter that's going on
underneath<00:04:08.310> your<00:04:08.700> consciousness<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.450> the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
underneath your consciousness and the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.039 
underneath your consciousness and the
reason<00:04:11.250> final<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.820> last<00:04:11.970> stand<00:04:12.390> is<00:04:12.510> effective

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
reason final and last stand is effective

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.780 
reason final and last stand is effective
is<00:04:13.170> because<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.620> just<00:04:13.739> completely<00:04:14.190> subverts

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
is because it just completely subverts

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.940 
is because it just completely subverts
that<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.239> because<00:04:15.630> okay<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.350> let's<00:04:16.829> say

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
that it's because okay you let's say

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.170 
that it's because okay you let's say
it's<00:04:17.130> going<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.430> take<00:04:17.579> four<00:04:17.789> bullets<00:04:18.090> your

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
it's going to take four bullets your

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.909 
it's going to take four bullets your
subconscious<00:04:18.690> goes<00:04:18.870> one<00:04:19.109> two<00:04:19.140> three<00:04:19.680> four

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
subconscious goes one two three four

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.500 
subconscious goes one two three four
bullets<00:04:20.280> okay<00:04:20.549> next<00:04:20.760> target<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.330> then<00:04:21.390> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
bullets okay next target and then the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.490 
bullets okay next target and then the
guys<00:04:21.660> laying<00:04:21.870> on<00:04:22.049> his<00:04:22.140> ass<00:04:22.289> with<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.530> gun<00:04:22.710> up

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
guys laying on his ass with a gun up

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.800 
guys laying on his ass with a gun up
pointed<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.130> gun<00:04:24.160> at<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.640> normally<00:04:25.480> if<00:04:25.600> that

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
pointed a gun at you normally if that

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.330 
pointed a gun at you normally if that
didn't<00:04:26.140> happen<00:04:26.170> again<00:04:26.620> we<00:04:26.890> would<00:04:27.040> keep

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
didn't happen again we would keep

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.970 
didn't happen again we would keep
shooting<00:04:28.030> until<00:04:28.180> we<00:04:29.050> saw<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.320> points<00:04:29.860> we

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
shooting until we saw the points we

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.590 
shooting until we saw the points we
would<00:04:30.130> keep<00:04:30.340> shooting<00:04:30.820> until<00:04:30.880> we<00:04:31.300> saw<00:04:31.570> the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
would keep shooting until we saw the

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.480 
would keep shooting until we saw the
yellow<00:04:31.960> number<00:04:32.290> saying<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:32.890> got<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.280> kill

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
yellow number saying you got the kill

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.000 
yellow number saying you got the kill
but<00:04:34.000> we<00:04:34.150> don't<00:04:34.450> because<00:04:34.960> our<00:04:35.290> brains<00:04:35.830> have

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
but we don't because our brains have

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.370 
but we don't because our brains have
been<00:04:36.130> conditioned<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.000> say<00:04:37.210> okay<00:04:37.510> yes<00:04:38.140> we

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
been conditioned to say okay yes we

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.530 
been conditioned to say okay yes we
don't<00:04:38.530> see<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.250> points<00:04:39.640> yes<00:04:39.970> we<00:04:40.150> don't<00:04:40.330> know

don't see the points yes we don't know

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.570 
don't see the points yes we don't know
definitively<00:04:41.140> that<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.190> target<00:04:42.490> is
