way there's no tension on the rear

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.279 
way there's no tension on the rear
shocks<00:00:43.070> I<00:00:43.370> need<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:44.000> take<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.270> rear<00:00:44.780> bolts<00:00:45.199> out

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
shocks I need to take the rear bolts out

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.040 
shocks I need to take the rear bolts out
on<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:45.860> lower<00:00:46.100> half<00:00:46.520> that<00:00:47.449> way<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.780> shocks

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
on the lower half that way the shocks

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.990 
on the lower half that way the shocks
will<00:00:48.199> be<00:00:48.320> free<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.920> actual<00:00:49.550> can<00:00:49.850> be

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
will be free and the actual can be

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:11.570 
will be free and the actual can be
lowered<00:00:50.449> down

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.480 

now<00:01:12.580> you're<00:01:12.880> doing<00:01:13.000> this<00:01:14.010> there's<00:01:15.010> a<00:01:15.220> slight

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
now you're doing this there's a slight

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.350 
now you're doing this there's a slight
tension<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.170> bolt<00:01:17.910> you<00:01:18.910> can<00:01:19.030> just<00:01:19.120> lightly

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
tension on the bolt you can just lightly

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.350 
tension on the bolt you can just lightly
adjust<00:01:19.990> your<00:01:20.110> jack<00:01:20.320> up<00:01:20.500> as<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:20.800> need<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.360> just

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
adjust your jack up as you need to just

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.900 
adjust your jack up as you need to just
to<00:01:22.570> leave<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.900> tensioner<00:01:23.350> bolt<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:24.670> should

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
to leave the tensioner bolt it should

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:33.120 
to leave the tensioner bolt it should
come<00:01:25.060> out<00:01:25.180> in<00:01:25.390> your<00:01:25.570> hand<00:01:26.280> pretty<00:01:27.280> easily<00:01:32.130> like

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
come out in your hand pretty easily like

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.580 
come out in your hand pretty easily like
that<00:01:34.440> now<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:35.500> do<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.890> other<00:01:36.040> side<00:01:37.350> okay<00:01:38.350> now

harnesses loose so I can lower the axle
little<00:02:23.170> lower<00:02:23.290> axle<00:02:23.739> slowly<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.870> as<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.959> do

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
little lower axle slowly and as you do

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.020 
little lower axle slowly and as you do
that<00:02:26.170> right<00:02:27.070> now<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.310> springs<00:02:27.670> are<00:02:27.790> under<00:02:28.000> a

that right now the springs are under a

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.250 
that right now the springs are under a
little<00:02:28.209> bit<00:02:28.299> of<00:02:28.420> tension<00:02:28.660> they're<00:02:29.080> going<00:02:29.170> to

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
I've lifted it to where the vehicle

actually comes up off the jack stands
this<00:05:37.500> puts<00:05:37.740> it<00:05:37.889> in<00:05:38.009> what's<00:05:38.190> called<00:05:38.370> unladen

this puts it in what's called unladen

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.779 
this puts it in what's called unladen
condition<00:05:39.629> so<00:05:40.469> that<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.979> suspension<00:05:41.669> is

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
condition so that the suspension is

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.189 
condition so that the suspension is
actually<00:05:42.150> what<00:05:42.360> is<00:05:42.479> supporting<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.020> car

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
actually what is supporting the car

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.200 
actually what is supporting the car
versus<00:05:43.680> the<00:05:43.740> jack<00:05:43.949> stands<00:05:44.250> in<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:45.000> condition

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
versus the jack stands in that condition

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.110 
versus the jack stands in that condition
