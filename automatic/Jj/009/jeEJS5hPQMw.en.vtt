00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.570
 what do you guys see is one of the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.209
 most important moments for a 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.340
 company for its shareholders or even 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.529
 for your customers is to check 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.439
 how a product has gone and if it has 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.810
 caused profits or losses nintendo 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.779
 you already have in your hands the results of 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.910
 sales corresponding to 2013 and such 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.510
 and as you can imagine they are not even 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.390
 I look good in 2013, Nintendo lost more 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.580
 of 200 million dollars a figure that 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.460
 proceeds for the most part to the enormous 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.350
 failure of wii and the console that threw by 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.660
 the good popularity that 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.120
 got his predecessor and that day of 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.370
 today it is considered by many a grain 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.530
 in the ass of nintendo the data of 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.809
 nintendo point to a total of 62 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.030
 million wii sold from its 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.010
 launch but if we look at the graph 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.469
 of sales per quarter we see that there 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.989
 two moments in which we have had 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.030
 some demand the first two months 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.490
 after its launch with three million 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.830
 units sold and campaign 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.440
 Christmas of 2013 in which they were sold 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.520
 two million units plus the rest of 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.829
 quarters 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.380
 an error for the console and the company 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.479
 with sales well below the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.399
 expectations concluded a nintendo 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.740
 shown his bet on the new 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.289
 generation of consoles but on the contrary 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.240
 that your competitors are and microsoft the 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.789
 evolution has made him lose customers 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.860
 also part of the fault of his fall the 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.990
 has the decision to continue on the line 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.299
 of casual game where today 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.850
 undoubtedly lead mobile phones 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.619
 the question is we will see soon a 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.110
 new console that rectifies the error 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.950
 committed with wii that is the doubt that we 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.950
 It is what you think
